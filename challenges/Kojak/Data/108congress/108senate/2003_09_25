Mr. President, this morning the Senator will conduct a \nperiod of morning business to allow Senators to speak. Following \nmorning business, at approximately 10:30, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the conference report to accompany the Defense \nappropriations bill. Senators Stevens and Inouye will be ready to give \ntheir remarks at that time. It is my hope that we can schedule the vote \non that conference report prior to noon.\n  Yesterday, we completed two conference reports--the Homeland Security \nand the legislative appropriations reports. I thank Senators Cochran, \nCampbell, and the ranking members for assisting in getting these ready \nfor the floor for full Senate consideration.\n  Following the Defense appropriations conference report passage, we \nwill consider the remaining available judicial nominations and another \ntwo or three still on the Executive Calendar that hopefully we will be \nable to clear. There is a standing request from the other side of the \naisle that a rollcall vote be held on judicial nominations and, \ntherefore, we will schedule those votes accordingly.\n  We will resume consideration of the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill today. Senator DeWine has been actively engaged in \nworking through a number of possible amendments to that bill. I hope we \ncan make substantial progress today toward finishing that measure.\n  We have a number of the appropriations bills and conference reports \nto consider, and we will consider those as they become available. I \nthank Members for their cooperation in this regard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, through the Chair, ask the \ndistinguished leader a question, we have a number of Jewish Members who \nare concerned about tomorrow. They want to be home by sundown. We have \nat least one Senator who would like to be home in California in time \nfor observance of the holiday. I am wondering if the leader has made a \ndecision about tomorrow yet because of the holiday.\n  Mr. FRIST. We will discuss tomorrow's schedule over the course of the \nmorning. We will let people know. Obviously, we will take that into \nstrong consideration in terms of scheduling votes for tomorrow. I do \nexpect us to be voting in the morning. But in terms of specifics, we \nwill have announcements as we go through the day.\n  Very shortly we will be going into morning business, but I want to \nmake several comments.\n  As most people know, my colleagues and others, we have made a \nconcerted effort to respond to the President of the United States in \nterms of emergency requests to support our troops and our military \nefforts overseas--the men and women who are fighting for freedom and \ndemocracy. Thus, over the course of this week, we have held a number of \nhearings at the committee level with the hopes that we would be able to \nend at a reasonable but as short a time as possible so as to bring that \nrequest to the floor of the Senate in order to have plenty of time to \nboth look at amendments and to debate, discuss, and examine the \nspecifics of that request.\n  We are going into a recess at the end of next week. That is what is \nanticipated now. As I said last week, knowing that the supplemental \nwould be delivered last week, we immediately began to set up a 2-week \nperiod by which the Senators would have sufficient and adequate time to \naddress this particular request. This week, we had over 30 hours of \nhearings at the committee level.\n\n  The distinguished President pro tempore attended most of those \nhearings.\n\n[[Page S11930]]\n\n  There have been seven separate hearings in the Senate alone in \naddition to the hearings that are being held in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  We have had attendance at the policy lunches to be briefed on both \nsides of the aisle by Ambassador Bremer. The President has given two \nnational addresses that relate to this supplemental request.\n  I mention this because I have said I would schedule adequate time for \nconsideration. It requires a lot of participation over the course of \nthis time. Probably over 70 Members are participating in those \nparticular hearings that are being held this week.\n  I think it is important to have us come to the floor so we can have a \nfull debate and debate amendments on the floor as well.\n  That will be the goal for next week. Again, because at the end of \nnext week we will go on a recess for greater than a week, I believe it \nis important to respond to the emergency requests by the President of \nthe United States, our Commander in Chief, in a timely way. That means \nthis week and next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11930-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11930-S11931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMBASSADOR BREMER\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wanted to comment on Ambassador Bremer \nbriefly.\n  I asked Ambassador Paul Bremer to come back and to participate in the \nhearings this week. He has really gone nonstop.\n  I express my deep appreciation for his presence every day--both in \nformal meetings, informal meetings, and hearings. He is the U.S. \nadministrator of Iraq and head of the coalition of provisional \nauthority.\n  Early last summer, Ambassador Bremer, who had already retired from \ngovernment service, was asked by the President of the United States, on \nvery short notice, to move to Iraq and to lead the coalition effort to \nstabilize the country; indeed, he volunteered to do so.\n  We all listen to him, and in listening to his testimony, we all \nrealize what a daunting task he has. Iraq has been ruled by a vicious \ndictator for decades, the economy has deteriorated, as we all know, to \nnear pre-industrial levels, the population is scarred by the ravages of \nthis dictatorship, the Saddam Hussein regime, and now we have the \nforeign terrorists who on a daily basis seem to be sneaking in the \ncountry, adding to the disorder and death.\n  Through all this, Ambassador Bremer continues to lead. He does that \nin spite of personally being under constant threat of attack and even \nconstant threat of assassination in that part of the world. Like many \nof our fine service men and women, he has left loved ones behind and is \nliving in what we all know are tough conditions in Iraq to serve the \nUnited States of America.\n  Ambassador Bremer may set a record this week for the number of \ncommittees before which he is testifying. There are at least 6 \ncongressional committees over 5 days, in addition to speaking \ninformally to our policy luncheons. He is a public servant in the \ntruest sense of the word, a great man serving our Nation.\n  As we debate the appropriate policies in Iraq, I want everyone to \nremember that he and others, military and civilian, are sacrificing for \nus in Iraq. I know we will have our differences. I encourage all of our \ncolleagues to be respectful of each other as we move forward and as we \nrecognize the great, unselfish leadership of Ambassador Bremer.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico wants to speak \nregarding the Chaplain. I will finish in a minute.\n  While the majority leader is on the floor, I say to the distinguished \nmajority leader, the reason I stepped off the floor is I got a call \nfrom one of our Jewish Senators indicating they were speaking for a \nnumber of other Senators of that faith. They not only have to, as I \nindicated, be home in time for the sundown services but also have to \nprepare meals and things of that nature. They wanted me to let you \nknow, if there is some way we could meet the burdensome schedule we \nhave tonight, it would sure be good for them because they have a lot of \nthings to do other than be home by sundown.\n  I also say, while the majority leader is here--I am speaking for me--\nI want to do everything I can--and I think I can fairly speak for the \nDemocratic caucus--to move this very important supplemental. Senator \nByrd and others are extremely concerned, for example, about having the \nhearing on Monday. The distinguished President pro tempore has heard \nfrom Senator Byrd himself. He would rather have that on Tuesday and \nrather have some other witnesses.\n  We want to do everything we can to be fair and responsible and move \nthis along. However, remember, the House is not going to mark up their \nlegislation until the week we are gone.\n\n  The leader is right, we should do everything we can to move this \nalong, but I don't want anyone thinking that Democratic Senators who \nhave some concern about the large amount of this number, especially the \nreconstruction, are in any way trying to hold this up. We want to \ncooperate in any way we can.\n  Now, speaking only for this Senator, I think it may be to the \nadvantage of the Senate to take this over and do whatever debate we \nneed next week but not complete it until we get back. I have \ncomplimented the distinguished majority leader on a number of occasions \nsince the Senator has taken over the Senate. We have had very few needs \nto file cloture on your side. We have tried to be as cooperative as \npossible. For example, without entering into unanimous consent \nagreements we simply have told you we will finish a bill on a certain \nnight and generally we have been able to live up to that. We are not \ntrying in any way to slow down or stall this most important \nlegislation, but there is not a question of running out of money \ntomorrow, the next day, or the next day. I don't think it would hurt \nuntil we got back to have some final time to complete this.\n  That is coming from this Senator, not the caucus. I am sure the \nDemocratic leader will be in touch early in the day. We had a number of \nmeetings yesterday to talk about this most important subject.\n  For the third time today, we want it understood we on this side are \ngoing to do everything we can to support the troops. There are serious \nquestions about the reconstruction money and how we should handle that. \nI don't think anyone disputes the fact they need reconstruction money. \nI think we need to take a close look at that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I respect what the assistant Democratic \nleader has put forward. I am not making accusations of stalling or \nobstruction at all. I do feel it is important as we turn on our \ntelevision sets every morning or read the paper and we see the \nimportance of the security in Iraq that we address the issue which has \nbeen brought by our leaders on the ground there, the security issues \nand the request for the supplemental, as expeditiously as possible and \nnot delay unnecessarily. That is why from a leadership position I want \nto focus this body on that security issue and spend whatever time it \ntakes right now to address that issue.\n  I understand we are working in good faith as we go forward. My \nintention is to continue to address thoroughly, with plenty of debate, \nmaybe an unprecedented number of hearings in a short period of time, by \nmost significant people, and to allow adequate time for floor debate. \nIf we can keep working together, it is my goal to dispose of this \nappropriately over the next 9 days before we go on recess. I am going \nto have a hard time leaving the Senate to go on recess and not \naddressing a Presidential request.\n  The House of Representatives is staying here. They are not going on \nrecess. They are going to be addressing it in early October. That is \nwhy at least from a schedule standpoint I want to do it as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. REID. If I could just say this, the other problem we have is we \ndo not want to have to go through this twice. Under the procedures of \nthe Senate, when we just have a Senate bill, we are limited very much \nbecause points of order will be raised on most everything we do \nrelative to amendments. I ask the distinguished majority leader to \nunderstand we do not need to go through this twice because when the \nbill comes back over from the House, we do not need to go through the \nsame amendment procedure again.\n  I am not sure we gain anything by trying to complete this by next \nweek. We would be well served to see what\n\n[[Page S11931]]\n\nthe House gives us and work through that. That way there can be \namendments that can be offered without points of order being issued to \nthose. Otherwise, we are stuck offering amendments, points of order, \nthen coming back with the House bill and doing the same thing again.\n  I see the distinguished Democratic leader on the floor and I \ncertainly will not speak anymore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11931-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I see the Senator from New Mexico is \nready to speak, as well, and I will be brief.\n  We had a caucus last night, and I don't know that I can recall ever \nhaving witnessed the depth of anger and deep-seated frustration \nexpressed by all of our membership as a result of the scheduling \ndecisions made with regard to the supplemental next week. It started \nwith the decision that may have been necessary but made last week with \nregard to calling Ambassador Bremer to a hearing on Monday, the very \nday the hearing was scheduled in the afternoon. No Senators were \nnotified ahead of time. Senators had very little time to prepare. Very \nfew Senators could attend because they were out of town. Many expressed \nthe view that this was orchestrated in a way to minimize the amount of \nscrutiny and attention Mr. Bremer would receive.\n  Throughout the week, similar experiences have been noted. And now we \nhave a markup on Monday, when, again, Senators have made travel plans \nand the real prospect for a good attendance is minimal at best.\n\n  The frustration, the anger, the venting that I witnessed, and that \nmost people felt, was as palpable as any caucus I can recall holding in \nthe 9 years I have been leader. I have not had the opportunity--I just \ntried to call the majority leader, and I will talk to him in private \nin, hopefully, a couple minutes, but I would ask that we reconsider \nholding that markup on Monday. I would ask that in the name of comity, \nbut also in the name of just ensuring that there be an opportunity to \ndo this right, it be postponed until Tuesday. I think we would actually \naccelerate the prospects of completing the work.\n  I will guarantee you, there will be very little prospect for comity \nand accommodation as we go through this already very vexing and \ncontroversial supplemental request by the administration--in order for \nthe Senate to complete its work, it is going to take cooperation. But \nwhen our caucus feels as jammed as they do, as shut out as they are, it \nwill be very difficult to reach some degree of procedural \naccommodation. So I will tell you that this matter needs more thought. \nI would hope we could have more consultation. But I will say, unless \nsomething changes, this is going to be exceedingly difficult.\n  So I only put the Senate on notice. And, again, as I said, I \nattempted to call the majority leader prior to the time I came to the \nSenate floor to impress upon him privately the same message I am \nsharing with our colleagues in this public way. We will have more to \nsay about it later. But this matter has generated far greater anxiety \nand anger than virtually anything I have seen in a long time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I note the Senator from New Mexico wants to \ncomment on the guest Chaplain and he has to be at a funeral.\n  We will talk privately. We have not had the opportunity to talk since \ntheir caucus, so we can handle our discussion privately and then come \nback to the floor.\n  Again, my goal is simply to address this request in a manner where \nboth sides are heard. We have done our very best this week to schedule \nit in terms of the hearings, and we have talked further about that.\n  I do ask you to consider--because how much time we spend in hearings \nor in markups or on the floor does not matter to me as much as having \npeople heard over a period of time--if the markup were delayed, will \nthe Democratic side at least consider finishing this before we go out \non our recess, given the fact that this is an emergency request from \nthe President of the United States? We can, whenever it comes to the \nfloor, start early, work late; if it is Monday morning, coming in, or \nTuesday, or as soon as you would say, ``Well, the markup is OK,'' so we \ncould finish this before we go out on vacation or recess when we have \nthis emergency request here. Can we finish it next week?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, again, I would respond to the \ndistinguished majority leader in several ways.\n  First of all, the Ambassador, in speaking to our caucus on Tuesday, \nnoted he does not need this money until January. Now obviously one \ncould make the case that there really is not any rush to do this in \nSeptember.\n  I would also say the House has not acted. Until the House acts--and \nthey are not going to act until next week--many of my colleagues wonder \nwhat the rush is. If we are denied the right to offer amendments, there \nare those who could make a point of order that many of the amendments \nwe will be offering involve legislating on appropriations because of \nthe germaneness questions. And if that becomes an issue, then I doubt \nvery much that there will be any way we can finish next week.\n\n  As I think I heard the distinguished assistant Democratic leader \nnote, this bill will come back, and we will have to have a second \ndebate when the House bill comes to the Senate if points of order are \nraised on the amendments, denying us the opportunity to have this \ndebate in the first place.\n  So I guess my answer to the distinguished majority leader would be \nthreefold: No. 1, will we have an opportunity to offer the amendments \nwithout points of order being raised against them? No. 2, when will the \nmarkup actually occur? And if it does occur on Monday, I fear there \ncould be some procedural delays involved in bringing the bill up. No. \n3, we need to have a clear understanding of just when this legislation \nneeds to be passed to accommodate the schedule Ambassador Bremer noted \nto our caucus. If we do not need to finish this until January, that is \nanother matter. So some clarification with regard to the urgency of \nthis issue also needs to be provided.\n  I certainly will work with the majority leader as we follow through \nwith these questions.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me turn to the Senator from New Mexico. \nI know he has a comment on the guest Chaplain, as well as other \ncomments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I make a unanimous consent request \nprior to the Senator from New Mexico beginning?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time used \nby the Senator from New Mexico not be counted against the morning \nbusiness time of the Republicans, and that the full 30 minutes be \ngranted to each side due to this late start.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all, might I say to my friends \non the other side, I came with the intention of speaking about the \nguest Chaplain, who is from New Mexico. But I want to note we have an \nimportant event, a funeral for a 27-year-old son of one of our staffers \nfrom the Energy Committee at 10:15, so I will not be able to come back \nduring that Republican time. So I would ask if I can----\n  Mr. REID. That was my request. You have it right now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if I could just give my speech on the guest \nChaplain and also my other comments now.\n  Mr. REID. That is what I asked in my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11931-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11931-S11932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I am proud to introduce Rev. Sheila \nGustafson from First Presbyterian Church of Santa Fe, NM. She has \ndevoted her life to the ministry of God and within her work has touched \nmany lives.\n  She began her service as the first female pastor ever to serve at \nFirst Presbyterian Church, and she is devoted to their mission and has \nserved it faithfully for the past 8 years.\n  Reverend Gustafson demonstrates a great leadership style that endears \nher not only to the members of her congregation but to the community of \nSanta Fe. She has taken the lead within the New Mexico Coalition of \nChurches to create a faith-based organization that fights hate crimes \nand recently has dedicated her time to the revitalization and \nmodernization of First Presbyterian Church. This project will allow the \nchurch to become a mission-oriented building that will provide direct \nassistance to the community. First Presbyterian Church will be able to \nprovide meeting space for social and faith-based organizations.\n  I thank Reverend Gustafson for coming to offer our invocation this \nmorning. That is not an easy chore clear from New Mexico, as I know \nwhen I take that trip every couple of weeks. It is an honor to have her \nhere today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11932-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11932-S11933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PROGRESS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to comment on where we are with \nreference to the war. I was very pleased to read in the New York Times \nyesterday that a poll had been taken in Iraq. In fact, the New York \nTimes reports so little good news about the theater of the war, I \nfigured it had to be a poll or it wouldn't state anything good.\n  The poll said two-thirds of the Iraqi people believed they were \nbetter off and that they would be better off in 5 years, having gotten \nrid of Saddam, rather than with him present. If you listen to all the \nnews, you wonder whether the people of Iraq even care about our efforts \nto help or whether there are very many who are pleased to be part of \nthis transition toward freedom.\n  In addition, that same article said something rather phenomenal about \nthe distinguished Ambassador who runs the American effort. The poll \nsaid--and the New York Times used two words--``remarkably positive''--\nto characterize the 47 percent of the Iraqis who said he was doing a \nvery good job. That was said almost with incredulity that it could be \ntrue, but it is, because we are doing a good job.\n  We have been there 4\\1/2\\ months--not years. For us to already have \nachieved what has been done is borderline miraculous: Schools opened; \nhospitals opened; a council formed; a head of government there ready to \nmove step by step toward democratization, with great leadership of the \n25-member governing body, 17 of them Ph.D.s in the subjects of the \nministries they run. The agriculture ministry is run by an agronomist \nof real class, the water problems handled by a hydrologist of high \nquality. These are the kinds of people working with us to put that \ncountry together.\n  One of the reasons I think we should move ahead rapidly--and I don't \nknow what rapidly means on this legislation. Does it mean Monday, \nTuesday, or Wednesday? I don't know--but we had better send a signal as \nsoon as we can that we are there to get this job done.\n  I had the privilege of asking questions yesterday of the two \ndistinguished generals, the chief of staff of the military, General \nMyers, and the general in charge of the entire operation, General \nAbizaid, who speaks Arabic brilliantly. My questions to them were: Will \nwe win this war, this conflict? Will we prevail, and will it end up \npositive? Instantly, each answered: Yes.\n  Can we win?\n  Yes.\n  Will we win?\n  Yes.\n  Do our men want to win?\n  Yes.\n  Are our men happy, pleased? Do they know what they are doing?\n  Absolutely.\n  When I was finished with my time with the Secretary of Defense and \nthe two outstanding generals, I was convinced that all we needed to be \nsure that democratization sets in and takes its footing there is the \nwill to do it. We got into this with the full concurrence of the \nCongress. Those who continually speak of this as being President Bush's \nwar are stating the facts wrong. It is our war. We voted for it by huge \nnumbers, and we haven't brought a resolution to the floor negating \nthat, to my knowledge.\n  For those who now think it is not ours, but that it is the \nPresident's alone, maybe they ought to bring a resolution here denying \nthat we are involved and that it is just his, and see what the Senate \nwould say. I believe no one will do it, and if they did it, it would \noverwhelmingly fail, because we want to win and we know it, but the \ncritics are involved in a great game of politics.\n  Truly, it is time we get politics out of the scene and do what is \nneeded. If there are Senators who know how to do it better, they ought \nto propose it. This is a very open body. If they have a better plan, \nsuggest it. If they think we ought to spend the money differently, \namend it. But we ought to do it. Everybody involved in this on the \nground in Iraq thinks we are on the right path--the men there, the \nwomen there, the generals there, the privates. The men whose boots are \non the ground think we are doing right. The only people who don't are \ncountries such as France. We will never convince France about this. \nThere is no use trying. They have already forgotten about America and \nAmerica's involvement in helping them, and they are on some new path of \ntheir own.\n\n  I remember as a Senator when people such as Helmut Kohl, the former \nChancellor of Germany, would give a speech that would make you cry \nabout how much Germany owed America. I heard one. I cried as he told of \nwhat brothers we were and why and what great people we were to win a \nwar and demand nothing from them. Here we are engaged in a war against \nterror that will help all of Europe, and we have France and other \ncountries, for some reasons of their own, out there acting as if \nAmerica were some foreign power that they don't even know, that has \nsome mission that is adverse to the world, when they know better. They \nknow our mission, they know our attitude, and they know what kind of \ncountry we are.\n  Having said that, I hope, if we can't move this emergency \nsupplemental request on Monday, that we move rapidly, whenever that is, \nto let the Senate speak. Do we want to abandon this process before it \never has a chance to succeed, or do we want to give it a real chance to \nprevail? I believe in the end the latter will prevail. It will take \nsome time and some talking, but in the end we will conclude that 4\\1/2\\ \nmonths is not long enough to determine the destiny of that country \nwhere we had such a fantastic military victory that the world will \nrecognize forever as one of the single most significant military \nachievements in history with minimal civilian damage and expeditious \nand maximum annihilation of the real opponent.\n  We cannot quit after 4 months. We cannot say we will support the men \nand women of the military but we won't support the effort to provide \nthe minimal service that will bring the Iraqi people into a state where \nthey will want to move forward, democratize, and become free.\n  To me, it is a simple proposition--and maybe it should not be--that \nis, do we want to give up or do we want to win? Do we want to abandon \nthis effort after 4\\1/2\\ months and challenge every single move by \nsomebody as distinguished as Ambassador Bremer and his team? I believe \nthe answers are pretty simple. The American people, even with all the \nnegatives thrown at them about what's happening in Iraq, still believe \nwe did right going in, and they still believe we are right in being \nthere now. All that is left is that we do what is right.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S11933]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11932-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11932-S11933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PROGRESS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to comment on where we are with \nreference to the war. I was very pleased to read in the New York Times \nyesterday that a poll had been taken in Iraq. In fact, the New York \nTimes reports so little good news about the theater of the war, I \nfigured it had to be a poll or it wouldn't state anything good.\n  The poll said two-thirds of the Iraqi people believed they were \nbetter off and that they would be better off in 5 years, having gotten \nrid of Saddam, rather than with him present. If you listen to all the \nnews, you wonder whether the people of Iraq even care about our efforts \nto help or whether there are very many who are pleased to be part of \nthis transition toward freedom.\n  In addition, that same article said something rather phenomenal about \nthe distinguished Ambassador who runs the American effort. The poll \nsaid--and the New York Times used two words--``remarkably positive''--\nto characterize the 47 percent of the Iraqis who said he was doing a \nvery good job. That was said almost with incredulity that it could be \ntrue, but it is, because we are doing a good job.\n  We have been there 4\\1/2\\ months--not years. For us to already have \nachieved what has been done is borderline miraculous: Schools opened; \nhospitals opened; a council formed; a head of government there ready to \nmove step by step toward democratization, with great leadership of the \n25-member governing body, 17 of them Ph.D.s in the subjects of the \nministries they run. The agriculture ministry is run by an agronomist \nof real class, the water problems handled by a hydrologist of high \nquality. These are the kinds of people working with us to put that \ncountry together.\n  One of the reasons I think we should move ahead rapidly--and I don't \nknow what rapidly means on this legislation. Does it mean Monday, \nTuesday, or Wednesday? I don't know--but we had better send a signal as \nsoon as we can that we are there to get this job done.\n  I had the privilege of asking questions yesterday of the two \ndistinguished generals, the chief of staff of the military, General \nMyers, and the general in charge of the entire operation, General \nAbizaid, who speaks Arabic brilliantly.

Mr. President, I will address the rotation \npolicy in Iraq of our U.S. military forces, and specifically the \nNational Guard and the Reserves. I will also address the planning of \nthat rotation policy.\n  Over the weekend, I met with enumerable groups in Florida about their \nloved ones who are serving overseas. As members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, we addressed this issue with Deputy Secretary of \nDefense Wolfowitz and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Myers, \nin our committee meeting 2 weeks ago on the plan of rotation and the \ninequities that are coming out as a result of the lack of planning and \nhow that is being implemented.\n  Now, I am going to give some specific examples. I might say that this \nlarge stack contains all e-mails--and you know how small the type is on \ne-mails--from family members in my State about the inequity of the \nsituation. These are e-mails that I have received directly from \nsoldiers, primarily members of the Florida National Guard and the \nReserves.\n  As I tried to address what I perceive to be the inequity in this so-\ncalled plan as being implemented, as I tried to address it in \ncommittee, as I have in private meetings with the brass, and now as I \ntry to discuss these inequities with the Senate, I, first, will say \nthat had the executive branch of Government listened to the bipartisan \nvoices in the Senate Armed Services Committee--and in particular the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee where the chairman of that \ncommittee, Dick Lugar of Indiana, a Republican, and one of his ranking \nmembers, Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a Republican, and another of \nhis high-ranking members, Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, a \nRepublican, along with a chorus of voices on the committee, including \nmine--had they listened about the need for a plan after the military \ncampaign in the postwar occupation of Iraq, then I don't think we would \nbe going through the strains and stresses on this rotation policy. \nCombatant Commander General Abizaid, who is supplied with Army troops \nthrough the Army Chief of Staff, of which they are having to stretch \nout these deployments of the National Guard and Reserves in Iraq, had \nthey listened--had the executive branch of Government listened that \nthere had to be a plan in place, as we had for Germany and Japan--we \nhad a plan being worked on for 3 years prior to the end of World War II \nfor Germany and Japan--had the plan been in place, we would see that we \nshould not have an American face as occupiers in a Muslim country. \nInstead, it should be the world community participating in trying to \nstabilize Iraq politically and economically.\n  Had a plan been in place, the preparation would have been there to \nbring in the Iraqi civilians to run the Government so that there is an \nIraqi face on the running of the Government. But that plan is not in \nplace and we are seeing the results of the near chaos from time to time \nand, indeed, the sabotage that is occurring, the deaths that are \noccurring, and so forth.\n\n  But that is an issue for another day. It is a table setter for what I \nwant to talk about--the inequity of the rotation policy and the plan \nthat is specifically being conducted in the rotation of the troops in \nIraq.\n  First, Florida's National Guard is one of the most professional in \nthe Nation. It is well organized, it is well trained, and it is well \nled. They have proven their dedication to duty in this war, and they \nhave committed to do whatever this Nation asks, and they have done it \nvery well.\n  A couple of days ago, General Schoomaker, the Chief of Staff of the \nArmy, told me that the soldiers of the Florida National Guard are as \ngood as they come. They are also tired and fatigued.\n  I raised this rotation policy with the Deputy Secretary of Defense \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in that committee meeting a couple \nweeks ago. I have discussed this rotation policy with the Army Chief of \nStaff. I will discuss this policy with the Secretary of Defense \ntomorrow.\n  Florida National Guard soldiers were among the first Guard units \nalerted in December. They were brought into the armory the day after \nChristmas to start preparing all of their equipment, and they were \nmobilized right after New Year's Day. They were also among the first to \nenter the theater of operations, beginning in February and flowing \nquickly through March and early April.\n  Florida's National Guard soldiers participated throughout the major \ncombat phase of this operation and throughout the breadth and depth of \nthe theater--a theater that we know had no safe rear area, in the \ntraditional sense.\n  Company C, Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion, 124th Infantry of the \nFlorida Guard--let me tell you what they did before the war. The war \nstarted on March 19. Charlie Company dug by hand through the berm that \nmarks the Jordanian-Iraqi border, and then they attacked into Iraq in \nsupport of the 5th Special Forces Group. They were in Iraq before the \nwar started on March 19. Since then, Charlie Company has been passed \naround the theater, from command to command, about 10 times, from the \n5th Special Forces Group, to Special Operations Headquarters, to the \n5th Corps Headquarters, to the 3rd Infantry Division, to the 2nd \nArmored Cavalry Regimen, and to the 1st Armored Division.\n  Charlie Company is still there and they have suffered two \nfatalities--one gunned down at the University of Baghdad the night I \nwas coming into Baghdad in early July, another in a vehicle accident, \nand a third wounded in the neck. Other companies of the three \nbattalions of the 124th Infantry, of the Florida Guard, have been \npassed among the headquarters all over the theater no less than 40 \ntimes since arriving in the area of operations.\n  This is not a complaint. This is a statement of fact. Florida is \njustifiably proud of its contribution to the war on terror. Florida has \nthe third highest number of Guard and Reserve soldiers mobilized and \ndeployed globally in the war on terror, with 6,190 Florida Guard \nsoldiers. Two States are a little higher, California and Texas, and it \nis only by a few hundred soldiers in each of those States.\n  Florida has also deployed the second highest number of Guard soldiers \nto the Iraqi theater. Right now, in the Iraqi area of operations, there \nare 2,482. We are second highest to Alabama, and Alabama has 38 \nsoldiers more. These two States, Alabama and Florida, by far have the \nmost soldiers deployed to the Iraqi theater.\n  No State has provided more infantry from the Guard than Florida--\n1,392 infantry soldiers, followed by Indiana's infantry at 1,286. These \ntwo States by far are contributing more to the Iraqi theater from Guard \nunits than are infantry troops.\n  Naturally, since they were deployed the day after Christmas, they are \ntired, and I believe they should be replaced by fresh troops as soon as \npossible.\n  There is a new policy, and the new policy of the Defense Department \nis a ``12-month Boots on the Ground in Iraq'' rotation policy, and it \nmay not be equitably implemented because Florida's Guard entered the \ntheater in company-size elements spread out over a period of 2\\1/2\\ \nmonths. So it doesn't sound like it is equitable for this new policy of \nboots-on-the-ground for the clock to start ticking only when the last \nunit arrives in theater, what they call over at the Pentagon ``closed \nin command.''\n  I understand that other National Guard units are already beginning \nthe process of coming home, and I am happy for them, and I am happy \nthey are coming back to their loved ones. But I cannot seem to get a \nclear answer from the Department of Defense\n\n[[Page S11934]]\n\nand the Army about who is coming home early and why.\n  National Guard units that have spent the entire major combat phase \noutside of Iraq appear to be on the way home. I will give an example.\n  I had several from the highest echelons of the Department of the Army \ntell me that another State's National Guard is rotating back--that \nState's Guard has, in fact, never been in Iraq. In fact, if that \ninformation is correct that the other State's Guard is returning in \nOctober, then they will have served there 11 months. I am happy for \nthem, but I am questioning the equity of a case where because of a \n``closed in command'' policy, the last unit arriving in the theater \nstarting the clock ticking for 12 months ``boots on the ground,'' that, \nin effect, is going to extend some of the Florida National Guard a year \nand a half since they were mobilized and when they went to that \nheadquarters to start packing their gear on December 26.\n  Then I was told last night by another general in the Pentagon that, \nno, that particular State was not going home until next January or \nFebruary. The Department of Defense cannot get the information correct. \nI have been told three different things about those units. I have been \ntold four different things about the Florida units. So I have had to \ndig it out for myself by talking to our own Guard members through e-\nmail and talking with them directly by telephone.\n  The rotation policy for our Guard and Reserve forces should be \nsimple: Return them to their civilian lives as soon as is militarily \npractical. This requires detailed and timely planning which does not \nappear to have been adequate or to have been based on realistic \nassumptions for operations after the major combat phase. Of course, the \nmajor combat phase was brilliant. General Franks will go down in \nmilitary history as one of the great military leaders of the United \nStates.\n\n  Now we are in the phase of the occupation, and our soldiers of the \nFlorida National Guard are proud to soldier on in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nKuwait, and Bosnia, as well as at home securing Air Force bases in \nFlorida. But we are on the threshold of a serious problem for our Guard \nand Reserve servicemembers. Their sacrifices began the moment they were \nmobilized and left their civilian lives behind. They leave their \nfamilies, they leave their employers, their livelihoods. Their \nfamilies' well-being is at risk throughout the deployment regardless of \ntheir location or tactical conditions. Guard families in Florida and \nacross the Nation have endured the separation, uncertainty, financial \nhardship, and fear that goes along with any deployment into harm's way, \nand that is what they signed up for. They are willing to accept it.\n  When I talked with these family members, as I did in Orlando last \nThursday, in Tampa on Friday, and in Miami on Monday, they were almost \napologetic to me. They said: For me to say anything sounds like I don't \nwant to be patriotic. I am most patriotic, they tell me, and we are so \nproud of our Guard who are serving. They are pointing out, if others \nare coming back in less than a year, why are our Florida Guard and \nReserves going to be mobilized for up to a year and a half? That is an \nexcellent question.\n  Let me give some of these family stories. In central Florida in \nDaytona Beach at the Halifax Medical Center, Kaitlyn Rose Long was born \non February 25. Her father was not there. He did not expect to be there \nbecause he is a soldier deployed since January. At the time of her \nbirth, he was 7,600 miles away in Qatar.\n  Kaitlyn's mother thought her husband was coming home soon, \nparticularly because he had suffered a collapsed lung while working \nguard duty in Balad, an Iraqi city about 50 miles north of Baghdad. He \nwas sent to a hospital in Germany where doctors initially told him he \nwas going to have to go home. They changed their minds, and he is \nexpected back in Balad next week. To family members that is \nheartbreaking, but they will accept that. What they will not accept is \nthe inequity of treating some one way and others another way.\n\n  The husband of another 25-year-old mother of three from Brandon is a \nspecialist in Charlie Company of the 2nd Battalion. As I said earlier, \nthey have shifted to over a half a dozen units during their deployment. \nIn mid-May, the company was told, because they were fatigued from the \nfog of war, that they were heading home. Instead, they were sent to \nBaghdad.\n  Another lady, Ada Dominquez, came from Miami all the way to the \nOrlando meeting to tell me of her concern about this inequity.\n  Florida's military families are tough, they are dedicated, and they \nare loyal Americans, proud of their service. They are willing to \ncontinue to make sacrifices to keep this Nation strong and free. They \nare an inspiration to me. They are an inspiration to all of us. They \nknow this is very tough and complex, and it is still a very dangerous \nmission.\n  One soldier's mother from central Florida said to me: Just tell them \nwhen they are going to be coming home. Do not keep jerking them around, \ngetting this information; it stops, then it starts, and then it stops. \nShe said that is when the morale sinks to the lowest.\n  Members of the Guard and the Reserve are also volunteers. As we so \noften say, we recruit individuals but we re-enlist families. The \nrotation challenges the Army struggles with now are going to be the \nresult of too few troops for the missions we ask them to do. We need to \nlook seriously at adding more troops to the Active Force.\n  There have been a number of us who have been trying to urge the \nSecretary of Defense to open that issue, and thus far it has not been \naddressed. We must, as a Nation, figure out how we are going to deal \nwith this challenge, or we are going to risk losing the numbers we need \nin the finest Guard and Reserve system in world history.\n  If the demands on our military continue at their current pace and \nmore than 12-month overseas deployments become routine--as some of the \nFlorida troops are facing, up to a year and a half--then our National \nGuard and Reserve troops are not going to re-enlist when the time \ncomes. Our military force of the Army, which is roughly a half million \nplus Active, 400,000 plus Reserves, and 300,000 plus Guard; we can see \nthat the Guard and the Reserves are so integrally important to the \nmilitary force structure. If we do not have what is perceived to be an \nequitable rotation policy, then when it comes time for them to re-up, \nmany of them will not. That will be devastating from the standpoint of \nproviding for the force structure this Nation is going to need as we \nface the multitude of places around the world where we will have to go \nand battle the terrorists. If those ranks are depleted, then we will \nnot have them when we need them the most.\n  I commend the Guard and the Reserves. They have been one of the \nfinest military fighting outfits that has ever been produced to \nsupplement the regular Active-Duty Army. We can talk about the Air \nGuard as well, performing services all over this country, including air \ndefense. It is those Guard units, under the command of the general from \nTyndall Air Force Base, that if we ever have another airliner hijacked, \nhe has the command responsibility of ordering the shoot-down of that \nairliner that is taken over by terrorists. The Air Guard is performing \nthat.\n  The issue in front of us now is the equity of the Guard and the \nReserves in the rotation policy. I hope General Schumacher, the \nSecretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Chairman and \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs will listen to these words and will \nenact a policy of rotation that will be perceived to be equitable for \nall the Guard units.\n  Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. What is the status of the \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period of morning business.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Is the time equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Equally divided, 30 minutes controlled by the \nDemocratic leader or his designee, and 30 minutes controlled by the \nSenator from Texas or her designee.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator from Florida would ask, does that \nmean the entire first 30 minutes is set aside for this side of the \naisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. How many minutes remain?\n\n[[Page S11935]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining controlled \nby the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I will make a couple of other \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on a completely different \nsubject, as a Nation, we are recklessly careening down the road toward \nbankruptcy. In the fiscal year that ends in a week, September 30, we \nare going to be hemorrhaging in our budget to the tune of $500 billion. \nThat is a half trillion dollars.\n  In the new fiscal year that starts October 1, it is estimated we are \ngoing to be hemorrhaging to the tune of $600 billion, well over a half \ntrillion dollars. Just to put it in perspective, in the decade of the \n1980s, when we ran up so much of our national debt, the max in any one \nyear in the late 1980s was a deficit of $280 billion. That means we \nwere spending $280 billion more than we had coming in in revenue. \nTherefore, we had to go out and borrow it, and that added to the \nnational debt.\n  The next fiscal year starts in a few days. We are going to spend more \nthan we have coming in tax revenue to the tune of $600 billion and we \nhave to borrow it. Now, where do my colleagues think we borrow it from? \nWe borrow it from folks like you and me, when we buy Treasury bills. We \nborrow it from institutional investors like pension funds. But it will \nshock people to know that a good bit of the debt that is being \nacquired, or debt that is being bought--or to put it in the vernacular \nof the street, the people who we are borrowing from are the Chinese and \nthe Saudis. Does that not portend some uncomfortable things for America \nto have a good part of its national debt owned by folks who from time \nto time we have serious policy differences with?\n  How did we get into this? September 11 clearly was part of the \nproblem. To protect this Nation, the war in Afghanistan and the war in \nIraq have caused additional spending, but that is not the only reason \nfor the $600 billion deficit. It was because in the spring of 2001, by \na one-vote margin, on a technical part of the budget bill, this Chamber \nof the Senate passed an instruction that by a majority vote we could \npass a tax bill and that tax bill, once we passed it, diminished the \nrevenues so much that the deficit started to swell. We are on a \nreckless fiscal course, headed toward bankruptcy. Is it any wonder that \nearlier we heard the majority leader and the Democratic leader going at \nit over this question of addressing the President's $87 billion \nrequest? That is going to add all the more to the budget deficit. We \nare going to pass the $67 billion that is going to the troops because \nour troops are going to be provided what they need. But for the \nremaining $20 billion that is for building 1,000 schools in Iraq, what \ndo we tell our constituents at home about building schools here? For \nthat $20 billion that is to fix water systems and roads and bridges in \nIraq, what are we to tell our constituents in America about the water \nsystems and the roads and the bridges?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Presiding Officer for giving me \nthe remainder of the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I wish to first associate myself with the \ncomments of my friend and colleague, the Senator from Florida, with \nregard to concerns he raised about all the stress on the National Guard \nand Reserve. I have been to a number of deployments of troops of the \nNational Guard and Reserve from Minnesota. Our folks are serving \nadmirably and bravely, and there is great stress. I think it is clearly \nimportant to make sure we do the things to alleviate the strain, not \njust on the folks on the front line but on the families, and creating a \nbit of certainty would be good thing to do. It is not a partisan thing. \nIt is the right thing to do for the folks who are serving so bravely \nand for their families. So I thank my distinguished colleague from \nFlorida for raising this concern and wish to let him know there are \nmany of us on both sides of the aisle who share that concern and would \nlike a greater sense of certainty.\n  What does it mean to have boots on the ground? When are our folks \ncoming home? We do have to give them every bit of support we can when \nthey are there. But certainly for the families, the words of my \ncolleague ring true and I associate myself with them.\n  I do disagree with my colleague from Florida when it comes to his \ndiscussion about the economy and the cause and the impact of debt. By \nthe way, debt is a bad thing. I am not going to spend a lot of time \ntalking about that right now, but I do certainly want to raise the \nissue. The national debt today is not as great as it was in the 1980s, \nnot if you measure it as a percentage of the overall economy. That is \nthe way we have to do it. If you bought a house in the 1980s and you \nspent $30,000 and you put $15,000 down, $15,000 in cash, you would be \nin debt 50 percent. As time went on, inflation went on, and you made a \nlittle money and you bought a second house in the 1990s, or today, for \n$100,000, and you borrowed only $30,000, you would be twice as much \nindebted as you were in the 1980s, but the $30,000 as a percent of the \noverall value of the house would be less, only 30 percent.\n\n  The reality is that the debt today is less than it was in the 1980s. \nThat is not to say debt is ever a good thing, but I think you have to \nmake the facts very clear.\n  It is also important to understand the cause of that. Let's never \nforget that September 11 had a devastating impact on the economy of \nthis country. Let's not forget that WorldCom and Enron and the \ncorporate scandals that undermined the confidence of investors in \ncorporate America--undermined it--had a devastating impact on the \nAmerican economy. And let us not forget this economy was rolling into \nrecession, was moving into recession at the time President Bush was \nelected. All these things had an impact.\n  The other concern and observation I have to make, as a Senator who \nhas been here at this point only about 9 months, is my distinguished \nfriends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle, many of them, \nhave consistently talked about the debt, they have great concerns about \nthe debt, yet the reality has been that every time we have acted on \nbudgets, one of the first things that I and, as a newly elected Member \nof this body, the Presiding Officer did was we had to resolve the \nbudget for 2003 as soon as we got here. On issue after issue, my \nfriends and colleagues from across the aisle, who loudly proclaim \nconcern about the debt, sought to raise the spending. They sought to \nincrease spending, I believe to the tune of perhaps $1 trillion of new \nspending.\n  So it is hard to hear folks being concerned about the debt when, on \nissue after issue, they seek to raise spending. We have experienced \nthat as we have gone through the process of approving the 2004 budget. \nOn issue after issue, whatever amount is set in the budget to spend, my \ncolleagues from across the aisle seek to increase that, again to the \ntune, calculated over 10-year periods, of trillions of dollars. Even \nfor the Government, a trillion dollars is real money.\n  So, yes, the debt is of concern. The way you deal with the debt is \nyou get the economy moving. That is what the President has done. That \nis what the tax cuts have stimulated. And then you have the will and \nresolve to keep a lid on spending.\n  Again, I urge my friends from across the aisle, every time you vote \nto increase spending, time and again, take a breath then before you \ntalk about the debt.\n  I came here this morning to support the President's request for a \nsupplemental appropriation of $87 billion to support our troops in Iraq \nand to accelerate the redevelopment of that country to a stable, \ndemocratic, and peaceful member of the community of nations. As \nSenators, we have two responsibilities in this matter. As members of \nthe legislative branch of Government, we must put the administration's \nproposals to the test to ensure they are prudent, practical, and can \nachieve the promised results. That is what we do as a legislative body. \nWe also have a responsibility to support our Commander in Chief as \nhe leads us as a nation.\n\n  I love the story told about Abraham Lincoln during the time he was \nleading our Nation in the Civil War. He was\n\n[[Page S11936]]\n\ngetting, on a regular basis, communications from an elderly woman who \nsaid to him that God was talking to her and God was telling her which \ngeneral to hire and which general to fire and where to attack and where \nto retreat. He got this series of letters. Finally, President Lincoln \nwrote back to this lady and said: Ma'am, I want to thank you for your \ncorrespondence and thank you for your advice, but isn't it fascinating \nhow the Lord Almighty has given you all the answers but gave me the \njob.\n  We have a Commander in Chief. We have the right to question and \nmodify the things he proposes. But it is our responsibility, I submit, \nto work expeditiously and to approve these urgently needed resources.\n  I express my strong hope that this bill will not be held hostage to \npolitical ambitions or become the vehicle of high-profile second-\nguessing. Our effort in Iraq has many challenges, but lack of politics \nis not one of them. This debate falls in a tempting place on the \nelectoral calendar, but I do hope we rise above a talk show mentality.\n  There was talk this morning: Why do we have to move quickly on the \nPresident's request? What is so urgent about it? Does the money need to \nbe spent right away? Kind of a slow walk and no sense of urgency.\n  I do hope those concerns are not raised so that we simply can extend \nthe possibly to have in the political arena debate for the sake of \ntaking political potshots. That is not what this is about. That is not \nwhat this body is about. We need to send a message to our troops in the \nfield that we support them and will provide them the resources they \nneed. We need to send a message to the Iraqi people that we are \ncommitted to working with Iraq to ensure that democracy is there. You \ncan't have democracy when the lights are out 8 hours a day. We are \nseeing in Washington and Virginia how difficult it is to operate when \nthe lights aren't on. Multiply that many times over.\n  I am concerned about the nature of the debate that comes with our \ninvolvement in Iraq. Debate is what this body expects and understands, \nbut there is a tone about the debate that is of great concern because \nothers watch. There is discussion now about whether this is the \nPresident's war.\n  Before you and I entered this body on October 11, 2002, there was a \ndebate about what action we should take regarding Iraq, what authority \nwe should give the President regarding Iraq.\n  There was a full debate. There was a great dialog. There was great \ndiscussion. This body voted. The sense of this body was 77 to 23 to \nsupport the President and to give the President the authority to do the \nthings that had to be done to make sure Saddam Hussein complied with \nthe United Nations resolutions. Let us not forget that for a period of \n10 years he disregarded United Nations resolutions.\n  By a vote of 77 to 23--not 51 to 49, not a 50 to 50 tie asking the \nVice President to break that tie--a broad bipartisan coalition, an \noverwhelming majority of the Senate, said: This is our battle, this is \nAmerica's battle, and the responsibility we have as elected \nrepresentatives to speak for the people we represent and give voice to \ntheir hopes and concerns was reflected in that debate.\n  When others now talk about the ``President's war,'' it causes great \nconcern.\n  I like the words of the ``Serenity Prayer.'' I hope we have the \nwisdom to address ourselves in the things we can change and not try to \nchange the past.\n  I say to my colleagues that one of my pleasures as a Senator from the \nState of Minnesota is to represent the western shore of Lake Superior, \nthe world's largest body of freshwater. If you visit this area during \nthe right time of year, you will see the enormous iron ore boats that \ntransport Minnesota iron ore to the steel plants of the eastern Great \nLakes. These gigantic boats are so large that it takes them many hours \nand many miles to execute a turn into port.\n  The bigger something is, the longer it takes to turn it around. Such \nis our challenge in Iraq. We are attempting to turn a large society \nfrom a generation of tyranny and totalitarianism to democracy and free \nenterprise.\n  For over 25 years, the people of Iraq suffered under the brutality of \nSaddam Hussein. For over 25 years, the people of Iraq didn't even have \na budget. Its infrastructure was eaten away as resources were simply \ngiven to Saddam for his friends and for his palaces, and the country \nsuffered.\n  I find it ironic that some critics of our policy who said we could \nnever defeat Saddam Hussein are now loudly complaining that it takes \ntoo long. In our instant-everything, drive-through, microwave society, \nwe perhaps have lost sight of the fact that some things take time. The \nbigger the thing, the more time it takes.\n  To those who lament our supposed slow progress in Iraq, we are \nexceeding any realistic expectations of success. Rome was not built in \na day and Iraq won't be, either. The lasting social structures in Iraq \nneed to rest on firm foundations and progress. And those foundations \nare being made.\n  To those who say we need to turn Iraq over to the Iraqis, we want to \nturn it over to the Iraqis. We want the Iraqis to be in charge. We want \nthe Iraqis to be guarding the hospitals and the oil wells. We want the \nIraqis to be responsible for the future of Iraq. But in order to have \nthat, you have to have a foundation. Iraq has to develop a \nconstitution. It needs to be affirmed. When it is affirmed, it then \nneeds to have free and fair elections. That is how to develop the \nfoundation.\n  As we are developing that foundation, we are making progress in \ndeveloping Iraqi security forces and police units which can begin to \ntake the load off the American and coalition military units.\n  We are helping the Iraqi oil industry and its power generation come \nback to some semblance of functionality. The Central Iraqi Bank has \ntaken bold steps to create a secure currency. Some of the most dramatic \nsteps that any government has to set for itself is to be open to trade, \nto be open to entrepreneurship, and to be open to opportunity. These \nare bold moves in any part of the world but certainly in Iraq.\n\n  The Governing Council has just taken steps to open the country to \nforeign investment.\n  You heard earlier today my colleague, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Energy Committee, Senator Domenici, talking about the Ministers of \nIraq and the number of Ph.Ds--one of the most educated governments \nanywhere in the world--and the caliber of folks we are bringing to the \ntable.\n  The Poles have already assumed command of a multinational division in \nIraq with NATO support. We have captured or killed over 40 of the 55 \nmost-wanted Iraqis, including one more over the weekend, Saddam's \nMinister of Defense.\n  I mentioned the Governing Council being formed. I am told there is \neven a city council in Baghdad. I must say as a former mayor that when \nI heard there was a city council in Baghdad, my first thought was, \nHaven't the Iraqis suffered enough? But a city council is there and \noperating.\n  Thousands of Iraqi policemen and soldiers are being hired and trained \nto help provide security for their nation. Every hospital and clinic in \nBaghdad is operating, as are most of the others around the country. \nEvery hospital and clinic in Baghdad is operating. The clinics and \nhospitals in Iraq have 7,500 tons of medicine distributed by the \ncoalition since May, an increase of over 700 percent over the level at \nthe end of the war.\n  For the first time in its history, all of Baghdad has garbage \ncollection service. No longer is garbage collection a privilege \nreserved for neighbors favored by the Government.\n  Again, I reflect back to my days as a mayor and the importance of \nbasic services being provided to all of the citizenry and not just for \nthe rich neighborhoods. We are doing that in Iraq.\n  Iraqi workers are producing over 1 million barrels of oil per day, \nthe proceeds of which will benefit the Iraqi people rather than Saddam \nHussein's corrupt regime. Ninety-two thousand Iraqis receive social \nsecurity and welfare benefits at levels four times higher than they \nreceived under Saddam. One point three million Iraqi civil servants are \ndrawing salaries under a new salary scale. Many of them, such as \nteachers, are being paid four times what they were paid under Saddam.\n  The test of our efforts is that the Iraqi people are voting with \ntheir feet. They are staying put. There has been no humanitarian \ncrisis. There has been\n\n[[Page S11937]]\n\nno flood of refugees as had been predicted. The $87 billion in this \nbill will bolster all of these critical efforts.\n  We all need to put the daily events so effusively reported in Iraq in \nperspective. We see this, by the way, even in our own Nation. A lot of \ngood is being done but somehow that doesn't always qualify as news.\n  I believe the President's leadership is beginning to pay dividends, \neven at the United Nations. It is a slow boat to turn as well, but I \nbelieve we will soon see progress towards broad international \ncooperation for the rebuilding of Iraq. Even the French say they will \nnot now veto a resolution.\n  The President met with the head of Germany yesterday and had a good \nconversation.\n\n  Let there be no mistake. We are in a state of war against terrorism. \nOur decisions and the tone of our debate must recognize that fact. \nForces that seek to destroy us are measuring our will and our resolve \nat each turn. Their view is that we are weak and easily distracted and \ndivided. We must prove to them the truth--that we are not. We do that \nby what our military does on the ground every day. We do that by how we \nas leaders conduct this debate in this body.\n  Again, I recognize the importance of debate and challenging ideas and \npropositions. But there is a tone about debate and I worry that we are \ncrossing the line. I worry that when we talk about this being the \nPresident's war, again disregarding the fact that this body, in a broad \nbipartisan way, raised its hand and understood the dangers of Saddam, \nunderstood the evil of Saddam and the evil impact he had on the Iraqi \npeople, the impact that it was having on the region, the impact it was \nhaving on Israel, and the impact it was having on terrorism; understood \nthat we had in Saddam and Iraq a nation which took care of and catered \nto the persons who masterminded the terrorist acts in the airports in \nRome and Vienna; a nation that coddled, took care of and exalted the \nterrorists responsible for the execution of an American in a \nwheelchair, Leon Klinghoffer on the Achilles Lauro in Athens--everybody \nunderstood what we were dealing with.\n  We rose together in unison. Let us not now forget. Let us not now \npull apart. Let us not now send the signal that we are weak and in \ndisarray. It is important to have a sense of strength and purpose. Let \nus have the debate but let us make decisions.\n  In World War I, the French soldiers came up with the saying that \n``the difference between a hero and a coward is the hero is brave 2 \nminutes longer.'' We cannot afford to lose our nerve at the point of \nvictory or all the sacrifice and the progress to date could be lost.\n\n  For those who question this amount of money being spent at times of \neconomic difficulty and high deficits, I understand that concern. It is \nso easy to say, with anything we do, if we put dollars into something, \nwhy aren't we taking care of the needs of kids? Why aren't we taking \ncare of the needs of schools? Why aren't we taking care of seniors? The \narguments can certainly be made, and they touch a sympathetic chord, a \nsympathetic note.\n  The reality is we have to understand again and again that you cannot \nhave economic security, you cannot have peace of mind, you cannot have \nthe opportunity for your kids to go to good schools, and folks to live \nin peace in their neighborhoods and go about their daily lives if we \nlive in fear. The world changed after September 11. We have to reflect \non the impact of September 11, not just psychologically but \neconomically.\n  What happens when we allow terrorism to visit our shores? The folks \nin Washington, DC, saw this very graphically during the terrible period \nwhen the sniper was on the loose in Washington, and people would not go \nout of their homes. They were afraid to go to a gas station, afraid to \nshop, afraid to go to a restaurant. I have not seen the final bills, \nbut I am sure the economic impact was enormous. When people live in \nfear, they cannot prosper economically or emotionally.\n  America has a responsibility at this point in history--for the sake \nof our kids, for the sake of our seniors, for the sake of our parents--\nto do those things necessary to live in peace, to confront and deal \nwith terrorism. We learned on September 11 we cannot contain terrorism. \nWe have to aggressively reach out to make sure we do all we can to make \nsure terrorism does not visit our shores.\n  It is not a matter of saying, if we did not put this money here we \nwould put it there. The reality is, of the $87 billion, $67 billion \ngoes directly to the military. It is also to rebuild the infrastructure \nof Iraq so that the military ethics can take hold. We cannot have such \nshort memories.\n  Ambassador Bremer visited with many Senators this last week and gave \na little historical lesson. He said: Look at what we did after World \nWar I. We did not step in. We did not have the sense of heart and \npurpose to come together and say we were going to deal with the \ndestruction left in the wake. We gave rise to Nazism, to fascism. What \nhappened is, ultimately, millions of lives were lost.\n  I am of the Jewish faith. In our faith we say: We shall never forget; \nwe shall never forget the Holocaust. The seeds of that were laid in the \nactions after World War I that were not taken to deal with the plight, \ndeal with the economic plight, deal with the disarray, deal with the \ndisintegration.\n  After World War II, we took a very different path. After World War \nII, we enacted a Marshall plan, and we came together, with the United \nStates taking the lead; the international community then joining in \nbuilding up and restoring the economy, doing things that restored hope, \ndoing things that restored water and electricity. The result is Europe \nhas been safer. We have been safer until the rise of terrorism.\n  Let us not forget those models. Let us not forget that history. \nSuccess will build world confidence and investment far beyond this \ninvestment in Iraq. Failure would cost far more.\n\n  All of these practical arguments notwithstanding, I close with a \nsimple argument for the passage of this supplemental appropriation: It \nis the right thing to do. Our troops need our support. The people of \nIraq, present and future, need our help. The world that hopes for far \nmore freedom and less terror needs what only the United States can \nprovide. We can reach out and set an example to the international \ncommunity to join with us.\n  This bill is the right thing to do. It is the right for the people of \nIraq who are free from the torture chambers so they may never come back \nagain. It is the right thing to do for the young women of Iraq who are \nraped and assaulted by Quday and Usay Hussein. It is the right thing to \ndo for the memory of thousands murdered and buried in mass graves, and \nfor their justice; for the millions of Iraqi people who will choose \ntheir own path, live their own lives, and decide their own faith when \nwe set the foundation, set the table for restoration of democracy, firm \nand lasting in Iraq.\n  It is the right thing to do for the millions of neighbors of Iraq who \nwill not fear the unbearable fanaticism of a dictator more concerned \nabout power than the moral obligation of leadership. It is the right \nthing to do for our democratic ally in Israel who no longer will face \nthe threat of Scud missiles from Iraq. It is the right thing to do for \nthe courage of our American soldiers who have performed their duty and \nlived up to their oath to defend and protect the national interests of \ntheir Nation.\n  It is the right thing to do for the memory of American soldiers who \nhave given their lives so that others may live in freedom. It is the \nright thing to do for the millions of Americans and the 3,000 who died \non September 11 that American determination, resolve, and will are not \nthings of the past but are ironclad promises for the future.\n  It is the right thing to do for the message it sends to those who \nsupport terrorism, that they will have no refuge; for the message it \nsends to those who kill, who terrorize, who destroy the hopes, dreams, \nand happiness of men and women and children that this is a new day, a \nbetter world. Their days are numbered. No more can we accept the crying \nfaces, parents holding their dying children, parents burying their dead \nchildren. To those who seek to destroy, those who choose to unravel the \nfabric of society and civilization, this bill is the right thing to do \nbecause it makes it clear their time will come; our resolve is strong. \nWe will support our fighting men and women and give them what they need \nto do the job.\n  We will work with the Iraqi people to rebuild and create a foundation \nwhere\n\n[[Page S11938]]\n\ndemocracy and hope will take place. Good will triumph over evil. \nDemocracy will triumph over tyranny. Security will triumph over \nterrorism. Peace will come to Iraq. And all of us in America will be \nsafer as a result.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11938-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SCHOOL VOUCHERS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, in the time remaining, I raise one other \nissue, the issue of opportunity scholarships, of expanded choice for \nstudents, the issue of the debate we are having over the opportunity \nfor the children of the District of Columbia to take advantage of a \n``voucher'' program. We do not like to use that word. In my State, it \nis a pretty divisive word.\n  The Mayor of Washington, Anthony Williams, says this is the right \nthing to do. As a former mayor, I will stand with Mayor Williams. This \nis a very divisive issue in my city of St. Paul. When I ran, I said I \nwould not push vouchers for the people of Minnesota. We had our debate. \nWe have gone a different path, expanding charter schools. St. Paul, my \ncity, had the first charter school in the Nation. As mayor, we started \n20 more charter schools, providing tax incentives and tax credits so \nparents could get money back and use money they need to support their \nkids' education, to give their kids more choice. That makes sense.\n  But more needs to be done. I recognize that. This is a divisive \nissue. When the Mayor of the District of Columbia is saying we need to \ndo this for our kids, why not do it? It is not taking any money from my \nkids in Minnesota. It is not taking any money from any kids in any of \nthe other States. We have a local, elected official saying we need to \ndo this; our kids are failing and we need to give them more hope and \nopportunity. Why not do it? What are we afraid of?\n  When I was mayor of St. Paul, the Governor offered, I believe, $13 \nmillion to any community that would simply do a pilot project offering \nopportunity scholarships to the poorest of the poor and only the kids \nwho were not succeeding.\n  So you were not going to take the cream of the crop. You were not \ngoing to cherry-pick. You were going to take those who were not making \nit. You have to do something. In fact, the offer was that out of this \n$13 million, he would give $10 million to the school district to do \nwhatever they wanted. Only $3 million would be for this pilot project. \nAnd not a single elected official, other than myself, would stand up \nand do it.\n  What are we afraid of? If all you keep doing is what you have been \ndoing, all you are going to get is more of the same. Our children need \nmore hope and opportunity. I hope we have the courage to give it a shot \nand a chance. The downside is minimal. The opportunity is great. Let's \nseize the opportunity. Let's do this for the kids. Let's do the right \nthing. Let's make change. Let's give hope.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2658, which the clerk will state by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2658) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by all of the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 24, 2003.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate, on \nbehalf of myself and the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, who is \ncurrently chairing the Indian Affairs Committee, the Defense \nappropriations conference report for fiscal year 2004.\n  This conference report was approved by the House of Representatives \nby a vote of 407 to 15. It has overwhelming bipartisan support. The \nagreement provides for a total of $368.7 billion for the Department for \nfiscal year 2004. Throughout our conversations with the House over the \npast months, Senator Inouye and I have sought to strike a balanced \nagreement that we believe addresses key requirements for readiness, \nquality of life, and reconstitution of our defense force.\n  As we take up this conference report on the floor today, there are \nhundreds of thousands of men and women in uniform deployed and serving \nour country at home and abroad. They are performing superbly, and we \nare extremely proud of what they are accomplishing. This agreement is a \ndemonstration of our support, the Congress's support, for our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  It provides a 4.1 percent average pay raise for all military \npersonnel. It funds an increase in basic allowance for housing to \nreduce average out-of-pocket expenses from 7.5 percent to 3.5 percent \nfor our military people. It provides an additional $128 million for the \ncontinuation of increased rates for imminent-danger pay and family-\nseparation allowances.\n  This agreement honors the commitment we have made to our Armed \nForces--one we will maintain. It helps ensure they will continue to \nhave good leadership, first-rate training, modernized equipment, and \nquality infrastructure. The agreement provides $115.9 billion for \noperation and maintenance, $74.7 billion for procurement, and $65.2 \nbillion for research and development.\n  Defense is a very expensive concept for our country. That is so not \nonly because we have a volunteer service but because we are modernizing \nour force for the future. This agreement is the result of a bicameral, \nbipartisan approach. I urge the Senate to adopt this conference report.\n  Let me once again thank my co-chairman, Senator Inouye, for his \nsupport and invaluable counsel on this bill. I would also like to note \nthe dedicated work of his chief of staff Charlie Houy, Betsy Schmid, \nand Nicole DiResta.\n  I thank my hard-working staff led by Sid Ashworth and including Tom \nHawkins, Kraig Siracuse, Bob Henke, Lesley Kalan, Jennifer Chartrand, \nMenda Fife, Brian Wilson, Mazie Mattson, Nicole Royal, and Alycia \nFarrell. They have helped put together this conference report and \nworked with us through the year to bring us where we are today with the \nlargest defense budget in history and the best bill we have ever \npresented to the Senate.\n  I yield to my good friend from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, before I proceed, I wish to commend my \nchairman, Mr. Stevens, for bringing this conference report to the \nSenate. In doing so, I commend him for his leadership. I realize \nMembers of the Senate may not be aware of this, but because of the \nleadership skills and because of the hard work of the staff, the \nconference committee concluded its work on this important measure in 2 \nhours. In 2 hours, we concluded a bill that was filled with controversy \nand issues. At the end, the vote was unanimous.\n  The conferees recommend $368.7 billion in mandatory and discretionary \nappropriations for the coming year. It is a huge sum, but it is a sum \nthat is absolutely necessary.\n  This is nearly half a billion less than recommended by the Senate and \n$3.6 billion less than requested by the President. We have tried our \nbest to trim what some would call ``fat.''\n\n[[Page S11939]]\n\n  The reduction to the President's request is not an indication that we \nbelieve Defense is overfunded. Instead, it is because we realize that \nthere are so many other underfunded areas of the budget that we had to \nreduce defense to accommodate these needs. This was a tough conference. \nOur chairman did an exceptional job--I emphasize ``exceptional''--\nrepresenting the Senate position. This is especially true given the \nreduced allocation.\n  This agreement provides the funds necessary for the military. It \nfully funds the pay and allowances for our troops and thereby ensures \nthat we have taken care of the crown jewel of our Defense capability--\nthe men and women who put on the uniform.\n  In the interest of time, I will not present all of the details of \nthis massive bill. However, I would like to address two important \nsubjects that the managers of the House and Senate spent many hours \ndiscussing.\n  First, the conferees agreed to include an amended version of House \nlanguage that would close down the Navy Station at Roosevelt Roads, \nPuerto Rico.\n  As we looked into this matter we found that the Navy no longer needed \nor wanted the base and it could save $300 million annually by closing \nit. As such, we agreed to close the base. However, the conference \nagreement ensures that the base will be closed in accordance with \nexisting base closure laws. We did not agree to a new procedure which \nwould have given the Navy all the benefits of the closure and the local \npopulation none of the safeguards included in the BRAC legislation.\n  Second, the Senate bill include language terminating the \ncontroversial Terrorism Information Awareness program, TIA. The \nconferees have agreed to terminate the program and close the Office of \nInformation Awareness in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, \nDARPA.\n  Language has been included that precludes any successor version of \nthis program to be reinstated or developed by any Federal agency. \nHowever, I must inform my colleagues that in our review, we learned \nthat there are some classified elements that are related to this \nprogram. These have all the safeguards of programs under the \njurisdiction of the National Foreign Intelligence Program to protect \ncivil liberties of U.S. citizens. These are very important to the \nongoing war on terrorism overseas. The conferees have agreed to allow \nthis effort to continue.\n  In addition, there were some worthwhile programs in the Office of \nInformation Awareness unrelated to the TIA program. The Statement of \nthe managers lists these programs and funds their continuation. This is \na good compromise. It kills TIA and on-line betting, and other \nquestionable DARPA programs, but ensures that beneficial parts of \ninformation awareness can continue. Finally, I want to express my \nstrong support for this measure.\n  My colleagues should know this was a fully bipartisan accord. There \nare no parts of this bill that I oppose. While it is a compromise, it \nis a very good bill.\n  The chairman and his staff, led by Sid Ashworth, have done great \nwork. I thank all the staff who worked so hard on this: Mazie Matson, \nNicole Royal, Jennifer Chartrand, Kraig Siracuse, Tom Hawkins, Bob \nHenke, Lesley Kalan, Menda Fife and Brian Wilson of the majority, and \nNicole Diresta, Betsy Schmid and Charlie Houy of the minority staff.\n  This is a good bill, and I urge all my colleages to support it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today we are considering the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 2658, the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill by FY 2004.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman and the ranking member on their \nsuccessfully reporting and conferencing this bill.\n  The pending bill provides $368.7 billion in total budget authority \nand $389.2 billion in total outlays for fiscal year 2004. The Senate \nbill is $3.5 billion in BA and $4.6 billion outlays below the \nPresident's budget request. These funds were shifted to other non-\ndefense spending bills consistent with an agreement with the \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     H.R. 2658, DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS, 2004: SPENDING COMPARISONS:\n                            CONFERENCE REPORT\n                    [Fiscal Year 2004, in $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        General\n                                        purpose    Mandatory     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n  Budget Authority..................    368,183         528     368,711\n  Outlays...........................    388,642         528     389,170\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget Authority..................    368,572         528     369,100\n  Outlays...........................    389,306         528     389,834\n2003 level:\n  Budget Authority..................    426,621         393     427,014\n  Outlays...........................    393,835         393     394,228\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority..................    371,699         528     372,227\n  Outlays...........................    393,222         528     393,750\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget Authority..................    368,662         528     369,190\n  Outlays...........................    388,836         528     389,364\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget Authority..................    368,637         528     369,165\n  Outlays...........................    389,371         528     389,899\n \n                     CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO--\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget Authority..................

Totals adjusted for\n  consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\nPrepared by SBC Majority Staff, 9/24/2003.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it is interesting to note that Senator \nNickles says this bill complies completely with the requirements of the \nBudget Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we only have notification of one person \nwho wishes to speak. If that is the case, I believe we will have a vote \non this conference report sometime around noon. It is my hope that we \nwill have it before lunch if possible. So I put the Senate on notice \nthat we will be voting around noon.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I rise to address the conference \nreport for fiscal year 2004, the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill. As has become a standard practice for appropriations matters, \nthis legislation is loaded with porkbarrel spending catered to the \nparochial needs of the Members and special interests and not to the \ninterests of the men and women in the military.\n  I feel it is important that I come to the floor of the Senate to draw \nattention to this legislation, especially at a time when American \ntroops are stretched across the globe, including major commitments in \nIraq and Afghanistan. I notice in this morning's paper it is very \nlikely that more National Guardsmen and Reserve Forces will have to be \ncalled up. We should be devoting critical defense dollars to urgent \ndefense priorities. Apparently, that philosophy is not shared by all.\n  In this year's version of the legislation, there is over $6.5 billion \nin Member add-ons. I must say I congratulate the committee because last \nyear it was $8.1 billion. So we have experienced a $1.6 billion \nreduction. I want to point out that these add-ons were not in the \nPresident's budget, not on the unfunded priority list, and not on the \nPentagon's long-range defense budget.\n  Nowhere--nowhere--was there a priority for any of these items that I \nwill be talking about and listing. One of the remarkable things about \nit is our disabled veterans are now trying to receive what we call \nconcurrent receipt--\n\n[[Page S11940]]\n\nin other words, to be treated, when they are disabled, the same way \nthat nonmilitary members of the Federal Government are treated. As it \nis now, they are prohibited against receiving both retirement and \ndisability pay, as are other men and women who work for our Federal \nGovernment. Full concurrent receipt would cost the Government $3.5 \nbillion annually, which is approximately half the total pork that is in \nthis bill.\n\n  So I am announcing to my colleagues today I was trying to work out \nsome way of ameliorating the cost of this concurrent receipt. When we \nspend money like this--when we will spend $5.9 billion more by leasing \nBoeing tankers rather than buying them, it seems to me that taking care \nof the men and women who have served with honor and distinction in the \nmilitary deserve full concurrent receipt.\n  Once again, we are considering the Defense appropriations conference \nreport prior to the consideration of the Defense authorization \nconference report. I remind my colleagues again of the role of the \nAppropriations Committee. The responsibility of the authorizers and the \nappropriators are expected to be distinct. The role of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee is to establish policy and funding levels and \noversee the Department of Defense and its programs. The role of the \nAppropriations Committee is to allocate funding based on policies \nprovided by authorization bills. The appropriators' function and role \ntoday, however, is expanded dramatically, and they now engage in \nsignificant policy decisionmaking and micromanagement, usurping the \nrole of the authorizing committees.\n  I recognize the failure of authorizing committees to pass authorizing \nlegislation contributes to this broken system and that often, as is \nprobably the case now, appropriators have no choice but to fund \nunauthorized programs and take it upon themselves to make policy \ndeterminations. That is why, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, I \nhave tried to reauthorize every program and bureaucracy that falls \nunder the responsibilities of the Commerce Committee. I think I have \ndone this with some success. But we still find, for example, in the \nCommerce-State-Justice appropriations bill--which has not been \nconsidered yet on the floor--significant policy changes, laws written--\nit is rather remarkable. Entire departments of Government are dissolved \nwithout debate--by the way, with the strong objections of the executive \nbranch.\n  So one of the reasons the authorization bills are held up is because \nMembers know that authorization measures don't really have to pass, and \nwe know that the appropriations vehicles are always available to carry \nlegislative riders. I have testified before the Rules Committee on the \nneed for change, and I think at some point in time we will be faced \nwith a choice: We either do away with the Appropriations Committee or \nwith the authorizing committees.\n  The authorizing committees, to some degree, have become rather \nengaging and sometimes interesting debating groups when the real \nchanges and policy decisions are made by the appropriators.\n  I also want to point out, last week I saw one of the most remarkable \nthings I have ever seen in all the years I have been here. The energy \nand water appropriations bill was voted on and passed last Tuesday \nnight. We voted. It was a recorded vote. Everybody went home. The next \nmorning--and I mention this because the Senator from Nevada is on the \nfloor--the next morning the Senator from Nevada stood and asked \nunanimous consent that $65 million be added for water projects for the \nCorps of Engineers.\n  I understand there was some technical reason for it and there was \nsome technical change that was made, but I have to tell you, Mr. \nPresident, I have never, in all the years I have been here, seen a bill \npassed and voted on and the next day, many hours after the bill was \npassed, a Member come to the floor and ask unanimous consent that \nmillions of dollars be added to an appropriations bill. If that is the \nway we are going to do business around here, then, I say to my friends, \nthere is no fiscal discipline.\n  On September 17, the Comptroller General of the United States David \nWalker delivered a speech at the National Press Club. According to the \nhead of the General Accounting Office, ``We must begin to come to grips \nwith the daunting fiscal realities that threaten our Nation's, \nchildren's and grandchildren's future.''\n  In his speech, Mr. Walker cited CBO estimates at that time--they have \nsince gone up $401 billion and $480 billion for the unified budget \ndeficits for the fiscal years 2003 and 2004 respectively. If we take \nout the Social Security surpluses, these numbers jump to $562 billion \nand $644 billion respectively. More importantly, the costs of the $87 \nbillion war supplemental are not even factored into these numbers.\n  In addition to this money, there are a number of financial \nliabilities the Federal Government has to pay out but are not counted \nagainst the budget, such as Medicare trust funds and health care \nbenefit costs provided to the Department of Veterans Affairs. This \nleads Mr. Walker to state:\n\n       We are starting off in a financial hole we don't really \n     have a very good picture of how deep it is.\n\n  His suggestion:\n\n       It is time to admit that we are in a fiscal hole and ``stop \n     digging.''\n\n  I would like us to take seriously the advice of the top Government \nwatchdog and quit digging. It seems to me if everybody in this country \nis watching reality television these days, I say to my good friends \nwatching the Senate proceedings on C-SPAN, you are not watching reality \ntelevision here. What you are watching is unreal. You are watching \nMembers who don't care about the budget deficit we are running. In the \nface of huge deficits, we can still find enough money to blow on some \nof the items I will describe today.\n  Mr. President, I am tired of fighting these bills. I don't enjoy \narousing the animosity of my friends on both sides of the aisle. I \ndon't pretend to judge these projects. Many of them are worthwhile. \nMany of them are worthy causes. The hundreds of millions of dollars \nthat are spent out of the Defense appropriations bill for breast cancer \nresearch is a worthy cause. My question remains, What in the world is \nit doing in a Defense appropriations bill when we have men and women \nwho are still on food stamps and living in quarters that were built in \nWorld War II?\n\n  I am dismayed by the lack of attention we focus on these bills. Aside \nfrom scouring the bills to see if their projects are included, not much \ntime is devoted to considering the conference report.\n  This legislation passed the House of Representatives without a copy \nof the bill text or explanatory report being available to all who want \nto look at it. In fact, a member of my staff called the House committee \nwhile they were voting on final passage of this conference report to \ninquire if the committee had the report available. The House \nappropriations staffer said they had a copy but were only allowing one \nstaff member at a time to look at it. Staff was not allowed to make \ncopies or remove the bill from the appropriator's office.\n  It took the House of Representatives 7 minutes to pass a bill that \nappropriates $368 billion for projects that appear on the Defense \nappropriations add-on list of items requested by Senators and were not \nincluded in the President's budget request. They did not appear on the \nJoint Chiefs unfunded priority list and were not authorized in the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  This criteria has been useful in identifying programs of questionable \nmerit and determining the relative priority of projects that are \nrequested by Members, often at the expense of the readiness of our \nArmed Forces.\n  The fact remains that in the years I have created these lists, no \noffsets have been provided for any project. The Joint Chiefs provided a \nlist of critical requirements above what was provided for in the \nPresident's budget request. That list totaled nearly $18 billion for \nthe year 2004. We should provide additional funding for defense for \nitems and programs which the Joint Chiefs need, not for programs that \nare important because of the State they come from or because of the \nseniority of the Member of Congress.\n  My point is, we cannot do business as usual. There is an ever-growing \nproportion of our Federal budget that is in these appropriations. While \nthe cost of each program or project may not seem\n\n[[Page S11941]]\n\nlike a good deal of money, collectively, earmarks, such as the ones in \nthis legislation, significantly burden American taxpayers.\n  Let me point out some of the more egregious examples in this \nlegislation:\n  $135 million for advanced procurement of the LPD-17;\n  $8.1 million for the 21st century truck. Mr. President, $8.1 million \nfor the 21st century truck, not requested by the Department of Defense, \nnot on any list the Joint Chiefs of Staff might feel is important, but \nthe 21st century truck finds its way into the Defense appropriations \nbill each year;\n  $4.3 million for the Army's smart truck. One would think after all \nthese years on the pork list if this truck was so smart, it would find \na way to fund itself by now;\n  $1.0 million for the Young Patriots Program. It is a wonderful name. \nIt is a program by the National Flag Foundation to expand the Young \nPatriots Program to include a video which promotes the significance of \nnational patriotic holidays. I love our patriotic holidays, but $1 \nmillion to watch a video on national patriotic holidays?\n  One of my favorites that has come up--it is interesting, once they \nare in, they continue year after year--$1.0 million for Shakespeare in \nAmerican Military Communities. Shakespeare in American Military \nCommunities has found its way in again. I guess it all is a matter of \npriorities.\n\n  $1.8 million for the canola fuel cell initiative. I think canola is \ncooking oil. I am not sure. But $1.8 million for the canola fuel cell \ninitiative not requested by the President or the Department of Defense;\n  $1 million for Lewis and Clark bicentennial activities. If this was \nin the Interior appropriations bill, I would support celebrating the \nLewis and Clark bicentennial activities. I think it was a monumental \nseries of events in American history, but we are taking it out of \ndefense.\n  $7.5 million for the Joint Advertising Market Research and Studies \nPrograms. I can hardly wait to see the commercials that come from this \nmoney.\n  $3 million for U.S.-made bayonets. Nobody else has made bayonets. \nOnce again, Buy America provisions have found their way into the bill.\n  $6.5 million for the procurement of lightweight armor for CH-46. The \nconferees mention use of Kevlar, a DuPont product, making this another \nBuy America provision.\n  I congratulate again the Senator from Alaska for a large number of \nappropriations that are earmarked for the State of Alaska ranging from \n$8 million and up to $26 million for railroad track alignment at Air \nForce-managed ranges to $8.9 million for hybrid electric vehicle \ntesting only at the cold region testing facility. $9 million for the \nFort Wainwright Utilidor. I apologize I keep displaying my ignorance on \nsome of these items. I do not know what a utilidor is. Kentucky, they \ndid OK. Then there is $1.2 million for the Fort Knox University of \nMounted Warfare Campus Area Network Infrastructure. One of my favorites \nthat was in the bill last year, a half million dollars for a hangar at \nGriffis Air Force Base in New York. The only problem with that is that \nGriffis Air Force Base has been closed for many years. It no longer \nbelongs to the military or the Federal Government.\n\n  Of course, language preventing that has been in for several years, \nlanguage which clearly falls under the purview of the authorizing \ncommittee, preventing the disestablishment of the 53rd Weather \nReconnaissance Squadron of the Air Force Reserve stationed in \nMississippi. That is clearly a policy decision and has nothing to do \nwith appropriations.\n  Then there is $45.7 million for the Maui Space Surveillance System; \n$23 million for the Hawaii Federal health care network, $2.5 for the \nAlaska Federal health care network. If I were from Alaska, I would be a \nlittle upset at that disparity: $23 million for the Hawaii Federal \nhealth care network, and only $2.5 million for the Alaska Federal \nhealth care network.\n  Our old friend, the brown tree snake, is back, another $1 million for \nthe brown tree snake, the best funded snakes in the United States and \ncertainly in the world; $1.4 million for the minimally invasive surgery \nprogram for Ohio; $4.5 million, Pacific Island health care network; $3 \nmillion for complementary and alternative medicine.\n  Again, I want to point out there are a number of excellent programs. \nThe legislation provides a pay raise to our soldiers, sailors, and \nairmen, as well as a targeted raise for midcareer officers and selected \nnoncommissioned officers. The legislation also provides $128 million \nfor the continuation of increased rates for imminent danger pay and \nfamily separation allowances. Of course, my question is: Why is that \nnot permanent?\n  I have a serious concern that extended deployments will lead to \nretention problems if we do not work to ensure that we take care of our \nsoldiers and sailors. By providing our servicemembers with adequate \nbenefits, we help ensure that our military will not face retention \nproblems.\n  In this morning's Washington Post there is a quote from an unnamed \nNational Guardsman who said that with these recent strains, the Guard \nin particular, and Reserves, are going to have significant \ndifficulties. National Guard and Reserve servicemembers are performing \nmany vital tasks. Direct involvement in military operations to liberate \nIraq in the air, on the ground, and on the sea, guarding nuclear \npowerplants, our borders and airports in the United States; providing \nsupport to the war on terrorism through guarding, interrogating and \nextending medical services to al-Qaida detainees; rebuilding schools in \nhurricane-stricken Honduras; fighting fires in our Western States; \noverseeing civil affairs in Bosnia; and augmenting aircraft carriers \nshort on Active Duty sailors with critical-skilled enlisted ratings \nduring at-sea exercises, as well as during periods of deployment.\n  I look forward to the day when I do not have to criticize the \nunrequested spending in appropriations bills. Yesterday, the House and \nSenate passed the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act. I \nwas encouraged to see that there was not a great deal of unnecessary \nspending in that legislation. We still have a number of appropriations \nbills and conference reports left to consider in this session. I can \nonly hope that the members of the Appropriations Committee will follow \nthe lead of the Homeland Security appropriators in the future. I think \nwe are entering a very serious fiscal crisis in the United States, \nincluding the fact that the Social Security situation is going to be \ncompounded by the retirement of the baby boomers, the Medicare trust \nfund is going to be in a very serious situation, and we are rapidly \napproaching the kind of deficits that were only equaled in the early \nReagan years and may even exceed them.\n\n  I know of no economist who does not believe that sooner or later the \ndeficit will increase interest rates and cause inflation. There are a \nbroad range of economists who have many different views on many \ndifferent aspects of economics. I know of none who believe that over \ntime burgeoning deficits are bad for America and the people who reside \nin our country.\n  Not too long ago, someone said the difference between California and \nWashington is that in California they cannot print their own money. I \nthink there is a certain truth to that. What bothers me is that we are \nnot making strong efforts to reduce unnecessary spending at this very \ndifficult time.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska, our distinguished chairman, as we \nenter a very difficult time, for trying to get approval of the request \nof the President of the United States. I commend him for his heroic \neffort on behalf of the much needed and very critical amounts of money, \nboth in terms of defense and in reconstruction funding.\n  I just came from a hearing in the Armed Services Committee where \nAmbassador Bremer stated unequivocally, as did General Abizaid, that \nthis money, both for the military and reconstruction, is not only vital \nbut very time sensitive. Both Ambassador Bremer and General Abizaid \nsaid the war is on for the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people. We \nneed to restore the infrastructure. We need to provide for their \nsecurity. Otherwise, we will face, in the words of Ambassador Bremer, \n``the most severe crisis.''\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska, our distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, for the heroic effort he is making to get \nthat urgent request from the President of the United\n\n[[Page S11942]]\n\nStates to take care of our men and women in the military and pursue to \nsuccess the very vital mission and challenges we face in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis comments about the supplemental. This bill before us now is what we \ncall the peace budget for defense. It does not contain any of the \nmonies for Iraq or for Afghanistan. That money is in the separate \nsupplemental emergency appropriations bill on which we are working. \nThat was handled in that manner because of the request that we have a \nclear delineation of the monies to be spent for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I will comment on two things, but first I ask unanimous consent that \nthe vote on the pending conference report occur at 12:10 today, and \nthat Senators be so notified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object. There has been a problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was just notified by staff that we \nreceived a call and we could have the vote at 1:15.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I did not hear the Senator. If there is an objection to \nthe time agreement, I will continue with my comments.\n  The Senator from Arizona did mention the money in this bill for the \nAlaska railroad. The Alaska railroad goes through two military \nreservations, and this money is to straighten out that railroad as it \ngoes through those two military reservations. We have done this for a \nperiod of years now. We are straightening it out so it does not provide \na hazard to the people who live on base. It moves the sound as far as \nwe can from the military operations. It is much more safe as it is \nstraightened out and does not have a circuitous route through those two \nmilitary bases.\n  In addition, for the Senator's information, a utilidor is a facility \nthat we put into the ground in Alaska to carry our utilities. In \neffect, it is an underground tunnel so that the utilities can all be \nmaintained underground during the wintertime. It contains water, sewer, \nelectric, all cables, and they are capable of maintenance through the \nwinter.\n  As a matter of fact, I would welcome the District of Columbia to \nfollow our path and put the utilities underground because every time \nthere is a storm, all the electric lines, power lines, and cable lines \ncome down because they are not buried. We do not just bury them under \nthe ground. We bury a long, continuous container that is capable of \nbeing walked through so we can maintain all of the utilities on our \nmilitary bases. They, at times, need modernization. The money in this \nbill is for modernization.\n\n  I know my friend wants to comment. I have been asked--we do expect a \nvote. We will try to get a vote on the pending bill. We are having a \ncommunications problem. I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the distinguished chairman of the committee, we \nwant to have a vote on this most important bill as early as possible. \nIt appears now we are not going to be able to do that until a later \ntime today because we have a number of people who are going to the \nWhite House at 2:20. President Bush always meets on time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield, I am informed if I make a \nrequest for a vote on this conference report at 1:15, that will be \nacceptable. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. REID. We would agree to that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe conference report occur at 1:20, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, that would be fine if the \nSenator would modify his request--that we stay on this until 1:15?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is my understanding. We will stay on this bill \nuntil 1:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Arizona, for whom I have the \ngreatest admiration and respect--he and I came to Washington together \nin 1982 as new Members of Congress. Of course, at that time I was aware \nof his gallant deeds for our country as a member of the U.S. Navy.\n  However, the Senator has tried to indicate that there was something \nwrong with how the energy and water appropriations bill was handled, \nespecially the raising of the 302(b) allocations. That is done all the \ntime. We worked very hard with the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nthe ranking member of the Budget Committee, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, this Senator, the chairman of the full committee, and the \nranking member of the full Appropriations Committee to come up with \nsome way to take care of the weather-related problems that had \noccurred, dealing with the Corps of Engineers.\n  What we did was, we had an amendment ready to offer, to have an \nemergency appropriation, in effect, for the $125 million that was \ncaused by weather-related activities. I have no doubt that would have \nbeen agreed to. However, after meeting with the Senators about whom I \nspoke, they were able to find money in other appropriations bills that \nwas not used. Rather than have the emergency designation, we simply \nraised the 302(b) allocation. The $65 million was just that.\n  So anyone who would in any way infer that there was anything wrong \nwith that simply is wrong. The chairman of the full committee is in the \nChamber, and he would acknowledge that, as would the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Nickles, as would Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. President, could we have order in the Chamber, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. REID. One reason I asked you to bring the Senate to order was \nthere were two conversations going on. They were both interesting. It \nwas hard for me to listen to both of those and also try to get my \nthoughts together. I don't know which of the two was the more \ninteresting but they were both pretty good.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Arizona said the country was in a hole and we should stop digging. \nI respectfully agree with him. But the hole isn't anything the Energy \nand Water Development Subcommittee created. We are struggling to take \ncare of the defense needs of this country. You know the Energy and \nWater Development Subcommittee handles the defense nuclear programs of \nthis country, in addition to many other programs--university programs \nand other things that go on.\n  The situation is simply that the hole the Senator talks about was \ncreated by the fact that we are spending far more money than we are \ntaking in. It is no secret, when President Bush took office, there was \na surplus of about $7 trillion over 10 years. That is gone. This year's \ndeficit will be around $700 billion, when you take out the Social \nSecurity Program and don't have that mask the deficit. So the hole is \nthere, and I acknowledge that. The Senator is right. I am simply saying \ndon't pick on the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee; we had \nnothing to do with the hole. The hole was dug by others, not by us.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n(At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered to \n                       be printed in the Record.)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, today I commend the Senate for \naddressing and correcting an unfortunate hardship placed on Native \nAmerican veterans.\n  For the past decade, VA's Native American Housing Loan Program has \nprovided direct loans to eligible Native American veterans who wish to \npurchase, construct, or improve a home on\n\n[[Page S11943]]\n\ntrust lands--lands held by the federal government for the benefit of \nNative Americans. A problem arose this year due to a provision included \nin the fiscal year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which set a \nspending cap for the program at $5 million. That figure was deemed \nreasonable by the administration and appropriators because it was taken \nfrom previous years' spending amounts.\n  However, due to historically low interest rates over the past year, \nVA and borrowers have worked together to refinance many loans, loans \nthat were counted toward the $5 million cap. The combined costs of \nrefinanced loans and new loans led VA to exceed the newly-implemented \ncap. Consequently, last June, VA was forced to cease providing further \nfunds for the year. This left many Native American veterans in despair \nas their housing projects sat awaiting completion. With the cessation \nof the program, veterans have been unable to complete construction on \nhomes that were already in progress, refinance existing loans, or pay \ncontractors.\n  The Native American Housing Loan Program originally began as a 5-year \npilot project in 1993. Congress, recognizing its value, has re-\nauthorized it twice and extended it through 2005. A recent GAO report \nnoted a primary motivating force behind the bill was the fact that the \nhome ownership rate among Native Americans is one of the lowest in the \nUnited States, finding that ``while over 67 percent of Americans own \ntheir homes, fewer than 33 percent of Native Americans own homes.''\n  In the report accompanying a reauthorization of the program in 1998, \nthe Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs stated that direct loans to \nthese Native American veterans are necessary since--even with \ntraditional VA guarantees--commercial lenders will not make mortgage \nloans to finance the purchase or construction of housing on Native \nAmerican lands. They decline to do so because Federal law would \nprohibit a lender, in the event of default, from taking possession of \nnative trust lands. Recent estimates indicate there are approximately \n190,000 Native American military veterans. Many expert demographers \nrecognize that, historically, Native Americans have the highest record \nof service per capita when compared to other ethnic groups. Congress \nrealized that they should be allowed to receive the benefits they have \nearned through their service--such as VA home loans--no matter where \nthey choose to live in the United States.\n  The Native American Housing Loan Program alleviates some of the \nproblems faced by Native American veterans in a couple of ways. First, \nthe bill lowers barriers for these heroic veterans by encouraging them \nto participate in the privileges and benefits of home ownership in \nAmerica. Secondly, the program provides economic incentives to develop \nthriving and long-lasting Native American communities. According to \nVA's Annual Report to Congress for fiscal year 2002, VA closed 62 loans \nduring 2002 for a total of 289 loans made under the program from its \ninception through September 30, 2002.\n  Mr. President, as ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nI applaud the Congress for working to alleviate this problem in a \ntimely manner. I am proud to support a provision in the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill that will eliminate the spending cap \ncompletely. The legislation ensures that stalled housing projects can \nbe continued without stifling future home ownership opportunities for \nNative American veterans. I am glad that we have been able to work in a \nbipartisan manner and I know the Native American veteran community is \nthankful of our efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nGregg) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2765) making appropriations for the government \n     of the District of Columbia and other activities chargeable \n     in whole or in part against the revenues of said District for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       DeWine/Landrieu amendment No. 1783 in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in just a moment my colleague and friend \nfrom California will be offering an amendment. Before she does that, I \nagain thank her for her contribution to this bill.\n  When this bill was being marked up in the Appropriations Committee, \nshe came to Senator Stevens, the chairman, Senator Gregg, myself, and \nthe other members of the committee and said she believed the bill could \nbe improved--specifically, the section having to do with the \nscholarships for the children in the District of Columbia.\n  She made some suggestions. Quite frankly, as I told her on the phone \nlater, I was just sorry I had not come up with those ideas because, \nfrankly, she significantly improved the bill. So I wish to publicly \nagain thank her for the suggestions she made. We incorporated those \nsuggestions, those ideas, into the bill in the committee.\n  She said: We want to make sure this bill is constitutional. She had \nsome ideas in regard to that. We incorporated them into the bill. She \nalso said: ``Let's make sure the mayor--who has been such a strong \nadvocate for the scholarship program, the mayor of the District of \nColumbia--let's make sure he is intricately involved in this program, \nthe designing of the program, the running of the program; let's make \nsure he is tied into this program, and that we can, in fact, do \nthat.'' We made those changes as well.\n\n  Third, she said: ``Let's make sure there is accountability so we can \nmeasure the results.'' We made some changes to accomplish that as well.\n  The amendment she will offer and describe in a moment builds on the \nchanges that we have already made but\n\n[[Page S11944]]\n\ngoes further and breaks new ground and perfects the bill even further. \nI am anxious to hear her description of the amendment. I have taken a \nlook at it. It is an excellent amendment.\n  I yield the floor and anxiously await her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from California.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1787 To Amendment No. 1783\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill, my \ncolleague from Ohio. I appreciate his sentiments.\n  Once in a while, by something we do, we can make a tangible and \nimmediate difference in the lives of others. This is one such instance. \nIn this case, what I hope to do is send an amendment to the desk, have \nSenator DeWine's second degree, and then I would like to speak to the \nunderpinnings of this scholarship program, which some people call a \nvoucher program, and my rationale as to why I think this Mayor's \nrequest to try a pilot small voucher program in the District of \nColumbia should be granted.\n  I begin by sending the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1787 to amendment No. 1783.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the DC Student Opportunity Scholarship Program \n                     regarding student assessments)\n\n       On page 31, strike line 13 and all that follows through \n     page 32, line 2, and insert the following:\n       (c) Student Assessments.--The Secretary may not approve an \n     application from an eligible entity for a grant under this \n     title unless the eligible entity's application--\n       (1) ensures that the eligible entity will--\n       (A) assess the academic achievement of all participating \n     eligible students;\n       (B) use the same assessments every school year that are \n     used for school year 2003-2004 by the District of Columbia \n     Public Schools to assess the achievement of District of \n     Columbia public school students under section 1111(b)(3)(A) \n     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 6311(b)(3)(A)), to assess participating eligible \n     students in the same grades as such public school students;\n       (C) provide assessment results and other relevant \n     information to the Secretary or to the entity conducting the \n     evaluation under section 9 so that the Secretary or the \n     entity, respectively, can conduct an evaluation that shall \n     include, but not be limited to, a comparison of the academic \n     achievement of participating eligible students in the \n     assessments described in this subsection to the achievement \n     of--\n       (i) students in the same grades in the District of Columbia \n     public schools; and\n       (ii) the eligible students in the same grades in District \n     of Columbia public schools who sought to participate in the \n     scholarship program but were not selected; and\n       (D) disclose any personally identifiable information only \n     to the parents of the student to whom the information \n     relates; and\n       (2) describes how the eligible entity will ensure that the \n     parents of each student who applies for a scholarship under \n     this title (regardless of whether the student receives the \n     scholarship), and the parents of each student participating \n     in the scholarship program under this title, agree that the \n     student will participate in the assessments used by the \n     District of Columbia Public Schools to assess the achievement \n     of District of Columbia public school students under section \n     1111(b)(3)(A) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(3)(A)), for the period for which \n     the student applied for or received the scholarship, \n     respectively.\n       (d) Independent Evaluation.--The Secretary and Mayor of the \n     District of Columbia shall jointly select an independent \n     entity to evaluate annually the performance of students who \n     received scholarships under the 5-year pilot program under \n     this title, and shall make the evaluations public. The first \n     evaluation shall be completed and made available not later \n     than 9 months after the entity is selected pursuant to the \n     preceding sentence.\n       (e) Teacher Quality.--Each teacher who instructs \n     participating eligible students under the scholarship program \n     shall possess a college degree.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have been in public office for 30 \nyears. I have always supported schools. I supported every charter \namendment, and every bond issue to be helpful to schools. I have \nsupported every vote to increase dollars to schools. I voted to support \ncharter schools, magnet schools, alternative schools. I have campaigned \nfor increasing Title I moneys that go to schools that teach poor \nchildren to try to correct the formula so the money goes where the \nchild goes.\n  As a Mayor for 9 years, 3 of those years I bailed out the school \ndistrict with $3 million a year so that teacher salary increases could \nbe paid during those years. I have traveled to many cities to see what \ninnovative public education programs have been put into play. I have \nnever before supported a voucher program. I do so now with a great \ncommitment to see if this program can succeed. I do so now because \nthose of us who believe strongly in public education--and that is 100 \nMembers of the Senate--have perhaps been too concerned with the \nstructure of education, the rhetoric of education, and not concerned \nenough about what actually works on the streets and in the \nneighborhoods and communities of America.\n  This was brought to my attention 3 years ago when the Mayor of \nOakland, Jerry Brown, called me and said: My schools have deep \ntroubles. There are so many failing youngsters. I want to try something \nnew. I would like to try a military school, all voluntary, aimed to be \ngeared for excellence, college preparatory. I want to have the poorest \nof the poor admitted to this school.\n  I thought about it for a while.\n  He said: I have been turned down by the local board of education. But \nthat is not going to stop me.\n  He went to the State and got a special charter from the State. He \ncame back here and convinced Jerry Lewis in the House, me in the \nSenate, to put some money in a bill to allow him to begin.\n  I spoke to Jerry Brown this morning. I said: Jerry, I want to give \nthe Senate a brief progress report. How is it going in your military \nschool?\n  He said: We have our startup problems, but we are doing pretty well. \nWe have 350 youngsters. Some drop out. We have discipline. We have \nuniforms. We have the National Guard participating. These youngsters, 3 \nyears later, are testing to the equivalent of the second best middle \nschool in Oakland.\n  So it was a new model. It was refused by the educational \nestablishment. But it is working for some youngsters.\n  When I went to public school in San Francisco, there were 350 \nstudents in the school. The class sizes were under 20. There were no \nother languages other than English spoken. That is certainly not the \ncase for the most part in public education today. It has changed \ndramatically. Schools have student populations in the hundreds. Classes \nare way up in numbers. Language has run up to 40 different languages in \na school. The economic and social disparity of this great diverse \nsociety makes teaching in the elementary school grades much more \ndifficult.\n  I have come to believe that if I can make a difference to work for \nnew models in education, I am going to do it. Education is primarily a \nlocal institution. Policy is set by local leaders. The Federal \nGovernment provides maybe 7 percent of educational dollars and most of \nthose through Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n\n  I strongly believe that Mayors should have an input. This Mayor has \nasked for dollars not to be taken from public schools but new dollars: \nnew dollars to be put in public schools, $13 million; new dollars to be \nput in chartered schools, $13 million; and new dollars to try a \nscholarship program to try something different.\n  What he has seen in the District of Columbia is too much failure. \nDespite the fact that each youngster receives $10,852 a year--the third \nhighest in the United States,--despite the fact that of the amount of \nmoney that comes into education, test scores are dismal.\n  Of fourth graders in the District of Columbia schools, only 10 \npercent read proficiently. Of eighth graders, only 12 percent read \nproficiently.\n  Think about what that means. If you are in the eighth grade and you \ncan't read, what good is high school? You can't read to learn. Reading \nis a predicate to learning, just as discipline is a predicate to \nlearning. So these youngsters become doomed.\n  This is not my assessment. This was a national assessment that was \ndone in March of 2000. Of eighth graders, 77 percent are below the \ngrade level in math. Twelve percent are proficient in reading.\n\n[[Page S11945]]\n\n  I am supporting this because the Mayor wants it. I am supporting it \nbecause it is not a precedent. It is a pilot. It is 5 years. The \nvoucher is adequate. It is $7,500. There are 9,049 students in the \nDistrict of Columbia in failing schools.\n  This would cover 2,000 of those youngsters; 2,000 of those youngsters \nwould have an opportunity to have some choice in where they go to \nschool. Would they go to a religious school or a secular school? That \nis up to the parent; it depends on the cost. Some families would be \nable to put in some additional funds, if the private school tuition is \nabove $7,500.\n  But I know for a fact there are plenty of schools where the tuition \nis below the $7,500. As I said in the committee, I helped a youngster \ngo to one of these parochial schools in the District. The tuition is \n$3,800 a year. I have watched her blossom. I have watched the \ndiscipline work for her. I have watched the small classes work for her. \nI have watched the additional time the teacher spends with her work. I \nsee her reading way above grade now. I see her proud of her uniform \nthat she wears, so there is no competition for clothes. It is just one \nmodel.\n  The key thing that comes through to me, as somebody who listens to \naverage people perhaps more than I do the policy wonks when it comes to \neducation, is different models work for different children. We all know \nwith our own children, what works for one child doesn't necessarily \nwork for another. Therefore, what public education needs to do is stop \nworrying about structures and bureaucracies and bigness and worry about \nwhat is not working for these children. What do we do to provide a \ndifferent environment? Do we divide up our campuses in a number of \nsmaller schools? Do we build schools in office buildings--small \nschools, maybe with a hundred youngsters--so children can be closer to \ntheir families? What do we do? What new models do we look at?\n  All this Mayor is saying is these are failing schools. Why should the \npoor child not have the same access as the wealthy child does? That is \nall he is asking for. He is saying let's try it for 5 years, and then \nlet's compare progress and let's see if this model can work for these \nDistrict youngsters.\n  Interestingly enough, I am looking at the list of failing schools, \nand I see four are elementary, four are middle/junior high; and then it \njumps to eight for senior high. What is the lesson in that one \nstatistic? The lesson in that one statistic is if you have four \nelementary schools failing, you are going to add to that in high \nschool; you are going to have more high schools failing and more \ndifficulty in high school.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN FAILING SCHOOLS, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC\n         SCHOOLS, ENROLLMENT FOR SELECTED SCHOOLS AS OF SY 02-03\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          Schools                             Enrollment\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nElementary\n  Bruce-Monroe ES..........................................          370\n  Stanton..................................................          622\n  Wilkinson................................................          508\n  Fletcher-Johnson EC......................................          528\nMiddle/Junior High\n  Evans MS.................................................          259\n  Sousa MS.................................................          420\n  Johnson JHS..............................................          646\n  R.H.

Mr. President, the Mayor has asked for a 5-year \npilot. He said it would be for the less affluent. They are defined by \nfamilies of 4 at 185 percent of poverty. This is a family of 4 that \nearns $34,000 a year, or below, and these children would be given \npriority by lottery to have an opportunity to go to another school. It \nis like a golden key. It gives them an opportunity to try something \nelse. It is voluntary. Nobody is forced to do it. Why is everybody so \nthreatened by it? No one is forced to do it. If a family wants to try \nit, this provides them with that opportunity.\n  Again, these are schools identified for improvement, corrective \naction, or restructuring. That is the language from the bill. And \npriority is given to students and families who lack financial resources \nto take advantage of educational opportunities. That is the language in \nthe bill. So for $7,500 a child, 2,000 youngsters will have an \nopportunity to try this, to see if it makes a difference.\n  It might offer some smaller classes, or uniforms; it might offer more \nattention; it might offer an easier learning environment; it may offer \nbetter discipline. Certainly, there will be some curriculum changes. \nThere will certainly be more emphasis on reading, writing, and \narithmetic--the basics, if you will.\n  Now we have in the Appropriations Committee, thanks to the \naccommodation of Senator DeWine and Senator Judd Gregg, made several \nchanges in the original bill. It was brought to my attention to take a \nlook at the Zelman Supreme Court case. Senator Voinovich mentioned that \nto us. I believe he was Governor of Ohio when Cleveland put forward \nthis program, and it went up to the Supreme Court in a case called \nZelman v. Simmons-Harris. So we took that case and this bill and we \ntried to bring them together so that we added religion to the general \nnondiscrimination clause, which also covers race, color, national \norigin, and sex, and extend the nondiscrimination clause to both \nschools and the entity operating the voucher program. We added language \nclarifying that the bill does not override title VII to ensure that we \ndon't change title VII's provisions permitting religious discrimination \nunder certain circumstances.\n  We deleted certain other language which we thought might impact the \nestablishment clause. We increased the role of the Mayor to make the \nMayor responsible for the details and functioning and accountability of \nthis program, and to ensure the proper use of public funds by the \nschools participating in this voucher program.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk is an additional strengthening \nof the testing and evaluation components of the bill to try to ensure \nthat scholarship students are taught by quality teachers. Essentially \nwhat this bill says is every voucher child must be taught by a teacher \nthat at least has a college education. Additionally, we have changed \nthe testing requirements. I have had a conversation with Cardinal \nMcCarrick. Since about one-third of the private schools in the \nDistricts are Catholic schools, I talked to the Cardinal about the \nadvisability of having the same tests given to a student on a voucher \nin a parochial, or secular school, as would be given to a student in \nthe public school. He agreed that would be a very significant thing to \ndo.\n  I would like to read into the Record a portion of the letter from \nCardinal McCarrick.\n\n       . . . I want to assure you that we are not only open to \n     being accountable for any public funds which the families of \n     our students receive, but anxious to be able to prove the \n     value of our education. This would mean being willing to \n     administer the same set of examinations that are given in the \n     public school system.\n       I was happy to be able to tell you that in the District of \n     Columbia 47% of our students are non-Catholic--\n\n  Forty-seven percent of the students in the DC Catholic schools are \nnon-Catholic--\n\n     and in the heavily impacted inner city areas it goes up to \n     67% or higher. My great predecessor, Cardinal Hickey, used to \n     say that we don't educate them because they are Catholic, but \n     because we are Catholic and we accept this as a \n     responsibility for being good neighbors and committed to \n     serving the community.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Archdiocese of Washington,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: It was good to be able to speak to \n     you on the phone on Friday. I promised to send you this \n     letter to clarify the situation of our Catholic schools in \n     the District of Columbia. First of all, I want to assure you \n     that we are not only open to being accountable for any public \n     funds which the families of our students receive, but anxious \n     to be able to prove the value of our education. This would \n     mean being willing to administer the same set of examinations \n     that are given in the public school system.\n       I was happy to be able to tell you that in the District of \n     Columbia 47% of our students\n\n[[Page S11946]]\n\n     are non-Catholic and in the heavily impacted inner city areas \n     it goes up to 67% or higher. My great predecessor, Cardinal \n     Hickey, used to say that we don't educate them because they \n     are Catholic, but because we are Catholic and we accept this \n     as a responsibility for being good neighbors and committed to \n     serving the community.\n       I am so greatful to you for your concern for the parents of \n     these children. So many of our parents work three jobs and \n     more to be able to afford the education in our schools. The \n     help that this legislation would make available would be such \n     a blessing for them.\n       If there is any further information that you might find \n     useful, please do not hesitate to have your staff contact me.\n       With every good wish and deepest gratitude, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Theodore Cardinal McCarrick,\n                                         Archbishop of Washington.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. We have a provision in this bill that a scholarship \nrecipient would essentially be tested against a control group with the \nsame test given in the public school setting as in the private school \nsetting.\n  The first component of my amendment requires that the managing entity \nthat will run the voucher program give voucher students--not every \nstudent in private school--the same assessments they took in public \nschools. It also requires that the Secretary of Education, in \nconjunction with the Mayor, appoint an independent evaluator to study \nall aspects of the voucher program, with a strong focus on the academic \nprogress of the students in the program.\n  The independent evaluator, which could be a think tank, could be an \nindependent entity, will be required to evaluate the test scores of \nvoucher students over the 5-year period, as well as the scores of a \nrandomly selected group of comparable students who applied for vouchers \nbut did not get them.\n  The test scores of the control group for which no voucher is \navailable will be studied and measured against the scores of the \nvoucher students.\n  The evaluator will be required to report back to the Congress every \nyear on the progress, for the duration of the 5-year pilot. This \namendment also requires that the test scores of both recipients and the \nstudent control group, as I said, would be studied, obviously, against \none another.\n  I think we have a very practical, very doable trial proposal. I know \non this side of the aisle there are a lot of objections to it, and I \nmust say I am deeply puzzled by them because I do not understand what \nthe fear is. Traditionally, the argument against vouchers always has \nbeen it takes money away from the public school. This does not. It adds \nmoney to the public school. Another argument always has been, how do we \nreally know the students will do better? We have the testing and \nevaluation component in place.\n  Finally, the program is restricted to those most in need. These will \nbe the poorest families in DC who will participate. They will all be \nfamilies of four, earning under $34,000 a year. So for 5 years, a child \nwho is not making it, whose parent may be at wit's end, will have an \nopportunity to say, aha, I might be able to get one of those vouchers. \nLet's see if John, Sam, Gloria, or Betty can make it in another \nsetting. In other words, let's try another model for our child.\n  Affluent people do this all the time. Affluent people have that \nopportunity. If their child does not do well in one setting, they can \nplace their child in another setting. Why shouldn't the poor person \nhave that same opportunity? This is the weight of our argument. This is \nthe candor of our argument. I hope this is the caring point of our \nargument, because if this passes, 2,000 children will be able to take \nthat pilot and 5 years from now we will know a lot more than we know \ntoday.\n  I have gotten a lot of flak because I am supporting it. And guess \nwhat. I do not care. I have finally reached the stage in my career, I \ndo not care. I am going to do what I sincerely believe is right. I have \nspent the time. I have gone to the schools, I have seen what works, I \nhave seen what does not work. Believe it or not, I have always been \nsort of a political figure for the streets as opposed to the policy \nwonks. I know different things work on the streets that often do not \nwork on the bookshelves. So we will see. It is kind of interesting.\n  I have a member of my own staff who I do not think was very much in \nfavor of me trying this, but at one point she came up to me and said: I \nmust tell you something. I grew up in Anacostia. My parents could \nafford to send me to a Catholic school, and I went to that school. I \nsaw so many of my peers get into such trouble and it conditioned the \nwhole remainder of their life. Now today, she is a distinguished \nattorney with a solid career and a solid job.\n  My concern in education has always been K-6. It has always been \nteaching the basic fundamentals to kids so they could go on and learn, \nbecause if they do not have the basic fundamentals, it is so \nhumiliating.\n  As mayor, I used to go out to Bayview Hunter's Point every Monday. I \nspent the afternoon with children. I talked to children. It took me 6 \nmonths to get them to look me in the eye, to be able to pronounce their \nnames, to be able to talk directly to another human being. It took the \ntime, the energy, and the effort. Through no fault of their own, in \nmany cases our public institutions are so overburdened, with so many \ndifferent issues, that it is difficult to provide everything for every \nchild. Obviously, some children need more than they are getting.\n  I hope there will be others on my side of the aisle who will give \nthis program a chance. I believe it will meet the test of \nconstitutionality. I believe it is a bona fide pilot. I intend to stay \nwith it and see what happens and see that the evaluation and the \ntesting is adequate and carried out correctly and see what we learn for \nthe future for our children.\n  Once again, I thank Senator DeWine for his courtesy in working with \nme. He really has been terrific and I appreciate it very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for a \nwonderful speech, but, more important than that, for her commitment to \nthe children of the District of Columbia. Her position on this issue is \nso typical of her career and what I have seen her do during the time I \nhave been in the Senate, during the time I have served with her. That \nis, she does not necessarily take the conventional position. She \nstudies issues. She goes out and looks at the issue. She goes out and \nsees what the issues are and tries to understand them. As she says, she \nlistens to the street. She listens to the people. She finds out what is \ngoing on, and that clearly is what she has done in this particular \ncase.\n  Again, as I have said on this floor before, I applaud her. I applaud \nher for her contribution to this bill. This is a better bill than it \nwould have been but for the Senator from California. I thank her for \nher contribution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I say one more thing? Will the Senator yield to \nme for a moment?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield to my colleague from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. First of all, again, I thank the Senator. It has been \na great pleasure for me to work with him. I really appreciate it.\n  I have just been alerted that the Mayor is here. I understand the \nMayor of the District of Columbia can come on the floor of the Senate. \nI believe very strongly, because mayors run their cities, they are \nresponsible. Yet, in education, it is very often so frustrating because \nthey do not have control. This is the Mayor who wants to leave a legacy \nof an improved education system for the District.\n  Those of us who read the Washington Post this morning, and the \nMayor's comments addressed, I guess, to the editorial board of the \nWashington Post, understand the frustration. I have always been one who \nhad a great appreciation for Dick Daley, of Chicago, who went to the \nState legislature and said: Give me control of appointment of the \nschool board. And they did. He appointed some of his people to the \nschool board and turned around the Chicago public schools. I think in a \nway that has set a real pattern for public education in America. I had \nthe privilege of visiting those schools and spending a day in Chicago.\n  I ask consent that the Mayor be allowed to come on the floor of the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Mayor of the District of Columbia is \nauthorized to be on the floor of the Senate under the rules.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S11947]]\n\n  Just to continue on for a moment, I think what's going to happen in \nAmerica is that more mayors of big cities will get more control over \nthe schools, whether it is by appointing the school board or whether it \nis by having a separate entity involved in it. In the case of Chicago, \nI remember the Mayor appointed his chief of staff as head of the school \nboard and his budget person, Paul G. Vallas, as superintendent of \npublic instruction. So they had a working team to really turn the \npublic school system around.\n  I would like to welcome the Mayor of the District of Columbia to the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Welcome, Mr. Mayor. Thank you very much.\n  I want everybody to know this is your request and your program. I \ndon't know how many votes on our side of the aisle we will have for it, \nbut I think it is a very important program to try. I think it is very \nimportant. I think because of the testing we have built into it, the \nsame tests, the evaluation component, the fact is that your feet are \ngoing to be to the fire because this is your program and it is going to \nsucceed or fail based on your energy, your staying power, your drive, \nyour motivation. And I know it is there.\n  To the Presiding Officer, and to the manager of the bill, I have made \nmy arguments. I am happy to answer any questions there may be, but I am \nhopeful this amendment will be agreed to and we will have an \nopportunity to try this pilot program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Ohio \ngiving me the opportunity to speak at a time while the Senator from \nCalifornia is still in the Chamber and the Mayor of the District of \nColumbia is still here.\n  I greatly respect the leadership shown by the Mayor of the District \nof Columbia and by the Senator from California, who are willing to take \na fresh look at children who need help. This leadership is based upon \ntheir own experiences and common sense, and wisdom to try something \ndifferent.\n  I listened very carefully to the Senator from California. I was \nthinking the Senate is a good place for someone with a lot of \nexperiences on the street and in the Mayor's office, in political \ncampaigns, and in legislative bodies. She is someone who has enough \nexperience to come to her own conclusions.\n  This is a terribly important decision. It would not even be before us \nif the Mayor and other local officials in the District of Columbia had \nnot asked for it because too many of the changes that have been \nsuggested in education are often suggested in the tone of: This is good \nfor you. But, it rarely ever happens unless somebody says: I want this \nfor my child, or my school district.\n  I remember in Milwaukee 15 years ago, there was a strange confluence \nof circumstances that led Milwaukee to try to give the poorest families \nin the city more choices of school for their children. It only happened \nbecause Polly Williams, who was the State representative and was the \nleader of Jesse Jackson's campaign in Wisconsin, and the Democratic \nmayor of Milwaukee, and the Republican Governor, Governor--now \nSecretary--Thompson, all happened to come to the same conclusion. They \nall thought outside the box. They all did things that were different.\n  But the person that really made the most difference, with great \nrespect to the mayor and with great respect to the Governor at that \ntime, was Polly Williams, who represented parents who said: I want this \nfor my child.\n  What we are hearing today in the Senate, and what the Senator from \nCalifornia has so beautifully stated, and the Mayor has brought to our \nattention, is that we have several thousand families in the District of \nColumbia who are saying to us: We want this for our child. We see the \nresults. We see the figures the Senator from California cited: In \neighth grade only a few children are reading at the eighth grade level, \nso few children are able to do math, this lack of academic success is \nalmost a guarantee of a lack of success in life.\n  I was glad I had the assignment of being the Presiding Officer at the \ntime when the Senator from California made her speech. I wanted to add \nto that in a couple of ways.\n  I think she beautifully distinguished between this proposal and a \nbroad voucher program. We have argued those up and down the street for \nyears. But here is what the Senator from California reminded us is \ndifferent about this proposal:\n  No. 1, the Mayor wants it. If we were in a State, if we were in the \nState of California, or Tennessee, or Ohio, the money we are talking \nabout would really be the State's money; in effect, it would be money \nthe State was spending the way the State wanted to spend it. We just \nhappen to be in the District of Columbia where the money is collected a \nlittle differently. This is money that local people really ought to be \nable to decide how to spend, and they want to spend it this way. That \nis one big difference.\n  The Senator from California said this is a pilot program. One might \nargue that there is not such a thing in Federal Government; that every \nprogram lasts forever. But it doesn't have to last forever. This is a \nchance to try to give 2,000 poor children from failing schools one \noption to see if they can succeed in their educational life.\n  We don't have many pilot programs with this idea. We have one in \nMilwaukee where it worked well, I thought. I have been to those \nschools. We learned a lot. We have some programs in Ohio, which the \nPresiding Officer helped to implement.\n  In the Nation's Capital, it might be good to have a look and see \nwhether this idea works or not. The Senator from California suggested \nin her amendment some provisions which will help make sure that it gets \na fair test--requiring scholarship students to take tests similar to \nother students in the District, requiring the Secretary of Education \nand the Mayor to select an independent entity for evaluation, and to \nsay that the teachers of these children who are on scholarships should \nbe as well qualified as possible. Those are very sensible additions.\n  The Mayor wants it. It is a pilot program. And it helps 2,000 of the \npoorest children in failing schools by giving them $7,500 a year of new \nmoney. This comes from no other educational program. If it is not spent \nfor this, it goes right back into the Federal budgets. It is new money \nto give them that choice.\n  Pilot programs and studies sometimes help us learn things. For \nexample, Vanderbilt University did a very interesting report that was \npublished in September of 2001.\n  The Senator from California and the Mayor of the District of Columbia \nmight be interested in this, too. They took a group of schools, all of \nwhich have the characteristics of potential failing schools. In this \ngroup of schools, 35 percent of the students changed school every year, \nand 50 percent of the students qualified for free or reduced-price \nlunches.\n  The parents of the children in those schools had a modest education \nthemselves. It is a recipe for failure when compared to most of our \nschools. Yet in these schools--instead of having only 1 of 10 or 1 of \n20 8th graders who score proficient in math or reading, these schools \nare first in the country and second in the country among African-\nAmerican students, according to the National Assessment for Educational \nProgress in Math and Reading.\n  What schools are these? These are the schools on the military bases \nacross the country. All of us can speculate as to why that is true. \nThere might be more discipline in a military school or military \nenvironment. Another one might be that the school reports to the \ncommanding officer of the base.\n  The Senator from California has just increased the accountability of \nthe schools in these scholarship programs by saying the Mayor is \ndirectly responsible. The Mayor of the District of Columbia is going to \nbe paying attention to these schools and these scholarship kids.\n  There is another thing we might learn from this study of the \nmilitary. There is one other provision which I found very interesting. \nAt the military post schools where the military children who live on \nthe base go to school, parents must go to the parent-teacher \nconference. They don't have a choice. They can be court-marshaled if \nthey don't go. They are ordered to go. I guess that might be the single \nmost important thing.\n  If this education has all of these aspects--and everyone is an \nexpert. Everybody has 1,000 ideas. There are two\n\n[[Page S11948]]\n\nthings we know for absolute sure. The thing that makes the most \ndifference in a child's education is the parent and the second thing is \nthe teacher. Everything else all added up into a lump counts for \nrelatively little compared to those first two.\n  It might be that if there are 2,000 families who go to the trouble of \nhelping their kids move from a failing school into another school that \nthese parents will have increased parental involvement. This might be \nwhat makes the difference in terms of their child's success. But we \ndon't know that unless we try to find out, which we can do over the \nnext 5 years if we support the Senator's amendment and then we support \nthe bill that is reported.\n\n  There are a couple of other things I would like to say. The Senator \nfrom California said that she has lived long enough to do what she \nthought was right and that she was puzzled by the opposition to this \nprogram. I have to admit that I am puzzled, too. On my side of the \naisle, I am not always in lockstep with all of the Republican ideas \nthat come along because I have lived long enough to make up my own mind \nabout things.\n  But on the idea of saying that poor children shouldn't have the same \nchoices of schools that middle-income and rich kids have, I have never \nreally understood the opposition. It has always puzzled me.\n  Let me give an example of why. This is not some idea from the Moon. \nThe idea of giving families choices in educational institutions has \nbeen the single most successful social program we have ever had in our \ncountry's history. Most people would say that the GI bill after World \nWar II has been our most successful social program. What happened after \nWorld War II?\n  At a time when only 5 or 10 percent of Americans were going to \ncollege, the Government said to the veterans: When you come home, to \npay you back, we are going to give you a scholarship to go wherever you \nwant to go to school. They said: You may go to Berkeley. You may take \nthis money to Fisk University. You might go to Hastings in California. \nYou can to Vanderbilt, you can go to the University of Tennessee, you \ncan go to Ohio State, or to Notre Dame, or Kenyon. You can go to \nYeshiva. You can go to a Brigham Young University. Wherever you want to \ngo you can go to an accredited university.\n  A great many of the veterans returning from World War II used their \nGI bills to go to high schools. Many of them went to Catholic high \nschools. At that time, we began to allow Government scholarships to \nfollow students to the educational institutions of their choice.\n  At that time, about 20 percent of our higher educational institutions \nwere public. About 80 percent of the students went to private schools.\n  It sounds strange today because now we have big public universities. \nIn Ohio you had all of those wonderful institutions--Miami, Kenyon, \nOberlin--all the colleges in Ohio. And Ohio State wasn't all that big \nat the end of World War II. A lot of the colleges that are universities \ntoday were just small teachers colleges.\n  What has been the effect of allowing Federal dollars to follow \nstudents to the educational institution of their choice since World War \nII? What happened is that it has created more opportunities for \nAmericans more than any other program we have ever passed. It has \ncreated not just some of the best universities in the world but almost \nall of the best universities in the world. It continues today in the \nform of the Federal Pell grant and the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. \nOne-half or more of students who go to colleges or universities in \nCalifornia or in Ohio or in Tennessee go to college with a Federal \ngrant or with a loan following them to the college or university of \ntheir choice.\n  When I was president of the University of Tennessee, it never \noccurred to me to come to the Senate and say: Senator DeWine, I hope \nyou will pass a law that keeps Federal dollars from following a \nTennessee student to Vanderbilt or to Fisk or to Maryville College or \nCarson-Newman College or Howard University or Brigham Young or Yeshiva \nbecause they are private, public, or parochial. It never occurred to \nme. I wanted the students to have all of those choices. It helped them \nand it helped our university.\n  If we have the tradition of choice in America, and if we have 60 \nyears of funding educational institutions by allowing the money to \nfollow the student to the school of their choice, it has always puzzled \nme as to why we exempt grade schools and high schools. We even allow \nFederal scholarships to let money follow preschoolers to Head Start or \nthe child care program of their choice. Many States allow juniors and \nseniors in high school to let money follow them to the college of their \nchoice.\n\n  We have gotten in this rut, and it is not clear how we got there but \nsome people are determined to keep it forever. The ones paying the \nprice are the poor kids of America.\n  We just finished what has turned out to be a very unpopular set of \ntests in Tennessee and America, the leave no child behind test. In our \nState, some of the superintendents and teachers were up in arms. They \nsaid: We are not a failing school.\n  I said: I would not get too proud or too embarrassed about the scores \nin Tennessee or California because all the leave no child behind tests \nare demonstrating is what we already know, which is that in most of our \nschools in America, even some of our finest schools, there are some \nchildren who are not learning to read. They are not learning to \ncompute. Almost all of those children are disadvantaged.\n  We can ignore that and adopt a new slogan that says leave no more \nthan 35 percent of our children behind and go right on to decide to try \nsome other things.\n  As the Senator from California said, one thing we could try is to \nallow the District of Columbia to spend its money helping 2,000 of \nthose children who are poor and in failing schools, help them go to a \nschool of their parents' choice and see whether that helps.\n  Some people say the school choice plan is a think-tank plan, maybe a \nconservative plan, maybe even a Republican plan. It is none of that. \nLet me give an example. One of the most distinguished educators in \nAmerica is a man named Ted Sizer, at Harvard University, a graduate \nstudent during the Lyndon Johnson days. He was a ``power to the \npeople,'' Johnson liberal Democrat. As his graduate degree thesis in \nthe late 1960s, Ted Sizer published a proposal called ``The Poor Kids \nBill of Rights.'' The idea was that part of the war on poverty, under \nthe LBJ programs, the Federal Government should give $5,000, in 1969 \ndollars, to every poor kid--he defined poor as middle income or below; \nwhich meant half the kids--give $5,000 to half the children in America \nand let it follow them to the school of their choice.\n  That proposal came out of the 1960s from Ted Sizer, out of Harvard, \nout of Lyndon Johnson's philosophy. It is as true to that philosophy as \nit is to Milton Friedman's philosophy.\n  I like better what the Senator from California said. She was not so \ninterested in a philosophy. She was interested in parents and kids on \nthe street. That is who we should be listening to. If the Mayor and the \nchairman of the city school board say: We have tried everything. We are \nspending $11,000 per kid; we are putting more money into charter \nschools; we are improving our schools, but we have all these children \nwho are not learning to read, could we not try to give them a chance to \ngo to some of the same schools that they could go to if their parents \nhad some money? That is all they are saying.\n  I am very glad to have been here today to hear the Senator from \nCalifornia address the Senate. I am glad she is here to make a \ndifference. I am glad the District of Columbia Mayor is here to make a \ndifference too.\n  Everyone, after being here for a while, looks to the end of their \ncareers and wonders what it will look like when looking back. My guess \nis when the Senator from California and the Mayor of the District of \nColumbia look back--these decisions, which are courageous in a \npolitical sense, are decisions they will take great pride in years to \ncome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to support the inclusion of the \nDistrict of Columbia School Choice Program contained within the fiscal \nyear 2004 District of Columbia appropriations bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to defeat any attempt to weaken or remove the program.\n\n[[Page S11949]]\n\n  I also rise to support the amendment of Senator Feinstein which \nstrengthens that provision in the appropriations bill.\n  First of all, I applaud the efforts of my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. DeWine, for his efforts to expand school choice for the \nparents and schools of the District. I also applaud the leadership of \nSenator Gregg moving this issue forward. I also applaud Senator \nFeinstein for her courageous support of this program and her very \nthoughtful amendment to the amendment to the appropriations bill.\n  My father, a first generation American, used to say that America \nenjoys more of the world's bounty than any other nation because of the \nfree enterprise system and our educational system. This is true today \nas it was years ago. It we expect to remain competitive in the world \nmarketplace and maintain our standard of living, this country needs to \nrededicate itself to the free enterprise and most importantly our \neducational system.\n  Some in Congress believe rededicating ourselves to this Nation's \neducational system means simply throwing more money at the issue, \nclosing our eyes, hoping it will solve itself.\n  If spending alone ensured a quality education, the District would be \none of the best school systems in the Nation. For the school year that \nended June 2001, the District spent an average of $10,852 per student. \nThat is the third highest in the Nation. However, the 2002 national \nassessment of educational progress showed fourth grade students in the \nDistrict held the lowest scores for writing and tied with Los Angeles \nfor the lowest score in reading. That means 27 percent of fourth \ngraders in the District scored below the basic level in writing, and 69 \npercent tested below the basic level in reading.\n  What a dismal message on the state of education for the families who \nlive in the shining city on the hill, the Nation's Capital. What a \nterrible record to send throughout the country and the world.\n  We, in Congress, are obligated to do more to help the children in our \nNation's Capital. I have often said that the greatest thing one could \ndo for their fellow human being is to help them fully develop their \nGod-given talents so they can take care of themselves, their families, \nand make a contribution to society. We need to empower families and \nchildren with more than just additional funding.\n  When I was first elected Governor of Ohio in 1990, I pledged to the \npeople that I would draw a line in the sand for this generation of \nchildren in Ohio by making their health education my administration's \ntop priority. As I look back, I am proud of that record in Ohio. When I \nleft the Governor's mansion in 1998 for the Senate, Ohio led the Nation \nin State funding for Head Start. Every eligible child whose parents \nwanted them in a Head Start Program, early education had a place for \nthem. Many of these Head Start facilities were sponsored by religious \norganizations and located on the premises of religious organizations.\n  We were among the Nation's leaders in providing health care for \nuninsured children. Ohio increased funding for children and family \nprograms by 47 percent while holding State spending to its lowest rate \nin 30 years. These actions and accomplishments were rooted in the \nbelief that future generations of Ohioans would be served by a \ngovernment that strived to empower families.\n\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, education begins with a family. A \nparent must be a child's first teacher. It was in this context that \nOhio became one of the first States to undertake the challenges of \nimplementing school choice. My colleagues in the Senate know how \ntumultuous a battle that program faced. It went on for years and \nfinally ended up in the Supreme Court.\n  At the beginning of the Cleveland scholarship program, we provided \n2,000 scholarships to children in grades kindergarten through third \ngrade that would follow them through the eighth grade. Depending on the \nfamily's income level, the State paid between 75 and 90 percent of the \ncost of education. The scholarship amount did not exceed $2,250, which \nprovided a significant portion of the tuition at one of the \nparticipating nonpublic schools in Cleveland. The State also provided \nan equal number of $500 tutoring grants to those students who did not \nreceive scholarships but whose parents felt they needed additional help \nfor their children.\n  The response to our program was overwhelming. The State received \nnearly 7,000 applications from Cleveland parents. More than half of the \napplicants were from households dependent on welfare, and half were \nfrom minorities. It was evident from the sheer number of applicants \nthat parents were demanding options that the Cleveland Scholarship \nProgram provided.\n  Today, the program has expanded. Effective July 1, 2003, students who \nhad previously received a scholarship are now eligible to receive a \nscholarship for grade 9 in the 2003-2004 school year. And beginning in \nthe 2004-2005 school year, a student who received a scholarship in the \n9th grade will be eligible to receive a scholarship in the 10th grade. \nWe are moving them along. Additionally, the scholarship amount has \nincreased. The capped tuition for the 2003-2004 school year is now \n$3,000.\n  From its humble beginnings in 1996, with 2,000 students, and total \nscholarships of $2.9 million, the program has more than doubled its \nenrollment. Today it covers some 5,200 students. Additionally, total \nscholarship amounts have increased to almost $10 million.\n  Since 1998, Indiana University's Center for Evaluation has been \nconducting longitudinal studies regarding the Cleveland Scholarship \nProgram. So we have been watching it. We put the money out so we could \nwatch how this thing has progressed.\n  In its most recent study, the center found that students who have \nparticipated in the Cleveland Scholarship Program since kindergarten \nhave achieved significantly higher levels than public school students \nin reading and language skills.\n  I would also like to call my colleagues' attention to the results of \nan evaluation of the Cleveland voucher program that was conducted 2 \nyears after it began by Paul Peterson of Harvard University.\n  In his study, Dr. Peterson found that parents of voucher recipients \nwere consistently more satisfied with many aspects of their child's \neducation than were parents of students in the Cleveland Public \nSchools. From the quality of academic programs to school discipline, \nteachers' skills, class size, and so forth, parents whose children were \nparticipants in the Cleveland Scholarship Program showed greater \nsatisfaction and enthusiasm than did parents in the Cleveland Public \nSchool System.\n  The Cleveland Scholarship Program is merely one component of a \nrenewal in our education system that needs to occur. I do not stand \nbefore the Senate and claim it is a cure-all for all troubled school \ndistricts. I think it is very important. Those of us who are supporting \nSenator DeWine's and Senator Feinstein's amendment are not claiming \nthis is going to be the cure-all for troubled school districts. What we \nare saying is that it is another option on the education smorgasbord. \nAnd as the Presiding Officer so eloquently stated, why not look at some \nother programs that are out there? A business that is not doing very \nwell starts to look at itself saying: What are other things we could be \ndoing? Let's do some research and development. Let's look at some new \nideas. Let's try something else.\n  I must tell you, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs subcommittee \nwith jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, I support this as one \nof many options. We need to expand our vision. Instead of putting on \nour blinders, let's look at some other programs. The legislation offers \nthe positive step toward empowering parents in the District by \nincreasing their involvement in their child's education and offering \nthem more choices.\n\n  Families in the District of Columbia have limited opportunity for \nchoice in their children's education, and families have wholeheartedly \nembraced school choice. In 1996, the first charter schools opened in \nthe District. The 39 charter schools operating in the District of \nColumbia only educate 1 in 7 children in the District. That is 15 \npercent of the students. Hundreds--hundreds--are on waiting lists.\n  Additionally, the Washington Scholarship Fund, a private, nonprofit \norganization, that provides scholarships for economically disadvantaged \nfamilies, received over 7,500 applications for 1,000 available \nscholarships. It is clear that the parents of children in the District \nof Columbia want more options.\n\n[[Page S11950]]\n\n  When I came to the Senate, I said I would not mandate a scholarship \nprogram on any jurisdiction; they had to want it. It is clear to me \nthat the District of Columbia wants this. And it is just as clear that \nthe District is within the responsibility of the Congress. They are our \nresponsibility. We are not mandating every school district in America. \nWe are increasing options for families in the District of Columbia.\n  Some would contend this is going to be running throughout the United \nStates of America. We are concentrating our attention on our \nresponsibility: the city on the hill, the Nation's Capital--our \nresponsibility. And we are saying we want to give the parents of those \nchildren more options.\n  The most important thing is that this proposal for fiscal year 2004 \nhas been drafted in consultation with and has the approval of Mayor \nAnthony Williams--I have talked to him about it; he is passionate about \nit--Council Member Kevin Chavous, chair of the Council's Committee of \nEducation, Libraries, and Recreation; and Ms. Peggy Cooper Cafritz, \npresident of the DC Board of Education. They are for this. They want \nthis for their children. They are asking us for it.\n  The bill also contains $13 million for charter schools and $13 \nmillion for public schools to assist them with requirements under No \nChild Left Behind for teacher recruitment, training, and similar \nprograms. Combined, the funds for these three programs represent the \nlargest Federal contribution to the District of Columbia in the history \nof this country.\n  Unfortunately, the debate is not focused on the $39 million in new \nfunds for the District. Oh, no. It is on the $13 million being \nconsidered for the scholarships. The proposed scholarship program would \nbe authorized for 5 years, giving Congress the opportunity to monitor \nand evaluate the progress of schools and students--5 years. Let's watch \nit, just as we did in Cleveland with the longitudinal studies. Let's \nsee how it works out. It would be overseen by the District of Columbia \nand the U.S. Secretary of Education.\n  Finally, it is a scholarship program that will help the neediest \nfamilies in the District, the ones about whom the Presiding Officer so \neloquently spoke. Eligible students are children attending low-\nperforming public schools and whose household incomes do not exceed 200 \npercent of the poverty level. We are talking about a relatively small \nnumber of students. I think it is something like 2,000 students \nwho would be eligible for the program.\n\n  I would like to stress to my colleagues that this is all new Federal \nmoney for students in the District of Columbia. Let me repeat: This is \nall new money. These scholarships are one piece of a larger proposal to \naddress the educational needs in Washington, DC.\n  Certainly there is a role for Congress to play. We in Congress have \nincreasingly recognized the need for the Federal Government to serve as \nthe State for the District, a necessity considering the unique \nrelationship between the District of Columbia and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  For example, just 4 years ago, I was the chief sponsor in the Senate \nof the DC Tuition Assistance Grant Program, which was enacted in 1999. \nThis program provides grants for students graduating from DC high \nschools to attend public universities and colleges nationwide at in-\nState tuition rates. In other words, we put the students in the \nDistrict in the same position as if they lived in the State of \nTennessee or the State of Ohio. There is a subsidy by the State so they \ncould go on and get higher education.\n  It also provides smaller grants for students to attend private \ninstitutions in the DC metropolitan area and private historically black \ncolleges and universities nationwide. So we have expanded it beyond \njust public. We now have private and historically black colleges \nincluded. This program has been enormously successful.\n  There is one final point I would like to discuss. Critics of \nscholarships argue that scholarships are ways for private schools, \nespecially religious schools, to get rich quick. Incredible, just \nincredible. It is not true. As my colleagues may know, tuition for a \nstudent does not cover the full cost of educating a child. The \ndifference currently is made up by private donations.\n  Many schools in the District run by the Archdiocese of Washington are \nstruggling financially and would not be able to support a large influx \nof students. The Archdiocese estimates needing an additional $5 million \nin the first year alone, should the Archdiocese fill all open seats in \ntheir schools with students on scholarships. It basically means, if \nthey opened their doors and took advantage of the scholarship program, \nfor them to do that, they would have to go out and find $5 million \nsomeplace in order to educate these children.\n  It is the same thing in the city of Cleveland, with our nonpublic \nschools. We have hundreds of low-income kids who are not Catholic who \nare attending Catholic schools. My mother was a volunteer librarian at \none of them where 70 percent of the kids were non-Catholic. There was \nnot any proselytizing going on.\n  The reason they opened their doors is they believed in the two great \ncommandments--love of God and love of fellow man. They believed the \nbest way they could witness their faith is by reaching out and making a \ndifference in the lives of these children, developing their God-given \ntalents so they can take care of themselves and their families and make \na contribution to society.\n  I will never forget one of those students was a player on the Ohio \nState football team. He was a big center. He went to the school where \nmy mom was a librarian. I went out there to one of their practices. He \nalmost picked me up, and he looked at me and said: Are you Mrs. \nVoinovich's son?\n  I said: Yes, I am.\n  And he talked about the wonderful experience he had at St. Aloysius \nand the difference it made in his life so he could go on to high school \nand get a scholarship to play football.\n  This is what we are talking about. Why anyone would deny a student in \nthe District the opportunity that students have had in the city of \nCleveland and other places throughout the United States is simply \nbeyond me. It is not the end of the world, if this is adopted. That is \nridiculous. This is a small experiment to give people an option in \ntheir children's education.\n  Over the years it was argued that the Cleveland scholarship program \nwas unconstitutional. I argued it was constitutional. I am not going to \nmake that argument because the Presiding Officer made it in his \npresentation just before me, in terms of kids having money. The money \ngoes to them, and then they can go wherever they want to go. That is in \nthe American tradition. That is how thousands of Americans got their \ncollege education through the GI bill. The Supreme Court, on June 27, \n2002, upheld the Cleveland scholarship program. When they did that, I \nlabeled it a victory for hope. We have seen wonderful successes in \nCleveland of children excelling in school, when the doors of \nopportunity were opened and parents could choose to offer what they \nbelieved is the best education. I believe all families deserve those \noptions. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation for the \nfamilies in our Nation's capital.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as a member of the DC Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I thank Senator DeWine and Senator Landrieu and their \nstaffs for their hard work on this important legislation.\n  This is never an easy bill. I have been ranking member of this \nsubcommittee in years gone by. It appears every Senator or Congressman, \nwhoever in their weakest moment or wildest dreams wanted to be a mayor \nor a member of a city council, decides they can play the role when it \ncomes to the DC appropriations bill. Thank goodness for Delegate \nEleanor Holmes Norton who has stood fast year after weary year, beating \noff every assault on home rule with some success and a few setbacks. \nBut this bill is a tough one. It is always a tough one.\n  Members of Congress will do on this bill what they wouldn't dare do \nin their own districts or State. They will force on the District of \nColumbia things they would never even consider doing at home. They \nthink it is easy. This is an area of America which, sadly, does not \nhave a vote in Congress nor in the Senate. Frankly, they don't have to \nanswer to the voters of the State. So\n\n[[Page S11951]]\n\nwhen it comes to experimenting and doing what you would never suggest \nat home, it is usually the DC appropriations bill that becomes that \nlaboratory, that political playground.\n  Senators DeWine and Landrieu, with very few exceptions, have done \ntheir level best to make certain this year's appropriations bill did \nnot deteriorate into that particular situation. I want to take a few \nminutes to underscore that there is much in this District of Columbia \nspending bill that merits our collective endorsement.\n\n  As has been outlined, this bill provides $545 million in Federal \nfunds, the bulk of which will fund the District of Columbia Courts, \nDefender Services, and the Court Services and Offender Supervision \nAgency, CSOSA, for the District of Columbia.\n  Since the enactment of the District of Columbia Revitalization Act of \n1997, these three entities are funded entirely by Federal \nappropriations. The Revitalization Act made substantial changes in the \nfinancial relationship between the Federal Government and the District \nof Columbia and in management of the DC government.\n  Under revitalization, the Federal Government's cash contributions to \nthe District budget were substantially reduced. In exchange, financial \nresponsibility for several governmental functions was transferred from \nthe District's budget to the Federal Government.\n  This year additional resources are being provided to the DC courts to \nintegrate the 18 different computer systems that track offender and \nlitigant information. In addition, the bill provides an increase of \n$6.8 million over the President's budget request which will allow CSOSA \nto enhance its supervision of high-risk sex offenders, offenders with \nmental health problems, and domestic violence offenders.\n  In addition, the bill continues level funding for the DC resident \ntuition program, a very successful initiative Congress established in \n1999 which permits DC high school graduates to attend out of State \nschools at in-State tuition rates.\n  Among other items, the bill also provides Federal funding for \nhospital bioterrorism preparedness; for security costs related to the \npresence of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia; for \nsupport of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative; and for the Children's \nNational Medical Center.\n  It is important to recognize and emphasize that about 93 percent of \nthe funds contained in this bill--fully $7.43 billion, $6.33 billion in \noperating expenses plus $1.1 billion in capital outlay funds--are not \nFederal funds, but locally-generally revenue which must be approved by \nCongress before the mayor can execute his budget and begin spending \nthese local funds.\n  The District of Columbia does not enjoy autonomy over the local \nportion of its budget but must await a congressional imprimatur. \nSenator Susan Collins has introduced bipartisan legislation designed to \nchange that, which I hope we will have an opportunity to consider \nduring this session of Congress.\n  Senator DeWine and Senator Landrieu have collaborated on producing a \nthoughtful product. We owe them a debt of gratitude for tenaciously \njuggling municipal needs, amid Federal funding constraints.\n  I have been in their shoes as either chairman or ranking member of \nthe District of Columbia Subcommittee and was honored to serve. I \nquickly learned from that experience that while the DC spending bill is \ntechnically the smallest of the 13 appropriations bills we consider \neach year, it usually is among the more contentious ones.\n  The issue before us is the issue of school vouchers. It is not just \nanother debate about another DC appropriations measure. If this is \nadopted, it will be the first time in the history of the United States \nthat the Federal Government will pay for private school vouchers in \ngrades K through 12.\n  This issue was brought up a few years ago when President Bush \nsuggested sweeping reform of public education and some of his allies \nsaid: Let's put in school vouchers for private schools at the same \ntime.\n  In the Senate we took a vote on that issue. If I am not mistaken, the \nvote was 41 in favor of school vouchers, 58 opposed. I raise that vote \nbecause it will be of interest to see what happens now when this issue \ngoes beyond a national program and is confined to the District of \nColumbia. I suspect many of those who said ``we don't want school \nvouchers in our State'' are going to say ``but we will allow them to \nhave school vouchers in the District of Columbia.'' That is \nunfortunate. It reflects an attitude toward the District of Columbia \nwhich is not complimentary. Mayor Williams is here on the floor with \nDelegate Norton. I respect him very much. We agree on much more than we \ndisagree, though we disagree on this particular issue. He was treated \nwith a Faustian bargain. Here was the bargain the Republicans offered \nto him. They said: If we give you $13 million for your public schools \nthat you had not anticipated and $13 million for your charter schools \nthat you had not anticipated, will you sit still for and embrace and \nendorse and help us pass the first federally funded voucher program for \nprivate schools in America?\n  The District of Columbia struggles with a lot of spending problems. \nThere are a lot of reasons for it I will not go into. I know he must \nhave looked at this long and hard and thought: This is something I will \nhave to agree to. To get $26 million for public schools and charter \nschools, I am going to support the Republican voucher program.\n  That, unfortunately, was the decision he made. I say \n``unfortunately'' because my respect for him has not diminished, but I \nam concerned that the decision he made for the District of Columbia is \na departure from where the District of Columbia has been year after \nyear when this appropriations bill has come up. For year after year the \nDistrict of Columbia has said to Congress, respect home rule. Let us \nmake our own decisions. Now this year they have done 180 degrees. The \nMayor has said: When it comes to our schools, which is the \nresponsibility of DC local government, we are going to allow the \nFederal Government--in this case the Congress--to create a school \nscholarship program, vouchers for private schools.\n  DC could have done this on their own. They could have done it over \nthe years. They didn't. There was a reason they didn't. It isn't that \nthey didn't consider the possibility of vouchers for private schools. \nThey considered it and voted on it and overwhelmingly voted against it. \nThe residents of the District of Columbia, in referendum, \noverwhelmingly opposed vouchers for private education, overwhelmingly \nopposed diverting public money from public schools into private \nschools. That is what the people think about the concept.\n  It isn't confined to that concept. The Mayor's own city council \nopposes this, and the elected members of the school board also oppose \nit. But the Mayor and the president of the school board support it. \nThey have entered into this bargain with the Republicans to go forward \nwith a voucher program, the first federally funded diversion of public \nfunds from public schools to private schools in the history of the \nUnited States.\n  It is momentous. What is particularly noteworthy is that this measure \ncomes to us not after committee hearings, deliberation, a markup \nprocess with amendments, but comes to us, frankly, in a package in this \nappropriations bill which we are now changing with some drama on the \nfloor of the Senate even as I speak.\n  Senator Feinstein of California came forward with an amendment. She \nhad made it clear in the Senate Appropriations Committee that she \nsupported the voucher plan for the District of Columbia. Many of us \npointed out in that hearing some deficiencies in this plan. Understand, \nwe were given this voucher program in the Appropriations Committee \nwhere we don't usually entertain anything of that complexity--not that \nit isn't done, but it is done rarely--and we were given it on a take-\nit-or-leave-it basis. As we considered what was proposed to us, a lot \nof questions were raised.\n  Let me cite an example of one amendment I offered in the \nAppropriations Committee to give an idea about the mindset that is \npushing this forward. I offered an amendment which said: You cannot \ngive vouchers to a private school--public money to a private school--\nunless the teachers in the private school receiving the voucher money \nhave a college degree and the\n\n[[Page S11952]]\n\nschool physically complies with the life, health, and safety code of \nthe District of Columbia.\n  That seems fairly reasonable for my colleagues who have voted for No \nChild Left Behind. Remember the President's program? The President not \nonly required college degrees for teachers, but imposed even higher \nstandards of excellence over the years. So to require a college degree \nat the private schools where we are sending public tax dollars is not a \nhuge leap or a radical idea. It is consistent with what the \noverwhelming majority of the Senate said would be the minimum standard \nfor public schools in America. To say that any private school that is \nsupported with public taxpayer dollars has to be safe for the \nchildren--fire escapes, and alarms, the appropriate exit doors, and the \nlike--it seems to me is just common sense. I am sorry to report to my \ncolleagues that amendment was defeated.\n  Senator Feinstein and the Republicans who support this DC voucher \nbill opposed my amendment which would have required a college degree of \nteachers at the private schools and would have required that those \nschools comply with the life, health, and safety code of the District \nof Columbia. I might add something. Per capita, the District of \nColumbia has the largest number of charter schools, which are \nexceptions to the traditional public school system, of any place in the \nUnited States. And even in the DC charter schools there is a \nrequirement that teachers at these charter schools have a college \ndegree.\n  When I offered the amendment in committee, you should have heard the \ndebate. I actually heard my colleagues say: Senator Durbin, you don't \nunderstand. These private schools are going to be experimental. We are \ngoing to try innovative approaches.\n  One Senator said that would rule out home schooling. Home schooling? \nIs that what DC vouchers are about? It strikes me as odd that we would \nwant to engage in an experiment in private schools with standards far \nlower than what we are demanding of our public schools. I have to add, \ntoo, that Senator Feinstein's effort to correct that problem, I don't \nbelieve, has been successful.\n  Let me give an example. In this amendment Senator Feinstein offers, \nwhich is presently before us, there is a section on teacher quality. In \ndescribing it, she stated that all teachers in the schools receiving \nvoucher funds must have a college degree. That is not what the \namendment says. What it says is that only those teachers who teach the \nstudents on vouchers need a college degree. So this means, frankly, a \nschool could put all of the students on vouchers in one classroom with \na teacher with an associate's degree, which is a college degree. So I \ndon't believe it was very carefully drawn. It doesn't meet the minimum \nstandards we expect of schools in America.\n  Let me tell you what else is deficient in the Feinstein amendment. \nThe amendment falls short of the requirements that we all voted and \nimposed on public schools in America, where we said it is not enough to \nhave a college degree. We said in public schools we are going to \nrequire not only a bachelor's degree, but certification of ability to \nteach, and particularly ``subject area mastery.'' What does that mean? \nIf you want to stand in front of a high school class and teach \nchemistry, you must demonstrate that you have taken the appropriate \namount of training in college to teach chemistry. Our understanding is \nthat all of the statistics show that when the teacher in front of the \nclassroom has not studied the subject, is merely reading a chapter \nahead to stay ahead of the children, the students don't learn much. So \nwe have said for public schools across America, this is our minimum \nstandard--a college degree, bachelor's degree, certification, and \nevidence of mastery of the subject.\n  It means in some of my schools in Illinois that they are saying we \nknow you have taught biology for many years and you are good at it, but \nyou don't have the requisite number of college degree hours to meet \nPresident Bush's requirements of No Child Left Behind. You have to take \nbiology classes in college to meet President Bush's minimum \nrequirements for public schools.\n  Turn the page to this debate. In this debate, we hear from Senator \nFeinstein and supporters of the DC voucher program that we are not \ngoing to hold the teachers in the private schools receiving Federal tax \ndollars to the same standards as teachers in the public schools in the \nDistrict of Columbia. Something is wrong with this picture. Either we \nwere mistaken in imposing the standard on public education, or they are \nlax and deficient in not requiring the same standards of teachers in \nprivate schools in the District of Columbia where these children are \ngoing to go to school.\n\n  Some of them have said this is just an experiment, and we are just \ngoing to see what happens. I can recall when my own kids were growing \nup and the school year started. After a few weeks, you get to meet the \nteacher. Before that, you may have said to your son or daughter, how \nare things going? They might say: Oh, I really like this teacher, or I \nam not getting along with the teacher. And you thought to yourself, I \nam going to work with my son or daughter and talk to the teacher and \ntry to make things right. But there is a real possibility that students \nin some schools, public and private, can be thrust into a situation \nwhere they not only have a bad year, they have two straight bad years--\nbad years with teachers who are not up to the academic levels that we \nshould require. The experiment may fail for those students. They may be \nin classrooms where the teachers are not ready to teach and where, \nfrankly, the teachers don't have the background to even consider \nteaching.\n  What happens to that student after one bad year in this experiment? \nCan they catch up? It is possible but more difficult. Now give them a \nsecond bad year.\n  This is an experiment with the lives of students. To think that a \nchild can have a bad experience in the fourth grade and fifth grade and \nthen catch up in the sixth grade may be wishful thinking. Some students \nare struggling with challenges that I never had and that my kids, thank \ngoodness, never faced. To put them in this experimental atmosphere \nwhere teachers are not required to have the same basic minimum \nqualifications as teachers in public schools is a disservice to those \nchildren and their families.\n  We hear about experiments taking place in other places, such as \nCleveland and Milwaukee. We read about one in the Washington Post the \nother day, where a convicted rapist, a fellow, started Alex's Academics \nof Excellence. He received $2.8 million from the State of Wisconsin. It \nturned out that the students were not getting the kind of education \nthey deserved there. They said it was very difficult for anybody to say \nno to someone who opened a school and said they were going to abide by \nall of the requirements of the law. That experiment failed, but it \ndidn't just fail for those who wrote the law, it failed for those kids \nand their families.\n  Why would we say, if there is going to be a DC voucher program, that \nthe teachers in private schools wouldn't at least meet the standards we \nrequire of teachers in public schools? Sadly, the Feinstein amendment \ndoesn't do that. That may have been her intent, but I am afraid she \ndidn't quite reach it in terms of satisfying that need.\n  There is another point that concerns me, too, and that is testing. If \nthis is to be legitimate and honest, you would have to take the \nstudents who are in private schools and test them with exactly the same \ntests students in public schools take. Then you could at least compare \nprogress. These students may be somewhat self-selected because they \ndecided to go to a private school. At the end of the day, you ought to \nbe able to compare test scores, in fairness, to not only the private \nschools but to the public schools.\n  Listen to what the Feinstein amendment says. It says: Student \nassessments are not a requirement imposed on the school; rather, it is \nplaced on the fund recipient--a very unusual allocation of \nresponsibility--the fund recipient that administers the voucher payout. \nI don't understand why the schools don't have this requirement.\n  The amendment goes on to say that the tests for voucher students must \nbe the ``same as'' school year 2003-2004. In a way that seems to answer \nmy challenge that the same tests be administered in the private schools \nas in the\n\n[[Page S11953]]\n\npublic schools. But read it more closely. If these are the same tests \nas required in school years 2003 and 2004, consider that this is \nproposed as a 5-year program. So what this means is that all of the \nstudents in all grades would have to be tested as required by No Child \nLeft Behind for public schools. Why? Because the requirements for \ntesting in No Child Left Behind take effect and change each year.\n  So what Senator Feinstein set up as a standard is a testing for this \nyear only, instead of just saying pointblank the students in these \nschools will be tested with the same frequency and the same tests as No \nChild Left Behind, she has instead said only one year's testing \nstandards, 2003-2004.\n\n  For example, by 2007, there will be a science assessment required \nunder No Child Left Behind. So public schools across America will be \ntaking tests indicating competency in science. Under the Feinstein \namendment, they do not have to worry about that. They are only held to \nthe standard of 2003-2004.\n  There is no duty in this law, as we read it, to report the findings \nof those tests publicly, even to the parents, only to the Secretary of \nEducation. Why not? Where I live, the State of Illinois--the State of \nOhio and other States--school test scores are reported publicly so the \nparents know, taxpayers know, whether the schools are performing. The \nFeinstein amendment does not require this.\n  Now here is another thing I find curious. The Feinstein amendment \nrequires the comparison made for those students tested must include \ntesting not just students still in public schools and students who are \nnow in private schools being funded with public funds, under vouchers, \nbut also a third class, those students who applied for vouchers and \nwere rejected. So we have a third category of students who are going to \nbe a control group for testing.\n  I do not quite understand this, but I do think the concept is at \nleast challengeable, because there is no doubt in my mind that the \nprivate schools are not going to rush to accept students who are going \nto be problem students and challenging students. So there will be the \nrejected students having been controlled out into a cherry-picked group \nbeing tested separately.\n  It is possible these students are likely to test worse. The private \nschools did not want to take them in because they are going to be held \naccountable for some 2003-2004 tests. Why the Senator has decided to \ninclude this, I do not know.\n  So when we look at this bill overall and consider the elements in it, \nI am afraid Senator Feinstein's attempt to correct the problems does \nnot quite solve the problem. We still have some major deficiencies in \nthis bill.\n  What bothers me, too, I read in the paper this morning that the Mayor \nhas said he wants new authority over education in the public schools of \nthe District of Columbia. At the risk of stepping on the toes of some \nof my friends, I think the Mayor is on the right path. The reason I say \nit is this: Many of the people who are supporting voucher programs have \ngiven up on public education, for a variety of reasons. For some \npolitical reasons, they believe the teachers' unions support Democrats \nand they are going to go after public education and they are going to \nfight the teachers' unions. Others have said, just look at the results. \nSome of the public schools are not very good. Therefore, there should \nbe an alternative.\n  If one takes an honest approach to this, the first obligation of \nelected officials in this country is to the system of education which \nbuilt America and the system of education which serves more than 90 \npercent of America's school children, and that is the public school \nsystem.\n  I say to the Mayor of Washington, who has joined us today, and all \nthose who are following the debate, do not give up on public education. \nThings are happening that are positive in the District of Columbia. \nFrankly, I think they have been ignored and played down and there has \nbeen a disservice by some of the rhetoric we have heard about DC public \nschools.\n  There are good things happening: Charter schools and transformational \nschools, big changes that are moving in the right direction. I ask the \nMayor, before he gives up on the public school system and says we have \nto have vouchers, that there is no other way but to take public tax \nfunds and send them to private schools, before he gives up on public \neducation, come to Chicago. Come and look at what has happened there. \nIn our Chicago public school system, we have 95 percent minority \nstudents and 85 percent students under the poverty level. Yet in a \nrather brief period of time we have seen dramatic increases in test \nscores because the mayor of the city of Chicago assumed a personal \nresponsibility for the public school system, brought in some of the \nmost talented people he could find, challenged the parents, the \nteachers, the principals, and the students to do a better job and got \nthe results to show for it.\n\n  My colleagues do not have to give up on public education. They do not \nhave to say there is no alternative but to let kids escape public \neducation and go to private schools. There is a lot more that can be \ndone. It takes some hard-nosed, tough-minded leadership, but I think \nthe Mayor may be on the right path in what he said this morning. He is \nwilling to accept more of this responsibility personally and maybe that \nis what is necessary.\n  The Chicago experience tells me it has been a good experience. When \nthe mayor had the power and the responsibility, good things happened. \nCome with me to the city of Chicago and take a drive through many tough \nparts of that great part of town. Homes will be found where people in \nthe lower and middle income are struggling to keep it together and \nthen, like a mirage or an oasis, one will see the public school where \nover the last several years the Chicago public school system has \ndedicated dramatic amounts of money to renovate these schools and bring \nthem back to a source of pride in the community.\n  No graffiti will be seen on the walls of the school. Flowers will be \nseen planted outside and the people in this neighborhood point to that \npublic school with pride, because the mayor was proud of those schools \nand because the people in the neighborhood are, too.\n  If that mayor or any mayor had said these public schools are a \nfailure, we are walking away from them, then frankly it would have \ncreated a negative environment. We need a positive environment for \neducation. Moving to this voucher plan, without adequate hearing, \nwithout the consideration of the options that are available to us, \nfrankly is a move in the wrong direction.\n  I also say to my colleagues that as I read through this bill, they \nmust, I hope, acknowledge the fact there are several things that could \nhappen they do not anticipate. For example, there is no prohibition in \nthis bill that the 1,000 to 2,0000 vouchers that are created, whatever \nnumber they turn out to be, will all be given to children who are \nalready in private schools. There is no prohibition against that. \nThough they start with a premise and a goal of moving kids from lower \nperforming public schools to higher performing private schools, in fact \nthe testing is not there for comparison.\n  Second, there is no requirement that the family of the student \nreceiving the voucher actually bring the student from a public school \nto a private school. This could end up diverting a substantial amount \nof money to students, and their families, already enrolled in private \nschools. Like it or not, the bill is inartfully drawn, and having been \nso poorly drawn, that could be the outcome. So they will not be proving \nmuch of a case there, will they, if students are already in the private \nschools?\n  I can go on for some time about the experiments with vouchers in \nprivate schools. I want to close, because I see Senator Kennedy is in \nthe Chamber and I imagine he would like to make a comment on this bill. \nIf he does, he is certainly welcome to.\n  I will close my comments on the Feinstein amendment by urging my \ncolleagues to oppose it. Senator Feinstein has identified the problem. \nShe has not identified solutions, not good solutions, not solutions \nthat are worthy of the first-ever program in the history of the United \nStates to divert funds from public schools to private schools under a \nvoucher program.\n  From my point of view, private schools in many communities add a lot \nto education. I am not an enemy of private education. I am a product of\n\n[[Page S11954]]\n\nCatholic education. My wife and I both attended Catholic schools, as \ndid our children. But we understood our responsibility. Our \nresponsibility was first to pay our public property taxes, to support \npublic education, and then if we chose, for religious reasons or \nwhatever reasons, to send our children to a Catholic school, we \naccepted the financial responsibility of paying tuition. It was a \nsacrifice for many families. I think they add a lot.\n\n  I think we should take care here. We are creating a new system in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and there are few protections and safeguards, if \nany, to stop the possibility that at some point after we have passed \nthis bill that some group will decide to open up a private school and \ndraw in hundreds of thousands of dollars of public taxpayer funds and \nthe teachers in those schools may not have college degrees, only \nassociate degrees, the testing in those schools may not match what is \ngoing on in the public schools, and the schools will be allowed to \ndiscriminate against students for such things as disabilities where \nthey will not allow any children in who have any kind of learning \ndisability or any physical or mental disability, which would be \nallowed, incidentally, under this proposal.\n  Is that what we want to see happen? Is that what should be the first \ntest case of this experiment in the voucher program? I think not. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I urge them to think long \nand hard that if they voted against vouchers for their States, why is \nit now we are making an exception because the case in point involves \nthe District of Columbia?\n  These students and their families deserve the same respect as the \nstudents and families in all of our States, and I urge my colleagues to \nkeep that in mind as we consider this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from Illinois has \nonce again demonstrated why he is known as certainly one of the best, \nif not the best, debater in the Senate. He does an absolutely excellent \njob. I always enjoy debating with him. I thank him for his contribution \nto this debate. I know we will have the opportunity to continue to \ndebate in the days ahead.\n  My colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, will, in a moment, \ntalk about her amendment and will respond to Senator Durbin's comments \nabout her amendment. But I would like to make a couple of comments \nfirst about Senator Durbin's comments.\n  My colleague from Illinois talked about where this plan came from. I \ntalked earlier about the fact that it is a three-pronged program. That \nis what I like about it. I happen to like the fact that a third of the \nmoney goes to the public schools, a third of the money goes to the \ncharter schools, and a third of the money goes to this new voucher \nprogram.\n  Somehow, my colleague seems to know--I don't know how, but he seems \nto know how this program started. Somehow he seems to know in his \nwisdom that this program was some sort of bargain deal. The House \nRepublicans came to the Mayor and said: Mayor, here's the deal.\n  It is a funny thing. The Mayor, under the rules of the Senate, cannot \ncome down here and speak. But if someone would happen to ask the Mayor, \nnot on the floor--you can't do that; that is against the rules, but if \nsomeone someday would happen to ask the Mayor what the truth is, what \nthe Mayor would say is that is not true, and this was the Mayor's idea; \nthat the Mayor and his people said they wanted. This is the program we \nwant. We want a balanced program because what we want is a choice for \nthe children and the families of the District of Columbia. We want a \nbalanced program.\n  Yes, we want more assistance for the public schools--and the Mayor \nhas a consistent record of trying to get more money for the public \nschools of the District of Columbia, and he is not bashful about that. \nHe should not be bashful about it. And he is proud about it. Yes, he \nwants more money to create more charter schools. Everyone who will vote \non this bill needs to understand when the issue comes, when Senator \nDurbin tries to strike the money, what you will be striking is $13 \nmillion which will create more charter schools, four or five more \ncharter schools in the District of Columbia. Everyone needs to \nunderstand that.\n  The Mayor is proud of the fact that the District of Columbia has \ncreated more charter schools. I must say my colleague, Senator \nLandrieu, has been integrally involved in creating those charter \nschools. It is something she cares passionately about.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I may finish the thought and then I will yield.\n  The Mayor also said: I want more money for my public schools. I want \nto continue to improve them. I want more money for the charter schools. \nWe are proud of what we are doing in that area. And third, I want to \ncreate the voucher program.\n  So let's clear that up. If anyone has any doubt about it, ask the \nMayor. Go to the source. What the Mayor will say is: It was my idea. I \nam the one who had the idea. My people put the program together. We \nrequested it. This is what we want.\n\n  I will be more than happy to yield, not the floor, but for the \npurpose of conversation with my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Ohio.\n  I would like to ask through the Chair, I certainly will be ready to \nyield whenever he would like to ask me a question because I think this \nis an important part of the debate, but I ask my colleague if he is \naware of two things. First, the amendment I am going to offer will take \nthe $13 million out of the school voucher program and divide it equally \namong the public and charter schools. The money goes back into public \nand charter schools, so they will end up with about $20 million each, \ninstead of $13 million.\n  Mr. DeWINE. In response, I have not seen the amendment of my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank him for acknowledging that.\n  Second, I ask my friend and colleague from Ohio if he is aware the \nExecutive Office of the President released a Statement of \nAdministration Policy on September 24. In reference to this particular \nprogram it said as follows:\n\n       The administration is pleased the committee bill puts $13 \n     million for the President's School Choice Incentive Fund \n     Initiative. . . .\n\n  It doesn't refer to Mayor Williams' School Choice Incentive Fund \nInitiative.\n  Mr. DeWINE. In respond to my colleague, we all like to take credit \nfor many things. I am sure the President is taking credit for this. I \nam sure I will probably take credit for it, too, if it passes. There \nwill be many fathers and mothers of this program.\n  All I know is what the Mayor will tell us. The Mayor will say this is \na program he put together.\n  What I would emphasize to my colleague is that this is a program that \nthe Mayor says is a balanced program.\n  I will quote from a letter the Mayor has sent to me. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 11, 2003\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on \n         the District of Columbia, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman DeWine: Thank you for your leadership on the \n     District of Columbia's FY 2004 Appropriations bill. By any \n     measure, it is a great bill for the city. In particular, I am \n     grateful for your support for the District of Columbia School \n     Improvement Initiative, which will help us advance the \n     important school reform efforts underway. Certainly, the \n     private school scholarship element has generated significant \n     debate, and I hope that I have made the case to your \n     colleagues that its passage is consonant with home rule and \n     will strengthen our public education system.\n       I, along with the Chair of the District Council's Education \n     Committee, Kevin Chavous, and the School Board President, \n     Peggy Cooper Cafritz, believe that we must continue to do \n     everything possible to strengthen our nation's public \n     schools. This is why, in addition to a private school \n     scholarship program, we have insisted on strong federal \n     financial support for both the District of Columbia Public \n     Schools (DCPS) and the public charter schools.\n       Since becoming Mayor, I have overseen an increase in the \n     public education budget by more than 50 percent. This \n     demonstrates my commitment to public schools as tremendously \n     important institutions in our city. This increase has allowed \n     our charter school movement to expand to 40 schools and has \n     permitted us to launch the Transformation Schools Initiative \n     in 15 DC public schools,\n\n[[Page S11955]]\n\n     which we hope will revitalize our lowest-performing schools. \n     After consulting with education officials, however, I have \n     concluded that these aggressive reforms, while promising, \n     will take years to reach most of our children. So, as these \n     foundations expand and improve, I think it is prudent to look \n     to the assets provided by our private schools, at least for a \n     limited period of time.\n       The proposed scholarship initiative will not drain \n     resources from our public school system. I have agreed to \n     hold the public schools harmless from any loss of local \n     funding arising from students' enrollments in private schools \n     through the federally funded scholarship program. Moreover, \n     because Title I funding is based largely on census data, we \n     do not anticipate that DC will lose significant federal \n     funding as a result of this program. Thus, under the \n     scholarship initiative, our public schools will receive the \n     same amount of funds as they otherwise would have, in order \n     to educate fewer students.\n       Since our city began to debate the issue of expanded school \n     choice, there has been speculation that this initiative will \n     have an impact far beyond the borders of Washington, DC. Some \n     say that what we do in the District will affect national \n     education policy and the likelihood of pilot programs in \n     other cities. For me, however, the issue of vouchers is more \n     localized.\n       This initiative was designed by District leadership for \n     District residents and is not being imposed on the District \n     from outside, as some would have you believe. As mayor, I am \n     trying to make the best choices for the residents of this \n     city, and without a state government to which, under normal \n     circumstances, I would make this request. In this regard, I \n     believe it is appropriate for the federal government to act \n     on behalf of the nation's capital when the local mayor and \n     school board president seek assistance.\n       You have been a strong supporter of the District of \n     Columbia and of our aspirations for self-government. Our city \n     continues to improve in many ways. I hope we can count on \n     affirmative action from the Senate in support of the School \n     Choice Improvement Initiative and the entire FY 2004 District \n     of Columbia Appropriations bill.\n       Again, I thank you for the extraordinary leadership and \n     commitment you have shown toward the District. I look forward \n     to continuing to work closely with you in taking the \n     necessary actions to support the District of Columbia.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Anthony A. Williams,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. This is a letter dated September 11, 2003, to me as \nchairman of the Subcommittee on the District of Columbia, a two-page \nletter from Mayor Williams to me.\n  I would like to quote a part of this letter to my colleagues. This is \nthe third paragraph:\n\n       Since becoming Mayor, I have overseen an increase in the \n     public education budget by more than 50 percent. This \n     demonstrates my commitment to public schools as tremendously \n     important institutions in our city. This increase has allowed \n     our charter school movement to expand to 40 schools and has \n     permitted us to launch the Transformation Schools Initiative \n     in 15 DC public schools, which we hope will revitalize our \n     lowest-performing schools. After consulting with education \n     officials, however, I have concluded that these aggressive \n     reforms, while promising, will take years to reach most of \n     our children. So, as these foundations expand and improve, I \n     think it is prudent to look to the assets provided by our \n     private schools, at least for a limited period of time.\n       What the Mayor clearly is saying is that as we improve our \n     public schools, as we have the charter schools, we need \n     another alternative for some of our students.\n\n  Let me quote again, if I could, from the letter:\n\n       The proposed scholarship initiative will not drain \n     resources from our public school system. I have agreed to \n     hold the public schools harmless from any loss of local \n     funding arising from students' enrollments in private schools \n     through the federally funded scholarship program. Moreover, \n     because Title I funding is based largely on census data, we \n     do not anticipate that DC will lose significant federal \n     funding as a result of this program. Thus, under the \n     scholarship initiative, our public schools will receive the \n     same amount of funds as they otherwise would have, in order \n     to educate fewer students.\n\n  Let me quote another part of the letter:\n\n       This initiative was designed by District leadership for \n     District residents and is not being imposed on the District \n     from outside, as some would have you believe. As mayor, I am \n     trying to make the best choices for the residents of this \n     city. . . . In this regard, I believe it is appropriate for \n     the federal government to act on behalf of the nation's \n     capital when the local mayor and school board president seek \n     assistance.\n\n  At this point, before I yield to my colleague, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator make the request again?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has requested the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold.\n  The question is on the call for the yeas and nays. Is there a \nsufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I very much disagree with the position of the Senator from Illinois. \nI understand this is something that is new. I understand it is \nsomething being tried. I understand it turns counter to a lot of what \nhas been done in the educational establishment today. But that doesn't \nmean it shouldn't be tried.\n  I wish to correct one point. I asked the Mayor if he believed he got \na Faustian bargain. He said no, he didn't. He said: As a matter of \nfact, I proposed the three-pronged asset portion of this. In other \nwords, one-third of the money would be new money to the schools, one-\nthird of the money would be new money to charter schools, and one-third \nof the money would be new money to try this special scholarship program \nfor poor children.\n  I would like the Record to reflect the rationale for the language in \nmy amendment on the testing. In order to guarantee a valid and \nstatistically reliable evaluation, we are told it is vital that we have \nthe scholarship student and those students who applied for the \nscholarship but didn't get it take the same test for all 5 years. If \nthe District should switch tests at some point in the 5-year duration \nof the program, we need to continue giving the test to start with, \nwhich today in the District is the Stanford 9 test. That is a norm-\nreferenced test which is given all over the country, and it would \npreserve the evaluation. The use of the same exact test for all 5 years \nis critical to be able to compare apples to apples. If the District \nchanges tests during these 5 years, you have a false comparison; you \nhave apples to oranges. That is the reason the language is as it is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I finish?\n  Any parent applying for this scholarship must agree that their child \nwill take the Stanford 9 test for all 5 years regardless of whether \nthey receive a scholarship or not.\n  Let me tell you what this is all about. I recognize the Senator \ndoesn't like it. That is fine. He doesn't have to vote for it. But what \nthis is all about is that 76 percent of DC fourth graders performed \nbelow basic in math, and only 10 percent read proficiently. Only 12 \npercent of eighth graders read proficiently.\n  That is what this is all about--to see if, by learning some of the \nbasics, these children have a better start in education in a different \nmodel, in a different setting, with a different structure than \ncurrently exists in public education. It may work. It may not work. But \nthese are all poor children. They are all in failing schools. Why not \ngive them a chance?\n  I suppose you could fault it by saying, well, everyone who instructs \none of these children in these schools should have more than a college \ndegree. Sure. I would like to do it. I don't know that we can condition \nthe requirement in every private secular school or every private \nparochial school that may accept one of these children.\n  I took high school classes from nuns who didn't have college degrees. \nAnd guess what. I got into Stanford based on what I learned in high \nschool. So I came to realize that these absolute requirements may be \nright if we are going into this on a permanent basis, but we are not; \nwe are going into it on a temporary basis. This pilot gives us an \nopportunity to see whether these children progress better in different \nsettings. What is the difference if those different settings happen to \nbe private parochial, or they happen to be private secular school \nsettings?\n  I cannot tell you how many parents write to me and ask: Can you help \nme get my child into a private school? Please help me. These are \nparents who have funds. What about the parents who do not have funds? \nThey don't have a chance at this. All this does is give them that \nopportunity.\n  If you do not like it, don't vote for it. That is easy. But some of \nus want to see what works and what doesn't work.\n\n[[Page S11956]]\n\n  They said the same thing to Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown about his idea \nto start a military school in Oakland. A public military school? \nHorrors. The school board voted it down. Fortunately, the Mayor of \nOakland is a persistent personality. He went to the State and got a \nspecial charter to open a military school so that youngsters from the \ndeeply troubled socioeconomic areas in the city of Oakland would have a \nshot of going to college. Now they have 350 kids who are 3 years into \nthe program, and they are testing as the second best middle school in \nOakland. That is discipline. It is amazing. Different models work for \ndifferent youngsters.\n\n  That is why I am supporting this approach.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. You might not find the ``i'' dotted or the ``t'' \ncrossed exactly the way you would like to have the ``i'' dotted or the \n``t'' crossed.\n  This isn't a program that is national. It is not a program that is \ngoing to exist for 50 years. It is a program that is going to be tried \nfor 5 years. Either poor children will do better or they won't. And the \ntest is going to be--\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I don't know whether I want to yield to the Senator \nor not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Just say no. No is also an answer.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I beg your pardon?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No is an answer, if you don't want to answer.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am thinking about it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is your prerogative.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my friend and colleague from California.\n  I have no doubt that she offered this amendment--I say through the \nChair--to address some of the concerns raised in the committee.\n  I ask my friend from California to turn to page 2 of her amendment \nand consider paragraph B on page 2. I will read it. It says:\n\n       Use the same assessment every school year used for school \n     year 2003-2004 by the District of Columbia public schools to \n     assess the achievement of DC public school students.\n\n  I will ask the question, and then I will sit down.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Fair enough.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Currently, the DC Public School System, like many public \nschool systems, is in transition under the No Child Left Behind Act and \nthe 2005 requirement that students be tested every year. Currently, \ntheir public school students are only tested every other year.\n  By establishing as a standard for the next 5 years for the District \nof Columbia voucher program using the 2003-2004 assessments, the \nSenator is saying they will only be tested every other year, while \nstudents in public schools by the year 2005 have to be tested every \nyear.\n  If the Senator had said here that you will comply with the No Child \nLeft Behind Act testing requirement, it would have been easy. But \ninstead, you picked one particular year, and I don't think you reach \nthe standard which you have described to our colleagues.\n  Is that true or not?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. What you have just stated and what I have been told \nis that in order to have a fair test evaluation and compare apples to \napples, the same test has to be used, which in the District is the \nStanford 9, for the 5-year period. So that is the test now being given. \nIf the District changes--I think it is called a criterion-based test--\nand I gather the District is considering changing them, this control \ngroup would still have to take the Stanford 9 to see if they have \nprogressed.\n  Now I am told if somebody says, I am happy to change it, I am told \nyou cannot get a fair test if we change it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield the floor, I would like to ask \nthis question.\n  Does the Senator understand that by the year 2005 under No Child Left \nBehind, every public school in America, including the District of \nColumbia, will have to test every grade every year; but in the current \nschool year, schools are moving toward that goal. In the District of \nColumbia they are only testing every other year.\n  It is not a question of changing the test. I am asking the Senator \nfrom California, does she understand if we stick to the 2003-2004 \nstandard, she will only be testing every other grade while every public \nschool in the District of Columbia and across the Nation will be moving \nto every grade, every year by 2005? Her bill, her standards, will not \nbe following that same assessment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As I understand it, the Stanford 9 is a nationally \nnorm-referenced test. It can certainly be given every year, and I \nbelieve the Mayor will agree to that.\n  If your question is, Are you saying the students will be tested every \nother year instead of every year, what I am saying is we can use it \nevery year. If you are saying we want the test to change in the middle \nof the test period, I am being told that will mess up any fair \nevaluation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am not suggesting changing the test. The same test \nshould be administered in a private school as administered in a public \nschool.\n  I am suggesting to the Senator, as she has written this amendment, \nthe 2003-2004 testing in the D.C. public schools, her standard for 5 \nyears only tests every other grade. By 2005 every grade will be tested. \nIt is not the substantive test that is the issue. It is a question of \nwhether every grade will be tested every year.\n  The reason I raise this, and I hope the Senator agrees, should have \nbeen worked out in the education committee after hearings and markup in \nthe amendment process. We are doing it on the fly, on the floor, \ncreating the first private school voucher program in America and \ndiscussing as we go.\n  That is my concern.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate the Senator's concern.\n  If the Senator from Ohio agrees, I am very happy to have my amendment \nmodified to provide that the voucher recipients and the students in the \ncontrol group be given the same test that all District public schools \nstudents are given.\n  With respect to this being done in the education committee, I \nprobably agree, except it would probably get bogged down one way. The \nreason it is in the appropriations bill is because the Mayor has come \nto us and asked us for the additional money. The additional money is \nwhat brought this on. Once the additional money was in the bill, then \nthe terms of the money came to bear and the bill had to be written.\n  It is not easy. There are powerful forces against it. People do not \nwant to try it. I do. I hope a majority want to try it. We have tried \nto do the best we can.\n  Even more importantly, what has been developed here is a relationship \nbetween the city and Members of this Senate with this Mayor. I happen \nto respect this Mayor. I am a taxpaying citizen of this District. I \nhave been so for 10 years. I used to go down the street where there was \na pothole so big somebody plugged it up with a mattress. I am very \npleased to say, Mr. Mayor, that pothole is gone now. The District is in \nmuch better shape. People are coming back to the District. He wants \nthis.\n  The question was also raised, it is easy to do it here. I am not in \nmy own jurisdiction. I tried to point out, the mayor of Oakland came to \nme in my own jurisdiction to do something that was a new model; I \nagreed to it. I am going to look at new models and try to support them \nwhere I can, also support teachers, also support Title I, and also \nsupport public education.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 1787 to amendment No. 1783, As Modified\n\n  I ask the Member from Ohio if he would be in agreement that we submit \na modification and ask our amendment be modified to reflect that the \ntest be given annually?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I would certainly have no objection to that. It at best \nis ambiguous. It is always good to clarify.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, may I direct a question to the Senator from \nOhio?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from California has \nthe right to modify her amendment. However, to do so, she would have to \nsend it to the desk.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I modify the amendment on page 2, line 3, strike \n``that are used for school year 2003-2004.''\n\n[[Page S11957]]\n\n  I send that modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to make that \nmodification to her amendment. However, she needs to send a \nmodification to the desk.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1787), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 31, strike line 13 and all that follows through \n     page 32, line 2, and insert the following:\n       (c) Student Assessments.--The Secretary may not approve an \n     application from an eligible entity for a grant under this \n     title unless the eligible entity's application--\n       (1) ensures that the eligible entity will--\n       (A) assess the academic achievement of all participating \n     eligible students;\n       (B) use the same assessments every school year that are \n     used by the District of Columbia Public Schools to assess the \n     achievement of District of Columbia public school students \n     under section 1111(b)(3)(A) of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(3)(A)), to assess \n     participating eligible students in the same grades as such \n     public school students;\n       (C) provide assessment results and other relevant \n     information to the Secretary or to the entity conducting the \n     evaluation under section 9 so that the Secretary or the \n     entity, respectively, can conduct an evaluation that shall \n     include, but not be limited to, a comparison of the academic \n     achievement of participating eligible students in the \n     assessments described in this subsection to the achievement \n     of--\n       (i) students in the same grades in the District of Columbia \n     public schools; and\n       (ii) the eligible students in the same grades in District \n     of Columbia public schools who sought to participate in the \n     scholarship program but were not selected; and\n       (D) disclose any personally identifiable information only \n     to the parents of the student to whom the information \n     relates; and\n       (2) describes how the eligible entity will ensure that the \n     parents of each student who applies for a scholarship under \n     this title (regardless of whether the student receives the \n     scholarship), and the parents of each student participating \n     in the scholarship program under this title, agree that the \n     student will participate in the assessments used by the \n     District of Columbia Public Schools to assess the achievement \n     of District of Columbia public school students under section \n     1111(b)(3)(A) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(3)(A)), for the period for which \n     the student applied for or received the scholarship, \n     respectively.\n       (d) Independent Evaluation.--The Secretary and Mayor of the \n     District of Columbia shall jointly select an independent \n     entity to evaluate annually the performance of students who \n     received scholarships under the 5-year pilot program under \n     this title, and shall make the evaluations public. The first \n     evaluation shall be completed and made available not later \n     than 9 months after the entity is selected pursuant to the \n     preceding sentence.\n       (e) Teacher Quality.--Each teacher who instructs \n     participating eligible students under the scholarship program \n     shall possess a college degree\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reid are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11957-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11957-S11967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DO-NOT-CALL REGISTRY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3161, the FTC's ratification \nof authority for the Do Not Call Registry, under the following \nconditions: 45 minutes under the control of the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee or his designee, and 45 minutes under the control of \nthe ranking member or his designee; of the time under the control of \nthe ranking member, the following Senators be recognized to speak for \nup to 5 minutes each: Senators Hollings, Dorgan, Conrad, Kohl, Pryor, \nSchumer, and Feinstein, with the remaining time under the control of \nthe Democratic leader or his designee; further, that no amendments be \nin order to the bill; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, \nthe bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I only ask \nthat the ranking member, Senator Hollings, be given up to 10 minutes \nout of the 45 minutes under his control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think everyone should be advised that if \nall the time is used, we will vote at about 5:35 on final passage of \nthis most important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be glad for the time to be 10 \nminutes for Senator Hollings, but I remind my friend from Nevada, \nSenator Hollings will be controlling the time. So he will be granting \nhimself as much time as he may use because the unanimous consent \nrequest is that the time will be under the control of the ranking \nmember or his designee.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona, Senator \nHollings is the ranking member, and the unanimous consent request does \nsay that. However, he is going to speak and then turn the time over to \nthe ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Dorgan of North Dakota.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Good. But I have always proceeded under the assumption \nthat Senator Hollings can speak whenever he wants to, for however long \nhe wants to. I have found that it has improved our relationship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3161) to ratify the authority of the Federal \n     Trade Commission to establish a do-not-call registry.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, does the Senator from South Carolina care \nto speak at this time?\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, marketers assault Americans' privacy \nevery day. Businesses track everything we buy and everything we do. It \nseems the marketers know more about our lives than we do ourselves. It \nis intrusive, and Americans want the tools to fight back.\n  But those of us who work to protect Americans' privacy are thwarted \nevery step of the way. The marketers oppose antispam legislation. The \nmarketers oppose decency limits on advertising to children. And the \nmarketers oppose legislation that would allow Americans to ``opt-out'' \nof the sharing of their personal information, including financial \nrecords.\n  The one success we have had is the Do Not Call list. The public's \nvociferous reaction to the court decision yesterday shows the country's \ndesire to win refuge from the marketing onslaught. The public wants the \nDo Not Call registry. And the public wants the registry to become \nactive next week. We will make sure that happens.\n  But we have several Johnny-Come-Latelys to our cause. When I was \nchairman of the Commerce Committee last Congress, we worked with the \nFTC to create the Do Not Call Registry. But we didn't get much help \nfrom the other side. Instead we were unfairly criticized by interest \ngroups for jeopardizing their funding.\n  We fought to win $18 million for the registry in the omnibus \nappropriations bill last year. But the House wanted language that would \nprohibit using that funding absent explicit Congressional \nauthorization. The House language could have stopped the registry. \nAgain, it was an uphill battle, and we had few allies. But we \neventually got the bad language removed, giving the FTC the funds to \nimplement the Do Not Call Registry.\n  Once the FTC opened the list to registration, the response from the \nAmerican public was overwhelming. By yesterday, Americans had \nregistered more than 50 million phone numbers. South Carolinians have \nregistered 685,393 phone numbers--486,533 through the FTC Web site, \n198,855 via phone, and 5 through hearing-impaired devices. The \nmarketers argued that Americans did not want the Do Not Call list, but \nthe American public proved them wrong. Americans want this tool. They \nwant the assault on their privacy to stop. Once news reports showed the \nDo Not\n\n[[Page S11958]]\n\nCall Registry was popular, many converted to the cause. And some of \nthem are leading the charge today. We appreciate their support now as \nwe try to overturn a clearly flawed court decision.\n  To prepare for compliance on October 1, 2003, nearly 5,000 \ntelemarketers have purchased all or parts of the list. Therefore, \ntelemarketers acting in good faith are ready to comply next week.\n  A telemarketer that ignores the Do Not Call list is subject to an \n$11,000 fine for each call to a phone number on the Do Not Call \nRegistry. The law requires telemarketers to search the registry every 3 \nmonths and synchronize their call lists.\n  Once consumers register a number on the Do Not Call list, \ntelemarketers are prohibited from calling the number for the purpose of \nselling goods and services. Consumers who receive sales calls after \ntheir number has been in the registry for three months can file a \ncomplaint on the FTC web site or call 1-888-382-1222.\n  The Do Not Call list will not hurt charities seeking to raise money \nfor worthy causes. Charities may still hire professional telemarketers \nto seek donations. But calls during which a charity or telemarketer \nseeks to sell something are prohibited to phone numbers on the Do Not \nCall Registry.\n  This Do Not Call Registry has been a long time in coming. We are \ngoing to take the final step today. The court decision yesterday may \neven have given the Do Not Call Registry more publicity, encouraging \neven more people to register their phone numbers.\n  Opponents of Americans' privacy should take notice: Americans want \ntools and choices, such as the Do Not Call Registry, to protect their \nprecious time with their families. They also want to protect their \nprivate medical and financial information and protect their children \nfrom indecent advertising. We will keep fighting.\n  Mr. President, let's thank Chairman Tim Muris of the Federal Trade \nCommission, who came to the Commerce Committee last year. And we put in \nS. 2946, the Do Not Call bill, with some $5 million that was requested. \nLater on, we found there were well organized holds, whereby we could \nnot even get this bill up for consideration. Yes, we reported it \nfavorably from the Commerce Committee, but we could not get it on the \nfloor to pass it. And it was needed.\n  Chairman Muris came to me and said he needed $15 million. I talked \nwith Chairman Gregg earlier this year, and in the omnibus bill, with \nthe Federal Trade Commission appropriations, we increased it to $18 \nmillion. We could see the demand and see the interest and see the need. \nSo we did just that.\n  It is good that my distinguished chairman, the Senator from Arizona, \nis on the Senate floor because the opposition was that it was not \nauthorized. I go right to my experience for over 30 some years on the \nState-Justice-Commerce Committee, where we have had difficulty over the \nyears passing, for example, an FBI authorization bill.\n  I remember for a period of almost 20 years we had no authorization. \nWe worked with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to make sure \ntheir wants were taken care of. But we provided the bill; the same with \nrespect to State Department authorization.\n  So I would only admonish the distinguished jurist who made this \nruling about authorization that, yes, the Senator from Arizona is \njointly correct with respect to the rules of the Senate but not with \nrespect to the Constitution.\n  Once you receive three readings in the House and three readings in \nthe Senate, and it is signed by the President of the United States, we \nhave no doubt that law would take effect and this order of the court \nwould be set aside.\n  However, the triggering date is the first of October, next week, and \nso I commend my House colleagues and those on the Senate side, and my \nchairman, Senator McCain, in taking this up at this particular time so \nwe can go ahead and take the House bill.\n  There are many interested in separate bills, and what have you. But \nright to the point, time is of the essence. Fifty million Americans \ncannot be wrong, they are all interested in stopping the calls.\n  With that, let me yield, then, to the distinguished chairman, and \nthen to Senator Dorgan, who will control the time on the floor.\n  I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First of all, I thank Senator Hollings for all his efforts on this \nlegislation. I think he was not a Member of the Senate when the Federal \nTrade Commission was created, but very close to it, and he has been \nheavily involved with all the issues surrounding the FTC and the good \nworks they do.\n  I will speak very briefly. I would like to thank Senator Ensign and \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Dorgan, Senator DeWine, and many other \nSenators, but particularly those including the distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Hollings, for all their efforts regarding this \nlegislation and, more importantly, this issue.\n  Two days ago, a Federal district court in Oklahoma issued an opinion \nthat could stall the FTC's implementation of a National Do Not Call \nRegistry scheduled to go into effect next Wednesday. The court opined \nthat the FTC was not authorized to create a Do Not Call Registry. I \nmust say that opinion came as an amazing surprise to those of us who \nhave been involved in this issue, and served as a rallying cry for tens \nof millions of Americans households that have signed up for the \nregistry.\n\n  I understand the judge received so many calls from irate Americans \nthat the FTC could not get through to the court regarding the \nCommission's appeal. Clearly, the court's decision was misguided.\n  The measure before us makes crystal clear that the Commission can and \nshould proceed as planned with the Do Not Call list. Earlier this year, \nin two separate measures, Congress ratified the FTC's Do Not Call \nRegistry by explicitly providing for the Commission to collect fees to \npay for it. Today Congress is once again saying, dispositively and \nunambiguously, that the FTC has the authority it needs to create a \nNational Do Not Call list.\n  When the FTC proposed to create this registry, I don't think they or \neven Members of this body had any idea how strongly it would be \nembraced by a public tired of having their precious leisure time filled \nwith a seemingly incessant string of telephone solicitations.\n  I understand the FTC's Web site for registering on the Do Not Call \nlist became the fastest growing Web site in history.\n  One of my favorite programs is ``Seinfeld.'' In one of the episodes \nthat has become famous in reruns, Jerry Seinfeld answers the phone and \nit is a telemarketer. He says: I am busy right now. Can I call you back \nat home?\n  And of course the telemarketer says: No, you are not allowed to do \nthat. You wouldn't like that. Well, neither do I. And he hung up the \nphone.\n  Obviously, the issue of telemarketing involves the free enterprise \nsystem. Nothing in this legislation would inhibit their ability from \npracticing that, but it also balances the right of private citizens not \nto be disturbed if they choose not to be.\n  During a peak period, the FTC's Web site received approximately 1,000 \nhits per second. On the first day alone, 3.4 million consumers visited \nthe Web site. In the first 10 days, 10 million phone numbers had been \nregistered. Within the first month, the number had risen to 28 \nmillion--quite a remarkable evolution. To date, over 50 million phone \nnumbers have been registered, including nearly 1.2 million in my State \nof Arizona.\n  Congress is often accused of being slow to respond. Thankfully, that \ncharge can't be leveled here. Just a few hours ago the House passed \nthis legislation by a vote of 412 to 8. Whenever you see a number like \nthat, you are always curious who the eight are, but the curious \ndecision of one court should not be allowed to frustrate the clear will \nof Congress and the even clearer will of tens of millions of Americans.\n  Obviously, we urge our colleagues to support the measure, give \nconsumers what they want by empowering them to say no to what they \nclearly do not want.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who have responded to the predictable \nbut certainly overwhelming response to the\n\n[[Page S11959]]\n\ncourt's decision in the State of Oklahoma. That judge in the district \ncourt will become well known to many Americans as well.\n  I thank all my colleagues for coming and speaking on this issue. I \nthank them for their support. Although there is not a need for the yeas \nand nays, some of our colleagues may want to be on record. So we may \nwant to do so depending on the desires of my friend from North Dakota, \na man who understands the will of the populace especially where \ntelecommunications issues are concerned.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues, Senator McCain \nand Senator Hollings. This is an important issue, one we believed we \nhad previously resolved only to learn that a court ruled that the Do \nNot Call list developed by the Federal Trade Commission was ``not \nauthorized.''\n  Most of us in Congress and the Senate are surprised by that. Clearly, \nwe authorized that. But if a court needs another authorization, it is \nsomething we can certainly do on a Thursday afternoon at 4:15. So this \nwill be done with the support of many colleagues, and I am pleased to \nsay that this is good public policy.\n  Let me make a couple of comments about the substance. There may be \nsome people who are terribly lonely and whose phone seldom rings except \nto have an advertiser of a credit card or a long-distance service call \nduring meal time just wanting to visit about their product. There may \nbe some people who welcome those calls, just talk the ear off these \ntelemarketers. I can't say that for sure, but this country is full of \nvery interesting people. As for me and for most of the American people, \ngetting a telephone call in the middle of a meal or getting a telephone \ncall at all hours of the day and night to have someone tell us that we \nreally need a new long-distance service or a preapproved credit card \ngets a little annoying. Unsolicited phone calls are an intrusion on the \nphone line that most American people pay every month to have in their \nhome.\n  I come from a sparsely populated State, a wonderful place. It is 10 \ntimes the size of the Massachusetts landmass, with 642,000 people. It \nis spread out. We understand the importance of communications. We \nunderstand the importance of telephones. It took a long while to get \ntelephones to the outer reaches of our country, including rural areas. \nNow with modern communications, we also understand that we are not \nalone in our homes.\n  There are those who are working in large banks of employees who are \nrandomly, with computers, calling telephone numbers from banks of \ntelephone books, getting people on the line. And by the way, because \nthese computers dial multiple numbers at once, when one person answers, \nperhaps a second person is answering a nanosecond later, no one will be \non the line when they answer. That happens often. People should \nunderstand that comes from unsolicited phone calls with computer banks \nmaking calls. One person answers; the other doesn't get an answer. That \nis what is happening. It is enormously annoying.\n  Do people have an inherent right to make solicitation calls? Yes. But \nthe other question is, Do people who pay for their telephone service \neach month have a right to put their name on a registry saying: I \nreally don't want these calls; don't have them come into my telephone \ninstrument; I pay for the instrument and I don't want to be annoyed and \nI don't want to be interrupted by them? Do people have that right? Of \ncourse, they do. That is what this issue is about.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs in the Commerce \nCommittee last year, I held hearings on this. At one of the \nreauthorization hearings for the FTC, we had an entire panel devoted to \nthe discussion of a do not call registry. We had a hearing in which the \nFederal Trade Commission came up, the Commissioners themselves, and \ntalked to us about this issue. I had a member of the Federal Trade \nCommission come to Fargo, ND. We held a public hearing there on this \nsubject. This is not a foreign or strange subject to me nor to most of \nmy colleagues. As a result of that, we took action in reauthorizing the \nFederal Trade Commission to include funding to allow them to put \ntogether a Do Not Call Registry.\n  If you wonder whether the American people care about this, just \nremember these numbers. They put together a Do Not Call Registry and \nsaid to the people: If you think these unsolicited telephone calls are \nbothersome to you, if it is an intrusion on your family and an \ninterruption to your life and annoying to you and you want to stop \nthem, call and put your telephone number and your name on this \nregistry.\n  Guess what. In virtually a nanosecond, 50 million Americans have \nsaid: Count me out. I don't want to be a part of this unsolicited phone \ncall mess going on. Put my name on the list and get rid of these phone \ncalls. In the State of North Dakota, 131,000 people said: We don't want \nthese calls. We don't want the interruptions. We don't want the \nannoyance. Stop it.\n  Now one court has said somehow this is not operative, effective, \nbecause it is not authorized. So this afternoon the House will \nauthorize it, the Senate will authorize it, and the bill will go to the \nPresident and be signed.\n  I hope this court will understand that not only was it authorized, \nbut we were pleased this afternoon to authorize it a second time just \nto reinforce our determination with the American people that we believe \nthey have the power and they ought to have the ability to stop these \ncalls.\n  Let me make just a couple of additional points. Some say this is an \nimportant industry making these telephone calls, doing marketing. The \nanswer is, sure, it is. It employs people. We are not saying with this \nlegislation that you cannot make unsolicited phone calls. We are saying \nthe American people, however, have a right to decide they don't want to \nbe part of it; I don't want to receive them. This is empowering the \nAmerican people.\n  If there are people, as I said, who are lonely, have no one to talk \nto, who sit around all day with a desire to visit with somebody, if \nthey want to get these phone calls, God bless them. Let them get the \nphone calls, let them get the credit cards and sign up for multiple \nlong-distance services, and let them visit until they are visited out. \nI assume there are a few of those people. But in most cases the \nAmerican people are saying: Put my name on the list. I don't want to be \ninterrupted. I don't want unsolicited phone calls, especially during \nmealtime.\n  There is this peculiar quality of this industry to call only when \ndinner or supper is ready. Lord only knows how that occurs, but it \ndoes. So today we have said we are going to authorize this explicitly \nonce again, so that this Do Not Call list will not be interrupted. \nPeople whose names are on that list will be assured they will not \nreceive unsolicited calls.\n  I say to my colleague, Senator Ensign, I know he is working on this \nissue and has introduced legislation, and my colleague, Senator \nFeinstein, and others--again, we have worked hard on this in the \nCommerce Committee, going back to last July--July 17, at the \nreauthorization hearing I chaired. I will not go through all the \nnegotiations that went on with appropriations and the reauthorization, \nbut suffice it to say we believed very strongly the FTC should have \ntaken the action they did. We provided the funding. We implicitly \nprovided authorization for it, and today we are once again \nreauthorizing that which we have previously done just to satisfy some \ncourt in some corner of America, and in order to give comfort to those \n50 million Americans and the at least 130,000 North Dakotans who have \nsaid: Take my name off this list. The American people have that right. \nThis legislation allows them to keep that right. It is very important.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I thank the cosponsors of our legislation, especially \nmy chief cosponsors, Senator Feinstein from California, Senator Dorgan, \nSenator McCain, and Senator DeWine, as well as the 47 original \ncosponsors. I thank them all for being original cosponsors.\n  The legislation, however, we are dealing with now is identical \nlegislation sent over by the House because of a procedural matter. I am \nvery excited that this legislation is going to be\n\n[[Page S11960]]\n\npassed in just a little over an hour from now, because I think this is \nvery important legislation just for the peace of mind of a lot of the \npeople at home.\n  People say, ``Have you heard about this from your constituents?'' A \nlot of people who don't follow politics are talking about this issue in \nthe last couple of days. They have talked about it for years, but they \nhave heard about it in the news. They are talking about it around the \nwater cooler and they are talking about it wherever there is a coffee \nshop, wherever they are, because they want to make sure that on October \n1, when the Do Not Call list is supposed to be starting to be enforced, \nthat it actually happens.\n  There are over 50 million Americans, as was said, who have signed up \nfor this service. I am hazarding a guess, but I would say in the coming \nmonths there are going to be tens of millions more who will sign up for \nthis because so many people don't want to be bothered. As Senator \nDorgan talked about, the people who don't mind being bothered--for \nthem, they don't have to sign up for the Do Not Call list. If they want \nto continue to receive all those offers at home from telemarketers who \nare trying to sell a product--if people want to receive those calls at \nhome--I don't, but a lot of people probably want them--it is their \nright to have that coming into their household. I know in our household \nwe get bothered by this a lot, and you hate being rude to people when \nthey call up on the telephone. Nobody likes to get a call during \ndinner. You happen to have the phone all the way across the room. You \nget up and you walk across the room, and all of a sudden you realize it \nis a telemarketer. You are a little irritated and you don't want to be \nmean, but at the same time you don't want to be bothered. This Do Not \nCall list stops that from happening because the penalties in the Do Not \nCall list legislation are such that these telemarketers are going to \nstop.\n  So it is, to me, very exciting that we are actually going to act very \nquickly after what I believe the judge did was wrong. But that is fine; \nthe Senate and the House have quickly acted on this bill. We are going \nto make sure there is no question in the court's mind that this bill is \nauthorized.\n  I will conclude with this, and I will yield 5 minutes to my friend \nfrom Montana. It is really summed up in the Jerry Seinfeld episode \nwhere a telemarketer calls him and he asks the telemarketer, ``Can I \nhave your phone number?'' The telemarketer says, ``Why?'' Jerry says, \n``Because I want to call you during dinnertime and bother you.'' Of \ncourse, the telemarketer doesn't want to do that. But that is how \npeople feel. They want to call them and bug them to let them know how \nthey feel. That is the way people feel all across America.\n  It is important that we pass this legislation, and it is great to see \nthe bipartisan support for it.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada. I am \nwondering if the Senator from California wants to speak, if we are \ngoing back and forth here. I don't want to preempt her.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. There is no problem. I merely wanted to thank \neverybody. We heard about this through my Judiciary counsel, who \nfollows the courts, and we came to the floor and indicated we were \ngoing to put this together and we got a number of cosponsors. It was \nreally Senator Dorgan who worked out all of the protocols involved.\n  I thank the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and Senator Hollings, \nfor their work on this issue. I didn't realize the depth of involvement \nthat had existed. I find the court's decision so out of whack with what \nhas happened. So I am very pleased and I thank the Senator from Montana \nfor his courtesy.\n  I am glad to see that so many of our fellow colleagues, from both \nsides of the aisle, have joined us in this important and urgent effort, \nand that we were able to take up this legislation so quickly, in record \ntime. It was only about 24 hours ago that I first raised this issue on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Our bill is identical in language to the bill introduced in the House \nof Representatives, and we expect one or both of the bills to pass \ntoday.\n  The bill simply confirms what we all already thought was true, that \nthe Federal Trade Commission has the authority to implement a ``Do-Not-\nCall'' Registry.\n  We in Congress must act quickly, because this registry is due to go \ninto effect in just 1 week on October 1. Literally tens of millions of \nAmericans have registered their phone numbers not to be called by \ntelemarketers.\n  I have rarely seen an issue where so many millions of Americans have \nmade their strong preferences known.\n  Are we going to simply tell them that this was all a myth? Or is \nCongress going to act to honor our earlier commitments and to protect \nthis important right to privacy? These citizens expect us to act--and I \nbelieve that the momentum is clearly on our side.\n  If allowed to stand, the decision made by an Oklahoma district court \njudge that the National Do-Not-Call-Registry would strike a powerful \nblow against the basic private interests of millions of Americans.\n  Right now, these people are subjected to unwanted and annoying \nmarketing calls to their homes at all times of the day, including the \ndinner hour.\n  According to industry estimates, about 60 million telemarketing calls \nare made daily. With advances in technology and declining telephone \ncosts, consumers would face the prospect of an unprecedented barrage of \ncalls. And this is why the registry is so important.\n  The FTC's registry will give Americans who want to avoid these \nunsolicited sales pitches a chance to stop annoying intrusions into \ntheir home.\n  As we know, tens of millions of Americans have registered more than \n50 million phone numbers for this program. In the end, the Federal \nTrade Commission expects 60 percent of the Nation's households with \napproximately 60 million home phone lines to sign on to the registry.\n  This registry is crucial because it puts consumers in charge of the \nnumber of telemarketing calls they receive. Telemarketers who disregard \nthe registry could be fined up to $11,000 per call.\n  The Oklahoma district court yesterday ruled that the Do Not Call \nRegistry is ``invalid''--that is the word the judge used in his \ndecision--because it was created without congressional authority.\n  I find this conclusion surprising since Congress passed H.R. 395, the \nDo-Not-Call Implementation Act on February 13 of this year. The \nlegislation clearly authorizes the Federal Trade Commission and the \nFederal Communications Commission to collect fees sufficient to \nimplement the registry. And the Appropriations Committee granted $18 \nmillion for the program.\n  I also note that the FTC's rule came after an exhaustive comment \nperiod. The FTC announced its plan to proceed with the registry on \nDecember 18, 2002, after receiving 64,000 comments. The overwhelming \nmajority of these comments favored the creation of the registry.\n  Millions of Americans were promised protection from annoying, \nunwanted telemarketing calls starting October 1. They are outraged--and \nso are we--by this setback.\n  Congress must move now and unanimously adopt and pass legislation \nwhich grants the authority to the FTC, clearly and unequivocally--so \nthat no Federal judge can misunderstand it.\n  Many of us were taken by surprise yesterday, but by putting this \nlegislation to a vote now, we are doing the right thing. On October 1, \nlet's make sure that the millions of Americans who want their privacy \nprotected from these telemarketers are not disappointed.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee and everybody on the committee. You are probably hearing from \nthe core of that committee today, reacting to the disappointment that \nwe have gotten from the Oklahoma Federal District Court preventing the \nFederal Trade Commission from going forward and implementing the Do Not \nCall list.\n\n[[Page S11961]]\n\n  The Do Not Call legislation turned out to be the most popular and \nprobably the most necessary consumer initiative we have ever passed in \nthe history of this body. From day one, people started to sign up; that \nwas June 26. Up until now--you have heard the figures--over 50 million \npeople have registered, and 138,000 of those are in Montana.\n  So urgent was the public's need to stop intrusive telemarketers that \nin the first 14 hours of enrollment on June 16, 650,000 people called \nup. That gives us some idea of how consumers think of these \ntelemarketers.\n  The ill-considered decision yesterday by the Federal District Court \nin Oklahoma would prevent the Do Not Call list from going into effect \nnext Wednesday. The decision is dead wrong and its core assumption is \nthat the FTC acted without statutory authority in creating and \nadministering the Do Not Call list.\n  Let us make it very clear, Congress clearly granted the FTC the \nauthority to set up the Do Not Call list by passing the Do Not Call \nImplementation Act in February of this year. The act gave the agency \nauthority to collect fees from telemarketers and to establish and \nenforce the list. In fact, the Omnibus Appropriations Act in February \nalso authorized the FTC to enforce the Do Not Call list.\n  Rather than waiting around for an appeals court to overturn this \nwrongheaded decision, I am certainly glad the Congress has taken action \nvery swiftly. It did not take long. In fact, one of my good friends who \ndoes not serve in this body anymore, who served from North Carolina, \nsaid this is almost a june bug issue, and it really is. We do not have \nto put Americans through unwarranted intrusions into their lives by \ntelemarketing, and so we will pass this today.\n  I tell my good friend from North Dakota, my wife has it all figured \nout about telemarketers. We both may be home; the call comes in: Is Mr. \nBurns there? She says: I will call him--whether I am there or not. She \nlays the phone down and goes off and leaves it until we hear the little \ndisconnect: ``If you are trying to place a call, please hang up and try \nagain.'' So that is our attitude towards that.\n  By any estimate, telemarketers attempt almost 105 million calls \ndaily. The implementation of the Do Not Call list would reduce these \ncalls by almost 80 percent, and those are figures that are out now. So \nif they do not get the message by talking to a telephone that does not \nhave an ear on the other end of it, then we will take care of it this \nway.\n  People are rightly sick and tired of this endless interruption into \ntheir private lives. So I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I thank my good friend from Nevada for allowing me this time, and \nSenator Dorgan and the chairman of the full committee for acting this \nswiftly, because this takes care of it.\n  Let's make no bones about it, they clearly had the authority. They \nclearly had the funds to implement it. We gave it to them in \nappropriations and we gave them the authority this year. The \ntelemarketers did not choose to abide by that law. So I heartily \ncommend my good friends for offering this legislation.\n  By the way, if I am not on the list, you may put me on the list.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nInouye as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was just recollecting, as the Senator from Montana was \nspeaking, telemarketing is, of course, a legitimate business. It is an \nimportant business in many respects. But the point that my colleague, \nSenator Ensign, made is the American people also have their right, and \ntheir right is to put their name on a list to say, I do not want \nunsolicited calls.\n  They call almost everyone. I received a call some long while ago from \na telemarketer. I answered the phone, and the telemarketer said: May I \nspeak to Haley Dorgan please? I could tell immediately it was a \ntelemarketer. I said: You could, but I do not think she is going to buy \nanything. She is 4 years old.\n  They get lists and they just blizzard the country with telephone \ncalls to young and old. It is indiscriminate, and that is why this \nfervor has grown in this country to do something about giving the \nAmerican people the right to say they do not want these unsolicited \ncalls. That is what this legislation will do.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Yesterday, a Federal judge in Oklahoma voided the Federal \nTrade Commission's national Do Not Call list that was set to go into \neffect next week. This action frustrates the wishes of more than 48 \nmillion Americans who have signed up for the list.\n  I am pleased that we will overturn that judge's questionable decision \ntoday. Americans have spoken very clearly on this issue and it is our \nresponsibility to respond. Though a judge ruled that the FTC lacked \ncongressional authority to create this national Do Not Call Registry, I \nstrongly disagree and believe that earlier this year Congress \nexplicitly granted the Commission both the authority and the funding to \ncreate the registry.\n  Indeed, absent congressional action, the FTC's Do Not Call initiative \nwould have failed to become a reality this year. I discussed the matter \nwith FTC Chairman Tim Muris at a hearing before the Antitrust \nSubcommittee last September. He asked me for help in getting \ncongressional authority in order to raise fees necessary to implement \nthe Do Not Call list. We were able to grant the Commission this \nauthority in the consolidated appropriations resolution which passed in \nFebruary of this year. We further authorized the FTC's list in the Do \nNot Call Implementation Act on March 11, 2003.\n  These actions more than authorized the FTC's rulemaking in my view. \nThat said, this bill will make it crystal clear that Congress endorses, \nsupports, and authorizes the FTC to create a national Do Not Call \nRegistry.\n  I commend the FTC's hard work to create a national Do Not Call list. \nSuch action was long overdue. The deluge of telemarketing sales calls \nis the number one consumer complaint in this country. It is a problem \nthat has gotten out of control. The average American receives two to \nthree telemarketing calls per day. Some estimate that the telemarketing \nindustry is able to make 560 calls per second or roughly 24 million \ncalls per day. No wonder people feel like they are under siege in their \nown home.\n  Wisconsin recently implemented a similar, statewide Do Not Call list \nlast year. During the first 3-month registration period, more than 2 \nmillion residents placed their phone numbers on the list, which is 40 \npercent of Wisconsin's population. Such a positive response demands \nfurther action at the Federal level. That is why we in Congress acted \nearlier this year to ensure that the FTC's Do Not Call list became a \nreality. Should we need to do more to overcome a court's objections, we \ncan and shall do it today. Providing consumers the option to stop \ntelemarketing calls is something on which we can all agree.\n  Given the enormous response of nearly 50 million Americans who have \nsigned up in less than 3 months, the Do Not Call list is clearly \nneeded. Though I am troubled by the court's decision, we can set the \nrecord straight and authorize the FTC's action. I urge quick passage of \nthis legislation so that the Do Not Call list can start up as scheduled \non October 1, 2003.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, unless the Senator from Nevada has time he \nwants to consume, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. \nPryor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their hard work \non this issue. It is a very important issue for people all across the \ncountry.\n  Yesterday, I received the news that the Federal court in Oklahoma had \ndecided that we had no authority over the Federal Do Not Call list.\n  I must tell you that as a United States Senator and as a former \nattorney general and as a lawyer and just as a citizen, I have all the \nrespect in the world for our Federal courts and our judges and our \nlegal system. I just happen to think they were wrong in this ruling.\n  At the same time, I am proud to join with my colleagues, both in the \nSenate and in the House, in efforts to try to\n\n[[Page S11962]]\n\nmake sure the courts understand that very clearly there is authority \nfor the Federal Trade Commission to establish a National Do Not Call \nlist.\n  I think it is very clear that the people have spoken on this issue. \nBack in February of this year, the Congress passed what we thought was \nthe authorization and the funding for Do Not Call. Then, just a few \nweeks later, President Bush signed it into law.\n  I know a lot of people have been sharing their stories about \ntelemarketers. I can tell you from firsthand experience, from back in \n1998 when I traveled the State of Arkansas extensively, running for \nattorney general--that is what I did before I was elected to this \naugust body--everywhere I went, it seemed as though every community I \nwent into, every group I talked to, it didn't matter who they were, \nwhat they had on their mind, they wanted to talk about telemarketing. \nThey would say: Please, is there anything you can do to have these \ntelemarketers stop calling us?\n  I said: Yes. We in Arkansas had one of the first--not the very first \nbut one of the first--State do not call systems that we passed in 1999. \nIt had very few exceptions to it. It was something we were proud of. We \nhad to charge $5 because, where Congress appropriated some dollars for \nthis Federal system, we did not have a State legislative appropriation \nfor our State system. But regardless of that, even though we charged \nfor it, we had thousands upon thousands of Arkansans sign up for our \nState do not call system.\n  I tell you, everywhere I go in Arkansas today, people still thank me \nfor the State's do not call system.\n  One thing we learned during that process was that for most people, \ntelemarketers' calls are an annoyance. People get tired of being \nbothered during dinnertime, when they are trying to do the homework \nwith the children, when they are trying to put the kids down--whatever \nthe case may be. But for some Americans, a small percentage, \ntelemarketing also has the element of fraud to it.\n  Many people in this country--mostly seniors but not all, but many \npeople in this country are taken advantage of via the telephone. If you \nlook at the FBI statistics--I haven't seen the most recent round, but I \nwas familiar with them in my 4 years in the attorney general's office--\nit is a small percentage of fraud, but let me tell you, it is a lot of \ndollars every single year. It is millions upon millions of dollars that \nare swindled away from people by use of the telephone.\n  I want to touch on something that Senator Dorgan said a few moments \nago. The telemarketing industry is not evil. They are just doing their \njob. We understand that. We appreciate that. It is a legitimate \nindustry. It is an industry that has a lot of hard-working people in \nit. They do a lot of great things. We are not critical of the industry \nper se.\n\n  We know there are some bad actors out there. I think a National Do \nNot Call program will help clear up those bad actors, just like we have \nbeen able to do on a State-by-State basis, when the States pass these \nkinds of provisions.\n  But telemarketing is, for many Americans, an annoyance that they just \ndo not want to have. After all, we are talking about the privacy of \npeople's homes. They should be able to have some control over the types \nof calls they get.\n  If they get solicitations, if they don't want those, there should be \nsome mechanism where they can shut those off on the front end. That is \nwhat the Federal Do Not Call program will do. That is why I think you \nhave seen so many people in the House and in the Senate come to the \nrespective floors today and argue that we should take this step that we \nare about to take today.\n  One last point. In the last few weeks, ever since it was announced \nwith toll-free numbers and Web sites that there would be a Federal Do \nNot Call program, and how to sign up, et cetera, there have been about \n50 million phone numbers added to this list. That is an amazing number. \nFifty million Americans can't be wrong.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent Senator Reid of Nevada be added \nas an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I just in less than a minute say we have not \nmentioned on the Senate floor, and we should, that the Federal \nCommunications Commission took action that was complementary and action \nthat coordinates with the Federal Trade Commission because action was \nneeded by the Federal Communications Commission with respect to common \ncarriers in areas under their jurisdiction to also create a do not call \nlist, which is expansive.\n  So while I, with some of my colleagues, have been critical of the \nFederal Communications Commission on other issues on the Senate floor \nin recent weeks, I did want to say that the Federal Communications \nCommission deserves our plaudits and deserves credit for moving very \nquickly to fill in a gap with respect to a do not call list. All of our \ndiscussion is about the Federal Trade Commission, but, again, I think \nthe Federal Trade Commission has contributed substantially, and I \ncompliment them for that, with the leadership of Michael Powell and all \nthe Commissioners.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent Senator Don Nickles be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to spend a couple of minutes \ntalking a little more about this legislation. First of all, this chart \nthat we have in back of us--this graphs the calls and online \nregistering to the Do Not Call center. This started June 27, 2003, \nwhich is the far left side of the graph. In blue or purple there is the \namount of e-mails that came in, the way the people registered on line.\n  In the middle is 1-888-382-1222, the telephone number. About 11 \nmillion came in there. In the yellow at the bottom which started in \nJuly, about 8.5 million people came in. Those were numbers that came in \nfrom the States.\n  There are over 31 million people just since June 27 who have \nregistered online. So we see, for a total of a little over 50 million \npeople, how rapidly people have signed up to say we do not want to \nreceive telemarketing phone calls.\n  The key is people are saying we don't want to be bothered. Part of \nfreedom, it seems to me, is the freedom from being bothered by people \nwhen you are in your own home. Telemarketers contend that, just as if \nthey are sending mail, somebody who is sending mail to somebody's home, \nthey have the right to call somebody in their home.\n  The American people are saying no; we don't want to receive those \nphone calls. Mail they can just glance at and throw away. They don't \nactually have to get on the telephone and speak to somebody. \nTelemarketers require somebody to pick up the phone. If it is ringing, \nyou have to go because you don't want to miss an important phone call. \nMaybe your kids are out or something, you don't want to miss \nan important phone call, and it turns out to be a telemarketer.\n\n  Nowadays, because of answering machines, you have a situation where \nyou come home and it says: Hi, this is Fred--or this is Lisa or whoever \nit is. Please give me a call my number is, and you don't know who it \nis.\n  Then you call the number back and you find out it is a telemarketer. \nSo you have just now wasted the time listening to the message, and you \nhave wasted the time making the telephone call.\n  So we have people stealing valuable time, and time is our most \nprecious commodity. That is why so many people want to sign up for the \nDo Not Call list.\n  We want to remind people--and I think this is going to happen a lot--\nthat the telephone number is 1-888-382-1222. That is the number that \npeople will be able to call, and can call today to sign up for when \nthis goes into effect on October 1. They just call up, very simple, add \ntheir name, give them their telephone number, add it to the list.\n  If they want to register on line, it is on the World Wide Web, \ndonotcall.gov. It is all small letters. They go on there, they sign up, \nput their telephone numbers in, and they are added to the list.\n\n[[Page S11963]]\n\nIt is simple for people to do. I think the simplicity is why it has \nbeen so wildly successful up to this point.\n  On October 1, when it goes into effect, that is when people will \nstart having some peace of mind at home. At a time where families need \nmore time together, they need more time to talk, I think it is \nimportant, especially around dinnertime when there are so many \ndistractions--that is a prime time for telemarketers to call, at dinner \ntime. Families don't have enough time together as it is now. I think to \nhave those distractions around dinnertime is even more disruptive of \nthat important family time.\n  We need to encourage families to be together. This certainly will \nresult in fewer interruptions around the dinner table. That is why I so \nstrongly support the legislation and why I sponsored this legislation \nto repeal what the Federal judge did in Oklahoma.\n  I don't currently see anyone who wishes to speak. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to address \nthe judicial action that would temporarily prevent the National Do Not \nCall Registry from going into effect.\n  This privacy-oriented program was recently implemented by the Federal \nTrade Commission and was supposed to go into effect by October 1. That \nis just about a week away.\n  I am proud to join my colleague from Nevada, the ranking member of \nthe Commerce Committee, Senator Ensign, in cosponsoring this bill. This \nbill ratifies the authority of the FTC to establish the National Do Not \nCall Registry and allows the program to go into effect as drafted by \nthe FTC.\n  As you may or may not know, Alaska is about a 4-hour time difference \nfrom Washington, DC. It seems like just about my dinner hour in Alaska \nwhen telemarketers throughout the country get kicked into full gear. I \nknow when my family and I are interrupted at the dinner table by these \ncalls, we feel invaded. I can only imagine that my other friends and \nneighbors are equally upset. Sometimes we are outraged that our right \nto privacy is invaded every night when we are sitting down to have \ndinner with our families. Our lives are busy enough throughout the day \nwith work, school, homework, and just catching up with one another and \npreparing for the next day. The last thing in the world we want when we \nsit down for the quiet time is to be interrupted by the telemarketing \ncompany that believes it is their right to disturb us during our few \nminutes of family time.\n  Those who seek to stop the implementation of this program assert that \nthey are protected by the right to free speech. I say it is the people \nwho have the right to decide that they do not want to be hounded by \ntelemarketers and those who would interrupt the sanctity of their \nhomes.\n\n  The entire purpose of the FTC's National Do Not Call Registry program \nis to allow Americans to opt out of receiving these annoying phone \ncalls. In my judgment, the court's decision to stop this program tilts \nthe privacy rights out of balance in favor of those telemarketing \ncompanies.\n  In June, the Anchorage Daily News--which is my hometown newspaper--\npublished an editorial supporting the National Do Not Call Registry. \nThey wrote about an Alaskan by the name of Ron Hammett who says he \nsometimes gets two or three calls a day. Mr. Hammett is a 76-year-old \nretiree who spent more than 2 hours waiting to get through the \nregistration process once the FTC rule came out. Now he is going to \nwake up today--or he woke up this morning--to find out that his time \nand the time of many other Alaskans was wasted.\n  In just a few short months since the FTC adopted these rules, nearly \n50 million people have registered to stop these phone calls.\n  My State of Alaska has its own do not call program that was created \nin 1996--it is called the Black Dot Program--which allows telephone \nsubscribers to elect to have a black dot placed next to their name in \nthe Alaska phone books.\n  A computerized version of the list is made available to the \ntelemarketers, but the problem is they are not required to use it. If \nthey call any telephone customer with a black dot next to his or her \nname, they are subject to a fine of up to $5,000, whether the \ntelemarketer uses the list or not.\n  The problem with Alaska's statute is that there has been only one \ncomplaint filed since it was implemented. Most of the telemarketers are \nlocated outside the State of Alaska, and the State law doesn't have the \nteeth that the FTC rule contains to go after these outside groups. \nAlaskans, quite honestly, are looking forward to the implementation of \nthis FTC rule to give them the peace and the quiet they have sought for \nso long. We need this FTC rule to protect our citizens and their \nprivacy.\n  Americans have spoken. They don't like to be disturbed by unwanted \nand harassing phone calls from people selling products over the phone. \nThrough this legislation we can have that peace and privacy within our \nown homes.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this legislation. I hope the body will act \nquickly on this measure. I am very pleased to see us moving so rapidly \nat this point.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Pryor \nbe added as a cosponsor to S. 1655.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I believe I have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes. I yield 5 minutes of my time to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise in strong support of this legislation. In my time in the \nSenate, I have never seen legislation move so quickly through the House \nand Senate for any issue.\n  Why? There are three reasons. The first is, of course, the need for \nthis legislation. Fifty million people have signed up on a registry and \nare expecting it to work October 1. We should fulfill those \nexpectations. None of us, me included, because this has happened to my \nfamily when we sit down to dinner all the time, hopping up and down \nlike jackrabbits to answer the phone and then hear someone on the phone \ntrying to sell you something. It drives you crazy. No. 1 is the need.\n  No. 2 is the fact the court decision was so goofy. The bottom line \nis, if you read the legislative language, if you read the statutes, in \nmy judgment, there is no question we granted authority. I think the \njudge went out of his way to try to throw out this list. This may be an \nexample of judges making law rather than interpreting law that we have \ntalked about for so long. On this, we all agree that we do not want the \njudge making law, particularly making law that so goes against the will \nof this Congress and the American people.\n  The bottom line is, our intent was clear from the language of the \nFebruary 13, 2003, statute called the Do Not Call Implementation Act. I \ncannot understand how a court would conclude Congress would have \ndirected the FTC to implement the registry if it had not assumed that \nit had authorized the FTC to make the registry, either in previous law \nor through the implementation act itself.\n  If this were not enough to demonstrate Congress's intent on this \nissue, on February 20, 2003, the Omnibus Appropriations Act was signed \ninto law which authorized the FTC to ``implement and enforce the do not \ncall provisions of the Telemarketing Sales Act.''\n  That is as clear as the nose on your face. The court's decision is \nbased on an overly technical view that ignores the clear intent of \nCongress. So the second reason we are moving so quickly is this law was \nso poorly interpreted by the judge.\n\n[[Page S11964]]\n\n  The third is this has a consensus behind it. It is needed. There are \na lot of laws that are needed but do not have a consensus. It was \nthrown out by a court in a strange decision. There is almost a \nuniversal consensus that this is the right thing to do.\n  The telemarketing industry feels badly about this. I understand there \nare many people who work in this industry. They are going to have to \nfind a way to telemarket--which is a good thing when people want \ntelemarketing--they will have to refine their processes. I would not \nmind refining this list and allowing people to file, if we could \ntechnically, to say I only want to get calls about mortgages or I only \nwant to get calls about garden tools, but not to subject everyone to \nanswer the phone, particularly at dinner time and evening time when the \nfamily is home alone and relaxing. This has happened in my family. It \ndoes not make any sense.\n  It is a good law. I wish there were more days in Congress that we do \nimportant things in a bipartisan way without tarrying. Let's savor it \nwhile we can.\n  I make one additional point. This approach can also work for another \nproblem facing American consumers very similar to the annoying \ntelemarketing call: e-mail spam. As in telemarketing calls, spam \ntraffic is also growing at a geometric rate. It has become more than an \nannoyance. It is now a real danger to the future of the e-mail part of \nthe Internet. Fifty percent of all e-mail is spam. What was a simple \nannoyance last year has become a major concern this year and could \ncripple one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century next year if \nnothing is done. We should be doing the same thing against spam.\n\n  Admittedly, it is easier to cut off a telemarketer than a spammer, \nbut the same basic concept applies and the telemarketing provisions \nworked. The anti-e-mail spam provisions are the best we have to deal \nwith spam right now.\n  This morning the Judiciary Committee passed the Criminal Spam Act of \n2003. I was proud to cosponsor that along with my colleagues, Senator \nHatch and Senator Leahy. For the first time that will criminalize some \nof the spammer's favorite tricks. Those that repeatedly use predatory \npractices to evade filtering software will face stiff punishment, \nincluding the potential of jail time, but we should add the registry to \nthose provisions. I did not do that in committee today, but I hope we \ncan do it on the floor when it comes forward.\n  A spam registry such as the Do Not Call Registry has broad consumer \nsupport. It has bipartisan support. Senator Graham of South Carolina \nand I are the lead sponsors. The registry provides parents with the \nunique opportunity to register their children's e-mail addresses to \nprevent unwanted advertisements that go to our children for pornography \nand lots of things the kids should not see.\n  I commend my colleagues for moving so quickly to defend consumers \nagainst unwanted telemarketing calls. Fifty million people cannot be \nwrong. I hope we will do the same and move with the same speed and \nurgency when we deal with e-mail spam and create an anti-e-mail spam \nregistry as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, we all know that fraud can be very much a \nproblem when it comes to telemarketing, but we also know a Do Not Call \nregistry is a very positive consumer tool against fraud. By that I mean \nif you signed up for the National Do Not Call plan and you still get a \ncall, you know something is up. That ought to be your first tip that \nsomething may be amiss with this call. This is another reason I thank \nmy friend from New York for his very wise comments.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator yielding \nto me. We are in the position of being able to yield back all of our \ntime except 6 minutes for the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that following the next vote on passage of the Do Not \nCall legislation, the Senate immediately proceed to executive session \nand two consecutive votes on the following nominations on today's \nExecutive Calendar: Calendar Nos. 359 and 360.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 4 minutes equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees prior to the second \nand third vote; further, that following the votes, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I yield back all time on our side.\n  Mr. REID. As soon as Senator Dodd arrives, we will use the remainder \nof our time. We have been told he is on his way--from where, we do not \nknow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time on our side to \nSenator Dodd from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am confident my colleague from North \nDakota will probably want to use 5 minutes of that 6 minutes. He \nprobably has not exhausted every thought on the subject matter. I will \nbe happy to yield back some of my time to him.\n  I wish to add my voice and thanks to the managers of this proposal \nand to commend the other body for their efforts in acting as quickly as \nthey have on the subject matter. I am familiar enough with it because I \nintroduced legislation about 2 years ago in this area. Connecticut was \none of the early States--I know there have been a number of States that \nhave adopted a do not call list--to adopt a do not call list in the \nyear 2000. In December 2001, I introduced a bill very similar to the \none Connecticut has produced. Either since then or before then, other \nStates--including Alabama, Alaska, the home of the distinguished \nSenator Murkowski, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, and \nothers--have also enacted legislation.\n  This is a very positive outcome. Clearly, what has happened is, as we \nare talking about the use of the telephone, the telemarketing idea, \nAmerica has phoned in and said to please give them some relief. We just \nwould like a few minutes of privacy and quiet. It is hard enough to get \na family together with all the pressures on them today. When you might \njust be able to get them to sit down for a meal, that phone starts \nringing. What they are saying is: Give me the choice of saying I don't \nwant to be bothered and buy this. They ought to have that right.\n  The obvious problem with this bill--I say it is a problem, but I am \nconfident we can correct it; it is the difference between the bill I \nintroduced several years ago and the one before us today--is the \nloophole that allows any prior business relationship to be an exception \nto the otherwise clear prohibition supported by this legislation.\n  As was pointed out in one news account in the last day or so, there \nhas been a tremendous surge of telemarketing in the last number of \nweeks by businesses trying to establish a ``prior business \nrelationship'' with a customer base in this country which would then \nallow them to become part of the exception even under this legislation.\n\n  The point I am making is, even though we will pass this bill--and I \nam very glad we are doing so; again, I commend the authors for moving \nas rapidly as they are on this legislation--we have not heard the end \nof this issue. There are going to be people coming back, once they \ndiscover that any prior business relationship pretty much will allow \nthe exception to occur, which means you will have that phone continue \nto ring. And I presume they are going to be asking us to come back and \neven close the loophole down further.\n  Much as we have in Connecticut and as other States are doing this. As \nI've\n\n[[Page S11965]]\n\nsaid, Connecticut has enacted legislation and the bill I introduced \nmirrors my State's efforts in that regard.\n  Justice Brandeis said it so eloquently years and years ago, as he \nalways could, this wonderful, brilliant mind of a Supreme Court \nJustice. He always had the ability of taking a difficult concept and \nsimplifying it in terms that were so understandable by everyone. He \nsaid: Privacy is nothing more than the simple right to be left alone. \nThat is what we are really talking about. He couldn't have imagined, \nwhen he said that, the technology that would make it possible for \ntelemarketing to occur. But the right to be left alone is really at the \nheart of what we are talking about--the right to say to someone: You \ndon't have the right to call me anytime you want. I should have some \nability to control that intrusive invasion in the privacy of my \nfamily's life.\n  I am glad the Federal Trade Commission acted. It certainly made a \ndifference. But clearly we need to respond to the court's decision in \nthis matter, and we are doing that by adopting this legislation.\n  I am pleased to add my name as a cosponsor. I implore my colleagues \nin their respective committees to take a look at the bill I have \nintroduced. I know others have introduced legislation, but take a look \nat this bill. Let's monitor what happens over the coming months to see \nif we are achieving the desired results that this legislation is \ndesigned to achieve. If not, we may have to go a bit further along the \nlines I have suggested. I am sure others have as well.\n  With that, I am pleased to be a part of this effort and congratulate \nthe authors of it.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, yesterday, the United States District Court \nfor the Western District of Oklahoma declared the Federal Trade \nCommission's national Do-Not-Call registry invalid after concluding \nthat the Commission lacked the authority to implement the rule. Today, \nI stand here with my colleagues to set the record straight--H.R. 3161, \nwhich the House passed earlier this morning by a vote of 412-8, \nprovides congressional authorization for the creation and \nimplementation of the Do-Not-Call registry.\n  The Do-Not-Call registry provides a very important service--\npreventing undue intrusions from marketers. Citizens should have the \nright not to be disturbed by unsolicited calls in their own homes and \nthe Do-Not-Call registry empowers citizens to stop these calls.\n  Support for the registry is unprecedented. To date, after only four \nmonths, the registry contains over 50 million phone numbers. In Maine \nalone, over 241,000 phone numbers have been registered and this number \nis growing everyday. Ultimately, the Federal Trade Commission expects \n60 percent of the Nation's households to sign onto the registry \npotentially blocking eighty percent of telemarketing calls.\n  Specifically, the Federal registry will supplement State Do-Not-Call \nlists. It works by requiring telemarketers to search the registry every \n3 months and synchronize their call lists with the phone numbers on the \nregistry. If you don't want to be disturbed by marketing calls, you \nsimply register online with the FTC or call a toll free number and \nrequest that your telephone number be added to the registry. More \nimportantly, this law has enforcement power--a telemarketer who \ndisregards the national Do-Not-Call registry could potentially be fined \nup to $11,000 for each call.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nat the Oklahoma Federal district court decision preventing the Federal \nTrade Commission from going forward on implementing the Do Not Call \nlist.\n  The Do Not Call list has proven to be one of the most popular and \nnecessary consumer initiatives in history. From the day consumers have \nbeen able to sign up for the Do Not Call list on June 26, over 50 \nmillion Americans have registered, including 138,841 in Montana. So \nurgent was the public's need to stop intrusive telemarketers that in \nthe first 14 hours of enrollment on June 26, over 650,000 citizens \nadded their numbers to the list.\n  Yesterday's ill-considered decision by the Federal district court in \nOklahoma would prevent the Do Not Call list from going into effect next \nWednesday. The decision is dead wrong in its core assumption that the \nFTC acted without statutory authority in creating and administering the \nDo Not Call list. In fact, Congress clearly granted the FTC the \nauthority to set up the Do Not Call list by passing the Do Not Call \nImplementation Act in February of this year. This act gave the agency \nauthority to collect fees from telemarketers to establish and enforce \nthe list. The Omnibus Appropriations Act in February also authorized \nthe FTC to enforce the do not call provisions.\n  Rather than waiting for an appeals court to overturn this wrongheaded \ndecision, we must act quickly so that Americans do not have to suffer \nthe needless and unwarranted intrusions into their lives by aggressive \ntelemarketing. Unwanted telemarketing calls have reached unacceptable \nlevels in our country. By one estimate, telemarketers attempt almost \n105 million calls daily; implementation of the Do Not Call list would \nreduce these calls by almost 80 percent.\n  Americans are rightly sick and tired of these endless interruptions \nin their private lives, which often take place during the dinner hour, \nor at times when parents wish to spend uninterrupted quality time with \ntheir children. By responding rapidly to overturn this reckless and \nsloppy decision by the Oklahoma district court, Congress sends a clear \nmessage that this destructive hyper-marketing will no longer be \ntolerated. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that would \nleave no doubt in anyone's mind as to the FTC's authority to maintain \nand implement the Do Not Call Registry.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I was disappointed to learn that early \nthis week a Federal district judge issued a ruling to delay the October \n1 implementation of the national Do Not Call Registry.\n  Sign-up for the national Do Not Call list began June 27. To date, the \nregistry has grown to 50 million Americans who submitted their \ntelephone numbers and unequivocally said they do not want to receive \nbusiness solicitation calls.\n  There has been near unanimity that the Oklahoma Federal judge simply \ngot it wrong when he found that Congress did not give the Federal Trade \nCommission the requisite statutory authority to create and implement a \nnationwide Do Not Call Registry.\n  To clarify the matter once and for all, the pending bill explicitly \nauthorizes the Federal Trade Commission to compile and implement a Do \nNot Call Registry, pursuant to the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and \nAbuse Prevention Act.\n  The bill also ratifies the relevant provisions of the Telemarketing \nSales Rules promulgated by the Commission early this year.\n  A nationwide Do Not Call Registry is particularly important to the \ncitizens of New Jersey. Although 27 States already have local do not \ncall lists, some States, such as my home State of New Jersey, have not \nyet enacted do not call legislation.\n  A New Jersey State law is expected to go into effect next spring, but \nthe residents of New Jersey and the other 23 States deserve the \nprotection that the FTC rule provides.\n  The FTC's rules are reasonable. They require telemarketers to check \nthe Do Not Call list every 3 months to see who does not want to be \ncalled. Those who call listed people face fines up to $11,000 for a \nviolation. Consumers would be allowed to file complaints to an \nautomated phone or online system.\n  There are about 166 million residential phone numbers in the United \nStates and an additional 150 million cell-phone numbers. The FTC \nexpects 60 percent of the Nation's households to sign onto the \nregistry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill which ratifies the FTC's Do \nNot Call Registry, permitting implementation of the registry on October \n1.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof this important measure, which will likely pass the House and Senate \nby an overwhelming margin and in record speed. This bill makes it \nperfectly\n\n[[Page S11966]]\n\nclear that the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, has the authority to \nimplement and enforce the Do Not Call program that until yesterday's \ncourt ruling was scheduled to go into effect on October 1. I am usually \nnot in favor of quick legislative reaction to lower court decisions. We \nhave an appellate process to determine if a lower court is mistaken, as \nthis one surely was, and that process serves us well. However, this \ncase is different, and I am pleased that this Congress is prepared to \nreact so quickly and so decisively.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that the FTC has the authority to create \nthe Do Not Call program. It is true that the Telephone Consumer \nProtection Act, TCPA, passed in 1991, allowed the Federal \nCommunications Commission, FCC, not the FTC, to create a national \ndatabase of telephone numbers from Americans who wanted to avoid \ntelephone solicitation. But in 1995, in the Telemarketing and Consumer \nFraud and Abuse Prevention Act, TCFAPA, Congress also directed the FTC \nto establish rules on telemarketing activities. The FCC and the FTC \nhave jurisdiction over different telemarketers, so it makes sense that \nthere is some overlapping authority.\n  The FTC initially promulgated the Telemarketing Sales Rule, TSR, \nwhich contained a variety of restrictions on telemarketing, such as \nprohibiting such calls between the hours of 9 pm and 8 am and requiring \ntelemarketers to cease making calls to consumers who specifically \nrequest not to be contacted again. Complaints about telemarketing \ncontinued and in 2000, the FTC began a proceeding to consider revisions \nto the TSR. That led to the adoption of the national Do Not Call \nRegistry. The FTC announced the final rule on December 18, 2002.\n  Just a few months ago, in March 2003, Congress passed and the \nPresident signed Do Not Call Implementation Act, DNCIA. That statute \nauthorized the FTC to collect fees sufficient to create and administer \nthe database. The Consolidated Appropriations Act passed a month \nearlier also authorized the FTC to collect fees for the enforcement and \nimplementation of the program, estimated at $18.1 million for fiscal \nyear 2003. With this history, it is as clear as day that Congress has \nat least ratified the FTC's view of its statutory authority to create \nthe Do Not Call list. Simply put, the district court decision yesterday \nwas wrong.\n  Mr. President, the public response and support for the Do Not Call \nprogram have been tremendous. Americans have voluntarily registered \nover 50 million phone numbers on the database. They have waited a long \ntime for this measure to finally be implemented. Months ago, they began \nadding their phone numbers to the list with the expectation that on \nOctober 1, finally, the calls would stop. That is why we must act \ndecisively to reverse the court decision. It adversely affects millions \nof people. It thwarts a good program that has received overwhelming \npublic support and participation. And it ignores clear evidence of \ncongressional authorization. Even the few months that it would take to \nreverse the decision, and I am convinced it ultimately would be \nreversed, would be too long. The time has come for the national Do Not \nCall program to go into effect, and for Americans to be able to eat \ndinner or watch TV with their families free of interruptions by \ntelephone solicitors. I am proud to support this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support the FTC's authority to establish \na Do Not Call Registry, I find myself in good and widespread company. \nMany in the Senate, like many of my constituents in Vermont, share the \nfrustration that I have with the recent district court decision \nstriking down the Do Not Call Registry established at the Federal Trade \nCommission. Apparently we in Congress need to make things a little more \nclear, and this is what we are doing with this legislation: We \nauthorize the FTC to set up and operate such a registry.\n  Vermont has been a leader in protecting the privacy and peace of its \nhouseholds from unwanted telemarketing calls. Federal law currently \nrequires individual companies to remove consumers from their calling \nlists if the consumers ask them to do so. There is also a national \n``telephone preference service'' registry to which consumers can submit \ntheir names and which telemarketers can consult to avoid calling those \nwho do not wish to hear from them--but industry compliance is entirely \nvoluntary. Two years ago, Vermont enacted a law which gives consumers a \nprivate right of action against companies that continue to call after \nbeing requested to cease. Vermonters can also sue if they are called by \na telemarketer after they have put their name on the national \n``telephone preference service'' registry. The FTC has expressed no \nintention of attempting to pre-empt such state systems, and I hope that \nfederal agencies continue to respect the efforts and institutions \nestablished at the state level. Federal agencies should not be in the \nbusiness of undercutting state efforts that are pursuing these same \ngoals.\n  Those goals are simple and laudable. People should be able to enjoy \nthe peace and quiet of their own homes, undisturbed by unsolicited \nsales calls. Of course, some consumers welcome such calls, and they \ncertainly should be able to receive them. But for the thousands of \nVermonters, and the millions of other Americans, who do not want to \nreceive such calls, the FTC's Do Not Call Registry is a long-awaited \nrelief. I understand that more than 50 million households have signed \nup, many of them, on-line, to be included in the Do Not Call Registry, \nwhich is set to begin its operations next week. This is an astonishing \nnumber of people, and this overwhelming response to the FTC's \nannouncement is the best possible affirmation of the need for and of \nthe good sense of the plan.\n  The Do Not Call Registry should also appeal to enlightened \ntelemarketers. They do not, of course, want to waste time and effort \ntalking to people who do not wish to hear from them, for whatever \nreason. Once the registry is operational--and I hope that this bill \nwill meet with speedy approval and make that so--telemarketers will be \nable to focus their resources, their time and personnel, on the \nhouseholds for which they provide a useful service. Consumers will be \nbetter served, the companies seeking to make sales will be better off, \nand telemarketers will be more effective for both their corporate \nclients and the potential customers they contact.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill, H.R. \n3161. The national Do Not Call Registry is a sensible way to protect \nthe privacy of the American people. It deserves our support, and it \ndeserves this effort to allow the registry to begin serving the public.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on the third reading of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 3161) was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the next two \nvotes be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support for the \nnominee for the Southern District Court of California, Dana Makoto \nSabraw.\n  I want to emphasize the excellent process that we have in place to \nselect District Court nominees in California. In a truly bipartisan \nfashion, the White House Counsel, Senator Feinstein and I worked \ntogether to create four judicial advisory committees for the State of \nCalifornia, one in each Federal judicial district in the State.\n  Each committee has a membership of six individuals: three appointed \nby the White House, and three appointed jointly by Senator Feinstein \nand me. Each member's vote counts equally, and a majority is necessary \nfor recommendation of a candidate.\n  The nominee before the Senate this evening was reviewed by the \nSouthern District Committee and strongly recommended. I continue to \nsupport this excellent bipartisan process and the high quality nominees \nit has produced.\n  Judge Sabraw has roots in my area of California, Marin County. From \nthere, he has embarked on a very impressive legal career and served the \npeople of my State with distinction. He currently is a judge on the San \nDiego Superior Court.\n  He is a graduate of San Diego State University and the McGeorge \nSchool of Law at the University of the Pacific.\n  Beyond his service on the bench, he is very involved with the \ncommunity, receiving commendation from the Pan Asian Lawyers of San \nDiego for his community outreach efforts.\n  The Southern District will benefit greatly from the exemplary \nservices of Judge Sabraw, and I fully support confirmation of this \nnominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We yield back our time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nnomination of Dana Makoto Sabraw for the United States District Court \nfor the Southern District of California.\n  Judge Sabraw has nearly two decades of experience as a litigator and \nas a jurist. He began his legal career as an associate with the firm of \nPostel & Parma in 1985, then joined the nationally recognized firm of \nBaker & McKenzie in 1989.\n  In 1995, he was appointed to the North County Municipal Court of San \nDiego County, where he was named Presiding Judge in 1998. That same \nyear, he was appointed to the San Diego Superior Court, and in 2000 was \nnamed Criminal Presiding Judge.\n  Judge Sabraw is a proven scholar, a disciplined judge, and a noted \nhumanitarian. He will make an outstanding addition to the Federal bench \nof the Southern District of California. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting his nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are now turning to the \nnomination of Dana Makoto Sabraw for the Southern District of \nCalifornia. This well-qualified nominee is the product of the exemplary \nbipartisan commission that Senators Feinstein and Boxer have worked so \nhard to maintain. It is a testament to their diligence that we have \nsuch stellar nominees heading to California's Federal courts.\n  Judge Sabraw has served for 8 years on the State trial bench. Prior \nto his appointment to the bench, Judge Sabraw was a partner and \nassociate at Baker & McKenzie in San Diego. In addition to Judge \nSabraw's public service as a judge, he has also been active in his \ncommunity.\n  As an attorney, he received Certificates of Appreciation from the Pan \nAsian Lawyers of San Diego for his service to the association and its \ncommunity outreach programs and recognition New Entra Casa for his pro \nbono work. Also as a private attorney, Mr. Sabraw provided pro bono \nservices to the Legal Aid Society of Santa Barbara Project Outreach for \nseveral years. He also founded Positive Impact Program in 1998, a \nprogram in which the court, its staff, the Bar Association of North San \nDiego County, the local DAs office and others partnered with the local \nschool districts to educate fifth graders about the justice system. The \nprogram involved a class curriculum, school assembly, mock trial, tour \nof the courthouse, and essay contest and reached approximately 6,000 \nstudents in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods.\n  The Southern District of California is the busiest Federal district \nin the Nation. In light of their demanding caseload, the Judiciary \nCommittee expedited consideration of nominations to the Southern \nDistrict. The Judiciary Committee held hearings for Dana Makoto Sabraw \nand Judge Burns, also nominated to this Southern District, just before \nthe August recess and they were unanimously reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee at our first meeting on September 4. That was 3 weeks ago. It \nis unfortunate that Judge Sabraw has been pending on the floor all \nmonth but I am pleased that we are voting on him today. Two more \nnominees to two additional vacancies recently created for the Southern \nDistrict of California were voted out of the Judiciary Committee today.\n  Senator Feinstein also deserves much credit for working so hard to \ncreate these additional judgeships in the Department of Justice \nauthorization we passed in 2002. These judgeships are among those we \ncreated for border districts that have a massive caseload and that \nneeded more Federal judges. We did what the Republican majority refused \nto do in the years 1995 through 2000 when there was a Democratic \nPresident, namely, create additional needed judgeships for the Southern \nDistrict of California. We did so under Senate Democratic leadership \nwith a Republican President. They have been available to be filled \nsince July 15. The expedited path of Judge Sabraw's nomination \ndemonstrates the fact that the Senate can act expeditiously when we \nreceive well-qualified, consensus nominations on courts that need \nadditional judges. I regret that the nomination has languished on the \nSenate calendar for most of the month for no reason. This nomination \nwill undoubtedly be confirmed without a single dissenting vote in the \nSenate. Democratic Senators have been ready and willing to vote at any \ntime. The Republican leadership will have to explain to the Chief Judge \nin the Southern District of California and the people of southern \nCalifornia what took so long.\n  I congratulate the California Senators on their outstanding work and \nthis nominee and his family on this confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Dana Makoto Sabraw, of California, to be a \nUnited States District Judge for the Southern District of California?\n\n[[Page S11968]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, after the next vote we will resume the DC \nappropriations bill and expect to be on the DC appropriations bill \ntonight and tomorrow. There will be further debate tonight. I encourage \nMembers with amendments to come forward so we can continue to make \nprogress on the DC appropriations bill.\n  I understand the two managers will not require any more rollcall \nvotes on any action on the bill tonight or tomorrow. Thus, the next \nrollcall vote will be the last rollcall vote for tonight and for \ntomorrow. Again, we will be in session tomorrow for further debate on \nthe DC appropriations bill.\n  With regard to Monday's schedule, we will be announcing what Monday's \nschedule will be in terms of voting. We will have votes on Monday in \nthe late afternoon. We will have further announcements on that \ntomorrow. The Democratic leader and I have had discussions over the \ncourse of the day, and from where we started early this morning they \nhave settled a lot in terms of looking forward to the next week and a \nhalf. I can tell all Members no more rollcall votes after this vote \ntonight, no rollcall votes tomorrow; DC appropriations.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, sir.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would rather my leader propounded this question but \ninasmuch as I am the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, \nthe reason I hoped all Members would sit--although there is no \nrequirement they have to in the rules, unless the Chair insists on it--\nwe have a problem. I think the full Senate ought to know about it. That \nis why I have urged Senators sit if they will; then they will be more \ncomfortable. I don't know how long it will last. I hope it will not \nlast long.\n  We have a problem in that we have the Iraq appropriations measure \nbefore the Senate Appropriations Committee. We have had hearings \nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday in that committee. There have \nbeen other committees that have been having hearings, too; I believe \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, and I know the Armed Services \nCommittee has had hearings.\n  Here is my problem as ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. \nWe had hearings this past Monday on the Iraq bill. Our members were not \nfully informed that there would be hearings on Monday but we proceeded \nwith hearings, in any event. Several of the members could not get there \nuntil very late. I have protested pretty consistently in that \ncommittee, saying we need more hearings, that we do not need to rush \nthat bill through. It would be well to have the House act, let us see \nthat bill so we would better know what amendments we should try to \noffer.\n  I have urged that outside witnesses be called. Why should we just \nhear one side of the question, that being, of course, the \nadministration's position? But we could be wiser, I think, if we had \noutside witnesses. That has been rejected. That proposal has been \nrejected. So we have pressed on, against my wishes. I believe we ought \nto have more hearings.\n  Now we come down to this point. We have completed what hearings we \nare going to have, as I understand it, in the Appropriations Committee.\n  Now the pressure is on to have the bill marked up. When? Monday. We \nall know that Senators, in recent years especially, are more likely to \nbe late getting in on Monday. They have faraway points of the compass \nto come from, and some of them have made appointments that will cause \nthem not to get in until Tuesday morning perhaps. And yet we are being \nforced to have a markup on this coming Monday. This greatly creates a \ndisadvantage to many of our Appropriations members.\n  So I have expressed the hope we would not have that markup on Monday. \nThere is no great reason to begin to have this markup. But we have been \npressed hard to get through these hearings, and now we are being \npressed to mark up the bill on Monday.\n  Many of our Members cannot be here Monday. So I have acquainted my \nleader and my side of the aisle with this problem. And I have said we \ncould have a markup on Tuesday. But my wife--and I hesitate to continue \nto inject my own personal problems into this matter--I said my wife has \nto have an operation on Tuesday morning. Not a major operation, but any \noperation at our age--if I were 40 or 50 or 60 again, I would say: You \ngo on and have your operation and I'll see you at suppertime; see you \ntonight. That is not the way she wants it. That is not the way I want \nit.\n  I have said this afternoon, speaking to Mr. Reid, and to Mr. Stevens: \nIf you want to have this on Tuesday, go ahead. If I am 2 hours there or \n3 hours or 5, I will come when I can. But go ahead and have the markup \nTuesday. The word comes back that the Republicans say: OK, but there is \na little catch to that: We will wait till Tuesday, but you have to give \nconsent to take up the bill on the next day. That consent could be \nobjected to, of course, causing a little longer wait.\n  So now we are faced with: OK, you can take it up Tuesday--I hope I am \nnot misrepresenting anyone here; at least this is the way I understand \nit--so you can have it on Tuesday, but you have to give consent to go \nto it Wednesday on the floor.\n  I don't want to enter into that deal. In the first place, I don't \nthink there is a necessity for our having that markup on Monday or on \nTuesday. I think we ought to have more hearings. I think we are \nentitled to more hearings. I see this bill as being ramrodded through \nthe Senate, when there is no necessity for that.\n  I will not go into that further except to say, I am willing to \nproceed on Tuesday, but I am not willing for it to be in accordance \nwith a deal. Call it a deal. Call it whatever you want--an agreement, \nwhatever--``yes, we'll do that if.'' There are times when we do that \naround here, but on this occasion I don't think we ought to take it up \non the floor that fast. We need more time on the floor. So I am \nunwilling to say: OK on Tuesday, but we will agree to taking it up on \nthe floor on Wednesday.\n  So here we are, Thursday afternoon, with no votes tomorrow, I guess, \nand many Members going home, and a Jewish holiday tomorrow. Here we are\n\n[[Page S11969]]\n\nunder this kind of pressure: You can have it on Tuesday, but you have \nto give us consent to take it up on Wednesday.\n  I understand now the--this is just my understanding--the other side \nis not willing to go on Tuesday without such an agreement. As I further \nunderstand it, they are saying--I may be wrong about this, but that is \nwhat I understand--that the majority is saying: OK, you don't want any \ndeal; we will do it on Monday. So there is where it creates a great \nhardship on the part of a lot of our Senators and, I suppose, on \nSenators on the other side.\n\n  I think we are in a quandary, and we just ought to open it up here \nand have a full discussion of it rather than have the onus on me as the \nold plebeian soldier around here. OK. I don't want to cause my comrades \non either side to have to come here on Monday and mark this up.\n  There is some reason it has to be Monday or else. This bill is being \npushed through, rammed through, and I think we ought to take more time \non it. I think the American people are entitled to more time on it.\n  Why don't we have more hearings? Is it that the majority is afraid to \nhave questions asked? Do the questions hurt? What is the problem? Why \ndo we have to have this--we are just not up against it. We passed the \nDefense appropriations conference report today.\n  I would like to know, I say to the leader, why we have to mark up \nthis bill in the Appropriations Committee Monday or Tuesday, and why, \nif we push it--if the majority is willing to go over to Tuesday--why \nthey are going to exact that pound of flesh: OK, we will go over, but \nlet us take it up on the following day.\n  I am not willing to do that. If it were absolutely necessary to do \nthat, I would be willing to do it. But that is not necessary. And in \nall my years here, I have never--I have never--seen the Appropriations \nCommittee of the Senate, and especially the minority--this place is for \nthe protection of the minority, a minority of Senators. I have said \nthat many times.\n  But to jam us up here against a Sunday and a Jewish holiday just \npreceding it, and then to come in here and say, you have to have this \nmarkup on Monday or you have to let us take it up on the floor on \nWednesday, I have to say, I think that is very unfair. I have argued \nthis out in the committee under the public eye, and I have talked with \nmy colleague, Senator Stevens. I know he is under great pressure.\n  I would hope to have a response to that. More than that, I would hope \nwe would not have to mark it up Monday or Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the question is really centered on the \ndebate, which we want to do in a thorough way. And the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, from day 1, has encouraged me to allow for \nadequate time for debate and amendment.\n  Starting about 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago, I made it very clear that the \nPresident of the United States would shortly deliver a supplemental--\nwhich was now about a week ago--that I wanted to take 2 weeks--and it \ncould be longer or it could be shorter--that we can focus on it in an \norganized way, and an organized way is to spend time in hearings.\n  Indeed, after a lot of discussion, we organized hearings in such a \nway, as you pointed out, that the Armed Services Committee has had \nhearings on it, the Foreign Relations Committee has had hearings on it, \nthe Appropriations Committee has had hearings on it. And, indeed, we \nhave had at least seven committee hearings in the Senate. The House is \nhaving hearings at the same time.\n  We have had interested parties engaged in formal discussions coming \nby your party lunch, coming by our party lunch to have the discussion \nwith the goal that we would focus on this issue. Indeed, we have done a \ngood job this week. My goal was expressed 9 days ago. I didn't know \nabout the surgery of your wife. Although the Jewish holiday begins \ntonight, we are not voting tomorrow because of a request from your side \nof the aisle. The Jewish holiday begins late tomorrow afternoon. But \nbecause of very specific requests from two of your Members through the \nassistant leader, we are bowing down once again to you for scheduling, \nwhich is fine, and I agree. If they need to travel back and there is no \nother way to get back, I am going to pay respect to their religion, \njust as I want to pay respect to you in every regard we can.\n  So there goes your Friday. So don't blame us on that. I don't think \nthat is fair. It is not fair as we go forward, if you are looking at \nequity or fairness.\n  On this floor about 2 months ago--it was a little bit later at \nnight--you came to me and said: We can't operate this place working 2 \ndays a week or 3 days a week. And I agree. You have been in this \nparticular situation in terms of scheduling. You know it is \nchallenging, just like votes for tomorrow. That is why 9 days ago I \nsaid, we are going to spend all next week on the floor, if possible, \ndebating and amending freely. And the Democratic leader and I talked \nearlier today. We want to stay on the bill. We don't want any trips or \npunches thrown that are not fair, but we will have a good discussion \nthrough next week. My objective is to bring it to the floor.\n  The question as to why? Because we are in a war. We are in a war \nagainst terrorism that our President has done, I think, an excellent \njob of spelling out. He has delivered to us, on behalf of the 150,000 \nmilitary men and women there, a call for emergency funding through a \nsupplemental that, although there is disagreement, the administration \nhas said it is urgent we address.\n  Thus, when we can work on Monday, we should work on Monday. And I \nwould argue Tuesday, Tuesday morning, Tuesday night, Wednesday morning, \nWednesday night, Thursday morning, Thursday night, Friday morning and \nFriday night, in response to that emergency request for funding that \nthe experts have told us is an emergency.\n  To say, well, people aren't going to be back Monday and therefore \nlet's do Tuesday, but, no, we can't do it Tuesday because of other \nscheduling reasons, therefore, let's put this off later. I can tell \nyou--you know this; again, I should be speaking to the Chair--if we say \nMonday it is just too difficult for people to come back, when there are \npeople at war and there are people dying every day when we turn on the \nnews, because of a lack of security, and we know this funding supports \nsecurity, how can we say, it is inconvenient Monday and Tuesday? \nAlthough, again, I say this with deep respect for your personal \nsituation and your wife's surgery in the morning, but we need to \nrespond.\n  I think you know, if we wait until Wednesday to mark it up, or \nThursday, the same thing, maybe a little bit different, Thursday, and \nyou know this, Thursday people will say, we are getting out of here. We \ndon't have time to debate this. Let's do it 2 weeks from now.\n  Once again, we are on recess during that period of time. I am going \nto have a hard time leaving here on recess with the American people \nsaying: The President of the United States delivered this urgent \nrequest to you for funding, and have the news every day of people \ndying, with people having told us that it does have to do with security \nand the war on terrorism. That is the why and the reason.\n\n  I think we just need to be addressing this up front. The dialog \nbetween our leadership has been good. I know it is challenging our \ncommittee members with all of the hearings we have had day in and day \nout. I know people are worn out. But it is a war, and it is a war on \nterrorism. I think the American people deserve that debate on the floor \nof this body--freely debating, freely amending, starting as soon as we \ncan that is reasonable. That is why I continue to request that the \nAppropriations Committee mark up the bill Monday, if it can--if it \ncan't, it is just convenience. I think that is hard to answer--or \nTuesday. And then there is no quid pro quo. I would like to get it to \nthe floor so people can debate it before we go on recess in the next \nfew weeks. But if there is objection to bringing it to the floor, that \nis your right as we go forward. But I do want the American people to \nknow we are ready to address this bill and debate it fully, looking at \neverybody's schedule in a very personal way. The reason is, we are at \nwar. That is it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished leader yield further?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me emphasize I am not asking that it be put off until\n\n[[Page S11970]]\n\nTuesday because of my wife's little problem. I said, go ahead, if I am \n2 hours or 3 hours or 5 hours, I will get there when I can. I would \nrather you didn't, but in any event, if you do, I am going to be with \nher. That is an easy choice for me. But I didn't intend to get into the \ndebate about the so-called war on terrorism as being the war in Iraq. I \nwon't do that now. But the distinguished majority leader has opened an \navenue for a great deal of debate in which I will partake, if the good \nLord lets me live. I am not going to lie down and roll over for that \nargument that, oh, we are in a war and we have to press ahead here; we \nhave people dying and so on, and we have to do this on Monday or \nTuesday. I am as concerned about the people dying as is the \ndistinguished majority leader. I was not for sending our people over \nthere to die. But we won't get into that here. The distinguished \nRepublican leader brought that up.\n  I am only saying I would hope that we would stage the markup at a \ntime when we could have full attendance on both sides.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. There is a nomination of Judge Mosman. I wonder if it \nwould be possible to vote on that nomination by voice vote or begin \nthat vote momentarily for the convenience of all Members?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am happy to propound that unanimous \nconsent request for a voice vote on the judge under consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the ranking member is not here. I am sure \nif he was, he would ask that we have a rollcall vote. We ought to.\n  Let me just say, I don't think there is any question that we have to \nmove forward and have an opportunity to debate this in a much more \nmeaningful and thorough way. The way we will do that is through a \nmarkup in the Appropriations Committee and through votes on the Senate \nfloor. Throughout the day the majority leader and I have been trying to \nfigure out a way to work through the schedule, and it is obvious there \nare differences of opinion about what the schedule should entail. Yes, \nthere should be more hearings. Yes, there ought to be more \naccountability as to how we make these decisions. If we had our choice, \nwe would bifurcate this request, send the money to the troops to make \nsure they get all they need to conduct their responsibilities, but then \nhave a more deliberate and thoughtful debate about this aid for \nreconstruction. That would be our desire. We will have amendments in \nthat regard whenever the bill comes to the floor.\n  We need to get on with the vote on the judge, and then we will talk \nfurther about schedule as the schedule presents itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11970-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11970-S11971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOMINATION OF MICHAEL W. MOSMAN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael W. \nMosman, of Oregon, to be United States District Judge for the District \nof Oregon.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my unqualified \nsupport for the nomination of Michael Mosman for the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Oregon and to urge my colleagues to \nconfirm this fine nominee.\n  Mr. Mosman has excellent academic and professional qualifications for \nthe federal bench. After graduating magna cum laude from the J. Reuben \nClark Law School at Brigham Young University, he clerked first for D.C. \nCircuit Judge Malcolm Wilkey and then for Supreme Court Justice Lewis \nPowell.\n  Mr. Mosman also has impressive courtroom experience. As an Assistant \nU.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon, Mr. Mosman \nhas worked on cases in all four prosecuting units in his office: \nnarcotics, violent crimes, organized crime, and fraud. He has tried \nabout 50 cases, including large multidefendant drug conspiracies, \ninternational money laundering, multimillion dollar counterfeiting \ncases, and multidistrict immigration fraud.\n  Mr. Mosman also displayed stellar leadership and integrity in the \nwake of the September 11 tragedy. He deftly guided his office in the \napprehension and prosecution of several would-be terrorists, all the \nwhile taking steps to ensure that those individuals' civil liberties \nwere not violated.\n  Mr. Mosman is an exceptional nominee. He merited an ABA rating of \nunanimously well-qualified, and I fully expect him to serve with \ndistinction on the federal bench in Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my good friend \nand fellow Oregonian Michael Mosman.\n  Recently, the ABA rated Mr. Mosman as well qualified for the position \nof District Court Judge. Those of us from Oregon, however, have long \nbeen aware of Mr. Mosman's stellar legal credentials and talents. It \nwould be an honor to have Mr. Mosman serve our state as the next U.S. \nDistrict Judge in Oregon. He has distinguished himself as a leader in \nour state and in the legal community. Since 1988, Mr. Mosman has worked \nfor the United States Attorney's office in Oregon. First joining the \nDepartment of Justice as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, he was \nsubsequently promoted to the position of U.S. Attorney for the District \nof Oregon in 2001.\n  In addition to his public service, Mr. Mosman has worked in private \npractice with the Portland law firm of Miller Nash LLP. He clerked for \nJudge Malcolm Wilkey of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit--\nand for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell. Graduating with \nhighest honors, he received his undergraduate degree from Utah State \nUniversity and his law degree from BYU's J. Reuben Clark Law School.\n  With his academic and legal background--both in private and public \npractice--Mr. Mosman will bring a wealth of knowledge and, most \nimportantly, compassion to the bench. In 2001, Senator Wyden and I \nconvened a bipartisan blue ribbon panel to interview applicants for the \nposition of U.S. attorney--our unanimous No. 1 recommendation was Mike \nMosman. Earlier this year, we convened another bipartisan blue ribbon \npanel to interview applicants for the U.S. District Court. Once again, \nour unanimous No. 1 recommendation was Mike Mosman.\n  It is, therefore, with great pleasure that I highly recommend to you \nmy friend, Mr. Mosman, and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of his \nconfirmation as United States District Judge for the District of \nOregon.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Michael W. Mosman, of Oregon, to be United States District Judge for \nthe District of Oregon? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond), \nthe Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), and the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Gregg) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nKentucky (Mr. Bunning) would vote ``yea''.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``aye''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the leadership on both sides for \nallowing us the opportunity to get back to the DC appropriations bill, \na bill Senator DeWine and I have worked very hard on over the last, \nactually, several months. We are very proud of so many portions of this \nbill that do such good work for the District, and do so in conjunction \nwith the leadership of the District and the residents of the District. \nSo we are thankful that as it has worked out today, we can actually get \nback on this bill.\n  It is my hope, and I think the chairman of this committee shares this \ngoal, since there are a couple of points in this bill that warrant \nfurther debate, the most obvious one being the issue of education \nimprovement in the District of Columbia, it would be my idea, and I \nhope it is shared by my colleagues and even on the other side, that we \ngive as much time to this debate as possible because it is a very \nimportant issue, not just for the District but for the whole Nation. As \na public policy, we would be hard pressed to find a public policy that \nis more important right now, other than, of course, national defense \nand homeland security. I think we all agree the challenge to our public \neducation system is one that continues to warrant our attention.\n  Tonight it is my intention, and Senator DeWine understands, to speak \nfor a minute about an amendment Senator Carper and I want to lay down \nat some time, and to talk in detail about what that amendment is. He \nand I are prepared to talk for maybe an hour about the details of it.\n  I understand there are other Members who might want to speak tonight. \nWe have no intention, obviously, of having the vote tonight or \ntomorrow, but we hope next week to proceed with some voting on this \nvery important bill.\n  The way I would like to start, just for a few moments, though, is to \nsay the reason our amendment would be necessary and other amendments \nwould be warranted is because the debate will show the publicly stated \ngoals, however laudable--and we have read those goals in the newspaper, \nwe have read them in press releases, we have heard the goals stated by \nthe voucher proponents, that the aim of this is to help children in \nfailing schools, poor children in failing schools have options--this \ndebate will show the bill itself does not actually do that. Even with \nthe Feinstein amendment, the bill does not do that.\n  There is another really puzzling aspect to this. I want to submit \nsomething for the record to show why I will say it is puzzling. We \nreceived today the Statement of Administration Policy. I would like to \nread it for the record and then explain why it is confusing. This is \nthe Statement of Administration Policy that was issued today on the DC \nbill. This policy, not from the House but from the White House, says \nthis: We like the DC bill, basically. I am paraphrasing the first part. \nThe administration looks forward to working with Congress to ensure its \npriorities and amounts of money are within the overall budget goal.\n\n       Additional Administration views regarding the Committee's \n     version of the bill are, [No. 1], School Choice Incentive \n     Fund.\n       The Administration is pleased the Committee bill included \n     $13 million for the President's School Choice Incentive Fund. \n     This innovative reform will increase the capacity of the \n     District to provide parents--particularly low-income \n     parents--with more options for obtaining a quality \n     education for their children who are trapped in low-\n     performing schools. The Administration appreciates the \n     Committee's support for strengthening the District's \n     school system and strongly urges the Senate to retain this \n     initiative.\n\n  The puzzling thing about this is the White House has said they \nsupport the Mayor's position. The Mayor was on the floor today. Mayor \nWilliams is one of the most honorable people I know. He is a reformer \nfor public education. But I don't know if the White House realizes that \nis not the Mayor's position.\n  The Mayor's position is a three-pronged approach: A third for \nvouchers, a third for charter schools, and a third for improvements to \npublic schools. That is because the Mayor has suggested that vouchers-\nonly is insufficient, and the Mayor has also said some other things \nabout the voucher-only proposal. So I just lay this down.\n  I ask the chairman if perhaps he could get to the bottom of this. I \ndon't know why the White House wouldn't say we understand the Senate \nbill has three clear sections on this issue. We like all those \nsections. We ask you to keep them all in the bill. But it doesn't say \nthat.\n  I am going to have this printed in the Record. That is why we are \ngoing to have a lot of debate on this, because we have to get clear \nwhat the administration is really asking for or advocating.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the Statement of Administration \nPolicy in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 2003.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n    (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned \n                               agencies.)\n\n\n       S. 1583--District of Columbia Appropriations Bill, FY 2004\n\n        (Sponsors: Stevens (R), Alaska; Byrd (D), West Virginia)\n\n       The Administration supports Senate passage of the FY 2004 \n     District of Columbia Appropriations Bill, as reported by the \n     Appropriations Committee.\n       While this bill exceeds the President's request by $145 \n     million, the Administration looks forward to working with the \n     Congress to ensure that the FY 2004 appropriations bills \n     ultimately fit within the top line funding level agreed to by \n     both the Administration and the Congress. The President \n     supports a discretionary spending total of $785.6\n\n[[Page S11972]]\n\n     billion, along with advance appropriations for FY 2005--\n     consistent with his Budget and the FY 2004 Congressional \n     Budget Resolution. Only within such a fiscal environment can \n     we encourage increased economic growth and a return to a \n     balanced budget. The Administration looks forward to working \n     with the Congress to ensure that its priorities are met \n     within that overall total.\n       Additional Administration views regarding the Committee's \n     version of the bill are:\n\n\n                      School Choice Incentive Fund\n\n       The Administration is pleased the Committee bill includes \n     $13 million for the President's School Choice Incentive Fund \n     initiative. This innovative reform will increase the capacity \n     of the District to provide parents--particularly low-income \n     parents--with more options for obtaining a quality education \n     for their children who are trapped in low-performing schools. \n     The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for \n     strengthening the District's school system and strongly urges \n     the Senate to retain this initiative.\n\n\n                         Federal Funding for DC\n\n       The Administration applauds the Committee for fully funding \n     the President's request for $17 million for District resident \n     tuition support, as well as $15 million for emergency \n     planning and security costs in the District.\n\n\n Attorney's Fees under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n                                 (IDEA)\n\n       The Administration is pleased that the Committee has \n     retained the provision that caps the award of plaintiff's \n     fees in cases brought against the District of Columbia Public \n     Schools (DCPS) under IDEA. The Administration strongly \n     supports the education of children with disabilities \n     according to the principles embodied in IDEA, and it is in \n     the best interest of the District's children if DCPS uses its \n     limited resources to improve its special education programs \n     rather than pay excessive attorneys' fees.\n\n\n                         local budget autonomy\n\n       The Administration continues to support local budget \n     autonomy, which would free the District's local funds from \n     any delay in the appropriations process past the beginning of \n     the fiscal year. We appreciate Congress' consideration of \n     this proposal and recognize Congress would continue to ensure \n     responsible use of Federal and local funds through the \n     enactment of the District's annual appropriations bill.\n\n\n                              other issues\n\n       The Administration is disappointed that the Senate version \n     of the bill modifies current law with respect to allowing \n     local funds to be used for needle exchange.\n       The Administration is concerned with the number of \n     unrequested earmarks contained in the Committee bill, \n     including $20 million provided to the District of Columbia \n     Chief Financial Officer for a variety of unspecified \n     projects.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to start with the Landrieu-Carper \namendment that we will offer at some time, and describe again why it is \npuzzling that we are having difficulty with the administration and the \nvoucher proponents coming to some agreement. I am going to read the \nsimple text, and without any rhetoric or signs or charts or anything, I \nam going to read the text of it because it is quite simple. I want the \npeople who are listening--and, of course, there is alot of interest in \nthis--to understand what basically has been rejected.\n  Before I do that, I will give a very brief history of how we got here \nbecause it will help to set this debate.\n  Three years ago we were in what I would call a quandary in public \neducation in the Nation. That quandary was this: Our schools were \nimproving but not fast enough. We had a lot of kids who needed help. We \nreally had to do something.\n  There were a group of people who wanted to give up on public schools \nand go to vouchers and say we can't, we tried, nothing is working, \nlet's go to vouchers. There was a group of people who said no, what we \nneed is just more money, the same thing, pump the money in and more \nresources will do it.\n  Both proposals were rejected. They were rejected by a broad-based \ncoalition of Democrats and Republicans who rejected both. We said no to \nvouchers which will undermine public schools; no, vouchers will not \nwork. And, no, just dumping more money in the system, as much needed as \nthe money is, just dumping money is not going to help.\n  We found a third way called Leave No Child Behind which the President \nhimself led. Many of us were proud to work with him to do that. We \ncrossed party lines. Republicans went to the Democratic side. Democrats \nwent to the Republican side. There were great coalitions forged to get \nthat done.\n  Here we are not even 2 years into Leave No Child Behind and there are \nstill grumblings on both sides. You can understand why. The money we \npromised isn't forthcoming. So people have a legitimate argument. They \nsay: We haven't received the money. I understand. I keep saying: Let us \ngo forth.\n  I know people want vouchers. No matter what we do, they want \nvouchers. They want them yesterday, today, and tomorrow. That is just \nwhat they want.\n  Here we are with Leave No Child Behind. One would think if the \nadministration wanted to prove something, they would try to prove it \nanywhere in the country--the District, New Orleans, Louisiana, Ohio--\nthat Leave No Child Behind could work.\n  There is some confusion. From my point of view, I think what would \ncome out of the President's proposal is something like this: I am \nsorry. We are short of money. I am sorry. We can't fund everything that \nwe thought we could fund, but let me just give enough money to the \nDistrict of Columbia, which is a city and a symbol, and let me fully \nfund Leave No Child Behind. Let me double the amount for charter \nschools. Let me push contracts for public schools. Let me increase \ntutorial services. Let me have afterschool and let us implement early \nchildhood education.\n  As a person who helped write the bill that laid those principles \ndown, that is what I would fully expect. I would have stood shoulder to \nshoulder with him, and I would have said with the Mayor's help, with \nthe Congresswoman's help, with the Republicans' help and the Democrats' \nhelp, let us show the country what we meant when we passed the bill. \nThey don't believe it. Neither sides believes it. So let us show them \nwhat we meant. Instead, we get the same old, tired, worn out, \ninadequate vouchers--vouchers, vouchers.\n  Mr. Carper, the Senator from Delaware, and I, and others who worked \nvery closely, think we are not hearing correctly. We think this \ncouldn't possibly be. So we tried. The chairman could not have been \nmore gracious. We tried. We think maybe it is something we don't \nunderstand. So we tried to talk. The talks aren't going very well.\n  So we think: Let us just put it down in an amendment form and see \nmaybe if we are missing something. This is our amendment. I will read \nfor the Record what the gist of the amendment is because it is very \nsimple. Tomorrow I will have this blown up so when I speak on it next \nweek people can see what it is.\n  This is what we said. Even though you don't want to fund title I in \nthe District, you don't want to double the amount of charter schools, \nyou don't want to have private contracts which the law allows, you \ndon't want to increase tutorial services, you don't want to have \nafterschool, you don't want to have early childhood, we will just take \nwhat the administration thinks--or what the voucher proponents think--\nand we will just go back to see if we can make vouchers work.\n  We say: OK. We will do a couple of things. If you will agree that the \nsame children will take the same test because the administration was \nvery strong on tests--they wanted the same test--that took a little \nwork but we finally got the same test.\n\n  Then they said last year that it is very important for teachers in \npublic schools to have a college education. That was a big deal. We \nsaid, yes, at a minimum. They can have alternative certifications but \nyou have to have a college education. Let us have a college education \nfor teachers who would be teaching students using public money to go to \nprivate schools. That has been agreed to.\n  Because one of the problems with this debate is that nobody has the \nresearch to tell whether it really works or not--we agree with that--we \nsaid, let us have a very rigorous evaluation so that after 5 years we \nwould know for sure, I mean for positive.\n  Let me speak for a minute about this. The Milwaukee program has been \ngoing on for 13 years. There are 11,000 children in vouchers and there \nare 89,000 children who aren't in vouchers. The Senators from that \nState can talk more about the details than I can. But what I do know \nabout it is many studies have been conducted, and there is still no \ndefinitive data that I have been able to find--that anybody has been \nable to find--about whether those children are doing better \nacademically. There is some evidence to suggest that\n\n[[Page S11973]]\n\nsome parents are happier and more satisfied. I acknowledge that. That \nis very good.\n  I remind this body that we did not start down this road to make \nparents happy. That is not what the President said. We want parents to \nbe satisfied. We want parents to be satisfied, but that is not the \ngoal. It is desirable. But the goal is a quality education with public \naccountability because public dollars are being spent. We don't know \nafter 13 years.\n  We said: OK. Let us have an evaluation component. The evaluation \ncomponent in this bill, to date, is inadequate to, even after 5 years, \ngive us those answers, and we think that is a real problem.\n  This is the most important. All of these are important, but this is \nreally the telling portion of why I think we are at a real standstill \nand a crossroads.\n  We said in our amendment that you say you want to limit this or you \nwant to help children who are in a trap. That is what this says. I want \nto read it again. This is the administration's policy. This is for \nchildren who are trapped in low-performing schools, which would mean \ntrapped in failing schools. That is what we can do in Leave No Child \nBehind. We said no more of this. You have to be good. If you are not \ngood and you are a failing school, you need improvement or you have to \nclose and be reconstituted. We said let us limit it to children in \nfailing schools. That is part of our amendment.\n  The word back so far is, no, I am sorry we can't limit this to \nchildren in failing schools because we want this to be available to \nchildren in all schools.\n  The sixth provision that we asked is to make sure all the civil \nrights laws which are required in Leave No Child Behind are adhered to. \nThe other side said that wouldn't be a problem. We assumed that would \nbe fine. But it is not in this bill.\n  The other part of our amendment says make sure the scholarship \nitself--whether it is $7,500 or $3,500 or $1,000--is sufficient to \nactually get a child by lottery from a failing school into another \nschool. The school can't discriminate. The child gets to go. But that \nlanguage was rejected.\n  I don't know what the other side is thinking. If a school costs \n$15,000 and the voucher is only worth $7,500, we can't figure out how \nthat child gets to the school if their voucher is only worth $7,500. We \nwanted to make sure that the voucher would be received as payment in \nfull so a parent couldn't be told: We would love to take your child \ninto the school but your voucher is only worth $7,500 and we need \n$15,000. I am sorry. Our private scholarship fund is out of money. We \nwould love to help you, Ms. Jones. We really know that your two sons \nwould do great in our school. We would love to give them vouchers. You \ncan either have a bake sale or raise money from your neighbors or go \ninto your savings account, but we can't put up the other $7,500.\n  Senator Carper and I thought it would be reasonable to say the \nvoucher--no matter where you get the money--has to get the kid in the \nschool.\n  The seventh thing we asked was--because this White House, when we \nwere debating Leave No Child Behind, insisted on yearly progress \nreports for children in public schools--we would like to craft a way to \nmake sure these 2,000 slots available that we are talking about, where \nthey take the same test that has been agreed to--we would have these \nyearly progress reports as defined by Leave No Child Behind. The same \nreports, no difference. No, I am sorry, we can't do that. We cannot \nhave yearly progress reports. So, again, accountability is out the \nwindow.\n  And finally, our amendment said, OK, we do not believe this should be \na Federal mandate. We are being told by the voucher opponents, that the \ncity wants this; it is the choice of the city. I said, fine, remove the \nlanguage that makes the money contingent because in committee I asked \nthe Senator handling the bill if he could just state for the record: \nDoes Mayor Williams have a choice? In other words, in order to get any \nmoney, does he have to take the voucher money? To get any money, does \nhe have to take vouchers? The answer was yes.\n  I and others strongly opposed forcing any city, anywhere, at any \ntime, being held hostage by voucher opponents that would say: We are \nhappy to give you $40 million; we are glad to give you $20 million; we \nare glad to give you $8 million; but you have to institute a voucher \nprogram. And not just vouchers for children in failing schools, but you \nmust have a voucher program for children in all schools.\n  That proposal will not pass with much Democratic support, let me \nassure Members.\n  This has been rejected today. Maybe cooler heads will prevail. The \nSenator from Delaware and I are still open to discussion. Why? I would \nstay here all night, all next week, all next month, all next year. My \nchildren are home; I would like to get home. His children are home. But \nthat is how important this education reform is for this country. It was \na hard fought victory and a wonderful victory and a powerful victory.\n  The ink is not even dry and we are talking about undoing it, \nunraveling it, undermining it. I don't understand it.\n  Senator Carper will talk, and then I will finish with a few more \ncomments about our amendment. I would like Senator Carper to explain \nfrom his perspective what our amendment hoped or sought to do.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for yielding. Before I \nwas elected, I served as Governor of Delaware for 8 years, following \nMike Castle, who launched near the end of his second term education \nreform. What we began in his last term and I tried to do in the 8 years \nI was privileged to serve as Governor was to focus more on raising \nstudent achievement than on anything else. We were willing to \nexperiment rather boldly to try to accomplish that. We established \nrigorous academic standards, not standards in math, science, English, \nand social studies that the politicians thought were important, but we \ngathered the best teachers in the State, the best scientists, to \ndevelop academic standards of what we expected kids to know at \ndifferent grade levels in their academic careers.\n  We wanted to test students objectively, measure whether they were \nmaking academic progress to the standards. We wanted to be objective.\n  And, finally, we wanted to make sure we held everyone accountable--\nstudents, schools, school districts, even the educators. Trying to hold \nparents accountable would be the hardest part of all.\n  During the course of those reforms, we sought to identify what was \nworking to raise student achievement. Did smaller class sizes work? If \nso, the idea was to replicate that and do that in other schools. We \neventually found that smaller class sizes in kindergarten and classes \nfor age 7 had the most impact.\n  We learned investment in early childhood paid huge dividends and \nconcluded that in the first 6 years of our life, by the time we are age \n6 and in first grade, we have learned about half of what we are going \nto learn in our lives. If we waste the first 6 years, it is hard to \ncatch up later on.\n  We learned that if we can harness technology, we can help equalize \nthe playing field for a whole lot of kids. We learned that it is not \njust enough to hook up classrooms to the Internet. It is not enough to \nhave even decent computers. If you do not have teachers comfortable in \nusing the technology to bring the outside world into the classroom and \nmaking the learning come alive and using it effectively as a tool, the \nmoney for all the wiring and the computers is money that is not well \nspent. Teachers have the professional development and the familiarity \nof using this technology lining up with the curriculum, the lesson \nplan, and making the learning come alive.\n  We learned in the course of our experiments in Delaware that all kids \ncan learn. Some learn more quickly than others. Mary might learn faster \nthan Tom, but Tom could learn. He just might need extra time or be \ntaught in different ways. We learned maybe longer school days are \nhelpful for doing that, afterschool programs, and maybe summer schools. \nWe have schools, for example, for kids who are entering ninth grade. We \ncan bring those kids in for a month or so in the summer before they go \ninto ninth grade, put them in a summer academy, and they have a better \nchance of helping the kids to meet the standards they need in ninth \ngrade.\n\n[[Page S11974]]\n\n  We did all this in an effort to try to learn what worked to raise \nstudent achievement. We did so because we wanted to be able to invest \nthe limited dollars that we had in programs that would raise student \nachievement. Of all the things we did in my State during the time that \nI served as its Governor, preparing the workforce for the 21st century \nwas most important. If we are going to be successful as a nation, it \nwill be because we prepare and create a workforce that is able to beat \nany workforce in the world.\n\n  What does that have to do with what we are talking about? The schools \nin the District of Columbia are not doing the job for many of the kids \nwho live there. The public schools in this District are not doing the \njob for many of the kids who live there. And a good deal is being done \nto try to turn that around. This District has begun to experiment \nrather boldly with charter schools, some of the things I talked about \nearlier--extra learning time, technology, and professional \ndevelopment--in order to raise student achievement. They have a long \nway to go.\n  As we dealt with the issue and tackled the issue of leaving no child \nbehind in a failing school, we did not say that the Federal Government \nwould go out there and establish academic standards. We said, we will \nlet the States establish their own academic standards. Let them figure \nit out and know what they should be doing. We said the same thing about \nthe District of Columbia. They develop their academic standards in the \nDistrict of Columbia. We do not do that.\n  No Child Left Behind also says we expect kids to make progress every \nyear. We expect all kids can learn, and over a period of a decade or so \nwe expect virtually all children to be able to reach the academic \nstandards, whether it is the District of Columbia, Delaware, Ohio, \nLouisiana, or Alabama. Of the public schools in the District of \nColumbia, or Minnesota or Delaware, under No Child Left Behind, if a \nschool does not meet adequate yearly progress for 1 year, that school \nis essentially put on notice that they are deficient.\n  If they continue to not meet the adequate yearly progress for a \nsecond or a third year, there are consequences for the failure to do \nso. By the fourth year, if a public school--4 years in a row, in any of \nour States or in the District of Columbia--fails to meet adequate \nyearly progress, there are consequences that can be rather severe. The \nschool can be closed and restructured, the faculty changed, leadership \nchanged. The school can be transformed into a charter school. Public \nschool choice can be demanded, required, including the funding of \ntransportation to other public schools. But the consequences are \nsevere.\n  If a charter school in Minnesota, where I think charter schools may \nhave originated, or in any of the other States that are represented \nhere is deficient, and the students there--for 1 year or 2 years or 3 \nyears or 4 years--do not demonstrate adequate yearly progress, or those \nschools do not show progress year after year, then there are \nconsequences as well. There is also help. We try to provide extra help: \nextra money, tutorial assistance, that kind of thing. But in the end, \nif there is not progress, we do not want to continue to throw good \nmoney after bad.\n  I want to talk about an area we got hung up on, and it is a little \ncomplicated; but I want to take a minute to talk about it anyway. I \nsaid earlier, if you have kids in public schools in this District of \nColumbia who are not making adequate yearly progress, there are \nconsequences for those schools. There are efforts to help them, but \nthere are also consequences.\n  For charter schools here, if kids are not making progress, if you \ncontinue year after year to fall short, there are consequences for that \nschool, and in the end fairly severe ones. If instead of taking this \n$13 million and distributing it in vouchers to send the kids to, let's \nsay, 80 different schools--instead of doing that, with maybe 25 kids to \na school--instead, we are going to take that $13 million and fund one \nnew school for 2,000 kids, and maybe have 80 classrooms, with 25 kids \nin a classroom, if we use the $13 million in that way, we would expect \nthat school and those students under No Child Left Behind to make \nprogress and to make adequate yearly progress. And if they did not, \nunder No Child Left Behind, that school would get help. And eventually, \nif they continue to fail, they would face dire consequences.\n  Stick with me on this, if you will. What we propose to do with this \nvoucher demonstration is to take $13 million, and instead of creating \none school with 80 classrooms, we might take the $13 million and give \nit to kids who will go to 80 different private schools somewhere here \nin the District; and it might be roughly 25 kids in each of those \nschools, but they add up to 2,000.\n  Some will go to schools, and they are going to be tested, and they \nwill do pretty well. Some will go to schools, and they will be tested, \nunder the District's test, and they are not going to do so well; and \nthey may not do so well next year and the year after that and the year \nafter that.\n  I wish it were possible somehow to take the results of those 2,000 \nkids who are going to be spread, in this example, in 80 schools across \nthe District to actually bring back, to aggregate, and to see how well \nthey did in making adequate yearly progress. And as it turns out, we \ncould actually do that. We would not have to impose No Child Left \nBehind on the individual private schools. I would not want to do \nthat. But we can certainly find out how those kids are doing in those \nprivate or parochial schools, and see if they are making, collectively, \nadequate yearly progress.\n\n  Earlier this year--I wish I could find the quotation--President Bush \nwas talking--I think it was maybe in July--about this experiment with \nvouchers in the District of Columbia.\n  If you bear with me, I want to see if I can find that quotation. At \nthe very least, I will give you part of it. He said words to this \neffect: It is the taxpayers' money. We want to know. We want to know in \na public school or in a private school whether or not the children are \nlearning.\n  Bear with me just for one moment. The quote is too good to miss. I \nwill find it, and then I will be able to read it in its entirety. Here \nis what the President said. And again, this is from July of this year. \nI am going to read it because I think he has it right. This is \nabsolutely on the money talking about his vision for a DC voucher \nprogram. This is what he said:\n\n       The same accountability system applies to the recipient \n     school as it does the public schools in Washington. After \n     all, it's taxpayers' money. We want to know. We want to know \n     in a public school or a private school whether or not the \n     children are learning.\n\n  I could not have said it better myself.\n  The negotiations we have had with our friends on the other side--and \nI just want to say to Senator DeWine, I said this privately, and I will \nsay it publicly, I very much admire the way he and Senator Landrieu \nwork together as the chairman of the subcommittee and as ranking \nmember. I thank them very much for the good faith that I think they and \ntheir staff demonstrated in trying to find a middle ground on some of \nthese complex and admittedly difficult issues.\n  While I believe it is important that the kids who will use these \nvouchers in this experimental program come out of schools that are \nfailing--not everyone thinks that; I think so--I think it is important \nthat the voucher actually offsets the cost of the tuition fully. Not \neveryone agrees with that. I certainly think so.\n  I think the teachers in those private and parochial schools have to \nmeet certain standards or credentialing qualifications. We could \nprobably work through most of that.\n  We fell apart in our negotiations on three points. One was this idea \nof: Is there some way we can fairly reasonably make sure we hold those \nwho are using public dollars, Federal dollars--for the first time, I \nthink, for vouchers--can we hold them accountable under No Child Left \nBehind, and in a way somewhat as we hold charter schools and other \npublic school kids accountable?\n  I had a conversation with an administration official this afternoon, \nand I thought it was a telling conversation. She said to me--words to \nthis effect--we can't agree with doing what you and Senator Landrieu \nwant because the kids who are coming from these schools, who will be \nusing these vouchers--falling under certain income limits; 185 percent \nof poverty--they are going to be some of our toughest kids\n\n[[Page S11975]]\n\nto help raise student achievement and to demonstrate adequate yearly \nprogress. And there was just a reluctance and a fear they were setting \nthemselves up for failure under this demonstration program.\n  What the President said is the same accountability system applies to \nrecipient schools as it does to the public schools of Washington, DC.\n  We have to be smart enough to figure out a way to put that kind of \naccountability plan in place in a voucher program so that it does not \ndiscourage private or parochial schools from joining in this \nexperiment. And if the kids who use those vouchers and go to the public \nand private schools don't make adequate yearly progress, we should not \ncontinue to fund those programs.\n  One of the great frustrations for me with what we are setting up \nhere, without the kind of provisions Senator Landrieu and I are talking \nabout, is we will end up not knowing for sure at the end of the day, \nand for 5 years, or whatever, whether this actually works to raise \nstudent achievement, comparing apples and apples, oranges and oranges, \nbeing able to compare those 2,000 kids with another 2,000 kids in \ncharter schools and 2,000 kids in public schools. We will not know \nabsolutely. And we should know.\n  For people who don't like vouchers, for those who think we should not \nput a dime in vouchers, they should know after 5 years that it works. \nAnd maybe we should consider, as we said, other school districts. By \nthe same token, for those who think vouchers are the best thing since \nsliced bread, it would be great to have an experiment that demonstrated \nthat at the end of 5 years, maybe it does not work. And other schools \naround the State, other cities or school districts would say: They \ntried it in DC. It was a fair experiment, and it didn't work. They \ncould decide to go ahead and have their own experiment and do it \nthemselves. But we need a test and experiment that nobody can question \nat the end of the day that it wasn't done fairly and squarely on all \ncounts.\n  I feel disappointed tonight. I really do. I am not angry, but I am \ndisappointed. I have invested some personal time. My staff has. Senator \nLandrieu has invested a whole lot more. I know Senator DeWine has. I \ndon't feel good about this because we ended up having spent all this \ntime without coming to the kind of consensus I hoped we could. I fear \nwe will pass a bill ultimately that will be flawed, not flawed in the \nsense of the Senate version, but the House version, because that is a \nbadly flawed voucher proposal. I fear we will pass something that is \nnot what it could be. We will go to conference and what comes out of \nconference will be a whole lot worse than what is being contemplated \nhere in the Senate.\n  The last thing I want to say is this: If we had been able to reach \nagreement that these vouchers would only be used for some of the 9,400 \nkids who are today in failing schools in the District, we would have \neliminated a real stumbling block going forward. If we had been able to \nwork out with smart people in the administration, smart people who work \naround here, a way to make sure that the same accountability or some \ncomparable accountability system that we used under No Child Left \nBehind for charter schools and public schools--that we can apply that \nin the way I described earlier for these 2,000 kids--if we can do that, \nwe have eliminated a major stumbling block.\n  Senator Landrieu and I are reluctant, though, even if we passed a \nmeasure that had those provisions in it and the other principle she has \ntalked about already, to go to conference even with a good bill without \nthe assurance that what is going to come out of conference will be \nconsistent with those principles. I would feel pretty foolish if we \nstruck a good agreement, a sound agreement that we felt proud of, and \nwent to conference and ended up with something else that was a horse of \na different color.\n  We are not going to come to agreement, I am afraid, on those two \nmajor principles that we talked about here tonight, if our friends on \nthe other side can't give us an assurance that even if we were, those \nprinciples would survive the conference. I understand that is a \ndifficult thing to do. Having said that, I must say that that \nunderstanding doesn't diminish at all my disappointment that we have \nfallen short.\n  I yield back.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware who, \nas usual, has described beautifully his position and the position which \nseveral of us on this side, who are cosponsors of the No Child Left \nBehind Act, believe in strongly. I would like to add to what he said \nbriefly by referring to what President Bush, 2 years ago in August, as \nwe were preparing for this debate, wisely said:\n\n       Accountability is an exercise in hope. When we raise \n     student standards, children raise their academic sights. When \n     children are regularly tested, teachers know where and how to \n     improve. When scores are known to parents, parents are \n     empowered to push for change. When accountability for our \n     schools is real, the results for our children are real.\n\n  This would be part of the Landrieu-Carper amendment that was, in \nessence, rejected. So it becomes a question, Is it just accountability \nfor taxpayer money when it comes to public schools but not taxpayer \nmoney when it goes to private schools? Again, let me say, if we started \nout on this course with a goal, the only goal being parental \nsatisfaction, we should never have started, because no amount of money \nin the Treasury will ever make every parent in America happy. It would \nbe a false, foolish journey to that end.\n  That wasn't why we started. We started to say the public money, if \nspent and managed correctly, could provide a very good education \nmeasured by academic performance. And along the way, if we could \nincrease parental satisfaction and taxpayer confidence, that would be \nthe best we could hope for. Yet proponents want to twist that debate, \nforget the accountability piece, and just keep saying: If parents are \nhappy, we have accomplished our goal. That is not our goal. We want \nparents to be satisfied, but that is not our goal.\n  Accountability is an exercise in hope. When we raise student \nstandards, children raise their academic sights. When children are \nregularly tested, teachers know how to improve. When scores are known \nto parents, parents are empowered to push for change. When \naccountability for our schools is real, the results for our children \nare real and the taxpayers get their money's worth. That is what this \nissue is about.\n  I will close, because my chairman has been very gracious, with a \nquote from another President, John Kennedy, on a similar subject.\n  I thank, again, my chairman, who has been more than gracious in terms \nof the time on this, and his staff. The two of us can come to a lot of \nagreements. It is just other Members, other interests. So we will \nsoldier on. But I just want him to know that he continues to have my \ngreatest respect as we work through this very important debate.\n  Let me close with a quote from a former President on another equally \nurgent matter to sort of capture my disappointment. I am not angry, but \nI am disappointed. President Kennedy, many years ago when our Nation \nwas faced with being left behind in the space race, as we are \nchallenged today being left behind in public education, to marshall the \nforces necessary to achieve the goal at that time, which was to win the \nrace to space and put a man on the Moon, said:\n\n       We possess all the resources and all the talents necessary. \n     But the facts of the matter are that we have never made the \n     national decisions or marshaled the national resources for \n     such leadership. We have never specified long-range goals on \n     an urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our \n     time so as to ensure their fulfillment . . .\n       Let it be clear that I am asking the Congress and the \n     country to accept a firm commitment to a new course of \n     action--a course which will last for many years and carry \n     very heavy costs . . . [but] if we were to only go halfway, \n     or reduce our sights in the face of difficulty, it would be \n     better not to go at all.\n  He was right. We didn't go halfway; we didn't go part of the way. We \ndidn't go for 2 years and then say I am sorry, we made a mistake, let's \ngo to another proposal. We stayed the course and, because of that, less \nthan 8 years later, we landed a man on the moon. In June in 1969, 8 \nyears and 1 month after the speech, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin \nlanded on the moon and Neil Armstrong said, ``One small step for \nAmerica, one giant leap for mankind.''\n  Mr. President, I will tell you as firmly--as I represent the people \nof my State--and as strongly as I can express\n\n[[Page S11976]]\n\nit, if we would stay the course, we would meet the goal. If we would \nmarshal the resources, we would meet the goal. But this debate, getting \nus off course, going in a different direction, undermining what we are \ndoing and underfunding what we are doing, will never get us there. That \nis what this debate is about.\n  I thank the chairman for allowing us to talk tonight. We will proceed \nwith this debate over the course of the next week until we can come to \nsome agreement as to how to proceed.\n  I yield back my time, and I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, again, I thank the ranking member, Senator \nLandrieu, for her good comments and, more importantly, I thank her for \nher good work on this bill.\n  There is a lot more to this bill, frankly, than just the scholarship \nportion of the bill. You would not know that by the debate, but there \nis an awful lot in this bill on which we all agree. Frankly, there is a \nlot on the education part we agree on as well.\n  I thank my colleague from Delaware for his good statement. They have \nboth contributed a lot to the debate tonight. I appreciate their good \nfaith and their commitment to the children and their good comments.\n  I want to take a moment before my friend from Alabama speaks, who has \nbeen on the floor for some time, to, at least from my perspective, \nexplain where I think these negotiations are and what happened with \nthem. I am afraid my perspective is a bit different than what my \ncolleague said, but I hope not too different. We negotiated in regard \nto the topics my colleagues have just discussed for 2 or 3 days. These \nwere negotiations that went on at the staff level, but they also went \non at the Member level. All three of us were directly involved. We \nspent all day yesterday involved in negotiations.\n  Quite frankly, the issues they have raised on the floor, I felt, and \ncontinue to feel, are very legitimate issues. These are not trivial \nissues; these are important issues. I felt and still feel at this \nmoment--I guess I am an eternal optimist--that these issues could be \nresolved on a policy basis among the three of us. I still feel they can \nbe resolved. The negotiations, candidly, broke down, as my colleague \nfrom Delaware said, when my two colleagues on the other side of the \naisle came to me and said there is one condition you have to meet that \nis not negotiable, and that condition is you have to guarantee these \nitems will come out of conference. That is one thing as chairman of the \nsubcommittee I cannot guarantee. I can guarantee I will fight for them \nin conference. I can guarantee I will represent the Senate position and \nthat I will do everything I can to get as much of what we agree on \nthrough the conference; but what I am not in a position to do is to \ngive any kind of ironclad guarantees to my colleagues--as much as I \nwould like to--that every single thing we would agree to, every single \nsentence, paragraph, word, comma, will come out of the conference \ncommittee with the other body. That just cannot be done. I am not in a \nposition to do that and to tell them that in good faith. I suppose I \ncan tell them that and it would not happen, but I am not going to do \nthat. So that is when the negotiations broke off.\n\n  I want the other Members of the Senate, both on my side of the aisle \nand the other side of the aisle, to understand that that is when the \nnegotiations broke off. If that is the condition of making an agreement \non this amendment we all could agree on, and that we can get this bill \npassed, then that is not going to happen.\n  Now if it is trying to work out all the very legitimate issues my \ncolleagues have just raised, then we can continue these negotiations. I \nam an eternal optimist, and I think we can work these out. I have told \nboth of my colleagues that. I don't think we are that far apart. These \nare legitimate issues, and we can work them out.\n  I see my colleague on her feet. I will not yield the floor, but I \nwill yield for a question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, did the Senator know--and I fully \nappreciate his position and I most certainly understand that even as \nthe powerful chairman he is, he is not able, of course, to make those \nconfirmations. I also know there are powers that can make such \narrangements, and the chairman is well aware of that. So we offer this \namendment in good faith, recognizing that if there truly is a view or a \ndesire to create a real, accountable pilot for children in failing \nschools in the District of Columbia that would show definitively \nwhether it works or not in 5 years, that meets the parameters of Leave \nNo Child Behind, that could be something that could be reached. That is \nwhat my intention would be. That is not the position of every single \nmember of the Democratic caucus. So as ranking member, I will also \nrepresent their position. But at this point, we don't see the \npossibility of that. I thank the chairman. I understand his position.\n  We look forward to continuing to lay down amendments that will try to \nimprove and perfect this proposal, or eventually to strike the language \nand try to move on a bill without any reference to the voucher \nproposal.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate my colleague's comments. Let me take a \nmoment to state where I think this bill is. My colleagues have talked \nabout some of the improvements they would like to make in the bill. I \nwas given a list here. We don't have an amendment before us. At this \npoint we don't have an amendment, but I think they are going to present \none at some point. So we don't have all the language to go through, but \nwe have talking points or some power points to look at. I will go \nthrough a couple of these points.\n  The first point is that eligible participating students must take the \nsame tests as kids in public schools. That was met and that is now part \nof the bill, as amended by Senator Feinstein's amendment. So we \nappreciate that contribution that now is a part of the bill as amended \nby Senator Feinstein, which the Senate just adopted about an hour ago.\n  The second provision talks about eligible participating students are \ntaught by a teacher who holds a college degree. That part of No. 2 is \nnow in there as far as Senator Feinstein had that in the amendment.\n  No. 3 requires a full and independent evaluation for the scholarship \nprogram. The Feinstein amendment that was passed by voice vote by this \nbody about an hour ago does require a full, independent evaluation.\n  I say to my colleague, the ranking member of the subcommittee, Ms. \nLandrieu, that we are more than happy to incorporate the Senator's \nspecific evaluation concerns that she has outlined and to work with her \non additional language as far as incorporating that into the bill.\n  Her fourth point, scholarships are limited to students attending \nfailing schools, the bill's language provides priority for students who \nare in failing schools. They are going to be the ones who get the \npriority. I point out to my colleagues that they are going to be the \nones who are going to be first in line. So that is the state of play. \nThat is where we are.\n  Let me make a couple of other additional points before I turn to my \ncolleague from Alabama. One is, my colleague asked, what is the \nadministration's position? Reference was made to the fact that in their \nletter the administration did not say they were for this three-pronged \napproach.\n  My colleague will be getting a letter from the administration \noutlining that, yes, they very definitely are for this three-pronged \napproach. They are for it. They are 100 percent behind it. They back \nit, and there will be a letter coming to her shortly and to this Senate \noutlining the administration's support of the three-pronged approach.\n  Earlier today we talked about the fact--I think it is significant--\nthat it was the Mayor and the Mayor's team who originally decided and \ncame to the Senate and the House and said: This is what we want; we \nwant this three-pronged approach. We want the additional money, this \nadd-on money, for the public schools.\n  We need to keep in mind that it has been this Mayor who has sought \nout additional money for the last several years for the public schools \nin the District of Columbia. So this is consistent with what he has \ndone in the past. He sought this additional $13 million. It is \nconsistent with what he has done when he has asked for additional money \nfor the charter schools. So in this bill we have an additional $13 \nmillion for the charter schools, again what the Mayor requested.\n  The third prong, of course, is the $13 million for the scholarships. \nSo it is\n\n[[Page S11977]]\n\nthe program of the Mayor of the District of Columbia. It is a very \nbalanced approach, new money, not taking any money away from the public \nschools but, in fact, doing just the opposite, new money for the public \nschools, new money for the charter schools, and new money for this new \nscholarship program. I think it is very important for us to keep this \nin mind.\n  My colleagues who are concerned about this bill have talked about No \nChild Left Behind. My esteemed colleague from Louisiana has talked \nabout this and has inferred that this is not really consistent with No \nChild Left Behind. It strikes me, with all due respect, that this is so \nconsistent with our program of No Child Left Behind, because if there \nis anyplace in this great country of ours where children have been left \nbehind, it is the District of Columbia. Through no fault of their own, \nthe children of the District of Columbia have truly been left behind.\n  What a great tragedy it is, when people come to the District of \nColumbia, they come to our Nation's Capital and they see the great \nmonuments, they see this great building, they see the great White \nHouse, they see this body, and yet if they truly understand what is \ngoing on here, they understand that there are children who are not \ngetting the education they deserve. They are not getting the education \nother children across this country are getting.\n  With this bill and with this very balanced approach, we are taking a \nstep towards giving the parents of these children more choices and \ngiving more opportunity to these children. I truly believe this is \nconsistent with our idea that there should be no child in this country \nleft behind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \nleadership and hard work on this issue and the Senator from Louisiana \nwho, I know, has also worked hard.\n  Education is a very important thing in this country. The title of the \noriginal education program proposed by President Bush, No Child Left \nBehind, is a powerful phrase. As the Senator from Ohio explained, this \nnation does not need to allow children to fall behind. We need to know \nwhat is going on. We need to find out how they are doing.\n  President Bush has proposed, and this Congress has passed, larger \nincreases in funding for education in the last three years than we saw \nin the previous eight. We have had a tremendous increase in education \nfunding from the Federal Government, but the problem was, and the \nchallenge and the important impact of No Child Left Behind is, that we \nare not just going to put money into systems that are not operating \neffectively and efficiently; systems that are allowing children to fall \nbehind.\n  Parents wake up, and their child is in the ninth or tenth grade and \ncannot do basic reading or basic math. They drop out of school, become \na discipline problem, and the child's life is not what it ought to be. \nThey will not reach the full potential that they ought to reach.\n  My wife taught four years, and I taught one year in public schools. \nWe care about education. Good friends of mine, as well as people we \nassociate with, are full-time teachers and we try to keep up with \neducation. We were active, particularly my wife, in our children's \neducation. We talked about how things were going at the school. We \nwanted to know.\n  My two daughters graduated from a large inner-city high school, \nracially fifty-fifty, in Mobile, Alabama. They have done very well. \nThey loved that high school, and it was very important to them. They \nare still loyal to Murphy High School.\n  This is a defining issue. That is why it has received so much \nattention. The Senator from Ohio is exactly correct, there are a lot of \ngood things in this bill other than just the scholarship portion. \nHowever, it is a big deal. What we are saying is that we care about \nchildren more than we care about bureaucracies, laws and regulations \nthat do not work. We are saying that what life gives in the form of \neducation to children is important.\n  Make no mistake about it, this is about power. A middle-income child \nor a poor-income child in this city is in a certain school district. \nThey cannot do anything with that. Maybe their parents bought a house \nthere 10 years ago. Maybe they can't afford to sell it. Maybe the price \nhas gone down. Or whatever--they are in that district. Then they are \nassigned to a certain school. If that school does not perform, what \nhappens? They go to the school board, and they say sorry, that is your \ndistrict.\n\n  The parent says: I don't like this school.\n  It doesn't make any difference. Doesn't make any difference to us. \nYou don't like this school? By law you must go to this school. They are \nsent there by order of the State or the city or the school system, and \nthey have no choice in the matter.\n  Some schools in this very District, and some schools all over the \ncountry, are not working. Some of them are not safe. Some of them are \nnot effective or efficient. Some of them are not producing the quality \nof education they could produce. The children who are sent to those \nschools are sentenced to a situation that makes it far more difficult \nfor them to achieve success in their educational life than they would \nany other way. It is a big deal.\n  What happens when Senators and Congressmen are in that situation? \nThey just decide to move out to the Maryland or Virginia suburbs and \nbuy a $300,000 or $500,000 house and they put their kids in a school \nthey like. Vice President Gore sent his kids over to St. Albans. That \nprobably costs as much or more than the University of Alabama for a \nyear. That is what they do because they can do those things.\n  But what happens to average Americans who cannot do that? They are \nstuck where the State sends them.\n  Dr. Paige, our Secretary of Education, himself a teacher of education \nand a former superintendent of the Houston school system, reformed that \nschool system dramatically. Do you know what he said about it? He said: \nWhen I was there and we were losing students to private schools, my \nview was I cared about the kids. If they could get a better education \nin a private school, so be it. I hope they can go there. It doesn't \nhurt me. My job is to make this system work so they can be educated \nhere. He said: With the money we have from the Government and \nadvantages we have, there is no way we ought not to be able to compete \nwith the private school system.\n  He said we lost kids, but he took firm control of discipline. He took \nfirm control of the mismanagement. He took firm control by testing, and \nhe made sure test scores were going up. He said in 5 years we were \ngaining kids back from private schools. They were happy to be in our \nschool system. Not that it was a huge number one way or the other, but \npeople did choose in that fashion.\n  But the average working American does not have those choices. It is \njust not financially possible for them. The wealthy can do it but not \nthe poor. They are stuck. So this is what it is all about. You have the \nMayor of this city, the leader of the school board of this city, and \nthey care about children, too. They love the children; they want to see \nthem succeed. When they have concluded that this program would help the \nchildren, why are we so upset about it? Why are we so determined and \nfrustrated about it? Why do we get frustrated about it? I ask that \nquestion.\n  I think there is a resistance to change here. It has been said that \nthey have totally eliminated religion from public schools. But within \nthe establishment of the public schools, I would say that is not true, \nreally. There is at least some religion left. There is one law that \ngoes beyond logic to the point I would say of religion, and that is: \nThou shalt not spend one dollar on schools that doesn't go through a \nsystem that the American Education Association doesn't have something \nto do with.\n  It is our money, they think. It has to be spent on our schools. Not \none dime can be allowed to be spent by a child who might want to have \nan alternative or choice in their education. Frankly, I think we do not \nneed to be that uptight about it.\n  The way this thing came up, we talked about it in the Senate and \nthere was an effort in the No Child Left Behind bill to allow all the \nStates to have scholarship programs. That did not go into the bill. It \njust was a fight we were not prepared to make at the time.\n  There was not agreement or consensus on it. But this is not a State. \nIt\n\n[[Page S11978]]\n\nis the Federal District of Columbia. It is part of the Federal \nGovernment. It is an area that we do not have a separation of Federal \nand State governments, where there is not a State's rights question \nabout these matters. It is a matter within our jurisdiction, No. 1.\n  No. 2, the Mayor and the school board president want it. They asked \nus for it.\n  The people want it. They have children lined up to get into this \nprogram. I love educators, and I love and appreciate education. I \nbelieve the public schools do a terrific job for the most part in \nAmerica. I have been pleased with the public schools my children have \nattended. But if they were not getting a good education there, one that \nwas sufficient, I would have done what I could to make sure they got a \ngood education. I think most Americans would. But for the poor, they \ndon't have that option. They can't send their children to St. Albans. \nThey can't send their kids to some other school if they are not happy, \nand I think we need to deal with that.\n  I salute the chairman, Senator DeWine. I suggest the Feinstein \namendment does many of the things that Senator Landrieu wants to do. I \ncould support that, and I am comfortable with the Feinstein amendment. \nBut if we are going to come up with an amendment that makes it so \ndifficult for the schools in this area who have agreed to take children \nat a discount of 40 percent or more from the cost that is being \nexpended for education in the District, that they will not accept them \nor it creates a bureaucracy--which is one of the things that makes it \nmore difficult for public schools to perform well--if we are going to \ndo that, I am not for it.\n  I know Senator DeWine will be wrestling with that and listening to \nthe Senators and their suggestions. But I would note we have a reality \nand that is there are two bodies, a House and a Senate. The House of \nRepresentatives deserves equal sway in these matters. That shouldn't \nchange just because a few Senators believe something is important--I \nbelieve a lot of things are important and I have not been able to have \nthem come out exactly as I want.\n  I think the Feinstein amendment does what Senator Landrieu wants. We \nhave not seen the exact wording of Senator Landrieu's amendment, so I \nguess we will have to look at it to know. This body needs to act in the \nbest interests of the schoolchildren of the District of Columbia. We \nhave a Mayor elected to take care of them. We have a school board \npresident who loves our children and wants them to succeed. They have \nsaid this program is the way to do it. This is what we need to improve \ntheir chances at a better life. I believe it is, too. I see no danger \nin going forward with it.\n  If the program turns out to be a failure, so be it. We will end it. I \ndon't know that it will. Frankly, I think it is more likely to be a \nsuccess than not.\n  I am glad the Senator from Ohio is leading this effort, and I look \nforward to working with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his \nvery fine statement. I think he is absolutely right. This is a pilot \nprogram. But it is a chance we have to take. These are children who \nneed this opportunity. Their parents need this opportunity.\n  As we have talked about before on the Senate floor, you have the \nMayor of this city coming to this Congress and saying: Give me the \ntools. Give me the tools to help shape the educational system in the \nDistrict of Columbia. For us to turn our back on the Mayor, to turn our \nback on children, and the parents, I think would be a very serious \nmistake.\n  We have the opportunity to do something very positive. I think we \nshould take that opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11978-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I take a brief few minutes to say a few \nwords about a situation that I think is a slap in the face to a brave \nNevadan but also to thousands of others who wear the uniform of our \ngreat Republic.\n  Bill Murwin is a deputy sheriff in Lyon County, one of 17 Nevada \ncounties. It is a rural county, even though it is becoming more urban \nall the time with the tremendous growth in Fernley and Silver Springs. \nStill we think of it as a rural county, a little over 60 miles outside \nof Reno.\n  In addition to Bill being deputy sheriff, he is also a staff sergeant \nin the Marine Corps Reserve. When his country called, he left his \nfamily and went to fight in Iraq. He was wounded a few months ago when \na grenade exploded in a vehicle in which he was riding. He was treated \nat a military hospital in Germany and then because of the seriousness \nof his injury he spent 4 weeks at Bethesda. I am sorry to say this, but \nat Bethesda Naval Hospital he had to have part of his left foot \namputated.\n  Obviously, we owe a debt of gratitude to Sergeant Murwin, just as we \nowe a debt of gratitude to all those who bravely fought for our freedom \nover the years, particularly in the sands and cities of Iraq.\n  Instead of gratitude--it is hard to comprehend--Bill Murwin got a \nbill from the Government in the amount of $243. Three days later he got \na second bill, along with a threat that his account would be turned \nover to a collection agency if he did not pay up immediately.\n  For what did he owe this large sum of $243? I say that somewhat \nfacetiously, but to him $243 was a large amount of money. It was for \nthe food he ate when he was having his foot amputated. It seems that \nmilitary personnel who do not eat in a messhall, including those who \nhave families, receive a monthly allowance for their food. But when our \ntroops are wounded, they eat in a hospital, they are billed by the \nGovernment $8.10 a day for their hospital meals.\n  I found out what happened to Sergeant Murwin when a coworker sent an \ne-mail to my office. I was disillusioned, disappointed, and somewhat \nupset to learn we have a policy and it has been in place for 22 years.\n  Our troops in combat who are eating field chow are already allowed to \nkeep their food allowance. Certainly, the same policy should apply to \nthose who are in a hospital recovering from the injuries they received \nin the field.\n  When a soldier is wounded in combat, we should not add insult to \ninjury by making him pay for his hospital food. I am proud of Sergeant \nMurwin for coming forward to shed light on this mistaken policy.\n  Today, he told a member of my staff:\n\n       This isn't about me. There are guys in the hospital who are \n     18 or 19 years old and have been there for three months or \n     longer. . . .Some of them are expecting bills of $1,000 or \n     more. They [are] really fretting those bills.\n\n  I think it is a national disgrace that anyone in this country has to \nworry about decent health care--and 44 million people have to worry \nabout decent health care. But, really, when a soldier who is wounded in \ncombat lies in a hospital bed worrying about a bill from his own \nGovernment for the food he is eating in the hospital, that is a little \ntoo much.\n  I also acknowledge my friend, the Congressman from Florida, \nRepresentative Young. When he heard about this, he sent a bill to the \nGovernment to repay this bill for Sergeant Murwin. So I publicly \nacknowledge and appreciate what I read in the paper that my friend, \nCongressman Young, had done.\n  I am proud to cosponsor Senator Graham's bill that would correct this \nridiculous policy. I salute, as I said, Congressman Young for \nintroducing a similar bill in the House and for paying the bill, \nliterally, of my constituent.\n  I hope every Member of both Chambers will act quickly to correct this \noutrage. And it is an outrage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11978-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11978-S11979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GREG MADDUX\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a great Nevadan, a \ngreat human being and a great athlete, my friend, Greg Maddux.\n  Mr. Maddux pitches for the Atlanta Braves baseball club. Since he \nwent to Atlanta almost 11 years ago, the\n\n[[Page S11979]]\n\nBraves have won their division every single season.\n  This is no coincidence. Greg Maddux has been the heart and soul of \nthe Atlanta Braves, and the key to their remarkable string of success.\n  From 1992 through 1995, he won the Cy Young award, as the best \npitcher in baseball, four years in a row. No other pitcher has ever \naccomplished that and I doubt anyone else ever will.\n  He finished the 1990s with a 2.54 earned run average for the decade. \nOnly two pitchers had posted a better ERA over a decade since 1910--\nHoyt Wilhelm and Sandy Koufax. That is pretty good company. And in \n1995, Maddux became the first pitcher to log back-to-back seasons with \nan ERA under 1.80.\n  From 1990 through 2001--12 consecutive years--Greg won the National \nLeague Gold Glove as the league's best-fielding pitcher.\n  He pitched nine scoreless innings in Game One of the 1995 World \nSeries, leading the Braves over the Cleveland Indians.\n  Greg could have retired years ago, and he would still be assured of \nentering the Baseball Hall of Fame on the first day he is eligible.\n  But he keeps pitching, and he keeps setting a new standard of \nexcellence.\n  Sunday, he broke a record that had been held by the great Cy Young \nhimself, winning at least 15 games for the 16th consecutive season. \nYoung's record of 15 games for 15 seasons had stood for 98 years, since \n1905.\n  For a major league pitcher, winning 15 games in a season is a feat \nthat only the best will ever accomplish. To do it for 16 straight years \nis almost unthinkable.\n  They say records are made to be broken. Well, I think this one will \nstand for a long, long time.\n  The success of Greg Maddux is even more amazing when you consider \nthat he doesn't have overwhelming speed. In an era of 100 mph \nfastballs, his clock in the mid-80s. He doesn't try to overpower \nhitters; he just outsmarts them.\n  Maddux is an unsurpassed student of the game who relies on his \npinpoint control and his unyielding determination. He never gives in to \nhitters. He makes them swing at his pitches.\n  After he defeated the Florida Marlins to break Cy Young's record, 72-\nyear-old Florida manager Jack McKeon said, ``He doesn't get you out--he \nmakes you get yourself out.''\n  Anybody who is a baseball fan, as I am, would be proud to know Greg \nMaddux. But he is more than a great athlete. He is a great person.\n  He is a devoted family man, married to a wonderful wife, Kathy. They \nhave a daughter Amanda Paige, and a son Chase Alan.\n  Obviously, the Maddux family could live anywhere they want to. I am \nproud that they have chosen to live in Las Vegas, where Greg grew up \nand graduated from Valley High School.\n  Greg doesn't endorse commercial products, and he has no interest in \nthe glamorous life of a celebrity. Instead, he and his family live \nquietly, giving generously of their time and money for causes that \nbenefit our community.\n  Kathy and Greg lead the Maddux Foundation, which is involved in \nseveral charitable activities in Las Vegas and Atlanta. The Foundation \nsupports children's homes, domestic crisis shelters, and boys and girls \nclubs. In recent years, the Madduxes have expanded their philanthropic \nefforts, helping even more kids.\n  Greg's brother Mike also has a foundation that helps children. And he \nhappens to be a pretty good pitcher in own right.\n  Mike Maddux began his major league career in 1986 with the \nPhiladelphia Phillies, and played in the big leagues for 15 seasons. \nHe, like his brother Greg, is a role model for Nevadas' and our voting \nyouth.\n  Both of the Maddux brothers are great baseball players, but even more \nimportant, they are great neighbors.\n  Baseball fans all over America know Greg Maddux as one of the \ngreatest pitchers in the history of the game.\n  In southern Nevada, we know him as a devoted family man, a positive \nrole model for kids, and a generous contributor to our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11979-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11979-S11980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under \nSection 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate \nscorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con.

The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2004 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, H.

Mr. President, every year since 1968, in the period \nbetween September 15 and October 15, our Nation observes Hispanic \nHeritage Month. This month-long celebration offers us a special \nopportunity to reflect on and pay tribute to the innumerable ways that \nHispanic Americans, and Hispanic culture, enrich both our daily lives \nand the diverse heritage of the Nation.\n  According to the Census Bureau, some 38 million Hispanic Americans \ntoday live in the United States--and increasingly, in every corner of \nthe United States. While many Hispanic Americans choose to live in \nparts of the country with proud and long-established Hispanic \ntraditions; others are finding work, raising families and building \nvigorous Hispanic communities in places where, until recently, they did \nnot exist or were little noticed. In politics, the arts, the media, \nsports, our colleges and universities, Hispanic Americans are a vital \npresence--architects of the American spirit. Even our taste in food \nreflects the degree to which Hispanic traditions are now woven into the \nfabric of our lives: tortillas are as much a staple of the national \ndiet as pizza and bagels, and salsa has ended the reign of ketchup as \nthe nation's most popular condiment.\n  Hispanic Americans bring to American life not one culture but many. \nTheir roots reach to Central and South America and the Caribbean, and \nbeyond, to Europe and Africa; every community enriches a great, \nunderlying cultural foundation with its own distinctive variations. My \nown State of Maryland offers a brilliant example. There are some \n228,000 Hispanic Americans in the State, a number that has increased by \n82 percent since the 1990 census. Marylanders today are fortunate to \nhave co-workers and neighbors from Europe, Africa, South and Central \nAmerica and close cultural ties to the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal. \nFrom Puerto Ricans in New York to the Mexican communities of \nCalifornia, Hispanic Americans are changing the face of America and \nteaching us to celebrate the glory of the multi-faith, multi-cultural \nfamily that constitutes this great country. In my own State of \nMaryland, there are 228,000 Hispanic Americans, an increase of more \nthan 82 percent since 1990, and they come from at least a dozen \ncountries. In every county in Maryland, from the Eastern Shore to the \nwestern reaches of the State, Hispanic Americans have found a home.\n  Nonetheless, across the country Hispanic Americans face numerous \nchallenges. Eager to work, too often they can find only low-paying \njobs; the income level of Hispanic households is on average $15,000 \nless than that of white households, and almost one-third of Hispanic \nAmericans live below the official poverty line. While Hispanics make up \nabout 13 percent of the U.S. population, a study by the Hispanic \nAssociation on Corporate Responsibility found that Hispanics account \nfor only 4.6 percent of U.S. firms' company officials and managers. \nDespite a 10 percent increase in population in just the last two years, \nHispanic voting participation remains worryingly static.\n  In the great tradition of newcomers to the United States, Hispanic \nAmericans come in search of better lives, decent jobs, and a chance to \nraise their families in peace and prosperity. Many of us in the \nCongress, whose families came here in an earlier time for just those \nreasons, know full well what that means. As public servants we have an \nopportunity, and indeed I would say an obligation, to ensure that every \ngeneration of Americans has access to the opportunities that were given \nto us. In doing so we keep our Nation on course to achieving the \nprinciples set out in the founding documents of our Nation.\n  We must not let language or economic or social status stand in the \nway of the full participation of all our people in our community life, \nand we must not permit these factors to become a barrier to our public \ninstitutions and services. In the history of this country no \nopportunity has been more important than the chance to go to school--\nimportant to the individual, with incalculable benefits to the society \nas a whole. That is why I have cosponsored S. 1545, the Development, \nRelief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, which would make it \neasier for States to provide in-state tuition status to students \nwithout regard to immigration status, and allow some immigrant students \nwho have been in this country for five years or more to apply for legal \nstatus. It is my hope that for thousands of our newest Americans the \nDREAM Act will prove to be an important step along the way to living a \nrewarding and productive life.\n  As Hispanic Americans move proudly into the mainstream of American \nlife, Hispanic Heritage Month is our time to celebrate all their \naccomplishments and contributions and to commit us anew to ensuring \nthat all Americans have access to the wondrous opportunities our Nation \noffers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11980-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11980-S11981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MATTHEW J. RYAN VETERINARY HOSPITAL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition regarding the \nrenaming of the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania \nin memory of the former Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of \nRepresentatives, Matthew J. Ryan.\n  Matt Ryan, whom I knew for many years, cared deeply for the people of \nPennsylvania. He loved the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and \nmade service his calling. Elected in 1962, he was one of its longest \nserving members and one of its longest serving Speakers, presiding for \nsix terms.\n  As much as Speaker Ryan loved Pennsylvania, the people of \nPennsylvania and his colleagues from both parties loved him. Known on \nboth sides of the aisle for the fair manner in which he presided over \nthe House, Matt was a\n\n[[Page S11981]]\n\ncommitted leader, tough debater, parliamentary tactician, and \nPennsylvania booster. He spoke with great passion, and often was \npraised for his statesmanship, compassion, openness, Irish wit, and \nintelligence.\n  Upon his death earlier this year, he became the first person whose \nbody lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda in Harrisburg since Abraham \nLincoln.\n  A true friend of animals--especially his black Labrador, Magic--Matt \nRyan was very proud of the University of Pennsylvania School of \nVeterinary Medicine. It is in no small part because of his decades of \nsupport that the school today is one of the finest in the world.\n  Founded in 1884, the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary \nMedicine was established at the urging of Penn's School of Medicine. It \nwas recognized that prevention and control of animal diseases had \nimportant implications for human health. This is as true today as it \nwas then--perhaps even more so--as we face a future in which advances \nin veterinary medicine's ability to understand biological threats will \nbe critical in our ability to fight bioterrorism.\n  In February 2003, the month before Matt's untimely death, the \nUniversity decided to honor his support by renaming the Veterinary \nHospital after him. Benjamin Franklin is the only other State \npolitician for whom a building on the University's campus has been \nnamed.\n  The renaming ceremony took place on Friday, September 19, 2003, and \nso I ask my colleagues to join me in reflecting on the legacy of \nSpeaker Matthew J. Ryan, one of the truest Pennsylvanians and a \nchampion of people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11981-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I take time today to tell the Senate \nabout a hero who made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of his Nation--a \nyoung man who died in the Korean war. His name is Ralph Ray Mitola.\n  He came from Broad Channel, NY. For those Senators who are not \nfamiliar with Broad Channel, it is a populated island in Jamaica Bay. \nIt is part of Queens County, which is one of the boroughs of the City \nof New York. Cross Bay Boulevard connects Broad Channel to the \nRockaways, which are a magnificent gateway to the Atlantic Ocean.\n  The American Legion Broad Channel Memorial Post 1404 recently honored \nthe memory of Ralph Mitola, and four other young men from Broad Channel \nwho died in the Korean war. The occasion for the ceremony was the 50th \nanniversary of the armistice in Korea, which was observed by American \nLegion Post 1404 as part of the 85th Annual Queens County Convention \nParade. Mr. President, July 27, 1953 is the day in history when \nnegotiators signed the armistice agreement at Panmunjom. The armistice \nled to a North Korean withdrawal across the 38th parallel, and the \nRepublic of South Korea regained its status as a free and democratic \nnation. Korea was a critical battleground in the defense of liberty \nagainst the totalitarian ideologies of the 20th century. Ralph Mitola \nleft his home and traveled half a world away to the Korean Peninsula to \ndefend freedom.\n  Corporal Mitola was a member of Company C, 1st Battalion, 23d \nInfantry Regiment, 2d Infantry Division. On August 1, 1952, during a \nnight attack on ``Old Baldy'' in North Korea, he was killed by small \narms fire. Corporal Mitola was awarded the Purple Heart, the Combat \nInfantryman's Badge, the Korean Service Medal, the United Nations \nService Medal, the National Defense Service Medal and the Korean War \nService Medal.\n  As our Nation's soldiers are once again fighting for the cause of \nfreedom overseas, it is all the more important to remember those who \nhelped protect America on the Korean Peninsula a half century ago.\n  Ralph Mitola, born April 10, 1931, killed in action, August 1, 1952.\n  Mr. President, his loved ones and comrades in arms are eternally \nproud of him. I honor his memory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11981-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WALTER FRANCIS GROSS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON.

Mr. President, last week the Department of Commerce signed \nthe sixth amendment to a memorandum of understanding between the \nInternet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers, ICANN, and the \nCommerce Department. The first agreement was signed in 1998 to \nestablish an organizational body to manage the technical coordination \nof the Internet Domain Name Addressing System. In the subsequent years \nthe agreement has been amended to reflect the needs of the organization \nto accommodate the industry and constituency it was created to support.\n  The Department of Commerce is hopeful this will be the last agreement \nthey have to sign with ICANN. The hope is for ICANN to show they have \nbecome a responsible organization and there can be a transition of the \nDomain Name System, DNS, management to private sector control, out of \nthe hands of the department permanently.\n  Several items of interest have been brought to my attention during \nour oversight hearing on ICANN that I would like the Department of \nCommerce to consider before ICANN receives the freedom they want as an \nindependent organization. They must first prove they are doing their \njob. I would encourage the Department of Commerce to establish dates of \naccomplishment to the milestones they have set out in their most recent \nmemorandum of understanding with ICANN.\n  Specific, quantifiable goals will help ascertain if ICANN has created \na stable environment where innovation and competition can flow freely \nfor the area surrounding the DNS.\n  It was noted before Congress in the July 31, 2003, hearing that ICANN \nshould be the organization to provide a forum for best practices for \nthe naming and numbering system. The recent amendment to the memorandum \nof understanding notes the need to continue to develop and test \naccountability mechanisms. I would ask the department to set a date to \ndetermine if these best practices guidelines focusing on stability, \nsecurity and interoperability have been determined and a set time for \ntheir implementation. The initial best practices could be established \nby a working group by the beginning of 2004 with a follow-up strategic \nplan for\n\n[[Page S11983]]\n\nimplementation of the first best practice guideline for the industry \nwith in the first 6 months of 2004.\n  The memorandum of understanding recommends the continued development \nand implementation of transparent procedures. I would again call for a \ndate certain to ensure the decisionmaking process set by ICANN is \ntransparent, predictable and timely for all parties involved in the \ndecisions ICANN influences. Established procedures for a transparent \ndecisionmaking process should be established by the end of this year to \nensure ICANN has this as a top priority and as a signal to ensure the \nindustry and constituents involved in ICANN can begin to plan for a \nprocess that will be applied equally across all parties and in a \npredictable fashion.\n  One concern that has been noted through our congressional oversight \nhearing is that parties with contractual obligations to ICANN are \ndisadvantaged in providing services that non-ICANN contracted parties \nare free to offer. There is reason for this discrepancy to exist in an \nopen market. ICANN should take into consideration the entire global \nInternet industry when making decisions. Disadvantaging contracted \nparties should be a thing of ICANN's past and new service level \nagreements should be negotiated with all ICANN participants that allow \nthe rights of a registry and root zone operator to independently \ndetermine functionality, pricing and operations of existing services \nand sue services as part of their new agreement with the Department of \nCommerce.\n  The decisionmaking process needs visible criteria and independent \narbitration procedures to ensure no party is being unjustly prosecuted \nby decisions made at the hands of the ICANN board. Ensuring that ICANN \nis considered a decisionmaker in global economic commerce hinges on \ntheir ability to reach agreements with the other international bodies. \nThey have been required in previous memorandums of understanding to \nreach agreements with the other country code operators. I would call on \nthe Department of Commerce to put a target date in place for ICANN to \nreach an agreement with a majority of the other country code operators.\n  The new leadership of both ICANN and at the National \nTelecommunications Information Administration should be able to take a \nfresh look at the challenges that lie before ICANN and its partners and \nbring a more orderly and professionally accountable way of doing \nbusiness that encourages competition, innovation and stability for the \nglobal internet structure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11983-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

On November 16, 2002, a 31-year-old Pakistani man was physically \nassaulted at a convenience store where he was working. Three men, \nbelieving the store clerk was from Afghanistan and associated with the \nSeptember 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on America, shouted racial slurs \nat the man and then proceeded to kick, punch and throw things at him. \nThe trio were later charged with a hate crime violation.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11983-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IRAQ SECURITY AND STABILIZATION FUND ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have joined with Senators Biden, \nKerry and Corzine to introduce legislation that will provide us with \nthe necessary financial footing to appropriately execute our \nobligations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In 1998, following nearly 30 years of deficits and a 17-fold increase \nin Federal debt from $365.8 billion to $6.4 trillion, bipartisan \ncooperation brought the budget back into balance once again. For the \nfirst time in more than a generation, some of the funds which would \nhave gone to pay interest on the debt were instead spent actually \npaying down the debt.\n  Now, deficits and interest costs are growing once again. Net interest \npayments on the Federal debt will increase sharply, from approximately \n$170 billion in 2003 to more than $300 billion by 2012.\n  We face a host of new challenges, particularly the war on terror, the \nwar in Iraq, and the threat of North Korea. This has necessarily led to \na shift in government spending toward improving our defense and \nhomeland security capabilities. Yet many of the challenges predating \nSeptember 11 are still with us: improving education, updating \ninfrastructure, and preparing for the retirement of the baby-boom \ngeneration, which will severely strain the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds.\n  The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the Federal deficit for \nfiscal year 2004 will top $500 billion. A portion of every dollar we \nspend from this day forward until the end of September 2004 will be \nborrowed money--money that our children and grandchildren will have to \nrepay.\n  It is no secret that if citizens wish to receive services or \nundertake activities as a Nation, they have the right to levy a tax \nupon themselves to achieve those ends. We have somehow lost this sense \nof obligation and have concluded that providing for our national \ndefense or for the education of children requires no more than charging \nthe costs to a government credit card. This must stop.\n  We are spending our way into economic oblivion. The President has \ndecided that the best way to reelection is to cut taxes and leave \nspending alone. He refuses to make the tough decisions. So, with my \ncolleagues in the Senate, I will help him. If the President wishes to \nengage our troops in Iraq, a decision that I agreed with and continue \nto support, then he must agree to pay for it.\n  By seeking a modest increase in the tax rate that affects those \nmaking more than $310,000 in taxable income we can pay for the \nPresident's most recent supplemental request. This bill generates \nprecisely $87 billion--enough to cover a portion of the cost of the war \nin Iraq and an even smaller part of our obligation in Afghanistan.\n  This bill is a first step toward putting our fiscal house in order. \nIt would pay for the President's supplemental spending request and it \ndoes not revoke the 2001 reduction in the top income tax rate. Nor \nwould it affect any other element of the 2001 tax package. It would \nmerely temporarily raise the marginal income tax rate on the richest in \nour society. These individuals would continue to benefit from the other \naspects of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, many of which predominantly \naccrued to them.\n  Nearly a decade ago, thanks to the commitment of Senators from both \nparties and all ideological persuasions, we were able to put in motion \na successful plan to balance the Federal budget, and laid the \ngroundwork for an unprecedented period of economic growth and \nprosperity.\n  I believe this bill moves us back to this path and represents our \nunderstanding that we have an obligation as a society to raise money \nfrom time to time to pay for those activities we deem important to our \nnational well-being.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11983-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11983-S11984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     HONORING THE 55th ANNIVERSARY OF BLACK HILLS NATIONAL CEMETERY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to express our \nNation's gratitude for the respectful services provided by Black Hills \nNational Cemetery near Sturgis, SD. This year marks the 55th \nanniversary of the cemetery, and comes at a time when all Americans \nhave been painfully reminded that our freedom is preserved by brave men \nand women in uniform who are willing to risk their lives in service to \nour Nation.\n  In the summer of 1862, thousands of soldiers had already died in a \nterrible\n\n[[Page S11984]]\n\nwar that few believed would last more than a matter of months. On July \n17 of that same year, Congress enacted legislation that would authorize \nthe President to purchase cemetery grounds to be used as national \ncemeteries for soldiers who died while in service to the country. It \nwas not long after that, in 1873, that all honorably discharged \nveterans became eligible for burial in national cemeteries. According \nto local legend, the hoofbeats of Custer's Cavalry may still be faintly \nheard today in the shadows of the Black Hills, where the Black Hills \nNational Cemetery has provided a dedicated area for the honored burial \nof past and present South Dakota members of our Nation's armed forces \nand their eligible dependents for the past 55 years.\n  Too often, it seems that Congress forgets those men and women who \nsacrificed a part of their lives to serve their country. In a Nation as \nwealthy as ours, the very least we can do to repay veterans for their \nservice is to provide them with the final resting place they deserve. \nToday, the National Cemetery Association ensures our veterans have a \nproper burial, while also maintaining the national cemeteries as \nshrines to their memory. In the words of Abraham Lincoln, the ``nation \nmust care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow \nand his orphan.''\n  The Black Hills National Cemetery has long been part of that \nrespected tradition since World War II, when the first four burials \nwere conducted on September 27, 1948. Three additional burials were \ndone before the official dedication of the Black Hills National \nCemetery on October 3, 1948. Since those initial entombments, the \nremains of more than 17,000 courageous soldiers who have served their \ncountry have been laid to rest there, including South Dakota's only \ncasualty from Operation Iraqi Freedom, Hans Gukheisen.\n  The Black Hills National Cemetery is also the final resting place to \nsuch notable men as United States Senator Francis H. Case, who also \ngave the dedication address in 1948, suggesting that the Black Hills \nNational Cemetery be the ``Arlington of the West,'' and Brigadier \nGeneral Richard E. Ellsworth, Commander of the Rapid City Air Force \nBase, which was later renamed Ellsworth Air Force Base in his honor, \nwas also laid to rest there.\n  As the father of a soldier who has recently returned from Iraq, I \nhave made it a priority to give veterans the recognition and treatment \nthey deserve for their outstanding service to our country. I am proud \nto have the Black Hills National Cemetery located in my home State of \nSouth Dakota, and I am honored today to congratulate the Black Hills \nNational Cemetery on their first 55 years of service. I know that our \nentire Nation shares in this expression of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11984-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MILLIE MAIRS AWARDED 2003 ``ANGELS IN ADOPTION'' AWARD\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Mrs. \nMillie Mairs, a woman who has demonstrated her enormous capacity for \nlove by serving some of West Virginia's most vulnerable children. \nThrough her work with the West Virginia Children's Home Society \nAdoption Program, Millie has touched the lives of many new families in \nmy home state and is a cornerstone of adoption services there. Later \nthis month, Millie will be honored alongside other ``Angels in \nAdoption.'' This is a special award created by the Congressional \nAdoption Caucus. I would like to take a moment to tell you more about \nthe work and accomplishments of this quiet, gentle lady who has worked \non behalf of children for more than twenty years at the West Virginia \nChildren's Home Society.\n  The West Virginia Children's Home Society was created in 1896 and has \nlong provided care for children in need. Today, the Society offers \nadoptive, child protective, and emergency services through an expanded \nmission. Twenty-eight years ago, Millie Mairs came to the Children's \nHome Society Adoption Program as an adoption secretary in order to \nassist West Virginia families who hoped to adopt a child. Since then, \nMillie has served those families in a variety of roles and has \nmaintained a strong relationship with many of them, including some of \nher very first clients. From administering support services to meeting \nwith perspective parents to guiding birth mothers through appropriate \nafter care, Millie's name has become synonymous with adoption advocacy \nin West Virginia.\n  Those who know Millie best say that no one is better suited to serve \nas an adoption advocate than she. Her colleagues use words such as \n``rare,'' ``special,'' ``kind,'' and ``considerate'' in order to \ndescribe her. Her clients depend on her as they complete necessary \npaperwork and interviews, and as they work through the many emotions \nthat adoption brings. And while Millie serves as a valuable resource \nfor those entering into the adoption system today, her knowledge of \nprevious adoptions is priceless to those who seek even the smallest \namount of information about their past. Millie has provided a \ncomforting ear and soothing words to these individuals since her first \ndays at the Children's Home Society and has also reunited birth mothers \nand their children from that time. She has always understood and has \ntried to convey to others that adoption is a selfless act of love from \nthe perspective of both birth mothers and adoptive parents. As you can \nimagine, this has brought great comfort to children, birth mothers, and \nadoptive parents alike.\n  The Angels in Adoption Award recognizes individuals like Millie who \nwork every day to better the lives of others through the field of \nadoption. On September 30, Millie and other Angels will come to \nWashington in order to be recognized for their good works. While they \nwill look just as any other visitors to the Capitol complex that day, I \nhave been assured by Millie's colleagues and by others that they truly \nare angels in our midst. I hope that you will help me in welcoming them \nand honoring them. Further, I hope that you will carry their message \nwith you: that all children deserve a safe, healthy, and permanent home \nand that, for some children, this is only possible through adoption.\n  I have worked for many years in bipartisan coalitions to promote \nadoption and improved services for abused and neglected children. While \nthese issues rarely command headlines, they change the lives of \nchildren and families across our country. People like Millie Mairs and \nprograms like Angels in Adoption remind us of the importance of our \nadoption and child welfare programs. In 1997, Congress passed the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act to ensure that a child's health and \nsafety are paramount, and to express the belief that every child \ndeserves a permanent home. Since then, adoptions from foster care have \nnearly doubled. While this is wonderful news, more than 100,000 \nchildren remain in foster care. As Millie and her peers would tell us, \nwe clearly have more work to do.\n  I am delighted to have had this opportunity to tell you more about \nMillie Mairs and her work with the West Virginia Children's Home \nSociety. I have long believed that the people of West Virginia are its \ngreatest resource; individuals such as Millie prove this point again \nand again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11984-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11984-S11985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING JUDY HADLEY OF LINCOLN, RHODE ISLAND\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wish to share with my colleagues \na story demonstrating one person's ability to protect the environment \nfrom the threat of pollution, for the benefit of wildlife and human \nenjoyment alike.\n  Thirty years after the passage of the Clean Water Act, the Blackstone \nRiver has shaken off a legacy of neglect and re-emerged as a vital \ncommunity asset. The water quality has improved, a bikeway is under \nconstruction, and mill buildings are being restored as apartments and \ncondominiums.

And just last week, I joined the Army Corps of \nEngineers in celebrating the restoration of wetlands in a floodplain \nthat had been paved over for 50 years. So there is a great deal of \nactivity on the banks of the Blackstone.\n  While the Federal Government has been a major player in the river's \nrebirth, none of these exciting developments would have been possible \nwithout the personal commitment of Blackstone Valley residents. It is \ntheir hard\n\n[[Page S11985]]\n\nwork and, more importantly, their heightened vigilance and renewed \nsense of ownership of the river that have helped it to thrive.\n  One such resident is Judy Hadley of Lincoln, RI a town of about \n21,000 people, located on the Blackstone River. As the chair of the \nLincoln Land Trust, Judy is a staunch defender of her town's remaining \nopen spaces and a passionate advocate on behalf of the Blackstone. She \nis active in a number of other local organizations, including the \nFriends of the Blackstone River, the Blackstone River Watershed \nCouncil, and the Lincoln Tree and Trail Commission. She has organized \nriver cleanups and educated her fellow residents about the impact that \nstormwater has on the Blackstone and its wildlife population.\n  For many years, a 60-ton excavator sat abandoned on a man-made island \nin the river a relic of an old gravel mining operation. It was an \neyesore and a potential environmental hazard. Two years ago, Judy \nHadley went to work: canvassing State and Federal authorities, trying \nto find the best solution for this problem. No agency seemed to have \nthe right equipment or the resources to handle such an unusual request, \nbut Judy persisted. If she could have dismantled it herself and taken \nit away piece by piece, I think she would have.\n  Fortunately, it did not come to that. Last year, the Rhode Island \nDepartment of Environmental Management removed more than 300 gallons of \ndiesel fuel and other fluids from the machinery. The excavator itself \nwas finally taken away this summer by the Army Corps via a temporary \nland bridge, as part of the wetland restoration project I mentioned \nearlier.\n  This was a great triumph, and Judy Hadley's dedication has been \ncheered by many local residents. Without her persistence, the excavator \nwould still be slowly degrading, leaving open the possibility that oil \nand fuel would seep out, fouling valuable marsh habitat downstream. \nWalkers and canoeists would still be shaking their heads at the sight \nof a rusting hulk across the river. But Judy refused to accept the \nexcavator as just another part of the landscape, insisting that it be \nremoved. In so doing, she has reminded us of the Blackstone River's \ngreat worth, as well as its vulnerability, and inspired us to be better \nstewards of a rediscovered resource.\n  I know my colleagues join me in saluting Judy Hadley on this \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11985-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DONALD P. OULTON\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I bring to your attention today \nthe exemplary work and most commendable service to one of our country's \noutstanding public servants. Mr. Donald P. Oulton, Chief of the \nInternational Law Branch, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, U.S. Air \nForce Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom Air Force Base, MA. Mr. Oulton \nretired on September 1, 2003, following an extraordinary career of more \nthan 30 years of service to the Nation.\n  Born in upstate New York at the beginning of the Great Depression, \nMr. Oulton was one of 10 children. Part of a close and loving family, \nat an early age he and his siblings became accomplished singers and \ndancers, helping support their large family performing ``minstrel \nshows'' through those challenging years. Mr. Oulton became a one-\nhandicap golfer in his teenage years while working as a caddy at a \nlocal country club. He had aspirations to become a professional golfer, \nbut his plans were cut short by the call to service in the Korean war.\n  An outstanding marksman, Mr. Oulton served as an intelligence and \nreconnaissance scout with the Seventh Infantry Division in the Chorwon \nValley. There, he spend much of his time in outposts far in front of \nthe main line of resistance, scouting out enemy positions and \ncoordinating artillery and mortar fire by American and United Nations \nforces. He performed these duties repeatedly under hostile fire and in \nextremely harsh and primitive conditions. Of his great physical courage \nand devotion to duty there can be no doubt.\n  After more than 9 months of combat at or in front of the main line of \nresistance, Mr. Oulton returned to the United States and was assigned \nto the United States National Honor Guard in Arlington, VA. Upon his \nhonorable discharge from the Army he relocated to the greater Boston \narea, married his lovely wife Carol, and started his devoted family of \nfour children David, Nancy, Sarah and Carol. After more than a decade, \nhe also began to pursue his boyhood dream of becoming an attorney. In \n1970, he achieved that goal, and after three years servicing as an \nAssistant District Attorney in Middlesex County, MA, he began his long \nassociation with the United States Air Force, and the Electronic \nSystems Center at Hanscom Air Force base.\n  Mr. Oulton's contributions have been monumental. He was on the ground \nfloor of many novel, complex issues arising from the passage of the \nArms Control Act of 1976. He quickly became, and remains, one of the \nDepartment of Defense's leading experts on the act, security \nassistance, and foreign military sales. His contributions over three \ndecades are too numerous to recount, but among the most significant \nhave been as the lead attorney for the sale of the Airborne Warning and \nControl System, AWACS, to a variety of U.S. allies, including the \nUnited Kingdom, France, Turkey, Australia, Japan, and most notably \nNATO. In the build up to, and in the wake of, Operation Desert Storm, \nMr. Oulton provided the expert legal advice that served as the \nfoundation for the early deployment of the Joint STARS aircraft before \nthe Air Force formally accepted it. His efforts have been instrumental \nin promoting the common defense and freedom throughout the world.\n  A well-recognized legal expert, Mr. Oulton was the 1980 recipient of \nthe James O. Wrightson Award, as the outstanding Air Force civilian \nattorney. In 1983, he was selected as the outstanding senior civilian \nin the electronic systems division of Air Force Systems Command, and \npresented the Harold M. Wright award. He is widely published and cited \nin the field of security assistance and foreign military sales, has \nbeen an adjunct faculty member at Western New England College, and has \nbeen a guest lecturer on International Law at Harvard University.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me and Mr. Oulton's many friends and \nfamily in saluting his many distinguished years of selfless service to \nthe United States of America. I know our Nation, his wife Carol, and \nhis family are extremely proud of his accomplishments. It is fitting \nthat the Senate honors this true patriot today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11985-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11985-S11986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n LIEUTENANT GENERAL EMIL R. ``BUCK'' BEDARD, UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to LTG \nEmil R. ``Buck'' Bedard, who will retire Monday and return to private \nlife after more than 36 years of selfless service to our Nation as a \nUnited States Marine. I have had the pleasure to work with Lieutenant \nGeneral Bedard on matters of importance to the U.S. Marine Corps and to \nour Nation's defense. His experience and expertise will be missed by \nmany of us in the Senate, as will his integrity, keen insight, and good \njudgment.\n  Buck Bedard was born in Argyle, MN, where he graduated from Argyle \nhigh school. He then slipped away from Minnesota's grasp and attended \nthe University of North Dakota. Following his graduation, he was \ncommissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps in December 1967. \nGeneral Bedard also holds a master of science degree, and his formal \nmilitary education includes the U.S. Army Advanced Infantry Course, the \nArmed Forces Staff College, and the Army War College.\n  While he was a lieutenant, Buck Bedard served as a rifle platoon \ncommander and company executive officer with 2d Battalion, 27th \nMarines, and 3d Battalion, 3d Marines, in the Republic of Vietnam. \nSubsequently, he was ordered to Quantico, VA, where he served as a \nstaff officer and then as the commander with Schools Demonstrations \nTroops.\n  Then-Captain Bedard was assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence School \nas an instructor, and he later served as a company commander in the 3d \nMarine Division in Okinawa, Japan. Following that tour of duty, Captain \nBedard became the Marine officer instructor at the Naval Reserve \nOfficer Training Unit at Vanderbilt University and was\n\n[[Page S11986]]\n\na Platoon and Company Commander at the Marine Corps Officer Candidate \nSchool in Quantico, VA. Following his promotion to major, he served as \nthe Logistics Officer, 7th Marines, and then as the executive officer, \n3d Battalion, 7th Marines.\n  Then-Lieutenant Colonel Bedard served as the assistant operations \nofficer, 1st Marine Amphibious Force, G-3, Pacific Plans Officer, and \nfinally as the G-5. Assigned to NATO and stationed in Holland, LTC \nBedard served in the Central Region Operations Division in charge of \nreinforcement operations of Allied Forces to Central Europe.\n  Then-Colonel Bedard was reassigned to Twenty-Nine Palms, California, \nwhere he directed the Combined Arms Exercise Program at the Marine \nCorps Air Ground Combat Center. He became the Assistant G-3 for \nOperations for the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade and the 1st Marine \nExpeditionary Force during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. \nFrom May 1991, through June 1993, Colonel Bedard commanded the 7th \nMarine Regiment, which deployed to Somalia in December, 1992. In July, \n1993, he was assigned as the Assistant Division Commander for the 1st \nMarine Division, Camp Pendleton, California, and in October 1993, he \nwas reassigned as J-3 Operations Officer, Joint Task Force, Somalia.\n  In June, 1994, Colonel Bedard was advanced to Brigadier General and \nwas assigned as the President, Marine Corps University and Commanding \nGeneral Marine Corps Schools, Marine Corps Combat Development Command, \nQuantico, Virginia. His next assignment in June, 1995, was as the \nDeputy Commander, Marine Forces Pacific, Camp H.M. Smith, Hawaii. \nGeneral Bedard assumed command of 2d Marine Division in July 1997, and \nwas promoted to Major General on September 1, 1997. He assumed command \nof 2d Marine Expeditionary Force in July 1999. On June 29, 2000, \nGeneral Bedard relinquished command of Second Marine Expeditionary \nForce and was advanced to his current rank. Lieutenant General Bedard \nhas been the Deputy Commandant of Plans, Policies and Operations at \nHeadquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, since July 2000, where he has \nskillfully guided Marine Corps operations following September 11th, \n2001, and during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.\n  Throughout his career as a U.S. Marine, Lieutenant General Bedard has \ndemonstrated his outstanding character, discerning wisdom, and deep \nsense of duty to his Country, his Corps, his Marines, and their \nfamilies. On behalf of the U.S. Senate I thank Lieutenant General \nBedard for his exemplary career, his many accomplishments, and his \ndevoted service to our Nation. We also thank his wife, Linda, and their \nthree children for sharing him with his country. Congratulations, \nLieutenant General Bedard; your mission has been very well \naccomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11986-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11986-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/25/senate-section/article/S11986-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3087.

A bill to address regulation of secondary mortgage market \nenterprises, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Federal Housing \nEnterprise Oversight Modernization Act of 2003, legislation to \nestablish a new, world-class regulator for our housing Government \nSponsored Enterprises (GSEs)--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--as an agency \nwithin the Department of Treasury.\n  There is no doubt that housing finance is essential to our economy \nand has been one of our Nation's few economic bright spots in recent \nyears. Given its critical role, and the size and complex financial \nstructures of the GSE's, which account for billions of mortgage-finance \ndollars, we need a credible, world-class regulator that can provide \neffective oversight.\n  Regrettably, the current system of GSE supervision fails to meet that \nstandard.\n  This legislation has four primary objectives: establishing a new, \nindependent regulator that is credible and capable; ensuring safe and \nsound capital; promoting market discipline and transparency through \nenhanced disclosures; and providing an incremental approach to \nultimately consolidating supervision of the Federal Home Loan Banks \nunder the regulatory framework contained in this legislation.\n  The proposal also recognizes the importance of the GSEs' underlying \nhousing mission and leaves responsibility for establishing the GSEs \nannual housing goals and overseeing their compliance with fair housing \nlaws with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\n  The legislation would create a new agency, the Office of Federal \nHousing Enterprise Supervision (OFHES), as a bureau within the \nDepartment of the Treasury, with a structure similar to that of the \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Office of \nThrift Supervision (OTS).\n  The agency would have general regulatory, supervisory and enforcement \nauthority with respect to the enterprises, be independent of Treasury \nwith regard to its comments and congressional testimony, and have a \ndirector, appointed for a five-year term, who would be given a seat on \nthe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). To \nensure that the enterprises' activities remain consistent with the \nscope of their charter, the agency would be authorized to approve all \nnew enterprise programs, but in close consultation with HUD.\n  Additionally, the agency would be given broad new authority to hire \nexperienced personnel, a significant portion of whom will be designated \nspecifically to carry out examinations and supervisory activities, to \nmake certain that the agency can fulfill its safety and soundness \nresponsibilities.\n  Central to that oversight function is ensuring that the enterprises \nmaintain safe and sound capital through vigorous, continuous \nmonitoring. The legislation therefore requires the new agency to ensure \nthat the enterprises remain in continuous compliance with their \nstatutorily prescribed minimum capital holding requirements.\n  By ensuring that the GSEs maintain adequate capital, we will mitigate \nthe risks to the enterprises, and our financial markets, from \nunforeseen shocks that can, and do, occasionally occur in our financial \nmarkets. To accomplish this, the legislation takes a multi-pronged \napproach to the issue of risk-based capital.\n  First, the legislation requires the new agency to continually monitor \nthe risk-based capital held by the enterprises, but it also provides \nthe new agency's director with the flexibility to adjust the risk-based \ncapital level of the enterprises in order to ensure their safe and \nsound financial operation.\n  The legislation also authorizes the new agency to conduct a \ncomprehensive review of the enterprises' risk-based capital rule every \nfive years. Part of the review would include a report to Congress \nentailing what, if any, proposed changes the new agency believes are \nneeded to the risk-based capital rule to better align the capital held \nby the enterprises with risk, and reflect evolving best practices for \nrisk-based capital standards for large, complex financial institutions. \nHowever, on a continual basis the Director would have the authority to \nadjust elements to the enterprises' stress test other than those \nspecifically prescribed in the risk-based rule.\n  With regard to the GSE non-mortgage related investments, this \nlegislation affirms the notion that those investments should be of the \nhighest quality and within the scope of the enterprises' respective \ncharters. It does so by requiring the new agency to continuously \nmonitor the appropriateness of the investments in the liquid and non-\nliquid portfolios of the GSEs and by certifying that the liquidity \nmanagement practices of the enterprises coinform with recommendations \ncontained in the ``Sound Practices for Managing Liquidity in Banking \nOrganizations'' established by the Basel Committee.\n  The capital and liquidity management provisions of this legislation \nare balanced. They ensure that the enterprises maintain appropriate \nminimum capital and are adequately capitalized relative to their risks. \nThey also empower the new agency to take appropriate action if \nenterprises become undercapitalized, and promote sound liquidity \nmanagement practices. At the same time, the bill is not so overly \nprescriptive that it would undermine the\n\n[[Page S11991]]\n\nessential liquidity the enterprises' provide, which has enabled \nAmerica's housing markets to become the envy of the world.\n  The third element of this bill that should dramatically improve the \nGSE's regulatory framework promotes transparency through enhanced \ndisclosures requirements.\n  This legislation statutorily requires Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the \nFederal Home Loan Banks to disclose a variety of information that will \nprovide the public, investors, and Congress with a better understanding \nof the underlying financial health of our housing enterprises.\n  First, the legislation requires the GSEs to register their equities \nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and to comply with SEC \ndisclosure and reporting requirements contained under sections 12 \n(Registration Requirements for Securities), 14 (Proxy Voting \nInformation) and 16 (Insider Sales) of the 1934 Act.\n  These disclosures are consistent with the highest standards of \ncorporate governance and disclosure required of other public companies \nand in my mind there is no reason why the GSEs should not be required \nto do so as well.\n  Second, this legislation would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to \ndisclose information regarding their interest rate and credit risks. \nSpecifically, each enterprise would regularly report the impact on \ntheir mortgage portfolios of a 50 basis point change in interest rates \nand a 25 basis point change in the slope of the yield curve. They would \nalso be required to disclose, on a quarterly basis, the financial \nimpact on each enterprise of an immediate 5 percent decline in U.S. \nhome prices.\n  Additionally, the bill requires the GSEs to acquire credit ratings \nfrom an SEC-recognized credit rating agency to provide an assessment of \nthe risk to the government and independent financial health of each \nenterprise. This ``stand-along'' rating would be derived from the \nunderlying credit quality of each enterprise and assume no direct \nsupport from the Federal Government.\n  These disclosures will ensure that the standards of financial \ndisclosure of the GSEs are in line with the rest of corporate America, \nmaking the enterprises subject to public scrutiny and market \ndisciplinary forces.\n  Finally, the bill takes an incremental approach towards incorporating \noversight of the Federal Home Loan Banks into the new regulatory \nframework created under this bill.\n  The bill requires Treasury, in consultation with HUD, to issue a \nreport to Congress no later than six months after the date of the \nbill's enactment on the appropriate manner upon which to consolidate \nthe responsibilities of the Federal Housing Finance Board, and \noversight of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), into the regulatory \nframework contained under this bill.\n  And as I mentioned earlier, the FHLBs would be required to \nimmediately comply with financial disclosure and reporting requirements \nunder the 1934 act in a manner similar to those required of Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac under this bill.\n  Lastly, the legislation would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury \nto designate an individual to serve as one of the five Federal Housing \nFinance Board members. This authority, transferred from HUD, would \nimmediately involve Treasury in the regulatory rubric of the FHFB and \nease the transition of the consolidation of the FHFBs regulatory \nresponsibilities into this new agency.\n  In conclusion, the reforms contained in this proposal are very \nimportant. They would establish a new regulatory framework that \npromotes sound and safe financial operations at the GSEs. They would \npromote stability in our capital markets by providing investors with \nbetter information about the financial health of the enterprises. They \nwould affirm the GSEs' critical role in our nation's housing market. \nAnd they would protect investors and taxpayers, while preserving the \nopportunity of millions of families to pursue the American dream of \nhomeownership.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this, important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1656\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make residents of Puerto Rico eligible for the \nearned income tax credit, the refundable portion of the child tax \ncredit, and supplemental security income benefits; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has been a \nterritory of the United States since 1898. Since 1917, people born in \nPuerto Rico have been citizens of the United States under Federal laws \napplicable in the territory.\n  One of the interesting, and most misunderstood, aspects of Puerto \nRico's unique relationship with the United States, is that the U.S. \ncitizens who reside there are not required to file tax returns and pay \nincome tax on the money they earn on the island. That might lead one to \nconclude that this is a huge benefit to the majority of people who live \non the island. The reality, however, is that well over half--and \nperhaps as much as three-quarters--of Puerto Rican families would \nlikely owe no U.S. income tax if they were taxed in the same manner as \nother citizens.\n  Why? Because Puerto Rico struggles with a high rate of poverty. \nFifty-eight percent of Puerto Rican children live below the national \npoverty level--which is an improvement from 67 percent in the early \n1990s. That means that today more than one-half of Puerto Rican \nchildren live in a family that earns less than $17,000 a year. In \ncontrast, the State with the highest child poverty rate, Mississippi, \nhas a child poverty rate of 27 percent.\n  For over 30 years, U.S. policy toward improving the economic \nsituation on the island has focused on corporate tax incentives. Today, \nI am introducing legislation that focuses on providing direct stimulus \nto the part of economy in Puerto Rico that has been neglected--Puerto \nRican families and children. Putting money into the hands of the people \nwho will spend it will provide the most direct stimulus for the economy \nof the island.\n  This bill puts Puerto Rican families on par with other families in \nAmerica by extending to them the benefits of our social safety net. \nSpecifically, the bill makes residents of Puerto Rico eligible for the \nearned income tax credit, the refundable per child tax credit, and the \nSupplemental Security Income program.\n  Although Puerto Rican families are not subject to the Federal income \ntax, they do pay Federal payroll taxes. Just like other working \nfamilies in America that work hard and play by the rules, low-income \nemployees in Puerto Rico deserve relief from those payroll taxes. The \nearned income tax credit and the refundable portion of the child tax \ncredit have long been recognized as an effective way to provide such \nrelief. The Puerto Rico Economic Stimulus Act says that families in \nPuerto Rico should also be able to claim these credits, in the same \nway, and subject to the\n\n[[Page S12000]]\n\nsame limitations, as families in Florida, Tennessee, Texas, or New \nYork.\n  Workers in Puerto Rico pay payroll taxes like all other Americans. \nWhile some may disagree with the notion of providing refundable credits \nto offset payroll taxes that is a different debate than whether low-\nincome families in Puerto Rico should be treated the same as low-income \nfamilies in the 50 States. This is a matter of equity, not tax policy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1658\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve water quality on abandoned and inactive \nmine land, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Good \nSamaritan Abandoned and Inactive Mine Reclamation Act of 2003.\n  I have been involved with efforts to clean up abandoned hardrock \nmines for a long time. In fact, I was an original cosponsor of a bill \nin the 106th Congress. The Western Governors Association regarded that \nthe bill as a first step in the right direction, and I am proud to \nbuild and improve upon that experience in crafting my own legislation.\n  Abandoned hardrock mines pose significant environmental and safety \nhazards to communities across the Western United States. In fact, the \nWestern Governor's Association concluded that there are at least \n400,000 such sites across the West, many of which cover our public \nlands.\n  The history of abandoned hardrock mines is linked to government \npolicies promoting the westward expansion of our Nation, and Federal \npolicies during times of war. Due to the historic nature of these \nsites, the party responsible for the environmental problem is not \nalways identifiable or not economically viable to be compelled to clean \nup the site.\n  Abandoned mine lands (AMLs) are areas adjacent to or affected by \nabandoned mines. They often contain unmined mineral deposits, mine \ndumps, and tailings that contaminate the surrounding watershed and \necosystem. Streams near AML sites--including many in Colorado--may \ncontain metals or be so acidic that fish and aquatic insects cannot \nlive in them. Water too polluted for fish and insects is also water too \npolluted for people. Further, abandoned mine sites pose very real \nsafety hazards for folks enjoying the West's wild lands.\n  Although abandoned hardrock mining in the West goes back a hundred \nyears, the Clean Water Act has only been in existence for thirty. The \nClean\n\n[[Page S12001]]\n\nWater Act was an important and historic piece of legislation that did a \nlot of good, but it failed to promote the reclamation of abandoned \nhardrock mine sites. In fact, if an environmental group or county or \ninterested party wanted to clean an abandoned mine site, they would \nincur liability under the Act.\n  The Western Governors Association has repeatedly called on Congress \nto amend the Clean Water Act's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination \nSystem permit program. The WGA stated that the NPDES program ``has \nbecome an overwhelming disincentive for any voluntary cleanup efforts \nof AMLs because of the liability that can be inherited for any \ndischarges from an abandoned mine site remaining after cleanup, even \nthough the volunteering remediating party had no previous \nresponsibility or liability for the site, and has reduced the water \nquality impacts from the site by completing a cleanup project.''\n  My bill recognizes that there are a lot of good, responsible folks \nacross our Western communities who recognize the environmental harm \nthat AMLs pose and finally gives them the tools to do something about \nit. My bill establishes a ``Good Samaritan'' permit program under the \nClean Water Act, administered by the EPA or a State-approved agency \nallowing an applicant to develop a strategy to remediate an affected \narea, and be granted a permit to do the work without penalizing them \nfor their good deed.\n  In order to be granted a Good Samaritan permit, my bill requires an \napplicant to meet comprehensive standards ensuring that they have the \nfinancial and technical resources to get the job done. An applicant \nmust establish remediation and monitoring schedules for the clean up \nproject and identify funding sources to carry out the plan.\n  My bill's goal is to promote the clean-up of abandoned hardrock \nmines. Therefore, it allows communities, interest stakeholder groups, \nand corporations, as coalitions or individually to be ``Good \nSamaritans.'' The transparent and publicly open permit application \nprocess helps to ensure that permit holders are acting in good faith \nand have the technical and financial wherewithal to get the job done.\n  Further, if a permit holder is found to have violated the terms of \nthe permit, he or she could lose their liability protection and subject \nto an enforcement action.\n  The West's States, communities, and interested parties have been \nprevented from cleaning up their own communities for far too long. My \nbill provides a transparent, flexible, and enforceable permit system \nthat removes the unintentional liability associated with abandoned \nhardrock mine cleanup.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on speedy passage of \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1660\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Good Samaritan Abandoned and \n     Inactive Mine Remediation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Federal Government has encouraged, through various \n     laws and policies, the development of gold, silver, and other \n     minerals, especially in the West;\n       (2) development of the resources referred to in paragraph \n     (1) has--\n       (A) helped create a strong economy; and\n       (B) provided strategic materials to achieve maximum \n     production of the metals that were essential to victory in \n     World War I and World War II;\n       (3) during World War I and World War II, the Federal \n     Government actively encouraged mining and milling operations, \n     including the design and placement of mine tailings and waste \n     rock piles, practices--\n       (A) that were not governed by any Federal or State \n     environmental laws during that period;\n       (B) the impact of which on the environment and public \n     health were unknown; and\n       (C) that since that period, have been--\n       (i) found to be harmful to the environment; and\n       (ii) made illegal;\n       (4) the result of the practices is a legacy of abandoned \n     and inactive mine sites, many of which are on Federal land, \n     that--\n       (A) have been unreclaimed or, based on existing \n     environmental standards, inadequately reclaimed; and\n       (B) continue to pose environmental and safety hazards;\n       (5) the cleanup of the abandoned and inactive mine sites is \n     hampered primarily by concerns about the potential liability \n     associated with the cleanup.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate the \n     cleanup of abandoned and inactive mine sites by limiting the \n     potential liability of persons cleaning up the sites.\n\n     SEC. 3. ABANDONED AND INACTIVE MINE REMEDIATION PERMITS.\n\n       Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1342) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(r) Abandoned and Inactive Mine Remediation Permits.--\n       ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       ``(A) Abandoned or inactive mine land.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The term `abandoned or inactive mine \n     land' means land--\n\n       ``(I) that was actively mined for noncoal resources;\n       ``(II) that is not--\n\n       ``(aa) being actively mined for noncoal resources;

No timber sale in Region 10 shall be advertised \n     if the indicated rate is deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar. Program accomplishments shall be based \n     on volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003, \n     the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale \n     quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management \n     Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar, all of the western redcedar timber from \n     those sales which is surplus to the needs of domestic \n     processors in Alaska, shall be made available to domestic \n     processors in the contiguous 48 United States at prevailing \n     domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003, \n     less than the annual average portion of the decadal allowable \n     sale quantity called for in the Tongass Land Management Plan \n     in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar, the volume of western redcedar timber \n     available to domestic processors at prevailing domestic \n     prices in the contiguous 48 United States shall be that \n     volume: (i) which is surplus to the needs of domestic \n     processors in Alaska, and (ii) is that percent of the surplus \n     western redcedar volume determined by calculating the ratio \n     of the total timber volume which has been sold on the Tongass \n     to the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale \n     quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management \n     Plan. The percentage shall be calculated by Region 10 on a \n     rolling basis as each sale is sold (for purposes of this \n     amendment, a ``rolling basis'' shall mean that the \n     determination of how much western redcedar is eligible for \n     sale to various markets shall be made at the time each sale \n     is awarded). Western redcedar shall be deemed ``surplus to \n     the needs of domestic processors in Alaska'' when the timber \n     sale holder has presented to the Forest Service documentation \n     of the inability to sell western redcedar logs from a given \n     sale to domestic Alaska processors at a price equal to or \n     greater than the log selling value stated in the contract. \n     All additional western redcedar volume not sold to Alaska or \n     contiguous 48 United States domestic processors may be \n     exported to foreign markets at the election of the timber \n     sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be sold at \n     prevailing export prices at the election of the timber sale \n     holder.\n       Sec. 319.

Any modifications to the \n     authorization shall be made within the terms and conditions \n     of the authorization and authorities of the impacted agency;\n       (2) the return of a commercial recreation service to the \n     Secretary for operation when such services have been provided \n     in the past by a private sector provider, except when--\n       (A) the private sector provider fails to bid on such \n     opportunities;\n       (B) the private sector provider terminates its relationship \n     with the agency; or\n       (C) the agency revokes the permit for non-compliance with \n     the terms and conditions of the authorization.\n\n     In such cases, the agency may use the Recreation Fee \n     Demonstration Program to provide for\n\n[[Page S12019]]\n\n     operations until a subsequent operator can be found through \n     the offering of a new prospectus.\n       Sec. 320.

Nothing in this section exempts the Secretary from \n     any other requirement of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable \n     Resources Planning Act (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) or any other \n     law: Provided, That if the Secretary is not acting \n     expeditiously and in good faith, within the funding \n     available, to revise a plan for a unit of the National Forest \n     System, this section shall be void with respect to such plan \n     and a court of proper jurisdiction may order completion of \n     the plan on an accelerated basis.\n       Sec. 321. No funds provided in this Act may be expended to \n     conduct preleasing, leasing and related activities under \n     either the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or the \n     Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) \n     within the boundaries of a National Monument established \n     pursuant to the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) \n     as such boundary existed on January 20, 2001, except where \n     such activities are allowed under the Presidential \n     proclamation establishing such monument.\n       Sec. 322.

Video Voyeurism.......................................1801''.....\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing S. \n1301, the DeWine-Schumer-Leahy Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2003. \nThis bill targets the pernicious practice of invading a person's \nprivacy through the surreptitious use of hidden surveillance equipment. \nSpecifically, the bill makes it a crime to capture an improper, naked \nor near-naked image of a person without his or her consent, and in such \na way as to violate his or her privacy. Any person found guilty of \nvideo voyeurism as outlined in the bill may be fined or imprisoned for \nup to one year, or both.\n  In recent years, the explosion of micro-camera technology has fed the \ngrowing phenomenon of video voyeurism. Hidden cameras have been \ndiscovered in bedrooms, bathrooms, public showers, changing rooms, \nlocker rooms, and tanning salons, all aimed at filming unsuspecting \nvictims in various states of undress. Often, the invasion of privacy is \nexacerbated when captured images are posted on the Internet for all the \nworld to see.\n  I commend Senators DeWine and Schumer for bringing this invasive \npractice to the attention of the Judiciary Committee, and for crafting \na bill that addresses it in a thoughtful and measured manner. In \naddition, I thank them for addressing a concern I raised during the \nCommittee's consideration of the bill. As introduced, the bill did not \nexpressly prohibit ``cyber-peeping''--a particularly offensive form of \nvideo voyeurism involving the contemporaneous transmission of improper \nimages of a non-consenting person over the Internet through Web cameras \nand other means. As reported by the Judiciary Committee, the ``cyber-\npeeping'' loophole has been closed: The bill we pass today covers the \nsimultaneous Web casting of images or any other transmissions that may \nnot be recorded, so that defendants who use this means of violating \npeople's privacy cannot escape punishment.\n  The National Center for Victims of Crime has dubbed video voyeurism \n``the new frontier of stalking.'' The States are already responding to \nthis ``new frontier'' in many different ways. Some have passed video \nvoyeurism laws; others have addressed the conduct within the context of \ntheir laws against stalking. The Video Voyeurism Prevention Act brings \nthe Federal criminal laws to bear on those who commit this offense \nwithin the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United \nStates. It should be enacted without delay.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask unanimous consent that the committee substitute \namendment be agreed to, the bill as amended be read the third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 234 submitted earlier \ntoday by Senators Stabenow and Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 234) honoring the Detroit Shock on \n     winning the Women's National Basketball Association \n     Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I offer a resolution congratulating the \nDetroit Shock for winning the Women's National Basketball Association \nChampionship.\n  In a remarkable display of talent, hard work and tenacity, the Shock \ncaptured the championship in the very next year after placing last in \ntheir league. Over the last 100 years, not a single other team in any \nmajor sport has been able to accomplish this feat.\n  Last Tuesday, in front of a WNBA record crowd of 22,000 people at the \nPalace in Auburn Hills, the Detroit Shock defeated the two-time \ndefending champion Los Angeles Sparks to win Detroit's first WNBA \ntitle. Ruth Riley, the game's Most Valuable Player, led the Shock by \nplaying the best game of her career. She scored 27 points and guarded \nanother all-star center. This season's Rookie of the Year, Cheryl Ford, \nalso played a great game. Ms. Ford is the only WNBA rookie ever to \naverage more than 10 points and 10 rebounds a game.\n  Bill Laimbeer, in his first season as a coach, led the Shock during \nthis remarkable season. Mr. Laimbeer has also brought two back-to-back \nchampionship titles to Detroit with the NBA's Detroit Pistons. Soon, \nthe address of the Palace at Auburn Hills will be renamed ``Three \nChampionship Drive'' to honor these accomplishments.\n  I would like to congratulate all of the players, coaches and support \nstaff that have made this championship possible. This was truly a great \nvictory for fans in Detroit and across the state of Michigan. And next \nyear, we are hoping for a repeat.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to congratulate the \nDetroit Shock on their victory of the Women's National Basketball \nAssociation, WNBA, Championship. Last week, the Detroit Shock defeated \nthe two-time defending WNBA champion Los Angeles Sparks, 83-78. The \nDetroit Shock victory is the first professional basketball championship \nfor the city of Detroit since the Detroit Pistons won back-to-back \nchampionships in 1988 and 1989.\n  The Detroit Shock's exceptional season broke several WNBA records. I \nam proud to say that the Shock is the first team in American \nprofessional sports since 1890 to go from the worst in their league to \nthe best the following year. The Detroit Shock finished the year with \nthe best record in the league at 25-9. Also, Game 3 of the finals was \nthe highest scoring WNBA finals game in the history of the league, as \nwell as the highest attended game in the league's 7-year history. The \nPalace of Auburn Hills hosted the sellout crowd of 22,076 fans.\n  In the final game of the best of three series, Ruth Riley, the 6-foot \n5-inch center for the Shock, dominated the court. She scored a career-\nhigh 27 points and was named the final's Most Valuable Player. Deanna \nNolan from Flint, MI scored 17 points, including a three-point shot \nwith less than a minute left, giving the Shock a 75-73 lead. Swin Cash, \nthe Shock's starting forward, added 13 points, 12 rebounds, and nine \nassists. The league's rebounds leader and Rookie of the Year, Cheryl \nFord, contributed 10 points and 12 rebounds for the Shock. The WNBA \nChampions were led by their head coach, Bill Laimbeer, himself an \ninstrumental player in the Detroit Pistons' Championship. The finishing \ntouch was added to the season when Coach Laimbeer was named the Coach \nof the Year.\n  Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick declared September 18, 2003 as Detroit \nShock Day and the Palace of Auburn Hills has officially changed its \naddress to Three Championship Drive. I am pleased to join Senator \nStabenow and my colleagues in the Senate in offering my heartiest \ncongratulations to the Detroit Shock as the players, coaches, staff, \nand fans celebrate their first Women's National Basketball Association \nChampionship. I look forward to another successful season next year. \nAnd, we in Detroit hope that the Shock's worst-to-first season will \nserve as an inspiration to the Detroit Tigers next year.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the resolution \nbe printed in the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
