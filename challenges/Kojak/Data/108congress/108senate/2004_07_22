Mr. President, Americans are united today in concern for \nthe safety and well-being of our men\n\n[[Page S8578]]\n\nand women in uniform--especially those who are serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, risking their lives to advance human freedom.\n  This morning, I would like to speak about the extraordinary service \nof a group of soldiers from two earlier wars.\n  We know these men today as ``the code talkers.''\n  They were Native American soldiers who used the languages of their \ntribes to send strategic military communications during World Wars I \nand II. Their impenetrable codes saved the lives of countless American \ntroops in Europe and throughout the Pacific.\n  The Navajo code talkers are the best-known of these men. Three years \nago, they were honored, rightly, with congressional medals.\n  But the Navajo were not the only code talkers. Soldiers from at least \n15 other Indian Nations--including the Cherokee, Choctaw, Comanche, \nPawnee, Seminole, Osage, Kiowa, Hopi and other nations--also served as \ncode talkers. And 11 code talkers came from the Lakota, Dakota, and \nNakota nations, known to many as the Great Sioux Nation.\n  Of those 11, nine--John Bear King of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe; \nSimon Broken Leg and Iver Crow Eagle, Sr., of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe; \nEddie Eagle Boy and Phillip LaBlanc, of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe; \nBap-TEEST Pumpkinseed of the Oglala Sioux Tribe; Edmund St. John of the \nCrow Creek Sioux Tribe; and Walter C. John of the Santee Sioux Tribe of \nNebraska--have all passed on.\n  Charlie Whitepipe is one of the two surviving Lakota code talkers.\n  In 1941, he enlisted in the United States Army. He was already in \ntraining in California when Pearl Harbor was attacked. The following \nday, he shipped out to Hawaii.\n  From Hawaii, his unit was sent to the Pacific island nation of New \nGuinea.\n  It was in New Guinea that another soldier, from Sioux Falls, told his \ncommanding officer that Charlie Whitepipe would make a good forward \nobserver because--in his words--``the Sioux are stealthy, sneaky, \npeople.''\n  The characterization angered Whitepipe, but it apparently impressed \nhis commanding officer.\n  Charlie Whitepipe spent the next 2 years in New Guinea as a forward \nobserver and radio man, moving ahead of his unit and communicating in \nLakota with a ship-based partner to direct artillery fire at enemy \ntroops.\n  In 1944, he was shipped home, suffering from malaria and jungle rot, \nthe result of months spent in water-filled foxholes.\n  After an honorable discharge, he returned to Rosebud, married, and \nraised six children with his wife.\n  He spent 30 years working as a lineman with the rural electric \nassociation, helping to bring electricity to the Rosebud Reservation \nand other parts of rural South Dakota. In his son's words, ``He got up \nand went to work 6 days a week and on the 7th day, he got up and took \nhis family to church.''\n  Charlie Whitepipe turned 86 this month. He suffers today from a \nprofound hearing loss caused in part by artillery explosions.\n  His family remains the center of his life.\n  Clarence Wolf Guts is the other surviving Lakota code talker.\n  He enlisted in the Army 7 months after Pearl Harbor with his friend \nand cousin, Iver Crow Eagle, Sr.\n  During Ranger training in Alabama, an officer discovered that the \ncousins could both speak, read, and write Lakota. As Mr. Wolf Guts \nrecalls it, that officer ``thought he'd hit the jackpot.''\n  Clarence Wolf Guts was assigned to travel with a general in the \nPacific, and Iver Crow Eagle was assigned as a radio operator for a \ncolonel.\n  For the next 3 years, the cousins jumped from one Pacific island to \nthe next, pushing the Japanese back.\n  They also helped develop a phonetic alphabet based on Lakota that was \nlater used to develop a Lakota code.\n  One day, as bullets and shrapnel exploded around him, Clarence Wolf \nGuts whispered a prayer in Lakota:\n\n       Bring me home, God, and I will praise your name always.\n\n  His prayer was answered.\n  Clarence Wolf Guts returned safely to Pine Ridge in 1946, married \nand--like Charlie Whitepipe--raised six children.\n  Today, at 80, he marches with veterans groups whenever he can.\n  The Yankton Sioux were among the first Native American soldiers to \nuse a native language to confound enemy troops, in World War I. Through \ntwo world wars, no native language or code based on an indigenous \nAmerican language was ever broken.\n  What makes the code talkers story even more extraordinary to some is \nthe fact that these men chose to fight for the United States at all.\n  As young boys, Charlie Whitepipe and Clarence Wolf Guts spoke only \nLakota. Like most of the code talkers, however, they were forced to \nattend schools in which they were forbidden to speak their native \nlanguage.\n  Students who broke the English-only rules were punished harshly; many \nwere beaten, some even to death.\n  It was part of a sad, brutal chapter in our Nation's history in which \nthe United States Government and other institutions tried to strip \nIndian children of their tribal identities.\n  Despite that history, despite the failure of the United States \nGovernment to honor its treaty obligations and other commitments to \ntribes, Native Americans have long had a higher rate of military \nservice than any other group in America.\n  Another young Lakota soldier, Sheldon Hawk Eagle, was laid to rest in \nthe National Cemetery in the Black Hills just before Thanksgiving last \nyear. Like so many Lakota people before him, he died serving this \nNation.\n  This past Fourth of July, I was honored to march with other veterans \nat a powwow at the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. \nAmong the veterans who marched with us that day were two members of the \ntribe who were home on leave from Iraq.\n  That evening, at our State's annual Fourth of July fireworks \ncelebration at Mount Rushmore, South Dakotans paid special tribute to \nthe Lakota code talkers.\n  There have been other tributes as well. But there is at least one \nmore honor the Lakota code talkers are due.\n  I strongly believe that Congress should pass the Code Talkers \nRecognition Act this year to award our Nation's highest honor, the \nCongressional Medal, to the Lakota code talkers and all Native American \ncode talkers who served in both world wars.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. Senator Inhofe introduced it, and I am \nproud to be a cosponsor, along with my fellow South Dakotan, Tim \nJohnson, and others. A similar bill passed the House in 2002 but was \nblocked in the Senate by members of the other party.\n  Historians can debate which code talkers communicated in actual codes \nand which communicated essential military information using only their \nnative languages. What is beyond debate, however, is the courage of \nveterans such as Charlie Whitepipe and Clarence Wolf Guts and the \nextraordinary value of their wartime service to our Nation. Let us work \ntogether to pass the Code Talkers Recognition Act this year before we \nlose any more of these heroes.\n  Let us also agree that we will honor the service of the code talkers \nby funding veterans health programs adequately, and ensuring that \nveterans in tribal communities have reasonable access to VA facilities. \nLet us also honor our Government's treaty obligations to fund Indian \nhealth care, so that tribal veterans and their families are not denied \nessential care.\n  Finally, we should honor the code talkers by working to preserve the \nrich, ancient languages they used to preserve our freedom.\n  Many of those languages are on the verge of extinction. Of the 300 \nindigenous languages once spoken in America, only 150 are still spoken \ntoday. Of those, only 20 are still spoken by several generations.\n  Experts warn that without immediate, dramatic action by Native \nAmericans, tribal governments and schools, and the Federal Government \nto encourage their preservation and perpetuation, Lakota and all of the \nnative languages of America will die by the year 2050.\n  Language is the most effective means we have to transmit our values, \nour beliefs, and our collective memories from one generation to the \nnext. For that reason, Native Americans and tribal communities \nparticularly benefit from preserving the languages of their ancestors.\n\n[[Page S8579]]\n\n  But they are not alone. Imagine how World War II might have turned \nout had we not had the code talkers.\n  In 1990, with Senator Inouye's leadership, Congress established the \nNative American Languages Act to ``preserve, protect and promote the \nrights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice and develop \nNative American languages.''\n  Last year, Senator Inouye introduced amendments to that law to \nsupport the creation within tribal communities of immersion schools and \nlanguage survival ``nests,'' to teach these languages to the next \ngeneration.\n  Let's pass those amendments this year. There is no time to waste.\n  Let's also work together to adequately fund Indian schools and to \ninclude in all Federal education policies the flexibility tribal \neducators need to include native languages, history and culture in \ntheir curriculums.\n  Indian parents, and tribal leaders and educators, in South Dakota \ncare deeply about this. And President Bush specifically called for such \nflexibility in the Executive order on Indian education he signed less \nthan three months ago.\n  Soldiers go to war to give their children the chance to live better \nlives. What better way can we honor the code talkers than to support \nschools in which their descendants can learn the native languages that \nhelped to save our Nation?\n  The result of such efforts will be a healthier, happier Indian \npopulation. And who knows what we will all learn in the process?\n  Mr. President, these remarks have been translated into Lakota by \nElizabeth Little Elk, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Lakota translation of my words be printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Honoring Native American Heroes, Preserving Native American Languages\n\n       Tunkasila Mila Hanska Oyate ki lel un gluwitapi.

Mr. President, the report from the National Commission on \nTerrorist Attacks upon the United States will be coming out today. \nThere has been some dribbling out of information about what that report \nmight contain, but we are not going to know\n\n[[Page S8580]]\n\nfor sure the full content of that report until we get a briefing. I am \nexcited that a good portion of the report is going to be released to \nthe public. I am always of the belief that we need to have an open \ndialog about issues and where there are shortcomings so that we can \ncome up with the answers and solutions that will serve us best.\n  I do not think any one group of people or even one individual has all \nthe answers. So I think the more dialog we can get as a result of this \nreport, the better. But I do think it serves us well to think about \nwhere we are today, and how it is we got to where we are.\n  The President came into office about 3\\1/2\\ years ago. He was elected \nin 2000. He had not even been in office a full year when all of a \nsudden we had 9/11. What has emerged is that we have a serious problem \nwith terrorism.\n  Historically, if we look back through the 1990s, we see that there \nwas an emerging problem, which many of us did not recognize as serious \nas it turned out to be, and most of us did not realize that a series of \nevents would eventually culminate into 9/11 and eventually a finishing \noff of the war with Iraq. There was a pattern, in looking back.\n  By the way, it is always easy to look back and say we should have \ndone this and we should have done that, but it is much more difficult \nto be prospective and say this is the information that is before us and \nthis is what is going to happen in the future.\n  What was happening in the 1990s was a persistent pattern of boldness \nin the size and the number of terrorist attacks that were occurring \nthroughout the world. They started with car bombs, and we still have \ncar bombs today. Then they added attacks on embassies. We had an attack \non the Khobar Towers. We had an attack on the USS Cole. We had planes \nbombed by terrorists. We had a partially successful attack from \nterrorists in New York, and then all of a sudden it built up to the \nultimate, which was the 9/11 attack in this country which brought down \nthe Twin Towers in New York, and there was also an attack on the \nPentagon, which is the first time this country had been attacked on its \nown soil since Pearl Harbor.\n  This was very much an awakening for the Congress, as well as the \nAmerican people. This President should be commended for rising to the \nchallenges of 9/11, and I think we have the right President in office \nat the right time. He sent a strong message to the world that was \nimportant to send, and that message was that we are not going to \ntolerate terrorism, and if there are any other countries that are going \nto support terrorist attacks, either directly or indirectly, they are \ngoing to be considered part of the problem as we resolve these issues \nrelated to terrorism.\n  As a result, he had to take some very strong stances. We had to take \nsome very strong positions.\n  Eventually, what evolved is that Afghanistan was the center. The \nPresident dealt first with Afghanistan. Afghanistan was pretty much the \ncenter of a lot of the terrorist activities. The Government had been \ntaken over by the terrorists. Afghanistan as a country was being used \nas a training ground for terrorists who were exporting terrorism \nthroughout the world.\n  Today, Afghanistan is now a democracy, moving toward more freedom for \nits people, and getting terrorism under control. It has some challenges \nwith economic growth, but I think President Karzai has done a \ntremendous job. This all happened because of strong action by this \nPresident in moving forward.\n  We saw that many of these terrorist groups, al-Qaida, for example, \nhad their origins in Saudi Arabia. We saw many terrorist groups that \nwere raising money through Saudi Arabia. Today, Saudi Arabia has \nrecognized the problem and taken some very strong actions. They are \nworking with the United States to control terrorism within their own \ncountry.\n  We have Libya and Muammar Qadhafi, who was exporting terrorism and \nactually attempting to develop a nuclear weapons program in his own \ncountry. Now he has backed off and said, look, we want to work with the \nUnited States. He has come out and publicly opposed terrorism. He has \ngiven up his nuclear program. The nuclear inspectors can now go into \nhis country and look for nuclear materials.\n  We have made remarkable progress in Afghanistan. I know we have \nremarkable progress in Saudi Arabia. We have made remarkable progress \nin Libya. Even in North Korea we seem to sense more willingness on \ntheir part at least to sit down with the United States and negotiate \nwith the United States on how it is we can move toward a more peaceful \nenvironment.\n  Finally, that brings us to Iraq. I think that is another remarkable \nachievement for this administration. Even though there are some \ndifferences of opinion about how this should have been handled, the \nfact is a large majority of the Senate, working with the President and \nworking with the United Nations, realized terrorism was a problem and \nIraq was a part of this problem.\n  The President decided to invade Iraq and Saddam Hussein. It was a \ngood decision. I need to remind Members this war started actually \nbefore then. It started under his father, the first President George \nBush. The first President George Bush had to deal with an invasion by \nSaddam Hussein into the country of Kuwait. He soundly defeated Saddam \nHussein. Saddam Hussein agreed to sign a treaty and in that treaty he \nagreed to allow inspectors into his country. He agreed to many \nprovisions that were being stipulated by the United Nations. He agreed \nto certain no-fly zones.\n  We attempted to enforce those no-fly zones as he was constantly \nshooting at our planes. After the first conflict, Saddam Hussein \nignored what he had agreed to with the first President George Bush. \nThen we had the United Nations inspectors going in and looking for \nnuclear materials, weapons of mass destruction, and they were kicked \nout of that country.\n  The Congress and the United Nations all agreed this was an unstable \nsituation and something needed to be done with Saddam Hussein. So \nGeorge Bush, who is now our President, made the right decision in \nsaying we need to go into Iraq and we need to deal with this unstable \nsituation because it is a persistent threat to world peace. If we do \nnot deal with the problem now, it is only going to get worse with time. \nI have to say this President has done a great job. He has the support \nof the American people.\n\n  Now this national commission on terrorist attacks upon the United \nStates is going to reveal some shortcomings and we are going to need to \naddress those. Our Nation has a leader who has made it clear that \nwinning the war on terror is the defining moment for the civilized \nworld.\n  Since September 11, 2001, President Bush has taken some bold steps to \nensure the safety and security of the United States, specifically \nagainst terrorist organizations and the nation states that support \nthem. Specifically, since President Bush has taken office, the United \nStates, under his leadership, has overthrown two terrorist regimes, \nrescued two nations and liberated over 50 million people, captured or \nkilled close to two-thirds of known senior al-Qaida operatives, \ncaptured or killed 45 of the 55 most wanted in Iraq, including Iraq's \ndeposed dictator, Saddam Hussein, who is now sitting in jail, hunted \ndown thousands of terrorist and regime remnants in Iraq, disrupted \nterrorist cells on most continents and likely prevented a number of \nplanned attacks. This is an astounding record of accomplishment for our \ncommander in chief and his national security staff.\n  We also have to recognize the phenomenal job of our men and women in \nour military services. They have been phenomenal and I do not think we \ncan repeat that enough. We are very fortunate to have their dedication \nand commitment, not only of the men and women who are serving in these \nservices, but their families and their communities back home who \nsupport them.\n  The United States went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq risking \nsignificant loss of life and treasure to protect our way of life. Our \ngoals are clear and twofold: Destroy the nexus of terrorism and weapons \nof mass murder that personify the two ousted regimes and create in \ntheir stead stable democratic states able to participate in the modern \nworld community.\n  We succeeded in our first goal, having killed or captured \nperpetrators and supporters of the enemy terrorists. The courageous \npeople of Afghanistan and Iraq are making remarkable progress toward \nadoption of constitutional reforms to secure momentum toward\n\n[[Page S8581]]\n\nlasting democratic independence. Nevertheless, we still have work to \ndo.\n  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report on Iraq's weapons \nof mass destruction clearly identified what we have all known for some \ntime, our intelligence has not performed in as desirable a way as we \nwould like and in some cases has raised some issues about some of the \ndecisions we had to make in this Congress.\n  As a former member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I say to my \ncolleagues that few employees in the Federal Government are as \ndedicated as those who work for our intelligence agencies. They are \nhard-working individuals who believe their work is critical to our \nNation's national security, and they provide us good information. As \npolicymakers, we also have to recognize the information they give us is \nnot always absolute. A lot of time it is a little bit of information \nhere, a little bit of information there, and we have to put it together \nand say this is a likely event that is going to happen or this is \nlikely what is happening. It is not absolute in many regards, and we \nhave to treat it that way.\n  I think that is the way the President treated it, and I think that is \nthe way the Congress has looked at much of the information that we \nreceived right after 9/11 and how terrorism is affecting us. That is \nwhy it was so frustrating to learn our intelligence agencies did not \nconnect many of the dots in regard to September 11 and again failed to \nprovide reliable information on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \nprograms.\n  We clearly have a considerable amount of work to do. As the Senate \nIntelligence Committee recommended, we need to improve the process by \nwhich analysts, collectors, and managers fuse intelligence and produce \njudgments for policymakers, but that is not new. We have been facing \nthis problem for some time. I am glad we are taking it more seriously. \nWe need to greatly enhance almost every aspect of the intelligence \ncommunity's human intelligence efforts. We need to address the tendency \nto build upon the judgments of previous assessments without including \nthe uncertainties in those assessments.\n\n  I will note the Senate Intelligence Committee's report did conclude \nthat the intelligence community's judgments regarding Saddam Hussein's \ngovernment's link to terrorist organizations were reasonable. Equally \nimportant was the Senate Intelligence Committee's conclusion that the \nexaggeration of the intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \ncapabilities was not the result of political pressure.\n  As we prepare for the 9/11 Commission's report, I think it is \nappropriate that we thank the people who served on the Commission for \ntheir service to this country. Their service will go a long way to \nhelping our Nation prevent future attacks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to make remarks today on two \nimportant subjects with which we are currently dealing in the Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8581-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8581-S8582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, ``Did the Bush administration \nmanipulate intelligence about Saddam Hussein's weapons program to \njustify an invasion of Iraq?'' This is the central question posed by \ndiscredited Ambassador Joe Wilson in his July 6, 2003, op-ed published \nby the New York Times.\n  Wilson alleged the answer to the question was ``yes'', and a \npolitical firestorm ensued. Indeed, the year-long furor over the \ninfamous 16 words stemmed from Mr. Wilson's disproved claims.\n  Many of the President's fiercest critics have since argued the Bush \nadministration misled the country into war, a truly incendiary charge.\n  Lord Butler's comprehensive report includes the real 16-word \nstatement we should focus on. Here is what he had to say:\n\n       We conclude that the statement in President Bush's State of \n     the Union address . . . is well founded.\n\n  It is well founded. Yet the New York Times threw its hat into the \nring early and ran an editorial on July 12, 2003 amplifying Wilson's \nirresponsible claim and flaming the fires of this pseudo-scandal. This \nis what they had to say:\n\n       Now the American people need to know how the accusation got \n     into the speech in the first place, and whether it was put \n     there with an intent to deceive the nation. The White House \n     has a lot of explaining to do.\n\n  Will the New York Times, which printed 70 stories that repeated Joe \nWilson's claims, now retract this editorial? Will it acknowledge on the \neditorial page the truth about Joe Wilson?\n  Rather than displaying caution and restraint, too many American \npoliticians raced, like the New York Times, to echo this outrageous \nallegation.\n  Early into the fray was the senior Senator from North Carolina. On \nJuly 22, 2003, Fox News played a clip from one of Senator Edwards' \nrallies in which he repeats Wilson's attacks on the President's \nhonesty. Senator Edwards claims:\n\n       Nothing is more important than the credibility of the \n     president of the United States and the words that come out of \n     his mouth at the State of the Union are, in fact, the \n     responsibility of the president.\n\n  According to the correspondent at the rally:\n\n       Edwards blasted the president's 16-word State of the Union \n     sentence on British intelligence information that Iraq sought \n     nuclear weapons material from Africa.\n\n  Now a candidate for the Vice Presidency, Senator Edwards will have \nmany media opportunities to set the record straight about his view of \nthe President's State of the Union speech. In the name of fairness, I \nsure hope he will.\n  Not to be outdone, the Senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, delivered an attack on the Bush administration this January. \nSenator Kennedy repeated Wilson's distortions, and claimed:\n\n       The gross abuse of intelligence was on full display in the \n     president's State of the Union address last January, when he \n     spoke the now infamous 16 words. . . . And as we all know \n     now, that allegation was false. . . . President Bush and his \n     advisers should have presented their case honestly.\n\n  When will Senator Kennedy acknowledge that the President's claim was \n``well founded?'' The junior Senator from Massachusetts has also \naccused the President of misleading the country. An Associated Press \nreport from 2003 includes an exchange between Senator Kerry and a woman \non the campaign trail. Here is how it went.\n\n       When a woman asked whether U.S. intelligence on Iraq was \n     doctored, Kerry replies that Americans were ``clearly \n     misled'' on two specific pieces of intelligence. ``I will not \n     let him off the hook throughout this campaign with respect to \n     America's credibility . . .\n\n  That is the junior Senator from Massachusetts. Let me quote another \nAP report about Senator Kerry from last summer:\n\n       Kerry said Bush made his case for war based on U.S. \n     intelligence that now appear to be wrong--that Iraq sought \n     nuclear material from Africa.\n\n  Now that Joe Wilson's claims have been completely discredited, the \njunior Senator from Massachusetts has a chance to set the record \nstraight. But will he?\n  I mentioned yesterday the distinguished Minority Leader had repeated \nJoe Wilson's discredited claims on the Senate Floor. Just last month, \nSenator Daschle said:\n\n       Sunlight, it's been said, is the best disinfectant. But for \n     too long, the administration has been able to keep Congress \n     and the American people in the dark . . . serious matters, \n     such as the manipulation of intelligence about Iraq, have \n     received only fitful attention.\n\n  The bipartisan Senate Intelligence Report reached the following \nconclusions that directly refute the serious charges made by the \nPresident's critics:\n\n       Conclusion 83. The Committee did not find any evidence that \n     Administration officials attempted to coerce, influence, or \n     pressure analysts to change their judgments related to Iraq's \n     weapons of mass destruction capabilities.\n       Conclusion 84. The Committee found no evidence that the \n     Vice President's visits to the CIA were attempts to pressure \n     analysts, were perceived as intended to pressure analysts by \n     those who participated in the briefings on Iraq's WMD \n     programs, or did pressure analysts to change their \n     assessments.\n\n  Let us not allow honesty to become a casualty of the campaign season.\n  My colleagues now have an opportunity--and I am sure they will take\n\n[[Page S8582]]\n\nit--to set the record straight about their support of Mr. Wilson's \noutrageous claims. In the name of fairness, will they?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8582-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8582-S8583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOMINATIONS TO THE SIXTH CIRCUIT COURT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, we will be voting \nlater this morning on the nominations of Henry Saad, David McKeague, \nand Richard Griffin to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  As this chart shows, the Sixth Circuit covers Michigan, Ohio, \nKentucky, and Tennessee.\n  For the last 2 years, the Sixth Circuit has been trying to function \nwith 25 percent of its seats empty. That vacancy rate is, as it has \nbeen, the highest vacancy rate in the Nation. Not surprisingly, the \nJudicial Conference has declared all four of these vacant seats to be \n``judicial emergencies.''\n  For the last 3 years, I have taken to the floor to decry the crushing \nburden under which the Sixth Circuit operates. The years change but one \nseemingly immutable fact remains: The Sixth Circuit remains the slowest \ncircuit in the Nation by far. According to the Administrative Office of \nthe Courts, last year the Sixth Circuit was a full 60-percent slower \nthan the national average. According to the AOC, the national average \nfor disposing of an appeal is 10\\1/2\\ months, but in the Sixth Circuit \nit takes almost 17 months to decide an appeal. That means in another \ncircuit, if you file your appeal at the beginning of the year, you get \nyour decision around Halloween. But in the Sixth Circuit, if you file \nyour appeal at the same time, you get your decision after the following \nMemorial Day, over a half a year later. If you can believe it, each \nyear the disparity between the Sixth Circuit and its sister circuits \ngets worse.\n  In 2001 and 2002, the Sixth Circuit was the slowest circuit in the \ncountry, just like last year. In those years, the average time for \ndecision was 15.3 and 16 months, respectively, but last year the delay \njumped up to almost 17 months. So clearly my constituents and the other \nresidents of the circuit are suffering more and more as the years go \nby.\n  What is the reason for this sorry state of affairs? An intra-\ndelegation dispute from years ago when nearly a quarter of the current \nSenate wasn't even here. Nor, I might add, was the current President \naround for that dispute either. He, too, has nothing to do with it.\n  This dispute drags on year after year. As I understand it, although \nonly two seats were involved in this dispute, six nominees, including \nfour circuit nominees, continue to be bottled up.\n  Frankly, I don't know whose fault it was it has been so long. But I \ndo know that neither the 4 million people in Kentucky, nor the 6 \nmillion people in Tennessee, nor the 11 million people in Ohio--nor \ntheir Senators--were any part of it.\n  They are all suffering for it, though, as are the 10 million people \nfrom Michigan.\n  The Michigan legislature has in fact passed a resolution calling on \nus, the U.S. Senate, to confirm these nominees. I ask consent that a \ncopy of this resolution from the Michigan State Senate be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 127\n\n       Whereas, The Senate of the United States is perpetuating a \n     grave injustice and endangering the well-being of countless \n     Americans, putting our system of justice in jeopardy in \n     Michigan and the states of the Sixth Circuit of the federal \n     court system; and\n       Whereas, The Senate of the United States is allowing the \n     continued, intentional obstruction of the judicial \n     nominations of four fine Michigan jurists: Judges Henry W. \n     Saad, Susan B. Neilson, David W. McKeague, and Richard A. \n     Griffin, all nominated by the President of the United States \n     to serve on the United States 6th Circuit Court of Appeals; \n     and\n       Whereas, This obstruction is not only harming the lives and \n     careers of good, qualified judicial nominees, but it is also \n     prolonging a dire emergency in the administration of justice. \n     This emergency has brought home to numerous Americans the \n     truth of the phrase ``justice delayed is justice denied''; \n     and\n       Whereas, Both of Michigan's Senators continue to block the \n     Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate from holding \n     hearings regarding these nominees. This refusal to allow the \n     United States Senate to complete its constitutional duty of \n     advice and consent is denying the nominees the opportunity to \n     address any honest objections to their records or \n     qualifications. It is also denying other Senators the right \n     to air the relevant issues and vote according to their \n     consciences. This is taking place during an emergency in the \n     United States 6th Circuit Court of Appeals with the backlog \n     of cases; and\n       Whereas, We join with the members of Michigan's \n     congressional delegation who wrote Chairman Orrin Hatch on \n     February 26, 2003, to express their concern that ``if the \n     President's nominations are permitted to be held hostage, for \n     reasons not personal to any nominee, then these judicial \n     seats traditionally held by judges representing the citizens \n     of Michigan may be filled with nominees from other states \n     within the Sixth Circuit. This would be an injustice to the \n     many citizens who support these judges and who have given \n     much to their professions and government in Michigan''; and\n       Whereas, We are concerned about the Sixth Circuit as a \n     whole, a circuit court understaffed, with 4 of its 16 seats \n     vacant, knowing that the Sixth Circuit ranks next to last out \n     of the 12 circuit courts in the time it takes to complete its \n     cases. Since 1996, each active judge has had to increase his \n     or her number of decisions by 46%--more than three times the \n     national average. In the recent past, the Sixth Circuit has \n     taken as long as, 15.3 months to reach a final disposition of \n     an appeal. With the national average at only 10.9 months, \n     this means the Sixth Circuit takes over 40% longer than the \n     national average to process a case; and\n       Whereas, The last time the Sixth Circuit was this \n     understaffed, former Chief Judge Gilbert S. Merritt said that \n     it was handling ``a caseload that is excessive by any \n     standard.'' Judge Merritt also wrote that the court was \n     ``rapidly deteriorating, understaffed and unable to properly \n     carry out their responsibilities''; and\n       Whereas, Decisions from the Sixth Circuit are slower in \n     coming, based on less careful deliberation, and, as a result, \n     are less likely to be just and predictable. The effects on \n     our people, our society, and our economy are far-reaching, \n     including transaction costs. Litigation increases as people \n     strive to continue doing business when the lines of swift \n     justice and clear precedent are being blurred; and\n       Whereas, President Bush has done his part to alleviate this \n     judicial crisis. Over the past two years, he has nominated \n     eight qualified people to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, \n     with three of them designated to address judicial \n     emergencies. Four of these nominees continue to languish \n     without hearings because of the obstruction of the two \n     Michigan Senators; Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Senate and Michigan's United States Senators to act to \n     continue the confirmation hearings and to have a vote by the \n     full Senate on the Michigan nominees to the United States 6th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     Michigan's United States Senators and to the President of the \n     United States Senate.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, that is 31 million people, who continue \nto suffer because our colleagues on the other side refuse to confirm \nany of these four Michigan nominees to the Sixth Circuit.\n  Indeed, two of the seats we are talking about were not even involved \nin this dispute. President Clinton never nominated anyone to the seat \nto which Henry Saad was nominated. That vacancy arose on January 1, \n2000.\n  And the seat to which David McKeague was nominated did not even \nbecome vacant until the current Bush administration on August 15, 2001.\n  So what the Senators from Michigan seek to do is hold up one-fourth \nof an entire circuit because of a past intra-delegation dispute about \ntwo of these six seats, the genesis of which occurred many years ago.\n  As to disputes on judicial nominees, the Senators from Michigan do \nnot have a monopoly on disappointment. There are several Republican \nnominees who were nominated by George H.W. Bush, who waited a year or \nmore for a hearing, and who never got one. I note Sixth Circuit nominee \nJohn Smietanka, D.C. Circuit nominee John Roberts and Fourth Circuit \nnominee Terry Boyle, just to name a few.\n  The remedy for disappointment is not to take out your frustration on \nthe populace of an entire circuit. Nor is it to demand that a President \ncede his constitutional power to another branch. It is to do what this \nPresident has done: re-nominate the person when your party is in the \nOval Office.\n  Let us be clear. We are not talking about any particular problems \nwith the nominees, including Judge Saad, who would be the first Arab-\nAmerican on any Federal circuit court and who has been endorsed by both \nthe Chamber of Commerce and the United Auto Workers. That is a pretty \ntall order.\n\n[[Page S8583]]\n\n  Quite frankly, it wouldn't matter who from Michigan the President put \nin the slot: if his name were Henry Ford rather than Henry Saad the \nresult would be the same--my colleagues from Michigan would filibuster \nthe nominee.\n  Why? Presumably because the Michigan Senators didn't get to pick \nJudge Saad or other Michigan nominees to the Sixth Circuit.\n  What we are talking about, then, is Senators wanting to adorn \nthemselves with the power of co-nomination.\n  Let us get back to first principles. Democrat Senators do not get to \npick circuit court judges in Republican administrations. In fact, \nRepublican Senators--myself included--do not get to pick circuit court \njudges in Republican administrations.\n  The Constitution gives the power to the President, and the President \nalone, to nominate. We all know as a matter of custom that Senators \nhave a good deal of influence over who gets to be a district judge but \nlittle or no influence over who gets to be a circuit judge. Presidents \nof both parties have been unwilling to delegate the picking of circuit \ncourt judges to Senators. It is a Presidential prerogative and we \nshouldn't rewrite the Constitution to allow Senators--especially those \nof the opposite party--to nominate judges.\n  By tradition, the President may consult with individual Senators. But \nthe tradition of ``consultation'' does not transform individual \nSenators into co-Presidents.\n  The President is not required to share his constitutional power with \nSenators, or with a ``non-partisan'' commission for that matter.\n  We have started a new precedent around here by filibustering judges; \nthis is something that I and the vast majority of the Republican caucus \nopposed during the Clinton administration and refused to engage in, \nalthough Republicans had profound differences with many Clinton \nnominees.\n  In fact, 95 percent of the current Senators who never voted for a \njudicial filibuster are Republicans.\n  Let me say that again.\n  Ninety-five percent of the current Senators who never voted for a \njudicial filibuster are Republicans.\n  Our Democrat friends have started this troubling precedent. They have \nfilibustered seven nominees and are now approaching double digits.\n  If my Democrat friends want to set another precedent, namely that \nSenators in opposite parties get to pick a President's circuit court \nnominees, I have news for you: this precedent may well be used when \nthere's a Democrat in the Oval Office whether that is next year or next \ndecade.\n  In closing, I don't get to pick Republican circuit nominees, and I \ndon't think Democrats should get to do so in a Republican \nadministration either. That is the President's job.\n  The Senate may establish a contrary precedent today. But if it does, \nI and other Republican Senators may invoke it the next time there is a \nDemocrat in the White House. So I urge my Democrat friends to be wary \nof the steps they are taking because they are leading us down a \ndangerous path from which there may be no return.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor an exemplary \nsoldier, a loyal American, a loving father, and a devoted husband. Our \nfriend and neighbor, Colonel Jon Jones passed away on June 6 after a \ncourageous battle with brain cancer that he waged on his own terms. \nUntil the week of his death, Jon lived life to the fullest and did not \nallow cancer to define him or to diminish his dream. Rather, he chose \nto be a husband, father and soldier until the end. His death has been a \nprofound loss to his colleagues in the Army, his neighbors, his \nfriends, and especially to his family. I say to his wife Cynthia, to \nhis two children Nick and Lena, who are here with us today, our Nation \nis grateful for your family's service and sacrifice.\n  Jon was born and raised in California. His mother was a teacher, and \nthe influence she had on him was apparent throughout his life. He \nattended high school outside of Sacremento, and graduated from Cal \nState at Sacramento. He went the extra mile to participate in the ROTC \nprogram at UC-Davis, because his own school had abolished ROTC during \nthe Vietnam war.\n  He graduated in 1980 as a distinguished military graduate and was \ncommissioned as a regular Army military intelligence officer. He met \nCynthia while he was in officers' basic course in Arizona, and they \nmarried in 1981. His career in the Army took Cynthia, Nick, and Lena to \nTurkey, Germany, and South Korea; and his last deployment was to Kuwait \nand to Iraq.\n  Jon died two weeks shy of serving 24 years in the U.S. Army and only \n12 days from his change of command. For almost 2 years he successfully \nled the Army's only deployable echelons-above-corps contingency force \nprotection military intelligence brigade. The men and women who served \nunder him, as well as his colleagues and senior officers, testified to \nhis leadership in a time of war. One soldier called it a privilege to \nbe under Colonel Jones' command, and described his strength and \nleadership as going well beyond what this soldier had seen in any other \nmilitary officer.\n  Throughout the war, in addition to his mission, Jon's focus was on \nthe health, welfare, and safety of every soldier and civilian who \nserved with him. When his brigade was deployed for 9 months to support \nOperation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, he succeeded in \nthat mission and brought every one of his soldiers home.\n  A month after bringing his brigade home, Jon was diagnosed with an \naggressive brain tumor. He was entitled to retirement, but he chose \ninstead to stay in the Army. As he told a colleague: ``Quitting was not \nan option.'' Another person might have headed for the shore and waited \nfor his time in comfortable surroundings, but this was not the path for \nJon Jones.\n  At the time of his diagnosis, he had a battalion preparing to \nredeploy to Iraq, and the thought of leaving them went against \neverything he stood for. In fact, in the months preceding his death, in \nbetween his own treatments and surgeries, Jon went to Kuwait and Iraq \nseveral times to support and bolster his troops.\n  Before he passed away, Jon was nominated for the Distinguished \nService Medal, for unparalleled dedication to duty. This citation \nstates that his accomplishments will have a lasting effect on national \nsecurity formulation at the highest levels. Later today, in a room near \nthis distinguished Chamber, Jon's widow Cynthia will accept this medal \non her husband's behalf.\n  Jon's commanding generals, some of whom are also with us today, \naccepted his decision to stay in the Army and continue in command \nthroughout his treatments. Perhaps they would have\n\n[[Page S8584]]\n\nencouraged a lesser officer to retire, but Jon was too valuable a \nsoldier to lose. Unfortunately, the Army, and especially the military \nintelligence community, realizes every day how valuable COL Jake Jones \nwas. Perhaps the words of one of his fellow officers said it best when \nhe stated:\n\n       Jake Jones did more than command a Brigade in war. He \n     commanded the respect and confidence of his peers, his \n     superiors, and his soldiers. He had a special aura about \n     him--a calming presence that bespoke competence and reason.\n\n  All of the virtues that made Jon a good soldier also made him a \ndevoted husband and father. In a career that takes you away from your \nfamily for extended periods of time, he made it home for his children's \nbirthdays and other special events. The only birthday of Nick's he ever \nmissed was last year when duty to country called him to stay in Iraq. \nHe made it home in time for Lena's birthday last year, and only God's \ncall home kept him from making that commitment this year.\n\n  He was driven to be a good example to his children and to make them \nproud. This drive contributed to his desire to continue in command even \nas he fought his own personal battle with a fierce enemy. Although his \ntime with Nick and Lena was inexplicably cut short, I know the love he \ngave them and the lessons he taught them will shore them up, inspire \nthem, and comfort them throughout their lifetime.\n  Mentor, hero, charismatic leader, humble individual, inspiring \ncommander, confident, patient, steadfast, stalwart, a rock--these are a \nfew of the descriptions used to communicate the man he was. Jon had the \ndetermination and perseverance to accomplish any task with which he was \npresented.\n  The role in life he cherished the most, after the role of father, was \nthat of a mentor, whether to his soldiers or to his children. He simply \nloved to teach. Having been raised by a mother who was a teacher, he \npaid her the greatest compliment a child can give a parent: He followed \nin her footsteps. He taught those of us who knew him how much fun it \nwas to live, and that quitting was not an option.\n  Jon Jones was a friend of our family, a neighbor, and an inspiration \nto all who knew him. His death is our Nation's loss. Rarely does a \nsoldier so capable and so completely committed step forward to answer \nthe call to service. And rarely has a family been so blessed to have \nsuch a father and husband.\n  May it be recorded this day that the people of the United States are \ngrateful to COL Jon Jones for his years of service in the U.S. Army. \nHis memory will live on in the hearts and minds of the many who knew \nhim, admired him, followed him, and loved him.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to speak on two issues: first, \nthe imminent release of the final report of the 9/11 Commission, and \nthen on the three judges we are voting on shortly.\n  First, on the imminent release of the report: First, I thank the \ncommissioners. They have done an incredible job. In this town, racked \nby partisanship, to come up with bipartisan recommendations is an \namazing accomplishment in itself. But when you look at what the \nrecommendations are and the thoroughness with which the Commission \ninvestigated the mistakes that were made in the past, the report \nassumes even greater magnitude.\n  We will have a real challenge in Washington, at each end of \nPennsylvania Avenue, to make sure these recommendations are \nimplemented.\n  The area I want to touch on right now is homeland security, but I do \nwant to say the reforms that were recommended, in terms of intelligence \ngathering, were right on the money. Many of us were puzzled after 9/11, \nlearning that the FBI knew this little piece of information and an \nagent in another part of the FBI knew another piece, and the CIA knew \nthis piece and that piece. The question was, why weren't these pieces \ntied together, which might have drawn the picture of what was going to \nhappen? And I underline the word ``might.'' Who knows if it would have? \nBut it certainly would have given us better odds.\n  The reason, as the Commission unveiled, is very simple: These \nintelligence agencies do not talk to one another. They regard the \nintelligence they have gathered, their work product, as so valued that \nthey do not want to give it up to another agency. The recommendations \nof the Commis-\nsion are outstanding--outstanding--in terms of requiring the \nintelligence agencies to talk to one another.\n  I am very pleased the Commission did not engage in the blame game or \nfinger pointing but, rather, looked at the facts--just the facts, \nma'am; that seems to be their underlying view--and then looked at \nrecommendations based on those facts so that another 9/11, God forbid, \nwould never happen again.\n  There is a particular area that has not received too much focus that \nI want to mention today. That is homeland security. The Commission's \nreport shows that while mistakes were made in intelligence gathering \nand while mistakes after September 11 have certainly been made in \nfighting the war overseas--we need a strong foreign policy, a muscular \nforeign policy to fight terrorism--those are mistakes of commission. In \na brave new world, a post-September 11 world, anyone is going to make \ncertain mistakes. The mistakes that have been made on homeland \nsecurity, on protecting our Nation from another terrorist attack, are \nmistakes of omission. We are simply not doing enough. That is what the \nCommission's report is going to reveal when they release it at 11:30. I \nhave been briefed on it already, and I guess many Members are being \nbriefed today.\n  To win this war on terror--it is the same as a good sports team. We \nneed a good offense, we need a good defense. Most of the focus has been \non the offense. There has been verbiage devoted to homeland security, \nbut the actual dollars, the actual focus, the actual changes that have \nto be made are not being made, plain and simple.\n  The bottom line is that in area after area, when billions of dollars \nare required, the administration recommends and Congress allocates tens \nof millions of dollars. They do not do nothing. They don't want to say \nwe are not putting any money into port security, rail security, truck \nsecurity, or improving security at the borders. But they do the bare \nminimum essential to get away with saying we are doing something.\n  It is frustrating to me, particularly coming from New York and \nknowing too many of the people who were lost on September 11, that we \nare not fighting a war--it is a war on homeland security--the way we \nare fighting a war overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. What is \ninteresting is the technology is there. We know how to detect nuclear \nmaterials which, God forbid, might be shipped into this country. We \nknow how to detect explosives if somebody were to walk into a railroad \nstation or Disney World or somewhere else loaded with explosives that \nthey might detonate. We know how to make our truck security more secure \nso people cannot use truck bombs. We know how to tighten up the \nborders.\n  The question is twofold: will and money. We are not doing either. As \nwe stand here today, what are we doing in the Senate? We are debating \nthree judges from Michigan who we know will not pass in a controversial \nand partisan way while Homeland Security appropriations languish. It \nhas not been brought to the Senate. Why? What are our priorities? This \nis not a Democrat or Republican issue. This is not a liberal or \nconservative issue. This is an American issue. We want to preserve our \nhomeland security. We want to make people secure. We want to make \npeople safe.\n  Over and over again, we are not doing what we should be doing. The \nnumber of bills introduced and even passed out of committee to tighten \nhomeland security are too many. It is not just homeland security \nlegislation, it is legislation on ports, legislation on borders. Over \nthese past few months, the Senate has been occupied by partisan \npolitical issues when nonpartisan and bipartisan issues that are far \nmore important related to homeland security languish.\n\n[[Page S8585]]\n\n  I hope the Commission's report is a clarion call. Let's get our act \ntogether. Again, this is not a partisan issue. This should not \ninstigate fighting with one another. We should just do it.\n\n  I wish the White House in their budgets had allocated more money. \nWhen people in the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, said, We need \nto do this, that, and the other, had the President said, Yes, sir, \nright on--but we do not have that. We do not have leadership on \nhomeland security. That is what the Commission's report shows.\n  Being a great leader and being a strong leader does not just mean \nfighting wars overseas in this brave new post-September 11 world; it \nmeans tightening things up at home. The bottom line is simple: Why \naren't we protecting our airplanes from shoulder-held missiles which we \nknow the terrorists have? Why aren't we saying more than 5 percent of \nthe big containers that come to our ports on the east coast, the west \ncoast, the gulf coast, should be inspected to see if they might contain \nmaterials that could hurt us? Why aren't we doing more to protect the \nborders? My State of New York has a large northern border. They have \nnot allocated the dollars, the bottom line is they do not have enough \nmanpower at the borders to prevent terrorists from sneaking in. They \nare doing a great job with the resources they have, but Lord knows they \ndon't have them. We are not doing any of these things.\n  I point out one other thing the Commission has mentioned--here, \nCongress is as much to blame as the White House--and that is the \nallocation of homeland security funds. The Commission is very strong on \nthis issue. The moneys that go to police, fire, and the others who are \nour first responders--we learned in New York how valuable they were. \nThe report today will show the number of people who died below where \nthe planes hit the World Trade Center towers was few--too many, but \nfew--because of the great job the police and the firefighters did. Yet \nwe are treating that money as pork barrel.\n  My State has greater needs than, say, the State with the smallest \npopulation, Wyoming. Yet Wyoming gets much more money on a per capita \nbasis. To the credit of the administration, that did not happen the \nfirst year we allocated homeland security money. Mitch Daniels, a true \nconservative, the head of OMB, says he does not want to waste these \ndollars. He is sending dollars to the places of greatest need. I might \nhave wanted more dollars, but at least the dollars that were allocated \nwere allocated fairly. But now we have slipped away from that. Frankly, \nwe do not hear the voice of Tom Ridge, who was the successor as we \ncreated a new Homeland Security Department, saying, allocate this money \nfairly. We do not hear the voice of the President, and we do not hear \nthe voices of the House and Senate.\n  This wonderful report is very critical of what our Nation is doing on \nhomeland security. It is saying we are not doing enough in area after \narea. I hope and pray this report will be a wakeup call. We do not want \nto be in the ``what if'' situation. God forbid there is another \nterrorist attack and the next morning we say: What if? What if we had \ndone the job? What if the attack was by shoulder-held missiles? And we \nsay: What if we had done the job. What if the attack was from ships and \nports? We say: What if we had done the job on port security or on the \nrails? Or because someone got across our borders and shouldn't have? We \ndo not want to be in a ``what if'' situation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8585-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, my colleague from Michigan is here, and I \nknow she will probably want to speak on the three votes on judges.\n  The first point I make is, I would much rather be debating the \nHomeland Security bill than these judges. Where are our priorities in \nthis body? What are we doing? We have had weeks and weeks where many \nhave called for bringing Homeland Security appropriations to the \nSenate. Instead, we have been debating all the political footballs. I \nknow it is a Presidential election year, I know it is election season, \nbut some things should have a higher calling.\n  On this particular issue, I make one point before yielding the floor \nto my colleague from Michigan. Anyone who thinks this is a tit-for-tat \ngame at least misreads the Senator from New York. Were there bad things \ndone on judges when Bill Clinton was President by the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate? You bet. But that does not motivate me in terms of \nwhat we ought to do in the future.\n  What motivates me is that in the issue of appointing judges--and I \nremind the American people that now 200 judges have been approved and 6 \nhave been rejected. My guess is the Founding Fathers, given that they \ngave the Senate the advice and consent process, would have imagined a \ngreater percentage should be rejected.\n  I am always mindful of the fact that one of the earliest nominees to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, Mr. Rutledge, from the neighboring State of the \nPresiding Officer, South Carolina, nominated by President George \nWashington, was rejected by the Senate because they didn't like his \nviews on the Jay Treaty. That Senate, which had a good number of \nFounding Fathers in it--the actual people who wrote the Constitution, \nmany of them became Senators the next year or two--didn't have any \nqualms about blocking a judge they thought was unfit.\n  Now all of a sudden when this body stops 6 of 200, we hear from the \nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue: That is obstructionist.\n  That is not obstructionist. That is doing our job. The Constitution \ndidn't give the President the sole power to appoint judges. It was \ndivided. In fact, for much of the Constitutional Convention the \nFounding Fathers thought the Senate ought to appoint the judges and \nonly at the last minute did they say the President, with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate.\n  This President--regretfully, in many instances--has not consulted the \nSenate. The two Senators from Michigan--they happen to be of a \ndifferent party than the President but we know they enjoy working with \nthe other party--were not consulted. I know it can be done. We have \ndone it in my State of New York. We don't have a single vacancy in \neither the district courts or the Second Circuit because finally, after \nI said I was not going to allow judges to go through unless I was \nconsulted, the White House came and consulted, and there is a happy \nresult. All the vacancies are filled. The judges tend to be \nconservative, but they are mainstream people. I may not agree with them \non a whole lot of issues, but they have all gone forward. In Michigan \nwe have had no consultation.\n  Today when I vote against these three nominations, I am not just \nbacking up two Senators from Michigan; I am defending the Constitution. \nThat is what all of us who vote this way will do. Because for the \nPresident to say on judges, it is my way or the highway, no compromise, \nis just not what the Founding Fathers intended. It is not good for \nAmerica. It tends to put--whoever is President--extreme people on the \nbench instead of the moderate people we need.\n  I regret that we have come to vote on these judges, but I have no \nqualms that I will vote and recommend to my colleagues that we vote \nagainst all three.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole).

The principle is that we should provide \nhearings to people who are nominated by Presidents. When those hearings \nare denied in order to preserve vacancies so that a subsequent \nPresident can make the appointments, that is wrong. That is what \nhappened with Clinton appointees to Michigan judgeships. Two women, \nhighly qualified, were appointed. One was denied a hearing over 4 \nyears, the longest time in the history of the Senate, never given a \nhearing by the Judiciary Committee. The second nominee, highly \nqualified, was denied a hearing for over a year and a half by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  This happened in a number of States. It happened to a nominee from \nOhio, whose name was Markus, who testified as to why he was denied a \nhearing because he asked the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who \nwere in the majority as to why he was never given a hearing. He was \nnominated for an Ohio vacancy to the Sixth Circuit. There are four \nStates in our circuit: Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Michigan. He \ntestified in front of the Judiciary Committee as to what happened, why \nhe was never given a hearing.\n\n     . . . Senator DeWine and his staff and Senator Hatch's staff \n     and others close to him were straight with me. Over and over \n     again they told me two things: There will be no more \n     confirmations to the 6th Circuit during the Clinton \n     Administration, and this has nothing to do with you; don't \n     take it personally--it doesn't matter who the nominee is, \n     what credentials they may have or what support they may have.\n     . . . On one occasion, Senator DeWine told me ``This is \n     bigger than you and it's bigger than me.'' Senator Kohl, who \n     had kindly agreed to champion my nomination within the \n     Judiciary Committee, encountered a similar brick wall. . . . \n     The fact was, a decision had been made to hold the vacancies \n     and see who won the presidential election. With a Bush win, \n     all those seats could go to Bush rather than to Clinton \n     nominees.\n\n  That is not an acceptable tactic. It should not be allowed to \nsucceed. That is the fundamental issue with these nominees, as to \nwhether that tactic of denying hearings--in one case for over 4 years \nand another case for a year and a half, to two highly qualified women \nappointed by President Clinton--is going to work. Senator Stabenow and \nI are determined that it should not work. But we are also determined to \ntry to accomplish a bipartisan solution.\n  There is a rare opportunity here, because of the number of vacancies \nto the Sixth Circuit--there are four Michigan vacancies on the Sixth \nCircuit--to have a bipartisan solution. Two have been proposed to the \nWhite House. Senator Stabenow and I have proposed that there be a \nbipartisan commission appointed in Michigan to make recommendations on \nthese nominations. Whether these two women succeed in getting those \nrecommendations is not the point and it is not assured. We don't know. \nRecommendations would not be binding upon the President, nor on the \nSenate. They are simply recommendations. That has been rejected by the \nWhite House.\n  When Senator Leahy was the chairman, when Democrats were in the \nmajority in the Senate, he made a suggestion, a proposal to the White \nHouse as to how to solve this problem. The White House rejected that \none as well.\n  Senator Stabenow and I have pursued bipartisan solutions to this \ndeadlock. We are going to continue to pursue solutions. But what we \nwill not do and the Senate should not do, in terms of the principle \ninvolved here of denying hearings year after year after year to \nnominees in the Judiciary Committee in order to keep those seats vacant \nso the next President can make the appointment, this principle, it \nseems to me, is not in all of our interests.\n  Even Judge Gonzales has acknowledged there were wrongs. He said: That \nwas wrong. That was wrong to deny Judiciary Committee hearings. That is \nnot right.\n  And he is right. We are going to try to correct that wrong. It can be \ncorrected in a bipartisan way. But for these nominations to simply be \napproved and for cloture to be invoked is not the way to achieve a \nbipartisan solution.\n  One final comment, if I have another minute. How much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, for over 4 years, we made efforts to get hearings \nfirst for Judge White, who is a court of appeals judge in Michigan, and \nfor Kathleen McCree Lewis, who is a noted appellate lawyer from \nMichigan in the Sixth Circuit. Two pages of efforts were made to get \nhearings. I am not going to read them all. All I can say is, month \nafter month after month Senator Daschle, Senator Leahy, and others \npleaded with the Republican majority, the majority leader, and the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee for hearings. We came to the floor \nand made speeches, even after the blue slip was returned from Senator \nAbraham.\n  There is a blue-ship issue here because Senator Abraham did not \noriginally return the blue slip on these judges. But even after the \nblue slip was returned, there were no hearings provided.\n  There is a huge issue always, whether blue slips were returned or \nreturned with objections, whether two Senators from a State who have \nobjections should be overridden and the nomination should proceed. That \nis an issue which affects all of us, and all of us should give a great \ndeal of thought as to whether, if two Senators from a State object to a \nnominee, that nomination should proceed. That gets to the advise and \nconsent clause of the Constitution. But when blue slips are returned, \nwhich is the case with these two judges, there was still a refusal to \nhold hearings. That is unacceptable. That tactic should not work, and I \nhope cloture will not be invoked on these three nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the handling of the nominations of Henry \nSaad, Richard Griffin, and David McKeague in the Judiciary Committee \nand here on the Senate floor sets an unfortunate precedent, and will be \nlong remembered in the annals of this Chamber for the double standard \nit embodies. In collusion with a White House of the same party, the \nSenate's Republicans have engaged in a series of changed practices and \nbroken rules. The home-State Senators of these nominees opposed \nproceeding on them any further until and unless they are able to reach \na bipartisan solution with the White House, but their interests have \nbeen disregarded. In the process Republicans have trampled on years of \ntradition, practice and comity. This sort of behavior may not easily be \nrepaired, but must be exposed.\n  Before I discuss the specifics of the Michigan nominations, I would \nlike to review the recent history of Republican rule breaking, bending, \nand changing with regard to nominations for lifetime judicial \nappointments. Over the last 3\\1/2\\ years, the good faith efforts of \nSenate Democrats to repair the damage done to the judicial confirmation \nprocess over the previous 6 years has been sorely tested and met with \nnothing but divisive partisanship. Rule after rule has been broken or \ntwisted until the process so long agreed upon is hardly recognizable \nanymore.\n  The string of transparently partisan actions taken by the Senate's \nRepublican majority took a wrong turn in January of last year. It was \nthen that one hearing was held for three controversial circuit court \nnominees, scheduled to take place in the course of a very busy day in \nthe Senate. There was no precedent for this in the years that \nRepublicans served in the majority and a Democrat was in the White \nHouse.\n  Then, two of the nominees from that hearing were voted out of the \ncommittee in clear violation of committee rules. Despite his prior \nstatements acknowledging the proper operation of rule IV in February, \nwhich should operate to preserve the minority's right to debate, the \nchairman declared that Rule IV no longer applied. I spent months \nworking to reach an agreement\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\nto move forward the nominees voted out in violation of rule IV and \nreach an understanding that this important rule would not be violated \nagain. However, in connection with the nomination of William Pryor to \nthe Eleventh Circuit the chairman again overrode the rights of the \nminority in order to rush to judgment on a controversial circuit court \nnominee. The assurances given to us that minority rights would be \nrespected and the Senate would not take up nominations sent to the \nSenate floor in violation of our rights were broken.\n  The Republican majority also supported and facilitated the \nunprecedented renomination and consideration of Priscilla Owen to a \nseat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, for which she \nalready had been rejected by the Judiciary Committee. That, too, was \nunprecedented.\n  The other rule breaking I want to discuss is the one directly \nrelevant to the Michigan nominees. It is the tradition of the ``blue-\nslip,'' the mechanism by which home-State Senators were, until the last \n2 years, able to express their approval of or opposition to judicial \nnominees from their home States.\n  For many years, at least since the time of Judiciary Committee \nChairman James Eastland, the committee has sought the consent of a \njudicial nominee's home-State Senators by sending them a letter and a \nsheet of blue paper asking whether or not they approve of the nominee. \nThis piece of paper, called a blue slip, formalized a courtesy long \nextended to home-State Senators. It was honored without exception when \nChairman Hatch chaired the Judiciary Committee during the Clinton \nadministration. Not once during those six years when the committee was \nconsidering the nominations of a Democratic President, did the chairman \nproceed on a nominee unless two approving, or positive blue slips had \nbeen returned. One non-returned blue slip, let alone one where a \nSenator indicated disapproval of the nominee, was enough to doom a \nnomination and prevent any consideration. For that matter, it seemed \nthat so long as one Republican Senator had an objection, it was \nhonored, even if they were not home-State Senators like Senator Helms \nof North Carolina objecting to an African-American nominee from \nVirginia, or Senator Gorton of Washington objecting to nominees from \nCalifornia.\n  When President Clinton was in office, the chairman's blue slip sent \nto Senators, asking their consent, said this:\n\n       Please return this form as soon as possible to the \n     nominations office. No further proceedings on this nominee \n     will be scheduled until both blue slips have been returned by \n     the nominee's home state senators.\n\n  When President Bush began his term, and Senator Hatch took over the \nchairmanship of this committee, he changed his blue slip to drop the \nassurance he had always provided Republican Senators who had an \nobjection. He eliminated the statement of his consistent practice in \nthe past by striking the sentence that provided: ``No further \nproceedings on this nominee will be scheduled until both blue slips \nhave been returned by the nominee's home state senators.'' Now he just \nasks that the blue slip be returned as soon as possible, disregarding \nyears of tradition and respect for the interests of the home-State \nSenators. Can there be any other explanation for this other than the \nchange in the White House? It is hard to imagine.\n  This change in policy has worked a severe unfairness on the interests \nof Senators Levin and Stabenow. They objected to the nominations of \nHenry Saad, Richard Griffin, and David McKeague for reasons they have \nexplained in detail. From the very beginning, they have been crystal \nclear with the President and the White House about their objections, \nand they have done everything possible to reach a compromise. Their \nconcerns ought to be respected, not rejected in favor of partisan \npolitical rule-bending.\n  This is not the first time the blue slip rule has been broken. Last \nyear the Judiciary Committee, under Republican leadership, took the \nunprecedented action of proceeding to a hearing on President Bush's \ncontroversial nomination of Carolyn Kuhl to the Ninth Circuit, over the \nobjection of Senator Boxer. When the senior Senator from California \nannounced her opposition to the nomination at the beginning of a \nJudiciary business meeting, I suggested that further proceedings on \nthat nomination ought to be carefully considered and noted that the \ncommittee had never proceeded on a nomination opposed by both home-\nState Senators once their opposition was known. Nonetheless, in one in \na continuing series of changes of practice and position, the committee \nwas required to proceed with the Kuhl nomination, and a divisive vote \nwas the result. The Senate has withheld consent to that nomination \nafter extended debate.\n  Continuing with the Saad nomination, and going further with Griffin \nand McKeague, the committee made more profound changes in its \npractices. When a Democratic President was doing the nominating and \nRepublican Senators were objecting, a single objection from a single \nhome-State Senator stalled any nomination. There is not a single \nexample of a single time that Chairman Hatch went forward with a \nhearing over the objection or negative blue slip of a single Republican \nhome-State Senator during the years that President Clinton was the \nnominating authority. But now that a Republican President is doing the \nnominating, no amount of objecting by Democratic Senators is \nsufficient. Republicans overrode the objection of one home-State \nSenator with the Kuhl nomination. Republicans outdid themselves when \nthey overrode the objections of both home-State Senators and forced the \nSaad, McKeague and Griffin nominations out of committee.\n  We will hear a lot of arguments from the other side about the history \nof the blue slip, and of the practices followed by other chairmen, \nincluding Senator Kennedy and Senator Biden. What I doubt we will hear \nfrom the other side of the aisle is the plain and simple truth of the \ntwo conflicting policies the Republicans have followed. While it is \ntrue that various chairmen of the Judiciary Committee have used the \nblue-slip in different ways--some to work unfairness, and others to \nattempt to remedy it--it is also true that each of those chairmen was \nconsistent in his application of his own policy--that is, until now.\n  In addition, I think the Senate and the American people need to \nrecall the party-line vote by which Senate Republicans defeated the \nconfirmation to the District Court in Missouri of an outstanding \nAfrican-American judge named Ronnie White. In connection with that \nvote, a number of Republican Senators who voted against Judge White \njustified their action as being required to uphold the role of the \nMissouri home-State Senators who opposed the nomination. Any Senator \nwho voted against the nomination of Ronnie White and does not vote with \nSenators Levin and Stabenow today will need to find another explanation \nfor having opposed Judge White or explain why suddenly the rules that \napplied to Judge White do not apply today.\n  I know Republican partisans hate being reminded of the double \nstandards by which they operated when asked to consider so many of \nPresident Clinton's nominees. I know that they would rather exist in a \nstate of ``confirmation amnesia,'' but that is not fair and that is not \nright. The blue slip policy in effect, and enforced strictly, by \nRepublicans during the Clinton administration operated as an absolute \nbar to the consideration of any nominee to any court unless both home-\nState Senators had returned positive blue slips. No time limit was set \nand no reason had to be articulated.\n\n  Remember also that before I became chairman in June of 2001, all of \nthese decisions were being made in secret. Blue slips were not public, \nand they were allowed to operate as anonymous holds on otherwise \nqualified nominees.\n  A few examples of the operation of the blue slip process and how it \nwas scrupulously honored by the committee during the Clinton Presidency \nare worth remembering. Remember, in the 106th Congress alone, more than \nhalf of President Clinton's circuit court nominees were defeated \nthrough the operation of the blue slip or other such partisan \nobstruction.\n  Perhaps the most vivid is the story of the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit, where Senator Helms was permitted to \nresist President Clinton's nominees for 6 years. Judge James Beaty was \nfirst nominated to the Fourth Circuit from North Carolina by President \nClinton in 1995,\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\nbut no action was taken on his nomination in 1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998. \nAnother Fourth Circuit nominee from North Carolina, Rich Leonard, was \nnominated in 1995, but no action was taken on his nomination either, in \n1995 or 1996. The nomination of Judge James Wynn, again a North \nCarolina nominee to the Fourth Circuit, sent to the Senate by President \nClinton in 1999, languished without action in 1999, 2000, and early \n2001 until President Bush withdrew his nomination.\n  A similar tale exists in connection with the Fifth Circuit where \nEnrique Moreno, Jorge Rangel and Alston Johnson were nominated but \nnever given confirmation hearings.\n  Perhaps the best documented abuses are those that stopped the \nnominations of Judge Helene White, Kathleen McCree Lewis and Professor \nKent Markus to the Sixth Circuit. Judge White and Ms. Lewis were \nthemselves Michigan nominees. Republicans in the Senate prevented \nconsideration of any of President Clinton's nominees to the Sixth \nCircuit for years.\n  When I became chairman in 2001, I ended that impasse. The vacancies \nthat once plagued the Sixth Circuit have been cut in half. Where \nRepublican obstruction led to 8 vacancies on that 16-judge court, \nDemocratic cooperation allowed 4 of those vacancies to be filled. The \nSixth Circuit currently has more judges and fewer vacancies than it has \nhad in years.\n  Those of us who were involved in this process in the years 1995-2000 \nknow that the Clinton White House bent over backwards to work with \nRepublican Senators and seek their advice on appointments to both \ncircuit and district court vacancies. There were many times when the \nWhite House made nominations at the direct suggestion of Republican \nSenators, and there are judges sitting today on the Ninth Circuit and \nthe Fourth Circuit, in the district courts in Arizona, Utah, \nMississippi, and many other places only because the recommendations and \ndemands of Republicans Senators were honored.\n  In contrast, since the beginning of its time in the White House, this \nBush administration has sought to overturn traditions of bipartisan \nnominating commissions and to run roughshod over the advice of \nDemocratic Senators. They attempted to change the exemplary systems in \nWisconsin, Washington, and Florida that had worked so well for so many \nyears. They ignored the protests of Senators like Senator Boxer who not \nonly objected to the nominee proposed by the White House, but who, in \nan attempt to reach a true compromise, also suggested Republican \nalternatives. And today, despite the best efforts of the well-respected \nSenators from Michigan, who have proposed a bipartisan commission \nsimilar to their sister state of Wisconsin, we see the administration \nhas flatly rejected any sort of compromise.\n  The double standards that the Republican majority has adopted \nobviously depend upon the occupant of the White House. The change in \nthe blue slip practice marks only one example of their disregard for \nthe rules and practices of committees and the Senate. In the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Republican majority abandoned our historic practice of \nbipartisan investigation in the Pryor nomination, as well as the \nmeaning and consistent practice of protecting minority rights through a \nlongstanding committee rule, rule IV, that required a member of the \nminority to vote to cut off debate in order to bring a matter to a \nvote. Republicans took another giant step in the direction of unbridled \npartisanship through the hearings granted Judges Kuhl, Saad, Griffin \nand McKeague.\n  During the past year and a half we have also suffered through the \nscandal of the theft of staff memoranda and files from the Judiciary \ncomputer by Republican staff, a matter which is now under criminal \ninvestigation by the Department of Justice. It is all part of a pattern \nthat has included bending, changing and even breaking this committee's \nrules to gain partisan advantage and to stiffen the White House's \ninfluence over the Senate.\n  The partisan Republican motto seems to be ``by any means necessary.'' \nIf stealing computer files is helpful, do it. If rules protecting the \nminority are inconvenient, ignore them. If traditional practices are an \nimpediment, break them. Partisan Republicans seem intent on turning the \nindependent Senate into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Presidency and \nour independent Federal judiciary into an activist arm of the \nRepublican Party.\n  Senate Republicans are now intent on violating ``the Thurmond Rule'' \nand the spirit of the cooperative agreement reached earlier this year \nby which 25 additional judicial nominees have been considered and \nconfirmed. The Thurmond Rule dates back at least to July 1980 when the \nReagan campaign urged Senate Republicans to block President Carter's \njudicial nominees. Over time, Senator Thurmond and Republican leaders \nrefined their use of and practices under the rule to prevent the \nconsideration of lifetime judicial appointments in the last year of a \nPresidency unless consensus nominees. Consent of the majority and \nminority leaders as well as the chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee came to be the norm. The agreement earlier this \nyear on the 25 additional judicial nominees considered and confirmed \nwas consistent with our traditions and the Thurmond Rule.\n  Senate Republicans abused their power in the last year of President \nClinton's first term, in 1996. They would not allow a single circuit \ncourt nominee to be considered by the Senate that entire session and \nonly allowed 17 noncontroversial district court nominees confirmed in \nJuly. No judicial nominees were allowed a vote in the first 6 months of \nthat session or the last 5 months of that Presidency.\n  In 2000, we had to work hard to get Senate Republicans to allow votes \non judicial nominees, even in the wake of searing criticism of their \nobstructionism by the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. \nAfter July 4, 2000, the only judicial nominees confirmed were by \nconsensus.\n  In stark contrast to their practices in 1996 and 2000, the Republican \nleadership of the Senate is now seeking to force the Senate into \nconfirmations of judicial nominees they know to be highly \ncontroversial. That is wholly inconsistent with the Thurmond Rule and \nwith their own past practices. Republican partisans seem intent on \nanother contrived partisan political stunt. They insist on staging \ncloture votes on judicial nominees late in a Presidential election year \nknowing that they have broken rule after rule and practice after \ntraditional practice just to force the controversial nominations before \nthe Senate. They are manufacturing confrontation and controversy. Like \nthe President, they seek division over cooperation with respect to the \nhandful of most controversial judicial nominees for lifetime \nappointments.\n  Reports this week are that the Republican leadership is setting up \nunilaterally to change the Senate's historic rules to protect the \nminority. According to press accounts, some Republicans leaders are \nplanning to have Vice President Cheney, acting as President of the \nSenate, declare that the Senate's longstanding cloture rule is \nunconstitutional and then have his fellow party members sustain that \npartisan power grab. When this radical might-makes-right approach was \nadvocated last year, some Republican had reservations about sacrificing \nthe Senate's rights to freedom of debate. Traditional conservatives who \nunderstand the role of the Senate as part of the checks and balances in \nour Constitution recognized the enormity of damage that would be caused \nto this institution by empowering such a partisan dictatorship. From \nthis week's reports, sensible Senate Republicans are being cast aside \nand overridden by the most strident.\n  Norm Ornstein observed: ``If Republicans unilaterally void a rule \nthat they themselves have employed in the past, they will break the \nback of comity in the Senate.'' Republicans call this the so-called \n``nuclear action,'' because it would destroy the Senate as we know it. \nIt is unjustified and unwise. It is ironic that Republicans blocked \nnearly 10 times as many of President Clinton's judicial nominees as \nthose of President Bush denied consent. Apparently, clearly Republican \npartisans will apparently stop at nothing in their efforts to aid and \nabet this White House in the efforts to politicize the Federal \njudiciary.\n  Both of the Senators from Michigan are respected Members of the \nSenate. Both are fair-minded. Both are committed to solving the \nproblems caused\n\n[[Page S8589]]\n\nby Republican high-handedness in blocking earlier nominees to the Sixth \nCircuit. Both of these home-State Senators have attempted to work with \nthe White House to offer their advice, but their input was rejected. \nThey have suggested ways to end the impasse on judicial nominations for \nMichigan, including a bipartisan commission along the lines of a \nsimilar commission in Wisconsin. This is a good idea and a fair idea. I \nam familiar with the work of bipartisan screening commissions. Vermont \nand its Republican, Democratic and Independent Senators had used such a \ncommission for more than 25 years with great success. I commend the \nSenators representing Michigan for their constructive suggestion and \nfor their good faith efforts to work with this White House in spite of \nthe administration's refusal to work with them.\n  Some Senators have said we need to forget the unfairness of the past \non nominations and start on a clean slate. But the way to wipe that \nslate clean is through cooperation now, and moving forward together--\nnot with the petulant, partisan unilateralism that we have seen so \noften from this administration.\n  Although President Bush promised on the campaign trail to be a uniter \nand not a divider, his practice once in office with respect to judicial \nnominees has been more divisive than those of any President. Citing the \nremarks of a White House official, The Lansing State Journal reported, \nfor example, that the President is simply not interested in compromise \non the existing vacancies in the State of Michigan. It is unfortunate \nthat the White House is not willing to work toward consensus with all \nSenators.\n  Under our Constitution, the Senate has an important role in the \nselection of our judiciary. The brilliant design of our Founding \nFathers established that the first two branches of Government would \nwork together to equip the third branch to serve as an independent \narbiter of justice. As columnist George Will has written, ``A proper \nconstitution distributes power among legislative, executive and \njudicial institutions so that the will of the majority can be measured, \nexpressed in policy and, for the protection of minorities, somewhat \nlimited.'' The structure of our Constitution and our own Senate rules \nof self-governance are designed to protect minority rights and to \nencourage consensus. Despite the razor-thin margin of recent elections, \nthe Republican majority is not acting in a measured way but in \ndisregard for the traditions of bipartisanship that are the hallmark of \nthe Senate.\n  When there was a Democratic President in the White House, circuit \ncourt nominees were delayed and deferred, and vacancies on the Courts \nof Appeals more than doubled under Republican leadership from 16 in \nJanuary 1995, to 33 when the Democratic majority took over part way \nthrough 2001.\n  Under Democratic leadership, we held hearings on 20 circuit court \nnominees in 17 months. Indeed, while Republicans averaged 7 \nconfirmations to the circuit courts every 12 months for the last \nPresident, the Senate under Democratic leadership confirmed 17 in its \n17 months with an historically uncooperative White House.\n  With a Republican in the White House, the Republican majority shifted \nfrom the restrained pace it had said was required for Clinton nominees, \ninto overdrive for the most controversial of President Bush's nominees. \nIn 2003 alone, 13 circuit court judges were confirmed. This year more \nhearings have been held for nominees in just 5 months than were held in \nall of 1996 or all of 2000. One hundred and ninety-eight of President \nBush's nominees have been confirmed so far--more than in all 4 years of \nPresident Reagan's first term, when he had a Republican Senate to work \nwith, more than in the Presidency of the first President Bush and more \nthan in the last term of President Clinton.\n  Many of the 198 nominees who have been confirmed for this President \nhave proceeded by consensus out of committee and on the Senate floor. I \nwould have hoped that the scores of nominees agreed upon by home-State \nSenators of both parties, voted out of committee unanimously and \nconfirmed without opposition in the full Senate would have been a \nlesson for the President. I would have hoped that the Michigan \nSenators' principled and reasoned opposition to the way the Sixth \nCircuit nominations have occurred would have been a starting point from \nwhich to reach a compromise. But, as with so many other nominees and so \nmany other issues, compromise was not forthcoming from this White \nHouse. Instead, they have refused to acknowledge the wrong done to \nPresident Clinton's nominees to the very same court, and they have \nrefused to budge. It is a shame.\n  The Judiciary Committee has now reported more than 200 of President \nBush's judicial nominees. Most have been reported with the support of \nDemocratic Senators. Some have been contentious and some have been so \nextreme that they have not garnered bipartisan support and have been \nproblematic. We have demonstrated time and again that when we unite and \nwork together we make progress. Republicans have too often chosen, \ninstead, to seek to pack the courts and tilt them out of balance and to \nuse unfounded allegations of prejudice to drive wedges among Americans \nfor partisan political purposes.\n  We have more Federal judges currently serving than at any time in our \nNation's history and we have succeeded in reducing judicial vacancies \nto the lowest level in decades. Even Alberto Gonzales, the White House \nCounsel, conceded that: ``If you look at the total numbers, I think one \ncould draw the conclusion that we've been fairly successful in having a \nlot of the president's nominees confirmed.'' The Republican leader in \nthe Senate has termed our efforts ``steady progress.'' The White House \nwould be even more successful if they would work with us to resolve \nthis situation in the Sixth Circuit.\n  Senate Democrats had demonstrated our good faith in confirming 100 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees in our 17 months in the Senate \nmajority. We have now cooperated in the confirmation of more judicial \nnominees for President Bush than President Reagan achieved working hand \nin hand with a Republican Senate majority. We have already confirmed \nmore judges this Congress than were confirmed before the presidential \nelections in 1996. We fulfilled our commitment in accord with the \nagreement reached with the White House to consider 25 additional \njudicial nominees already this year. We have demonstrated not only our \nwillingness to cooperate but we have done so to achieve historic \nconfirmation numbers and historically low numbers of judicial \nvacancies. I have come to recognize that no good deed we do in \ncorrecting the Republican abuses of the past goes unpunished.\n\n  Unfortunately, this President has also chosen to nominate for some \nimportant circuit court seats some candidates who on their merits are \nnot deserving of lifetime appointments. It appears that Judge Saad is \none of those nominees. Clearly the Senators from Michigan have grave \nconcerns.\n  I also have concerns about the nominee, his legal judgment, and his \nability to be fair. While Judge Saad was an attorney his practice \nprimarily consisted of defending large corporations against employees' \nclaims of race discrimination, age discrimination, sexual harassment \nand wrongful termination. A review of Judge Saad's cases on the \nMichigan Court of Appeals raises concerns because he frequently favored \nemployers in complaints brought by workers, even in the face of \nextremely sympathetic facts.\n  For example, in Cocke v. Trecorp Enterprises, a young Burger King \nemployee was aggressively and repeatedly sexually harassed and \nassaulted by her shift manager. More than once, she reported this \ntreatment to her other shift managers who promised to take care of it. \nThe trial court prevented her case from going to the jury but Judge \nSaad dissented from an appellate decision reversing the trial court. \nJudge Saad ignored the legal standard of review followed by the \nmajority and would have protected the corporation from responsibility \nfor the shift manager's notorious and unlawful behavior.\n  Also, in Coleman v. Michigan, a female corrections officer brought a \nsexual harassment suit against her employer, the State of Michigan. \nThis officer was assaulted and nearly raped by an armed prisoner. \nAccording to the officer's complaint, after this terrible attack, her \nsupervisor insinuated that she provoked the attack because of her \nattire. The supervisor made the officer\n\n[[Page S8590]]\n\ncome to his office on a regular basis to check the appropriateness of \nher clothing and he frequently called her to discuss personal matters, \nsuch as her relationship with her boyfriend. Despite these serious \nallegations, the trial court granted summary disposition in favor of \nthe State of Michigan. Judge Saad joined in the Michigan Court of \nAppeals' per curiam opinion affirming the trial court's grant of \nsummary disposition. The corrections officer appealed his decision to \nthe Michigan Supreme Court, which reversed and held that her claims \nconstituted sufficient evidence to go to trial.\n  In another case, Fuller v. McPherson Hospital, a jury who heard live \ntestimony was persuaded to conclude that a woman had endured sexual \nharassment from her immediate supervisor and other superiors. The trial \ncourt vacated the jury findings because it found that the plaintiff had \nnot complained of the harassment while working at the hospital. On \nappeal, the panel reinstated the jury's finding of sexual harassment \nbut Judge Saad dissented. Unfortunately, his dissent in this case was \nonly two sentences and failed to address his colleagues' legal \nconclusions.\n  I cannot speak in open session about all concerns but I can note a \ntemperament problem, as evidenced by an e-mail he sent, a copy of which \nhe mistakenly sent to Senator Stabenow as well. In Judge Saad's e-mail \nhe displays not only shockingly bad manners, but appalling judgment and \na possible threatening nature.\n  In the e-mail exchange, Judge Saad is writing to someone named Joe, \nforwarding him a copy of another e-mail sent by Senator Stabenow in \nresponse to a letter of support for Saad's nomination. In her response \nSenator Stabenow politely and reasonably explains the basis for her \ncontinuing objection to the nomination, explaining that she understands \nthe writer's ``concerns and frustrations,'' thanking them, and offering \nher help in the future. Apparently this type of courteous explanation \nwas too much for Judge Saad. Here is what he wrote in response to the \nSenator's explanation:\n\n       She sends this standard response to all those who inquire \n     about this subject. We know, of course, that this is the game \n     they play. Pretend to do the right thing while abusing the \n     system and undermining the constitutional process. Perhaps \n     some day she will pay the price for her misconduct.\n\n  I know that Senator Stabenow does not need me to defend her, and I \ndoubt that sort of personal threat concerns her, but I think Judge \nSaad's message deserves some attention. It shows a shocking lack of \ngood judgment, a pronounced political viewpoint, and a total absence of \nrespect for the process undertaken by Senators of good faith and good \nwill.\n  As soon as they saw this e-mail message, both Michigan Senators wrote \nto the President's Counsel, Alberto Gonzales, alerting him to the \noffensive comments. While I do not believe Judge Gonzales or the \nPresident ever responded, 2 weeks later Judge Saad did get around to \nsending a ``non-apology.'' He wrote:\n\n       I write regarding your and Senator Levin's recent letter to \n     Alberto R. Gonzales, Counsel to the President (a copy of \n     which you sent to me), relating to an e-mail message that I \n     meant to send only to a close personal friend of mine. \n     Unfortunately, this e-mail, which commented on my pending \n     nomination, was inadvertently sent to your office. I regret \n     that the e-mail was sent to you and certainly apologize for \n     any personal concern this may have caused you. I have a great \n     deal of respect for our political institutions and meant no \n     lack of respect to you.\n\n  He cannot bring himself to say he is sorry for his words, to \napologize for accusing a Senator of abusing the system she so respects, \nor even for expressing the hope that she would ``pay for her conduct.'' \nInstead he is sorry that he was caught, and if what he said may have \ncaused Senator Stabenow ``personal concern.''\n  Apart from all of the procedural problems with this nomination, I \nhave serious concerns about giving lifetime tenure to someone with this \nstunning lack of judgment.\n  I also have concerns about parts of the record of Richard Griffin. As \na judge on the Michigan Court of Appeals since 1989, Judge Griffin has \nhandled and written hundreds of opinions involving a range of civil and \ncriminal law issues. Yet, a review of Judge Griffin's cases on the \nMichigan Court of Appeals raises concerns. He has not been shy about \ninterjecting his own personal views into some of his opinions, \nindicating that he may use the opportunity, if confirmed, to further \nhis own agenda when confronted with cases of first impression.\n  For example, in one troubling case involving the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), Doe v. Mich. Dep't of Corrections, Judge \nGriffin allowed the State disability claim of disabled prisoners to \nproceed, but wrote that, if precedent had allowed, he would have \ndismissed those claims. Griffin authored the opinion in this class \naction brought by current and former prisoners who alleged that the \nMichigan Department of Corrections denied them certain benefits on the \nbasis of their HIV-positive status. Although Judge Griffin held that \nthe plaintiffs had stated a claim for relief, his opinion makes clear \nthat he only ruled this way because he was bound to follow the \nprecedent established in a recent case decided by his court. Moreover, \nhe went on to urge Congress to invalidate a unanimous Supreme Court \ndecision, written by Justice Scalia, holding that the ADA applies to \nState prisoners and prisons. He wrote, ``While we follow Yeskey, we \nurge Congress to amend the ADA to exclude prisoners from the class of \npersons entitled to protection under the act.''\n  In other cases, he has also articulated personal preferences that \nfavor a narrow reading of the law, which would limit individual rights \nand protections. For example, in Wohlert Special Products v. Mich. \nEmployment Security Comm'n, he reversed the decision of the Michigan \nEmployment Security Commission and held that striking employees were \nnot entitled to unemployment benefits. The Michigan Supreme Court \nvacated part of Judge Griffin's decision, noting that he had \ninappropriately made his own findings of fact when ruling that the \nemployees were not entitled to benefits. This case raises concerns \nabout Judge Griffin's willingness to distort precedent to reach the \nresults he favors.\n  In several other cases, Judge Griffin has gone out of his way to \ninterject his conservative personal views into his opinions. The \nappeals courts are the courts of last resort in over 99 percent of all \nFederal cases and often decide cases of first impression. If confirmed, \nJudge Griffin will have much greater latitude to be a conservative \njudicial activist.\n  It is ironic that Judge Griffin's father who, as Senator in 1968, \nlaunched the filibuster of the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Abe \nFortas to serve as Chief Justice. Former Senator Griffin led a core \ngroup of Republican Senators in derailing President Johnson's \nnomination by filibustering his nomination on the floor of the United \nStates Senate. Eventually, Justice Fortas withdrew his nomination. I \nknow that the Republicans here will call any attempt to block Judge \nGriffin's nomination ``unconstitutional'' and ``unprecedented,'' but \nhis father actually helped set the precedent for blocking nominees on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Finally, I turn to David McKeague, his record, and questions. In \nparticular, I am concerned about Judge McKeague's decisions in a series \nof cases on environmental issues. In Northwoods Wilderness Recovery v. \nUnited States Forest Serv., 323 F.3d 405 (6th Cir. 2003), Judge \nMcKeague would have allowed the U.S. Forest Service to commence a \nharvesting project that allowed selective logging and clear-cutting in \nareas of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The appellate court reversed him \nand found that the Forest Service had not adhered to a ``statutorily \nmandated environmental analysis'' prior to approval of the project, \nwhich was dubbed ``Rolling Thunder.''\n  Sitting by designation on the Sixth Circuit, Judge McKeague joined in \nan opinion that permitted the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) broadly \nto interpret a clause of the National Environmental Policy Act in a way \nthat would allow the TVA to conduct large-scale timber harvesting \noperations without performing site-specific environmental assessments. \nHelp Alert Western Ky., Inc. v. Tenn. Valley Authority, 1999 U.S. App. \nLEXIS 23759 (6th Cir. 1999). The majority decision in this case \npermitted the TVA to determine that logging operations that covered \n2,147 acres of land were ``minor,'' and thus fell under a categorical \nexclusion\n\n[[Page S8591]]\n\nto the environmental impact statement requirement. The dissent in this \ncase noted that the exclusion in the past had applied only to truly \n``minor'' activities, such as the purchase or lease of transmission \nlines, construction of visitor reception centers and on-site research.\n  Judge McKeague also dismissed a suit brought by the Michigan Natural \nResources Commission against the Manufacturer's National Bank of \nDetroit, finding that the bank was not liable for the costs of \nenvironmental cleanup at sites owned by a ``troubled borrower.'' See \nKelley ex rel. Mich. Natural Resources Comm'n v. Tiscornia, 810 F. \nSupp. 901 (W.D. Mich. 1993). The bank took over the property from Auto \nSpecialties Manufacturing Company when it defaulted on its loans. The \nNatural Resources Commission argued that the bank should be responsible \nfor taking over the cost of cleanup because it held the property when \nthe toxic spill occurred, but Judge McKeague disagreed.\n  In Miron v. Menominee County, 795 F. Supp. 840 (W.D. Mich. 1992), \nJudge McKeague rejected the efforts of a citizen who lived close to a \nlandfill to require the Federal Aviation Administration to enjoin \nlandfill cleanup efforts until an environmental impact statement \nregarding the efforts could be prepared. The citizen contended that if \nthe statement were prepared, the inadequacies of a State-sponsored \ncleanup would be revealed and appropriate corrective measures would be \nundertaken to minimize further environmental contamination and wetlands \ndestruction. Holding that the alleged environmental injuries were \n``remote and speculative,'' Judge McKeague denied the requested \ninjunctive relief.\n  In Pape v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9253 \n(W.D. Mich.), Judge McKeague seems to have ignored relevant facts in \norder to prevent citizen enforcement of environmental protections. Dale \nPape, a private citizen and wildlife photographer, sued the U.S. Corps \nof Army Engineers under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery \nAct of 1976 (RCRA), alleging that the Corps mishandled hazardous waste \nin violation of RCRA, destroying wildlife in a park near the site. \nDespite the Supreme Court's holding in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife \nthat ``the desire to use or observe an animal species, even for purely \nesthetic purposes, is undeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of \nstanding,'' and even though RCRA specifically conferred the right for \ncitizen suits against the government for failure to implement orders or \nto protect the environment or health and safety, Judge McKeague \ndismissed the case, holding that plaintiff lacked standing to sue.\n  Judge McKeague found plaintiff's complaint insufficient on several \ngrounds, in particular plaintiff's inability to establish which site \nspecifically he would visit in the future. Plaintiff had stated in his \ncomplaint that he ``has visited the 'area around' the RACO site 'at \nleast five times per year' and that he has made plans to vacation in \n'Soliders Park' located 'near' the RACO site in early October 1998, \nwhere he plans to spend his time 'fishing, canoeing, and photographing \nthe area.''' Comparing Pape's testimony with that of the Lujan \nplaintiff, who had failed to win standing after he presented general \nfacts about prior visits and an intent to visit in the future, Judge \nMcKeague rejected Pape's complaint as too speculative, based on the \nCourt's holding in Lujan that:\n\n       [Plaintiffs'] profession of an ``intent'' to return to the \n     places [plaintiffs] had visited before--where they will, \n     presumably, this time, be deprived of the opportunity to \n     observe animals of the endangered species--is simply not \n     enough to establish standing. . . . Such ``some day'' \n     intentions--without any description of concrete plans, or \n     indeed, even any specification of when the some day will be--\n     do not support a finding of the ``actual or imminent'' injury \n     that our cases require.\n\n  In concluding that ``the allegations contained in plaintiff's first \namended complaint fail to establish an actual injury because they do \nnot include an allegation that plaintiff has specific plans to use the \nallegedly affected area in the future,'' Judge McKeague seemed to \nignore completely the detailed fact description that Pape submitted in \nhis amendment complaint. The judge further asserted that there was no \ncausal connection between the injury and the activity complained of, \nand that, in any case, the alleged injury was not redressable by the \nsuit.\n  On another important topic, that of the scheme of enforcing the civil \nand constitutional rights of institutionalized persons, I am concerned \nabout one of Judge McKeague's decisions. In 1994, (United States v. \nMichigan, 868 F. Supp. 890 (W.D. Mi. 1994)), he refused to allow the \nDepartment of Justice access to Michigan prisons in the course of its \ninvestigation into some now notorious claims of sexual abuse of women \nprisoners by guards undermines the long-established system under the \nConstitutional Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act. That law's \ninvestigative and enforcement regime is unworkable if the Department of \nJustice is denied access to State prisons to determine if enough \nevidence exists to file suit, and Judge McKeague's tortured reasoning \nmade it impossible for the investigation to continue in his district.\n  I know that concern for the rights of prisoners who have often \ncommitted horrendous criminal acts is not politically popular, but \nCongress enacted the law and expected its statute and its clear intent \nto be followed. It seems to me that Judge McKeague disregarded \nlegislative history and the clear intent of the law, and that sort of \njudging is of concern to me.\n  I also note my disappointment in his answer to a question I sent him \nabout a presentation he made in the fall of 2000, when he made what I \njudged to be inappropriate and insensitive comments about the health \nand well-being of sitting Supreme Court Justices. In a speech to a law \nschool audience about the impact of the 2000 elections on the courts, \nJudge McKeague discussed the possibility of vacancies on the Court over \nthe following year. In doing so he felt it necessary to not only refer \nto--but to make a chart of--the Justices' particular health problems, \nand ghoulishly focus on their life expectancy by highlighting their \nages. He says he does not believe he was disrespectful, and used only \npublic information. There were other, better ways he could have made \nthe same point, and it is too bad he still cannot see that.\n  The people of the Sixth Circuit deserve better than this. And the \nAmerican people, the independent Federal judiciary, the U.S. Senate, \nall deserve better than the double standard that is now squarely on \ndisplay for all to see.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I yield the time remaining to me to the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Parliamentary inquiry: I thought there was 15 minutes on \neach side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, since nobody \nis here and we are voting at 11, that Senator Stabenow be given 4 \nminutes to discuss this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I thank my \ncolleague and friend from New York.\n  I rise to support the distinguished senior Senator from Michigan, my \nfriend and colleague, who has spoken very eloquently about what we are \nabout to vote on.\n  Today we will be asked to vote to close debate and proceed to a final \nvote on three judges who have been nominated by the President to the \nSixth Circuit in Michigan. We are asking that colleagues vote no and \ngive us an opportunity to work out this situation in a bipartisan way. \nWe have been very close. I appreciate Chairman Hatch's efforts to work \nwith us, Senator Leahy, and others who have worked with us and proposed \nbipartisan solutions. I still believe we can develop a solution if we \ndo not proceed with this vote today. If we do not vote for cloture, I \nbelieve we can continue to work together in a bipartisan way to resolve \nthis issue.\n  It is always difficult when the President nominates people for the \nbench. Oftentimes people will say: Why not give the President his \nnominees? We know this is different from the Cabinet. I have voted to \ngive the President his team, his Cabinet, because they are with him for \nhis 4-year term, and they are part of his team. Except for those few \nexceptions I believed were too extreme, I supported individuals I \npersonally would not select to be in a Cabinet, but it is his team.\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\n  In the case of the judiciary, this is the third branch of Government. \nAs we learn from reading simple high school government books, in the \nbeginning of the debate of our Founders, those at the Constitutional \nConvention gave the full authority to the Senate. Then there was \nfurther discussion and they said possibly the President should appoint \nthe third branch of Government. In the end, they said this is so \nimportant that this judiciary, this third branch of Government, be \nindependent of the other two branches that we are going to split the \nauthority in half. We are going to give half to the President of the \nUnited States to make nominations, and the other half to the Senate to \nconsult and to confirm.\n\n  Our concern is that in the case of Michigan, working together has not \nbeen happening. It is not about two Senators; it is about the people we \nrepresent. We represent 9 million people in the State of Michigan whose \nvoices are heard through our input to the President.\n  My distinguished colleague from New York spoke about the fact that he \nand his colleague from New York, opposite parties of the President, \nhave worked with him and have had agreement on judges they believe were \nmainstream, who were appropriate for the bench, and they have been able \nto work together to do that.\n  Why in New York and not Michigan? Why in California and not Michigan? \nWhy in Washington but not Michigan? Why in Wisconsin but not Michigan?\n  The issue for us today on behalf of the people of our State is we are \nasking for the same consideration, the same ability to have input about \npeople who will serve us long past this President, people who will \nserve us long past the next President, people who have lifetime \nappointments and make decisions that affect our lives in every facet of \nthe laws that affect us, from the workplace to the home to the \nenvironment to civil rights. These judges make decisions that affect \neach of us, and it is our responsibility to be involved and make sure \nwe are working with the White House, whoever that is, to have the very \nbest choices that are balanced and mainstream and will continue on long \nbeyond most of us who are serving in the Senate.\n  This is important, and it is with great disappointment that I rise \ntoday to ask for a ``no'' vote on cloture because we have been \nattempting to work this out now for almost 3 years. Unfortunately, this \nmove to get this vote at this time does not help us get to a fair \nbipartisan conclusion. It is an effort that will only get in the way of \nthat happening.\n  I ask colleagues to join with us in saying no to the motion to close \ndebate and invoking cloture, and I ask colleagues to give us an \nopportunity, that same opportunity that anyone on this floor would ask, \nthe same opportunity that others have been given, to work together with \nthis White House to develop recommendations on the Sixth Circuit and \nnominees we all believe are in the best interest of the people of \nMichigan and in the best interest of the people of the country.\n  I yield back my time, Madam President, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \nwill take a couple of minutes before the vote to express my views with \nregard to Judge Saad. There is no question in my mind that Judge Saad \nis competent, decent, and honorable--a person of great temperament, \ngreat legal ability and great capacity. That is what all of the people \nwho know him best say. He also has a ``very good'' recommendation from \nthe American Bar Association. So he has fit the bill there.\n  The real problem has been in the prior administration, we were unable \nto get two judges through, Judge Helene White and Kathleen McCree \nLewis, both of whom are nice people. I tried to do my best to get them \nthrough, but we could not because there was zero consultation at the \ntime, and by the time we got to the end, it got into another set of \nproblems and, frankly, they did not get confirmed.\n  The two Senators from Michigan have been very upset about that, and \nif I were to put myself in their shoes I would feel the same way, \nperhaps.\n  The fact of the matter is these are three excellent people who could \ndo a very good job on the bench, and Judge Saad certainly in this \nparticular case is very capable of doing the job. So are Judge Richard \nGriffin and Judge David W. McKeague. I will continue to work to try and \nresolve the problems that exist with the Michigan Senators, but these \npeople deserve up-or-down votes and should have up-or-down votes.\n  Some have said if two Senators are against a nomination in their \nState, that should be the end of it. That is not true, and it never has \nbeen with regard to a circuit court of appeals nominees. Every \nadministration has guarded its right to nominate and put forth circuit \ncourt of appeals nominations, and in most cases at least one or two of \nthe Senators have been cooperative in helping.\n  In this particular case, both Senators feel aggrieved because of the \nprior two judges and in the process have had some difficulty with Judge \nSaad. I assure the Senate that Judge Saad is an excellent person. He \ndeserves this position. There is no question about Griffin and \nMcKeague. They are two excellent judges and have great reputations in \nthe State of Michigan. They deserve to be voted up or down today. I \nhope the people will vote for cloture. It is the right thing to do.\n  We should not be filibustering Federal judges. It has never been done \nbefore, and I recommend to all of our colleagues to vote for cloture in \nall three cases.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 11 a.m. \nhaving arrived, the cloture motion having been presented under rule \nXXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Executive \n     Calendar No. 705, Henry W.

Mr. President, I am pleased that we are considering the \nnominations of Judge Richard Griffin and Judge David W. McKeague, who \nhave been nominated by President Bush to serve on the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. These individuals each have a \nsterling resume and a record of distinguished public service. So I rise \ntoday to express my enthusiastic support for the confirmation of Judge \nRichard Griffin and Judge David W. McKeague to the Sixth Circuit Court \nof Appeals.\n  It is unfortunate that we have to continue coming to the floor to \nvote on cloture motions, to end debate on these nominations, rather \nthan the Senate being able to vote up or down on the merits of the \nnomination. This unprecedented abuse of the process, by filibuster, to \nprevent a majority of the Senate from exercising its will is truly \ndisturbing. What is going on is a hijacking of the constitutional \nprocess of advice and consent.\n  This abuse of the process isn't just being used on these two \nnominees. Unfortunately, we have now reached double-digit filibusters. \nThere are ten judicial nominees who have been subjected to a \nfilibuster. They are Miguel Estrada, D.C. Circuit; Priscilla Owen, 5th \nCircuit; William Pryor, 11th Circuit; Charles Pickering, 5th Circuit; \nCarolyn Kuhl, 9th Circuit; Janice Rogers Brown, D.C. Circuit; Williams \nMyers, 9th Circuit; Henry Saad, 6th Circuit; David McKeague, 6th \nCircuit; and Richard Griffin, 6th Circuit. In addition to these ten \nindividuals, there are five additional Circuit Court nominations that \nare threatened to be filibustered--Claude Allen, 9th Circuit; Terrence \nBoyle, 4th Circuit; Susan Neilson, 6th Circuit; Brett Kavanaugh, D.C. \nCircuit; and William Haynes, 4th Circuit.\n  These individuals being filibustered represent a cross section of \nAmerica and include men and women as well as members of various \nminority groups. And they are decent individuals with outstanding \nrecords in the law, in public service and in their States and \ncommunities.\n  It appears that these nominations are being tied up as some sort of \npayback for the way President Clinton's nominees were treated. However, \na review of the record will demonstrate that this contention is without \nmerit. What is happening is the creation of a stalemate for political \npurposes.\n  The current controversy surrounding the nomination of Henry Saad to \nbe United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit dates back a \ndecade. At the end of President George H.W. Bush's administration two \nMichigan nominees to the federal courts were denied hearings by the \nDemocratic Senate and failed to attain confirmation. Those nominees \nwere John Smientanka and Henry Saad, whose nomination we are \nconsidering again today.\n  As President Clinton named his nominees to fill judicial vacancies, \nthere was no expectation, let alone demand, that the two previous \nnominees be renominated by a new administration. Accordingly, President \nClinton did nominate Michigan nominees to both the Sixth Circuit and \nthe district courts. In fact, nine of those nominees were confirmed. A \nmajority were confirmed during Republican control of the Senate.\n  Two nominees, Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis, failed to \nattain confirmation. The primary circumstance for their failed \nnomination was the lack of consultation with one of the home State \nsenators. In his letter to then White House Counsel Beth Nolan, Senator \nAbraham wrote to express his astonishment and dismay that President \nClinton forwarded the nomination for a Sixth Circuit seat without any \nadvance notice or consultation.\n  What was particularly troubling was that Senator Abraham had worked \nwith the previous White House Counsel, Mr. Ruff, to improve the \nconsultation process. In fact, despite previous difficulties, Senator \nAbraham had fully cooperated with the administration in advancing the \nnominations of a number of Michigan nominees. Unfortunately, the \nsituation again deteriorated and the White House reverted to its \nprevious pattern of lack of consultation. In fact, Senator Abraham was \nnot consulted and in fact was told by the White House Counsel that \ndespite earlier representations, the administration felt under no real \nobligation to do anything of the kind.\n  Because of the White House's lack of consultation, the nominations of \nthe two individuals did not move forward. This was consistent with my \nwell stated policy, communicated to Mr. Ruff, that if good faith \nconsultation has not taken place, the Judiciary Committee will treat \nthe return of a negative blue slip by a home state Senator as \ndispositive and the nominee will not be considered.\n  At the end of the Clinton presidency, the nominations of Ms. White \nand Ms. Lewis were returned to the President unconfirmed. Their \nrenomination was urged by Senators Levin and Stabenow at the beginning \nof President Bush's administration. During the spring and summer of \n2001, there was considerable consultation by the President with the \nMichigan Senators regarding nominations to judicial vacancies, and the \nSixth Circuit in particular.\n  While the White House protected its constitutional prerogative to \nnominate individuals to the judiciary, there was an offer to consider \nnominating both of the two individuals to Federal judgeships in \nMichigan in an effort to advance the process. These overtures were not \nonly rebuffed, but in fact holds were requested to be placed on all \nSixth Circuit nominations.\n  This was an unfortunate escalation of the dispute, and was \nparticularly unfair to other States in the Sixth Circuit. In addition, \nthis left the circuit at half-strength. Fortunately, we have been able \nto confirm non-Michigan judges to the circuit court.\n  I regret that the cycle of acrimony and partisanship has escalated \nover the past decade. I believe the Bush administration made a good \nfaith offer and regrets that the compromise was not accepted. However, \neven as the Judiciary Committee gives appropriate consideration to the \nviews of home State senators, it is not in the public interest to \npermit this partisan obstructionism to continue.\n  So let me summarize regarding the treatment of Michigan judicial \nnominees. During the current Bush presidency the Senate has confirmed \nno Michigan judges. Six nominations are pending. During the Clinton \npresidency the Senate confirmed nine Michigan judges. Although two \nMichigan nominees were left unconfirmed at the end\n\n[[Page S8594]]\n\nof the Clinton presidency, two nominees were also left without hearings \nat the end of President Bush's term in 1993. During the first Bush \npresidency the Senate confirmed six Michigan judges. Two nominations \nwere returned to the President.\n  So for those who like to keep score, the Michigan judge tally is as \nfollows: Current President Bush: 0-6; President Clinton: 9-2; former \nPresident Bush: 6-2. The record is clear that previous Presidents were \ntreated fairly by the Senate. It is time to give President Bush the \nsame courtesy and move forward with his Michigan Judges to the Sixth \nCircuit and the District Courts. We can begin by approving the cloture \nmotions we will vote on today for Henry Saad, Richard Griffin, and \nDavid McKeague.\n  Yesterday I spoke about the qualifications of Henry Saad. I would \nlike to say a few words about the qualifications of the other two \nnominees whom we are voting on today.\n  Judge Griffin has exceptional qualifications for the Federal \nappellate bench. After graduating from the University of Michigan Law \nSchool in 1977, Judge Griffin spent 11 years in the private practice of \nlaw first as an associate at Williams, Coulter, Cunningham, Davison & \nRead from 1977-1981, then as a partner from 1981-1985. In 1985, Judge \nGriffin founded the firm Read & Griffin, in Traverse City, MI.\n  During his private practice Judge Griffin specialized in automobile \nnegligence, premises liability, products liability, and employment law. \nAdditionally, he provided pro bono legal services as a volunteer \ncounselor and attorney with the Third Level Crisis Center. In 1988, \nJudge Griffin was elected to the Michigan Court of Appeals. He was \nelected to retain his seat in 1996 and again in 2002.\n  Judge Griffin was first nominated to this position by President \nGeorge W. Bush on June 26, 2002. He was renominated to this seat on \nJanuary 7, 2003. He is universally respected as one of the best judges \nin Michigan. He is not a controversial nominee. Yet he has been waiting \nfor a vote for over 750 days because my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle are, once again, playing politics with the Federal judiciary.\n  Judge Griffin has an exemplary record that includes service as both a \ncommitted advocate and an impartial jurist. The American Bar \nAssociation has rated him well qualified for this position. Although \nthe ABA rating used to be the gold standard as far as my Democratic \ncolleagues were concerned, I am only half joking when I say that an ABA \nrating of well qualified seems to have become the kiss of death for \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. Miguel Estrada, Carolyn Kuhl, David \nMcKeague, William Haynes, Charles Pickering and Priscilla Owen, all \nreceived Well Qualified ratings from the ABA, and all are, or were, \nbeing filibustered by Democrats. Judge Griffin deserves to fare better, \nand I certainly hope we can give his nomination an up-or-down vote on \nthe Senate floor.\n\n  Simply put, Judge Griffin--along with the other qualified nominees to \nthe Sixth Circuit--deserves a vote. I urge my colleagues to do what is \nright and join me in supporting his confirmation to the Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Judge David McKeague has also been nominated to serve on the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Judge McKeague was first nominated to fill a \nFederal judgeship in 1992, when the first President Bush nominated him \nfor a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District \nof Michigan. The Judiciary Committee voted him to the floor with \nseveral other district court nominees en bloc, without any objection, \nand the full Senate confirmed him to the Federal bench by unanimous \nconsent. Since 1992, he has served with distinction in the Western \nDistrict of Michigan, and since 1994 has regularly been designated to \nsit on panels and draft appellate opinions for the Sixth Circuit Court \nof Appeals.\n  On November 8, 2001, President Bush nominated Judge McKeague for a \nseat on the Sixth Circuit, the position for which we are considering \nhim today. When no action was taken on his nomination during the 107th \nCongress, President Bush renominated him to the Sixth Circuit on \nJanuary 7, 2003. As with the other nominees, it is time for the Senate \nto vote up or down on this nomination.\n  In Judge McKeague, we have a jurist with impressive credentials who \nwill honor his hometown of Lansing and serve with great distinction as \na Sixth Circuit judge, as he already has for more than a decade as a \nFederal district judge in western Michigan.\n  Judge McKeague graduated from the University of Michigan in 1968 and \nthen attended the University of Michigan Law School. Upon his \ngraduation from law school in 1971, he joined the law firm of Foster, \nSwift, Collins & Smith, P.C., in Lansing, MI, and in 1976 was elected a \nshareholder and director of the firm. Judge McKeague served on the \nfirm's executive committee in various offices, and was chairman of the \nfirm's government and commerce department, from 1979 until his \nconfirmation to the Federal bench in February 1992, where he serves as \na judge on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nMichigan.\n  Since 1994, Judge McKeague regularly has participated by designation \non, and authored appellate opinions for, panels of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit. So he already has considerable \nexperience in handling Federal appellate cases--in fact, I understand \nthat none of the decisions he has authored for the Sixth Circuit have \nbeen reversed--and I am certain that experience will serve him well \nonce he is handling cases full time on the Sixth Circuit.\n  Judge McKeague has been active as a member of several community, \nlocal, and professional organizations, including the Judicial \nConference of the United States, the Federal Judicial Center, the \nMichigan State and Ingham County bar associations, the board of \ndirectors of a community museum that provides science education for \nchildren, Junior Achievement, which provides business education to high \nschool students, and Camp Highfields, a private facility that provides \nhousing and counseling for troubled youth. He has also been active as a \nmember of the Wharton Center for the Performing Arts Advisory Council, \nthe American Inns of Court, the Catholic Lawyers Guild, and the \nFederalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies. While in private \npractice and since his service on the Federal bench began, he has \ndirected and participated in numerous seminars, moot court \ncompetitions, and trial advocacy programs at high schools, universities \nand law schools throughout Michigan. In addition, prior to his \nconfirmation to the Federal bench, he served 6 years in the United \nStates Army Reserve. Since 1998, he has also served as an adjunct \nprofessor of law at Michigan State University's Detroit College of Law, \nwhere he teaches Federal jurisdiction.\n  Judge McKeague is a distinguished and well-respected Federal judge \nwho, in the words of one of his current colleagues on the Federal \ndistrict court, ``let the law and the facts take him where they take \nhim.'' He will make an outstanding addition to the Sixth Circuit, and I \nurge my colleagues to vote for his confirmation.\n  Let me make something absolutely clear: We need to vote on these \nnominations because it is critical that these Sixth Circuit vacancies \nare filled as expeditiously as possible.\n  The Sixth Circuit has a vacancy rate of 25 percent, and the four \nvacancies are all deemed judicial emergencies by the Administrative \nOffice of the U.S. Courts. Among the twelve United States Courts of \nAppeal, the Sixth Circuit is last in the timeliness of its disposition \nof cases. For the 12-month period ending September 30, 2003, the median \ntime interval from filing of Notice of Appeal to final disposition was \n16.8 months. This was nearly 10 months longer than the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals which was the fastest court that year at 7 months. By \ncomparison, the average disposition time for appeals in all Circuits \nwas about 10\\1/2\\ months.\n  Mike Cox, the Attorney General for the State of Michigan, wrote to \nthe committee last year:\n\n       My office alone has over 430 cases currently pending before \n     the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Those cases range the \n     gamut of the law, from habeas matters involving horrendous \n     murders to cases involving matters of broad public policy. . \n     . . [O]n behalf of the citizens of my state, I urge you to \n     quickly approve Judge Saad's nomination, and begin easing the \n     vacancy crisis that has lingered far too long at the Sixth \n     Circuit.\n\n\n[[Page S8595]]\n\n\n  District judges and U.S. attorneys within the Sixth Circuit have \npublicly stated that the vacancy rate in the Sixth Circuit has slowed \nthe administration of justice. Accordingly, nine members of Michigan's \nCongressional delegation have written to the Judiciary Committee, \nexpressing their deep concern over the persistence of the Michigan \nvacancies and urging us to confirm President Bush's Michigan nominees. \nUnder such circumstances, with the understanding that we will continue \nto work to resolve the Michigan Senators' concerns, we simply must move \nforward on these nominations and confirm Judge Saad, Judge Griffin, and \nJudge McKeague to the Sixth Circuit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in \nexpressing my continued grave concern about the situation in Darfur, \nSudan. For months now, Members of Congress have come to the floor to \nexpress their outrage at the situation in Darfur. All credible evidence \nindicates that what is unfolding in Darfur is genocide. Already, an \nestimated 30,000 civilians have been killed. More than 130,000 refugees \nhave fled to Chad, and more than 1 million people have been displaced.\n  Numerous credible reports document the widespread use of rape as a \nweapon against female civilians. Entire communities have been razed, \nmosques destroyed, and wells poisoned, guaranteeing that a grave \nhumanitarian crisis will continue to unfold for many months or even \nyears. And now reports indicate that terrified survivors are being \nforced to return to their homes, which have been utterly destroyed, in \na context of serious insecurity by Government officials who apparently \nview their own suffering citizens as something like a source of \nembarrassment.\n  Those of us who have followed developments in Sudan for many years \nsee a horrifying familiarity in this crisis. The Government of Sudan \nhas deliberately provoked a humanitarian catastrophe before in an \nattempt to repress dissent, and so for months now Members have come to \nthe floor to speak out about this crisis.\n  I have written and spoken to administration officials, to U.N. \nofficials, and to European officials to call for action and a firm \nunified message to Khartoum. I have raised the issue, as have\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\nmany colleagues, in numerous Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nhearings. This April, my colleague, Senator Brownback, and I introduced \nS. Con. Res. 99 condemning the actions of the Sudanese Government. I \nhave joined many of my colleagues in supporting Senator DeWine's effort \nto direct urgently needed funds to Darfur for humanitarian relief, and \nI am a cosponsor of S. Con. Res. 124 acknowledging the genocide that is \nunfolding in Darfur, and I commend the leadership of Senators Corzine \nand Brownback, the sponsors of this legislation.\n  This is a tremendously difficult and complex situation. I commend the \nSecretary of State for traveling to Darfur to raise the profile on this \nissue. I commend the efforts of the USAID to respond to the urgent \nhumanitarian needs in CHAD and IDPs in Darfur.\n  The administration can and must do more. First, the President needs \nto put in charge a senior official who can speak authoritatively to \nKhartoum and to key regional players, someone who is focused on Sudan \nexclusively each and every day. It is almost inexplicable that this has \nnot been done to date.\n  Since our former colleague, Senator Jack Danforth, left his post as \nthe President's special envoy for Sudan to serve as U.S. Ambassador to \nthe United Nations, it appears that no one has been in charge of this \nissue on a day-to-day basis while this genocide unfolds. What kind of \nsignal does this send about our seriousness? We need someone senior, \nwith knowledge of the African and Arab worlds, put in place today to \ncoordinate U.S. policy and deliver authoritative U.S. messages on a \ndaily basis, to seize on fleeting opportunities, eliminate any \nconfusion, match available resources with urgent needs, and constantly \nhold the Sudan Government's feet to the fire.\n  We also need serious thinking today about how to improve the security \nsituation in Darfur. To date, the Government of Sudan has utterly \nfailed to honor its commitments to disarm the janjaweed and to stop \ntheir brutal campaign.\n  Our strategy cannot simply consist of waiting for them to act. This \nis the same regime that orchestrated this misery in the first place. We \ncannot leave them in the driver's seat. So even as we push \ndiplomatically for meaningful action from Khartoum, even as we do the \nhard work of building a strong, unified multilateral coalition to send \na clear message about the serious consequences that will result from \ncontinued intransigence, we must develop plans to help people in spite \nof the Government of Sudan's policies. That means finding a way to \nprovide security for Darfur's vulnerable populations and for the \nhumanitarian organizations working to assist them.\n  We need to be working now to collect testimony and evidence so that \nthose responsible for atrocities in Darfur can be held accountable for \ntheir crimes. This must not be an afterthought. It is a central part of \nour obligation. And in addition to appropriately and sensitively \ncollecting testimony, we should be making plans today to develop \nstrategies to reach the survivors of rape in Darfur with medical \nassistance, counseling, and community-based support strategies to help \naddress issues of stigma.\n  Ultimately, we need to think about underlying issues of political \ndisenfranchisement that stoked the initial conflict in Darfur. The \nNorth-South peace process made real progress, and I applaud the efforts \nof the many African, European, and American diplomats who worked so \nhard to help the parties come to agreement. But the process only \ncreated real political space for two entities, the Government of Sudan \nand the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement of the South. Neither the \nSouth nor the North are monolithic. We need to think today about \npolitical accommodations that can give the disenfranchised a voice in \ndetermining their own destiny.\n  I share the outrage of my colleagues.

Mr. President, when major and hard-fought legislation \nnears enactment, the rhetoric on this floor can get a little \noverheated. Supporters of the measure sometimes overstate the \nimportance of the legislation or exaggerate its benefits. Opponents \nmake doomsday predictions of what will happen if the bill becomes law. \nOnly the passage of time can answer those arguments, but by the time \nthat answers are available, the Senate has often has moved on to other \nbattles.\n  Today, I want to take a few minutes on the floor to call the \nattention of my colleagues and the American people to some promising \nindications that the doomsday predictions of opponents of the McCain-\nFeingold bill have not come to pass. As we told the Senate at the time, \nMcCain-Feingold will not solve every problem in our campaign finance \nsystem, and it hasn't. Lately, there has been significant controversy \nover so-called ``527 organizations,'' which the FEC has permitted to \noperate in violation, I believe, of the Federal Election Campaign Act \nof 1974.\n  Nonetheless, McCain-Feingold is working as it was intended to work. \nIt closed the political party soft money loophole, and it has restored \nsome sanity to a system that had truly spun out of control over the \nlast several elections. While it is still too early to reach a final \nconclusion, it appears that the cynics and the doubters were wrong. And \nthat is good news for the American people.\n  When the Senate considered the McCain-Feingold bill in March 2001, we \nhad just finished a hotly contested Presidential election in 2000. \nNearly $500 million of soft money was raised in that election by the \ntwo political parties, almost double what was raised in the 1996 \nelection. Nearly two-thirds of that total was given by just 800 donors, \nwho contributed over $120,000 each to the parties. The biggest donors \ncontributed far more than that. The most generous soft money donor, \nAFSCME, gave almost $6 million, all to the Democratic party. SEIU gave \na total of $4.3 million, mostly to the Democrats. AT gave a total of \n$3.7 million to the parties, the Carpenters and Joiners Union $2.9 \nmillion, Freddie Mac and Philip Morris, $2.4 million. Then we had the \n``double givers''--companies that gave money to both parties. In 2000, \nthere were 146 donors that gave over $100,000 in soft money to both of \nthe political parties.\n  The appearance of corruption created by this avalanche of soft money \nwas overwhelming. The public knew it; and we all knew it in our hearts. \nAnd the Supreme Court knew it when it upheld the McCain-Feingold bill \nagainst constitutional challenge in the case of McConnell v. FEC. The \nCourt stated the following:\n\n       As the record demonstrates, it is the manner in which \n     parties have sold access to federal candidates and \n     officeholders that has given rise to the appearance of undue \n     influence. Implicit (and, as the record shows, sometimes \n     explicit) in the sale of access is the suggestion that money \n     buys influence. It is no surprise then that purchasers of \n     such access unabashedly admit that they are seeking to \n     purchase just such influence. It was not unwarranted for \n     Congress to conclude that the selling of access gives rise to \n     the appearance of corruption.\n\n  In this election cycle, I am happy to report, political party soft \nmoney is no more. Not reduced, not held in check, not capped--it is \njust gone. I consider this one of the most significant developments in \nAmerican politics in the last 50 years. In 2002, a colleague told me on \nthis floor that he had just finished making an hour of calls asking for \nlarge soft money contributions. He said he felt like taking a shower. \nNow, many of my colleagues, including some who did not support our \nbill, tell me how happy they are to not have to make those calls any \nmore. That's a huge change in how we spend our time, and how we relate \nto people who have a big stake in what we do on this floor.\n  But what about the political parties? When we were debating McCain-\nFeingold, we had a real difference of opinion on how the bill would \naffect the parties. On one side were Senators who\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\nargued passionately that the bill would kill the political parties.\n  One Senator said the following during our debate:\n\n       This legislation seeks, quite literally, to eliminate any \n     prominence for the role of political parties in American \n     elections.\n       This legislation favors special interests over parties and \n     favors some special interests over other special interests. \n     Equally remarkable is the patchwork manner in which this \n     legislation achieves its virtual elimination of political \n     parties from the electoral process.\n\n  The same Senator claimed:\n\n       But under this bill, I promise you, if McCain-Feingold \n     becomes law, there won't be one penny less spent on \n     politics--not a penny less. In fact, a good deal more will be \n     spent on politics. It just won't be spent by the parties. \n     Even with the increase in hard money, which I think is a good \n     idea and I voted for, there is no way that will ever make up \n     for the soft dollars lost.\n\n  There isn't any way, he said, that they will ever make up for the \nsoft dollars lost.\n  Twenty months after the McCain-Feingold bill went into effect as the \nlaw of the land, our two great political parties are alive and well. \nApparently they do have something to offer to the American people other \nthan fundraisers for lobbyists. A new study by Anthony Corrado and Tom \nMann of the Brookings Institution reports that through the first 18 \nmonths of the 2004 election cycle, the national party committees raised \n$615 million in hard money alone, which was more than the $540 million \nthat they had raised in hard and soft money combined at a comparable \npoint in the 2000 election cycle. Let me say that again. As of June 30, \nthe parties had raised more in hard money in this election cycle than \nthey had raised in hard and soft money combined at a similar point in \nthe 2000 cycle.\n  Remember the Senator who said there was ``no way'' that the parties \ncould make up for the soft money they would lose under the McCain-\nFeingold bill. Well it turns out that Senator was wrong.\n  The parties are not just surviving, they are thriving. And they are \ndoing this not just by taking advantage of the increased contribution \nlimits instituted by McCain-Feingold. Corrado and Mann state the \nfollowing:\n\n       While these increases in the contribution limits have \n     provided the parties with millions of additional dollars, the \n     growth in party funding in 2004 is largely the result of a \n     remarkable surge in the number of party donors. Both parties \n     have added hundreds of thousands of new small donors to their \n     rolls.\n\n  The numbers are truly astonishing. The Republican National Committee \nhas added a million new donors. The NRCC added 400,000 new contributors \nin 2003. The DNC has recruited more than 800,000 new small donors \nthrough direct mail alone. And these numbers don't include any new \nonline contributions in 2004. And, of course, they don't include the \nhundreds of millions of dollars in hard money raised by the two major \nparty presidential candidates.\n  The parties are stronger than they were before not just because they \nhave raised more money than in 2000. Small contributors are a much \nbetter indicator of strength than big contributors. Small contributors \nvolunteer, they are involved, they vote, and they inspire others to \ncontribute and vote. I believe McCain-Feingold saved the political \nparties from the oblivion to which they were sending themselves with \ntheir reliance on the easy fix of soft money.\n  The argument over the effect of the bill on the political parties was \njust one of the disagreements we had when the bill was considered back \nin 2001. Another dispute concerned what would happen to all that soft \nmoney that had previously been contributed to the parties. Opponents of \nthe bill expressed absolute certainty that the money contributed to the \nparties would simply migrate to less accountable outside groups. One \nSenator said the following during our debate:\n\n       Why do we want to ban soft money to political parties, that \n     funding which is now accountable and reportable? This ban \n     would weaken the parties and put more money and control in \n     the hands of wealthy individuals and independent groups who \n     are accountable to no one.\n       Another Senator quoted a prominent Republican lawyer who \n     said: ``The world under McCain-Feingold is a world where the \n     loudest voices in the process are third-party groups.''\n\n  Those of us who supported the bill certainly recognized that some \ndonors would look for alternative ways to influence the political \nprocess. But we also thought that much of the money that was being \ngiven to the political parties was being given under duress. We argued \nthat if Members of Congress and other public officials weren't asking \nfor the money, much of it wouldn't be given at all. We had heard from \ncountless corporate executives that the soft money system, which many \nhad called legalized bribery, was really more like legalized extortion. \nI will never forget the words of Ed Kangas the former CEO of Deloitte \nTouche Tohmatsu. He said:\n\n       Businesses should not have to pay a toll to have their case \n     heard in Washington. There are many times when CEOs feel like \n     the pressure to contribute soft money is nothing less than a \n     shakedown.\n\n  In 1999, on this floor, I said the following in a debate with another \nSenator who actually supported the soft money ban, but asserted that \nsoft money would simply flow to outside groups:\n\n       I have this chart. It is a list of all the soft money \n     double givers. These are corporations that have given over \n     $150,000 to both sides. Under the Senator's logic, these very \n     same corporations--Philip Morris, Joseph Seagram, RJR \n     Nabisco, BankAmerica Corporation--each of these would \n     continue making the same amount of contributions; they would \n     take the chance of violating the law by doing this in \n     coordination with or at the suggestion of the parties, and \n     they would calmly turn over the same kind of cash to others, \n     be it left-wing or right-wing independent groups?\n       I have to say . . . I am skeptical that if they cannot hand \n     the check directly to the political party leaders, they will \n     take those chances.\n\n  On this dispute, with 3\\1/2\\ months to go before the election, the \njury is still out. But once again, the early indications are that the \ndoomsday predictions of opponents of the bill will not come to pass.\n  Not long ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that it surveyed the \n20 top corporate donors in the 2002 election cycle and more than half, \nincluding Microsoft, Citigroup, and Pfizer, are resisting giving large \ncontributions to the outside groups, the 527s, that are trying to raise \nunlimited contributions since the parties can no longer accept them. As \nthe article noted:\n\n       The reticence illustrates an uneasiness on the part of some \n     of the corporations to get sucked back into the world of \n     unlimited political contributions that they thought campaign \n     reform had left behind.\n\n  According to a Washington Post article in June:\n\n       [E]lection law lawyers said corporations are showing \n     significant reluctance to get back into making ``soft money'' \n     donations after passage of the McCain-Feingold law.\n\n  According to the Center for Public Integrity, which maintains the \nmost complete database of information on 527s using the reports \nrequired by the disclosure bill we passed in 2000, 527s that focus on \nfederal elections along with labor-funded 527s have raised \napproximately $150 million as of June 30. This is far less than the \n$254 million that had been raised in soft money by the parties at a \nsimilar point in the 2000 election cycle and less than half of the $308 \nmillion raised in the first 18 months of the 2002 cycle. It is, of \ncourse, possible that 527 fundraising will pick up significantly in the \nwake of the FEC's determination in May that it will likely not regulate \nthese groups as political committees in this election cycle. But the \nunderlying problem with raising money for these organizations remain. \nThat is very simple. It is central to this whole issue. They cannot \noffer the kind of access and influence that made the parties such \neffective soft money seekers prior to the enactment of McCain-Feingold.\n  There is no doubt that ideologically motivated wealthy individuals \nwill continue to seek ways to influence elections. Most of the money \nbeing donated to the 527s is coming from such people. I continue to \nbelieve that many of these groups, since their stated goal is to \ninfluence federal elections, should be required to register as federal \nPACs, which can accept contributions of only $5,000 per year from \nindividuals. But even if they continue to operate outside the law, they \nare not going to replace the political parties. Without significant \ncorporate support, they simply cannot raise the kind of money that the \nparties raised in 2000, much less the amounts that would have been \nraised under the old system in this election cycle.\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\n  So to those who forecast or believed the doomsday scenarios back in \n2001 and 2002 when we considered the bill, or who continue to believe \nthem today, I suggest you look at the numbers. McCain-Feingold is \nworking, and the Senate should be proud that it passed. As we approach \nthe 2004 elections, and the airwaves become saturated with political \nadvertising, note the difference. Party ads are paid for with the \ncontributions of millions of hardworking Americans proud to participate \nin the political process and looking to parties and to their government \nto represent them, not the special interests that used to write the big \nchecks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent I be recognized to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         9/11 Commission Report\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this may be the last day of Senate \nactivity before we take a recess for August. In that recess, both major \npolitical parties will have their conventions in Boston and New York. \nMembers will be back home in their States, some campaigning, some \nspending time with their families--a period of time we all look forward \nto each year. However, we leave this Senate with a great deal of \nunfinished business.\n  This morning, Governor Tom Kean, a former Governor of New Jersey, and \nCongressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana gave a briefing to Members of the \nSenate on the 9/11 Commission Report. Let me say at the outset that \nthose two individuals, Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, as well \nas every member of this Commission, performed a great service for the \nUnited States of America. They have produced a report which, frankly, \nis a bargain. They were given an appropriation of some $15 million, \nthey had 80 staff people, and over a very short period of time by \ncongressional standards did a more thorough analysis of the events \nleading up to September 11 than any analysis that has been done by a \ncongressional committee. They did it in a bipartisan fashion, an \nanalytical fashion, and they did it not looking for someone to blame or \nsomeone to assign responsibility but, rather, to learn so they would \nlearn as a Commission and we would learn as a nation how to make \nAmerica safer.\n  As Governor Kean this morning went through this Commission report, he \noutlined all of the occurrences, starting with the initial bombing of \nthe World Trade Center many years ago, that led up to September 11. As \nhe read the list, it went longer and longer and longer, all of the \nclear evidence we had accumulated of activities by al-Qaida and other \nterrorists threatening the United States of America. When you heard \nthis list, you reached the same conclusion he did; that is, why didn't \nwe see it coming?\n\n  There was so much evidence leading in that direction. Governor Kean \nand Congressman Hamilton said many of our leaders, many of our \nagencies, many Members of Congress, and many American people were still \nthinking about the threat and danger of our world in terms of a cold \nwar. Now we were facing a new danger, a danger which was not obvious to \nus, and very few people were prescient enough to see it coming.\n  He talked about how these al-Qaida terrorists on 9/11, with a budget \nof less than half a million dollars, managed to see weaknesses in our \nsystem of security, that they could bring a 4-inch bladed knife on a \nplane but not a 6-inch bladed knife. All they needed was a 4-inch \nknife. They used box cutters. They came on planes and threatened the \ncrews and commandeered the aircraft. They knew the doorways to the \npilots' cabin were not reinforced or locked. They put all this together \ninto this hideous plan of theirs to crash airplanes into the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon.\n  Well, the facts were there for us to see, and most of us missed it. \nBut this Commission said: We need to look beyond that. We need to look \nto the next question: What should we be doing to make certain America \nis safer? What should we have learned from 9/11? And they identified \nseveral areas.\n  Congressman Hamilton said: We need more imagination. At one point he \nsaid--I suppose halfway in jest--we should have been reading more Tom \nClancy novels and thinking about possibilities rather than just \nanalyzing the way things had always been. We needed to make sure we \ndeveloped imagination, developed a program that could respond to these \nnew threats, capabilities. And we needed to make certain we had done \neverything we could to organize and manage our Government assets so \nthey could be used most effectively.\n  Our friends in the military understand that. It is the reason why the \nUnited States of America has the best military in the world. About 10 \nyears ago, Senator Goldwater and Congressman Nichols proposed some \ndramatic reforms in the military and its management to try to stop this \ncompetition among the branches in the military and bring them together, \nand it has worked. This cooperative effort has made our military even \nthat much better today.\n  Well, this Commission report suggests we need to do the same thing \nwhen it comes to the 15 different intelligence agencies across our \nGovernment that are responsible for collecting and analyzing \ninformation, to warn us of dangers ahead. Fifteen different agencies, \nwith many extremely talented people, some with the most sophisticated \ntechnology in the world, but often dealing with obstacles and hurdles \nbetween agencies that should not exist.\n  They gave us examples: that one agency would know of the 19 \nterrorists on 9/11 and that many of them were dangerous people, but it \nwas not communicated to the Federal Aviation Administration to keep \nthem off airplanes; that we would establish standards which said: If \nyou were identified by our Government as a dangerous person, we are \ngoing to search your baggage, but we are not going to stop you from \ngetting on a plane. All of these things suggest we need to be smarter \nand better and tougher in the future.\n  The proposals they came up with are going to be controversial. They \nwill be discussed at length by Members of Congress and a lot of others. \nBut they are on the right track.\n\n  First: to give to one person new authority over these intelligence \nagencies. Senator Feinstein of California, my colleague, has one \napproach. The Commission has another approach. But the idea is to vest \nin that person more authority to get the job done.\n  Second: to force together all these different agencies, 15 different \nagencies, into a counterterrorism network that works and cooperates. \nThat is something that is long overdue.\n  And then, third: to look at Congress, because we have a role in this, \ntoo. Congress did not do as good a job as it could have done. We have a \nSenate Intelligence Committee, of which I am proud to be a part, and \nthe House Intelligence Committee. But we need more oversight. We need \nto be able to develop the skills, with staff and our own commitment, to \nask hard questions of these intelligence agencies, to ask what they are \ndoing, whether they are being imaginative enough, whether they are \ncooperating with other agencies.\n  We need to ask hard questions about the appropriations for these \nagencies. I happen to serve on the Intelligence Committee and on the \nAppropriations Committee. So I sat through both hearings recently. I \nwill tell you what happened in our Appropriations Committee hearing. It \nwas a meeting of the Defense Subcommittee, in the closed room upstairs.\n  Then-Director of the CIA George Tenet presented a lengthy analysis of \nthe intelligence threats to the United States, about 150 pages, and \nwent through it. On about page 110, he started talking about the \nappropriations. That is what we were there for. We were there to \ndiscuss the money needed for our intelligence operations. But the first \n110 out of 150 pages were all about the threats around the world and \nhow serious they might be.\n  When it came time for members of the Appropriations subcommittee to\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\nask questions, they dwelled on the front part of Mr. Tenet's \npresentation, the first 110 pages. They dwelled on questions related to \nthreats to the United States.\n  I am way down the line on that committee. By the time it came, an \nhour and a half later, to my questions, I said to Director Tenet: May I \nask you a question about your appropriations? It was the first question \nasked about that at that hearing. We spent less than 10 minutes asking \nabout the money that was to be spent and why.\n  My question to Director Tenet at the time was: What is the most \nsignificant part of your budget? How has it changed from last year? And \nwhy do we need it?\n  Well, that is an obvious question in any Appropriations hearing. But \nwe never got to it until extremely late in the hearing. We can do \nbetter.\n  One of the suggestions from Congressman Hamilton is to look for a \njoint Intelligence Committee between the House and the Senate. There is \nonly one viable analogy, when we did the same thing with atomic energy \n40 years ago. No one in Congress today served at that time. It would be \ninteresting to see how it worked.\n  Another is to give to the Senate Intelligence Committee and House \nIntelligence Committee authorizing-appropriating authority. For most \npeople following this debate, this sounds so arcane it does not sound \nimportant, but it is: to give to one committee the authority to look at \nthe programs and how they are working and then look at the budget and \nsee how it matches up. That is important.\n\n  We need to expand the Senate Intelligence Committee staff. We do not \nhave enough people. How can we possibly keep track of 15 different \nagencies, thousands of employees, the reaches of these agencies into \ncountries all around the world, in the heavens above and the Earth \nbelow, and do this with literally a handful of staff people?\n  On the Senate Intelligence Committee, which I have served on for 4 \nyears, I have one staff person whom I share with another Senator. That \nis not good enough. Part-time staff will not do the job.\n  Again, let me say, the 9/11 Commission report is a great service to \nAmerica. The men and women who spent the time to make it a reality \ndeserve our thanks and praise. President Bush was right yesterday. This \nis not a matter of blaming President Clinton or blaming President Bush. \nWe are called on, as Members of Congress, in a bipartisan fashion, to \nthink of ways to change the law to make America safer. I think that is \nwhat people across America expect of us.\n  Let me tell you what we can do today in a bipartisan fashion. We are \nhours away from leaving. We will be off, as I said, for the August \nrecess. We will leave behind this Senate Calendar of pending \nlegislation. On the back page of this calendar, the first item: the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. It has been on this calendar \nsince June 17--over a month now. We will leave town. We will leave \nWashington for 6 weeks, without passing the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill.\n  We should have done that a long time ago. We should be moving toward \na conference to make sure that when October 1 comes, the new fiscal \nyear, we are ready to move, we are ready to send the resources that are \nnecessary not only to the Department of Homeland Security but to State \nand local first responders. That is a critical issue.\n  Let me give you an example. The President's budget request for \nHomeland Security has a total appropriation of $32.6 billion. This is a \n7.7-percent increase over last year. In the House of Representatives, \nthey appropriated $33.1 billion, slightly more than the Senate. But the \nproblem is within the appropriations request itself.\n  President Bush's budget request for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity represents a dramatic cut of $1 billion in money for State and \nlocal first responders. I have said it repeatedly, God forbid another \nact of terrorism hits the United States. People in the streets of \nAmerica are not likely to look for the number of the White House or of \nthe Senate. They will dial 911. They will be looking for first \nresponders in their community.\n  When we cut money, as the President's budget does, for State and \nlocal first responders, we are shortchanging our line of defense, our \nhometown line of defense against terrorism.\n  When you make these cuts to these State and local units of \ngovernment, let me give you an example of some of what we in Illinois \nand other places may find at risk.\n  We need the money that has been cut in the President's budget for \nhomeland security. We need it to specially train and equip local and \nState teams, firefighters, policemen, medical responders. We need it \nfor interoperable communications.\n  I was surprised to learn a few years ago that in my State of \nIllinois, with 12.5 million people, there is no single network for the \npolice and firefighters and ambulance services and hospital trauma \ncenters to communicate. They each have different radio systems, \ndifferent frequencies. What is wrong with this picture? We need them \nall together. If something should happen in my State or in a \nneighboring State, in South Carolina, wherever it happened to be, the \nfirst responders in that State should have a common communications \nsystem. When President Bush's budget cuts money for State and local \nresponders, it reduces the likelihood that we can develop those \nsystems. We need standardized training, methods to share intelligence, \nand we need mutual aid plans.\n  Most people, when they think of dangers and threats in the State of \nIllinois, automatically think of the great city of Chicago that may be \na target. I hope it never happens. We had an exercise 2 years ago to \ntry to simulate what might happen if we had such a tragedy. We quickly \nlearned that if something did happen, we would need a dramatic increase \nof first responders, that the existing police and firefighters in \nChicago and most major cities were inadequate to the task. We would \nalmost have to double their numbers. That means reaching out to \nsurrounding communities in mutual aid, so if it is a situation in \ndowntown Chicago or in a suburban area, surrounding units would come to \ntheir assistance. That is done today over and over again across \nAmerica. When the tornado hit Utica, IL, a few months ago, they had \nfire departments and first responders from all over the region coming \ntogether. But in order to make this mutual aid happen, we need money \nfor the State and local responders to develop it. That line in the \nbudget was cut by President Bush. It needs to be restored by Congress. \nWe need to do that before we go home.\n  Within this same Senate calendar, you will also find other provisions \nof homeland security, such as a provision to increase the safety and \nsecurity of nuclear powerplants. We have six nuclear powerplants in \nIllinois. These are important for us. They provide more than half of \nour electricity. They need better protection. We need better \ncoordination of the fire and police and medical units around them.\n  We also have in our State--and it is probably the reason why we have \nbeen as prosperous as we have throughout our history--so much \ntransportation, intermodal facilities. I visited at the old Joliet \narsenal out in the area where Shell is. All of these trainyards and \ninterstate highways--each one of them is vulnerable and needs to have \nspecial protection. We are a significant source of our Nation's food \nsupply. We have many great universities.\n  Our State is not unique. Virtually every State can tell the same \nstory of areas where we need to focus our attention and resources. We \nhave these four bills on the calendar that would address some aspects.\n  One of the bills provides for greater security and defense of nuclear \npower facilities. That is one that is obvious. We will leave the Senate \ntoday without enacting that legislation and moving it to conference \ncommittee.\n\n  We also have a provision for the chemical industry. Obviously, here \nis a part of the private sector that is really vulnerable. Legislation \nhas been developed to make it safer, and it sits on the calendar while \nwe spend our time spinning our wheels on the Senate floor.\n  The same thing for our ports with the thousands of containers that \ncome in on a daily basis, and our rail facilities. Each one of these \nareas has a special piece of legislation on this calendar that we have \nfailed to address as we leave to go on our August recess. I\n\n[[Page S8600]]\n\nhope there won't come a moment in the next 6 weeks when we look back \nand say: We really should have done our work. We should have spent less \ntime on the Senate floor embroiled in these political debates that spin \nour wheels and go nowhere and more time doing things people care about.\n\n\n                        Further Important Issues\n\n  I have devoted this period of time in my speech on the 9/11 \nCommission report and homeland security, but I will say that we are \nremiss if we leave Washington without thinking of other issues that \nhave a direct impact on the families and businesses across America. \nSome are extremely obvious. Pick a State. Pick a city. Go to any \nbusiness, large or small, and ask them their No. 1 headache today. It \nis likely that most will respond: The cost of health insurance. It is a \ncost which is crippling businesses, denying coverage to many people, it \ncontinues to go up and out of sight, and reduces protection for the \npeople who are supposed to be helped.\n  What have we done in Washington in the Senate on the issue of the \naffordability of quality health care and health insurance? Absolutely \nnothing. We don't even talk about it. We act as if it is not a problem. \nIt is the No. 1 complaint of businesses and unions and families in \nIllinois. How can this representative body, charged with changing the \nlaws and making life better in America, have a session that is void of \nany meaningful debate on the cost and availability of quality health \ncare? We will have done that. We will adjourn without having seriously \nconsidered it.\n  The second issue is the state of the economy, whether we are prepared \nto help those industries which have struggled during the last \nrecession, particularly manufacturing, whether our trade laws are \nadequately enforced, whether we are training and equipping the \nworkforce of the future.\n  The third issue is obvious to most: What are we going to do about \nenergy? Are we going to continue to be dependent for decades to come on \nthe Middle East, drawing us into the intrigue of Saudi Arabia and those \nsurrounding countries and all the other sources or are we going to move \ntoward energy independence? We had a debate on an energy bill that went \nnowhere. Sadly, that bill didn't get very serious about the real \nissues. Can you imagine a debate on energy policy in America that does \nnot even address the question of the fuel efficiency of America's cars \nand trucks? That was our debate. We decided, because the special \ninterest groups, the manufacturers, and some of their workers didn't \nwant to get into energy efficiency, that we would consider an energy \nbill that did not address the No. 1 area of consumption of energy in \nAmerica--the fuel efficiencies of cars and trucks.\n  We can do better. America can have a good, strong, growing economy \nthat is environmentally responsible and energy efficient. We have done \nit before, and we can do it again. What is lacking is leadership, on \nthe floor of the Senate, in the House, and in the White House. That is \ncritically important.\n\n  Of course, the one issue I started with is the issue that I will end \nwith--America's security defense. As we speak on the Senate floor \ntoday, just a few minutes away by car are Walter Reed Hospital and the \nBethesda Naval Medical Center. In the wards and rooms of those two \ngreat medical institutions are men and women who served our country \nvaliantly in Iraq, many of whom suffered extremely serious injuries. I \nhave been out with colleagues to visit with them from time to time and \ncan't help but be impressed. They are the best and brightest in \nAmerica. They are young men and women who stood up, took the oath, put \non the uniform, and risked their lives for America. My heart goes out \nto them every day and many just like them who are serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and all around the world.\n  We have to be mindful of the fact that our situation in Iraq is a \nlong-term commitment. No matter what you might have thought when we \ndecided to invade Iraq--and I was one of 23 Senators who voted against \nthe use-of-force resolution at that time--we all come together now \nbelieving that we need to provide every resource our men and women in \nuniform need to finish their mission and come home safely. That is \nsomething that should never be far from our minds, as well as the \nquestion of what we are going to do to make America safer here at home.\n  We talk about a war on terrorism, but former Senator Bob Kerrey of \nNebraska at the 9/11 Commission meeting made an observation we should \nnot forget. He said to Donald Rumsfeld and George Tenet, who appeared \nbefore the Commission, that it really isn't a war on terrorism. \nTerrorism is a tactic. The question is, Who is the enemy using the \nterrorism tactic? That is the real question. What should we be doing \nnow to discover the plots and dangers across the world that might come \nto threaten the United States but also to reach out to the next \ngeneration in countries around the world to let them know we are a \ncompassionate, caring people with values they can share and that their \nlives will be better for that.\n  It goes beyond military strength and intelligence. It goes into \ndiplomacy and leadership around the world so that this country, as we \nmay hear from time to time, is not only strong at home but respected \naround the world.\n  We can do our part. We need to reach out in different areas where we \nhave not as much in the past. Yesterday, I spoke on the floor about the \nsituation in the Sudan. It is a situation where literally a thousand \npeople a day are losing their lives to what is a horrible genocide \noccurring in that country. We need to do more.\n  The United States has spent over $100 million so far in food aid. We \nneed to be a political force, too, to push that Sudanese Government to \ndo what is right and to work with the United Nations so that we say to \nthe world: The United States is not interested in treasure or \nterritory; we are a caring people, a humanitarian people who care about \nsome of the poorest places on Earth, such as the Sudan.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I also thank my friend from Tennessee, Senator Alexander. \nI know he wants to speak as well. I will not be long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wyden pertaining to the introduction of S. 2723 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2721 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                         9/11 Commission Report\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, this morning at about 10 a.m. we were \ngiven an opportunity to meet with Governor Kean and Lee Hamilton, the \ncochair of the 9/11 Commission. That is the subject of the news today. \nI know both men well. I know Governor Kean better. We served as \nGovernors at the same time. I have known a lot of Governors. He was \nGovernor of New Jersey at the time he served. My judgment was he was \nthe best Governor in the country. Those leadership characteristics \ncertainly showed themselves with this report.\n  Mr. Hamilton said he had been working actively with the directors of \nthe CIA in every administration since Lyndon Johnson. In a few words, \nhe gave us a very impressive presentation. I believe this is an \nimpressive report. It is an impressive committee. It has had impressive \nleadership, and it certainly will command my attention as one Senator. \nI intend to read it all the way through, and I intend to take seriously \nthe recommendations. I hope all Americans will take time to read it.\n  Terrorism, as they remind us, whether or not we like it, is the \ngreatest challenge today to our national security. It will be for our \nlifetimes and perhaps much longer than that.\n  This is a hard matter for us to come to grips with in the United \nStates of\n\n[[Page S8601]]\n\nAmerica, because it seems too remote from us. It seems as if it is on \ntelevision. That is hard to say after 9/11 when 3,000 people were \nkilled in an hour.\n  But as Mr. Hamilton gave his report to us, he emphasized four areas \nof failure--not President Bush's failure, not President Clinton's \nfailure, but our failure. In fact, he said both Presidents were active \nand busy and interested and working hard on the threat. But in these \nfour areas, we as a country failed.\n  First was the failure of imagination. We didn't imagine what could \nhave happened that day. Second was a failure of policy. A third was a \nfailure of capability. And fourth was a failure of management.\n  It made me think, if I may give a personal reflection. I have thought \nabout it many times because I have heard various people suggest, ``Why \ndidn't President Bush think of this?'' or ``Why didn't President \nClinton think of this?'' As the Chair knows, I was busy in the mid \n1990s trying to occupy the same seat President Bush occupies today. I \nwas a candidate for President of the United States in 1994, 1995, and \n1996. I thought back many times. It never once occurred to me a group \nof people might fly airplanes into the World Trade Center and into the \nPentagon and try to fly them into the Capitol.\n  It never occurred to me. And it also never occurred to me that if I \nshould by some chance be successful in that race, that within a year \nand a half of taking office I would suddenly be interrupted in a \nmeeting in Florida with some schoolchildren, and in a short period of \ntime I would have to decide whether to shoot down a plane load of U.S. \ncitizens on a commercial airline headed toward Washington, DC. It never \noccurred to me.\n  I thought for a long time: Maybe that is just me. Maybe I am naive \nand have not had enough experience, but I have asked other public \nofficials with a lot more experience. I did not ask the Presiding \nOfficer, whose husband was a candidate for our country's highest \noffice, if that occurred whether they might have to shoot down such an \nairplane. Maybe with her background in transportation, she would have \nthought of that, but I didn't. And I think most policymakers did not. \nObviously, many people in intelligence didn't.\n  What Mr. Hamilton was saying, and Governor Kean, is we are going to \nhave to imagine all of the things that could be done, some of us at \nleast, and think about them and take those things very seriously in the \nfuture.\n  As fortunate as we are to live in this big country with remote, safe \nplaces, far away from a lot of the fighting we see on television, an \nunfortunate part of living in today's world is there are real threats \nand we are going to have to imagine those things that even candidates \nfor the highest office in our land a few years ago would not have ever \nimagined.\n  I salute the Commission for its work. I thank them for it. I like the \nfact that it is unanimous, without a single dissent, without a \ndissenting opinion. I thank them for their job.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8601-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8601-S8614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n               financial solicitations on military bases\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about \na rider included in the Department of Defense appropriations conference \nreport that we will be taking up shortly. This rider is from the House \nDefense appropriations bill. It will limit the ability of the \nDepartment of Defense to address deceptive sales practices on our \nmilitary bases.\n  This week, the New York Times has published a two-part series which \nincluded disturbing reports of financial advisers taking advantage of \nservice men and women on our military installations. These articles \ncontained evidence which indicate that recently enlisted service \nmembers are required, at many installations, to attend mandatory \nfinancial advisory classes. In those classes, it has been discovered \nthat sales agents use questionable tactics to sell insurance and \ninvestments that may not fit the needs of our young men and women in \nuniform.\n  Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues the articles from the July \n20 and July 21 editions of the New York Times titled ``Basic Training \nDoesn't Guard Against Insurance Pitch to G.I.'s'' and ``Insurers Rely \non Congress to Keep Access to G.I.'s.''\n  Mr. President, as you well know, our men and women in uniform today \nare being called upon to sacrifice, sometimes--for more than 900 of \nthem--the ultimate sacrifice. All of them are separated from their \nfamilies. They are putting their lives at risk in the service of our \nNation.\n  It is almost unimaginable that in addition to their sacrifice they \nwould be exposed to less than scrupulous financial advisers at the \ninstallations at which they serve. However, instead of protecting our \nservice members, a culture of financial abuse persists on our military \nbases. As soon as I learned of these reports, I immediately wrote to \nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, asking for an immediate \ninvestigation of these practices, as well as immediate action to \nprevent these abuses from continuing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Secretary \nRumsfeld be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2004.\n     Hon. Donald Rumsfeld,\n     Secretary of Defense, U.S. Department of Defense, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I write to urge you to conduct an \n     immediate investigation into reports about efforts by \n     financial advisors to take advantage of our men and women in \n     uniform through the use of deceptive sales practices. I am \n     greatly alarmed by these reports which indicate that recently \n     enlisted service members at many installations are required \n     to attend mandatory financial advisory classes in which sales \n     agents use questionable tactics to sell insurance and \n     investments that may not fit the needs of people in uniform.\n       Today our men and women in uniform are being called upon to \n     sacrifice, be separated from their families, and to put their \n     lives at risk in service of their nation. They should not, \n     under any circumstances, be exposed to less than scrupulous \n     financial advisors at the installations at which they serve. \n     However, instead of protecting our service members, a culture \n     of financial abuse persists at military installations. It \n     should not be too much to expect that our service men and \n     women are protected from this behavior through the \n     enforcement of post policies and regulations restricting \n     disreputable financial practices. In short, our men and women \n     in uniform should never be the unwitting prey of self-\n     interested sales agents at military installations.\n       In addition to conducting a thorough investigation, I urge \n     you to establish a financial education program for enlistees \n     and review the practices whereby sales agents are given \n     unfettered access to new recruits. This financial education \n     program should include a component that equips soldiers to \n     recognize that an attempt is being made to entice them to \n     purchase financial services that are not in their best \n     interest.\n       With our men and women in uniform serving bravely in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan and elsewhere, we owe it to them to make sure \n     they are not solicited for questionable financial schemes at \n     the installations where they live.\n       I thank you for your consideration of my request and look \n     forward to your response.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                           Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I have also written to and spoken to both Chairman \nWarner and Ranking Member Levin from the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices, to ask for hearings on this issue when we return in \nSeptember. However, I was alerted yesterday that there is a provision \nin the Department of Defense conference report that would prohibit the \nDepartment of Defense from taking immediate action to address these \nfinancial abuses on our military installations.\n  Specifically, section 8133 of the conference report does not allow \nany changes to the Department of Defense Directive 1344.7, entitled \n``Personal Commercial Solicitation on DOD Installations,'' until 90 \ndays after a report containing the results of an investigation \nregarding insurance premium allotment processing is submitted to the \nHouse Committee on Government Reform and the Senate Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  With that investigation still ongoing, it could be months--maybe \nyears, for\n\n[[Page S8602]]\n\nall we know--until any changes are made to these abusive practices. \nDuring that time, more of our young men and women will fall prey to \nthese unscrupulous agents who sell them financial products they do not \nneed and they barely understand.\n  Yesterday, I sent a letter to Senators Stevens and Byrd, the \ndistinguished chair and ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations, as well as to Senator Inouye, the ranking member of the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, to express my concern \nabout the inclusion of this provision in the conference report of the \nDOD appropriations bill and to urge them to take action to remove this \nrider.\n  I understand a similar provision, with an even longer delay before \nDOD can take action, was included in the House Defense authorization \nbill. I am a conferee in the House-Senate conference on the Defense \nauthorization bill, and I intend to do everything I can to include \nlanguage that will allow the Department of Defense to immediately \naddress this troubling issue without having to wait several months \nwhile our men and women in uniform continue to be fleeced.\n  I hope I will have the support of my colleagues who are also \nconferees on the Department of Defense authorization bill. I look \nforward to working with Senators on the Committee on Appropriations to \nfigure out the best way to address this issue.\n  The problem of financial advisers taking advantage of our service men \nand women is one that requires immediate action. It is almost hard to \nbelieve, as the two articles in the New York Times so poignantly point \nout, that young men and women, who have a lot on their minds--such as \nleaving their families; oftentimes worrying about young wives left \nalone, taking care of children; or parents who are worried about their \nsafety; trying to get the training they need; trying to get prepared \nfor the dangerous missions they will face in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nelsewhere--would be required, in many instances, to attend these \nmeetings, which could do a lot to help educate them.\n  In fact, in my letter to Secretary Rumsfeld I ask there be financial \neducation provided to these young men and women and oftentimes, if \npossible, where there are large bases, to the spouses who are left \nbehind. I have visited bases where particularly young wives--often as \nyoung as 17, 18, 19 years old--are seeing their husbands leave for \noverseas deployments. They do not know how to keep a checkbook. They do \nnot know how to pay bills. They have gone literally from their parents' \nhome into a new, young marriage, oftentimes under the pressure of an \nimpending deployment--usually of their husbands--and now, all of a \nsudden, they are left to try to deal with the financial demands of \nrunning a household. They should be given help. They should not be \ntaken advantage of.\n\n  It strikes me as just regrettable that we would permit the \nsolicitation for questionable financial schemes at the very military \ninstallations where these young men and women live prior to asking them \nto go into harm's way.\n  There certainly is a role for additional insurance, for other kinds \nof investment information to be provided, but not in a situation where \nthe people doing the presentations are often former military officers \nor high-ranking noncommissioned officers, who purport to and present \nthemselves as people in authority, and often lay the groundwork for a \nvery rushed and somewhat coercive atmosphere, where these young men and \nwomen sign things they do not understand. It is somewhat reminiscent of \nmany of our college students, who are in comparable age and group \nsettings, who are given the hard sells for credit cards and insurance \npolicies they do not understand. So I think there is a tremendous \nopportunity for legitimate financial education and for helping our \nmilitary service members know what their needs are, and then to meet \nthose needs.\n  I am looking forward to working with my colleagues on the Committee \non Armed Services, as well as Senators on the Committee on \nAppropriations, to find a solution to this problem. I regret these \nriders were injected into the DOD appropriations subcommittee \nconference report that we will vote up or down this afternoon.\n  I will certainly support the appropriations bill because there are \nmuch-needed resources in it for our military and other ongoing needs \nthat are within the purview of the Department of Defense that we need \nto be funding.\n\n\n                     Report of the 9/11 Commission\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I salute the 9/11 Commission for an \nextraordinary job well done and an act of real patriotism. The men and \none woman who served on this Commission were asked to do a very \ndifficult task, to try to separate themselves from their prior \nassociations. These are all political people. Not everyone ran for \npolitical office, but the distinguished chair and vice chair certainly \ndid and other members as well. These are all people who understand our \npolitical process and who with great distinction have served their \nparty as well as our country, but they put that to one side when it \ncame to working together. This 9/11 Commission report is a great \ntestimony to their willingness to search hard for the truth, to get at \nthe facts, to then explain, in understandable language, whatever they \ncould discover about the events leading up to \n9/11.\n  This report not only is educational and informative, but it is an \nurgent call to action. There are recommendations that ask the branches \nof our Government, the executive and legislative, as well as the \nAmerican public, to understand we are up against a determined and \ncommitted adversary. Therefore, we have to think differently. We have \nto organize differently. We cannot act as though business as usual is \nsufficient. The recommendations from this Commission will ask this body \nto reorganize itself, to have a different approach to the oversight of \nintelligence. I hope we will respond to that request and \nrecommendation.\n  There have been many other commissions, led by distinguished \nAmericans, who have plowed the same ground, who have come forth with \nworthwhile and compelling recommendations which, frankly, have been \nignored. We ignore this one at our peril.\n  I have stood in this spot numerous times, most recently just a week \nago Thursday, to ask what are we doing. We sometimes act as though \nthere is no threat beyond what our young men and women in the military \nface in the mountains of Afghanistan or the streets of Baghdad. This \nthreat is real and it is here. It is among us. We know enough to \nunderstand that there are credible reports of plans underway as I speak \nto strike again.\n  If one reads this report--and I hope every American does, and I hope \nthis is assigned in junior high schools and high schools and colleges \nbecause this is not just a report to be read by decisionmakers, to be \nread by political leaders, this is a report that should be read by \nevery American--they cannot help but be struck by the ongoing threat we \nface.\n  I perhaps feel it more strongly because we know that in every report \nof any credibility, New York is always mentioned. Therefore, I have to \nask: Are we doing our part even now, before we get to the point of \nconsidering the Commission's recommendations? Why aren't we considering \nhomeland security right now? Why have we done nearly everything but \nconsider the appropriations for homeland security, consider the very \ngood legislation offered on both sides of the aisle to try to have a \nbetter approach to everything from port security to providing our first \nresponders with the resources they need, to disbursing Federal funds \nbased on threat and not treating it, as the Commission rightly says, \nlike some kind of revenue sharing? Obviously, that will mean New York \nwill get more than any other place, probably followed closely by \nWashington, DC, but those are the places of highest risk and threat.\n\n  The work before us is obvious. But I have to confess to a certain \nlevel of frustration that we have not even addressed what is within our \npurview. Now we are being asked by the 9/11 Commission to be even more \nimaginative, to be willing to change the turf, to remove some of the \nauthority some have in order to better organize ourselves going \nforward.\n  At the press conference today, one of our distinguished former \nMembers who served in this body for a number of years, Senator Bob \nKerrey, summed it\n\n[[Page S8603]]\n\nup. He said, knowing as he does how this town works and how this body \nworks, how this Congress works, he was hopeful but not optimistic that \nwe would face up to our responsibilities.\n  What does it take for us to realize that the partisan bickering, the \ndivisiveness, the point scoring, and the political gamesmanship have no \nplace in the ongoing serious war against terror?\n  I hope, as a result of the fine work of this Commission and the path \nit has charted that we should follow into the future, we will rise to \nthe occasion. There are recommendations certainly for the White House, \nthe FBI, the CIA, the Department of Defense, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, the Department of Homeland Security. There are \nmany recommendations that go to the administration, that go to the \nexecutive branch, that regardless of who is our President after \nNovember, that President will have to address. But that does not let \nthe Congress off the hook. We have not fulfilled our responsibilities \nof oversight, and we now must take seriously the recommendations of \nthese patriotic, hard-working, thoughtful Commissioners.\n  This report cannot be allowed to sit on a shelf somewhere. I hope we \nwill take it in the spirit it is offered, as not just a bipartisan but, \nfrankly, nonpartisan report; that we will immediately, under the \nleadership we have in this Senate, begin to figure out how we will \nfulfill the hope this Commission offers us; that we will be better \nprepared, better organized to play our part in the struggle against \nterrorism. I certainly will look forward to working with my colleagues \nin order to do that. I trust and hope that I can afford to be \noptimistic and that we will be able to prove our former colleague and \none of the Commissioners, Senator Kerrey, wrong to a limited extent, \nthat we can be both hopeful and optimistic that the Senate, the \nCongress, and our Government will live up to the obligations this \nreport lays out so clearly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about what \nso many Americans are thinking about as they turn on their television \ntoday, and that is the 9/11 Commission report that is being issued by \nmany of our former colleagues and partners in trying to address the \nsecurity needs of our Nation. I am sure many Americans are going to \nwant to know from this 9/11 report, is it going to result in us getting \noff our orange alert? Is it going to help us in providing better \nsecurity across America?\n  One of the things we have to think about is the fact that this report \nnow needs to be put into legislative action by this body. I thank the \nCommission, including Governor Keane, former Congressman Hamilton, and \nformer Senator Slade Gorton, for their contribution to this report and \ntheir hard work. The voluminous report has a lot of recommendations, \nbut I would like to call out two or three of those recommendations that \nare particularly important for us as a body to address when we return \nin September.\n  First and foremost is the need for us to focus on international \ncooperation. We in the Northwest learned that lesson very well when \nAhmed Ressam came across the Canadian border with a car full of \nexplosives on his way to LAX Airport. Many people in America know that \nstory and know that a good customs agent was able to stop Ressam and \nconfiscate those goods, and that act was never perpetrated on American \nsoil. We also know after that, 9/11 did happen. So the question for us \nin America is, What are we going to do to make sure we have good \ninternational cooperation?\n  What is interesting about the Ressam case is Mr. Ressam started his \nefforts in Algiers, was successful in getting into France, then \nsuccessful in creating a new identity and getting into Canada. Even \nthough that was an illegal entry into Canada, he was able to remain in \nCanada and then create a Canadian passport and birth certificate and \ntry to gain access to the United States.\n  As I said, the route he took through several countries to try to get \nto Port Angeles, WA, to start his journey shows the need we have in \nthis country for international cooperation as it relates to our visa \nprogram and our visa standards. This is something we have seen a delay \nin in the last several years and something we need to pay particular \nattention to in the Senate to make sure this visa standard program gets \nimplemented and gets implemented as soon as possible.\n  While we in the United States can have a visa entry program based on \na biometric standard, that standard will only be as good as the \nstandard that is then adopted by Canada and Mexico, our European \npartners, our Middle East allies, and various other countries around \nthe world. By that, I mean if Mr. Ressam had entered France on a \nbiometric standard which showed, perhaps with fingerprints or facial \nrecognition, who Ahmed Ressam was, the various times he tried to \nperpetrate a false identity to get into the United States, we would be \nable to track that individual.\n  We know this is very important because we know that of the hijackers \non 9/11, many of them had various trips back and forth to the United \nStates. While we want to continue to have good international commerce \nwith many countries and have people travel to the United States, we \nneed a better security system with our visa standard, and we should \nmake a top priority of getting such international cooperation based on \nbiometrics.\n\n  I can say the same for international cooperation on port security. \nWashington State, being the home to many ports, needs to focus on the \nfact that cargo containers come in every day into the ports of Seattle, \nTacoma, Vancouver, and various parts of Washington State. What we need \nis not to wait until the last minute for cargo containers to get into \nthe Seattle area to find out whether they have explosives or whether \nthe containers have been tampered with, but to have point of origin \ncooperation with countries all over the world to make sure that \nsecurity system is deployed at the time the cargo leaves its port.\n  Here are two examples, one of human deployment of people coming to \nthe United States and another of goods and services in which \ninternational cooperation is essential. That is why I take to heart the \nrecommendation on page 20 of the 9/11 Commission report, the executive \nsummary saying that:\n\n       Unifying strategic intelligence and operational planning \n     against Islamic terrorists across foreign-domestic divide \n     with a National Counterterrorism Center.\n\n  What I believe the report is saying is we have to have the \ncooperation of our allies and the global community in fighting \nterrorism and doing so in a cooperative effort if we are going to be \nsuccessful in the United States.\n  Secondly, while I think the report emphasizes the focus of a flat \norganization, from my 2 years on the Judiciary Committee and review of \nthe incidents of 9/11 through the FBI and their organization and \nchanges that have been made to that organization, one thing that is \nvery clear about the 9/11 report is that a flat, decentralized \norganization and network of information must be accomplished.\n  While the report does talk about consolidation and the central focus, \nthe important thing to understand is we are facing an asymmetrical \nthreat by terrorists. We are not facing a superpower. We are not facing \na well-oiled, well-heeled organization with a lot of support that we \ncan track, detect, and analyze on a large-scale basis; it is very \ndecentralized, with a lot of information flowing from a lot of \ndifferent cells through different parts of the international community. \nWhat is important about that is if we are going to face that \nasymmetrical threat and meet that challenge, having a large bureaucracy \nfacing an asymmetrical threat of lots of cells presents a challenging \nproblem.\n  That is why it is very important, as Special Agent Coleen Rowley \npointed out to many of the people in the intelligence community and the \nFBI community, the information that existed in different FBI offices \nthroughout America but was not shared, was not pieced together with the \nother intelligence information by the CIA about potential people \nentering and exiting the country, needs to be pieced together in a flat \norganization.\n\n[[Page S8604]]\n\n  Critical to this report and our success is for us to monitor the new \norganizations and agencies, such as Homeland Security, the structure of \nthe FBI and CIA, and any new structures coming out of the 9/11 report \nto make sure we are keeping a flat organization. That flat organization \nis about getting access to as much information as possible.\n  Just as the Intelligence Committee report released by my colleagues \nin the last 10 days showed and just as this 9/11 report shows, the \nthird thing we need to do is make sure we use the information we \nacquire and put much more focus and analysis behind that. While that \nsounds simple and it sounds like something that can be easily \nforgotten, I remind my colleagues that in 1998, ADM David Jeremiah, \nunder a CIA governance order study, was asked the question: Why did the \nCIA miss India's testing of a nuclear bomb? Why did we as a country not \nreally understand that was happening? Well, the No. 1 recommendation \nfrom that report was not enough analysis, and we had a culture that was \nnot really assessing the 21st century threats to our country.\n  That is a report that was done in 1998 about a particular part of \nintelligence, in a particular part of the world, that missed something. \nWe had a report that basically is saying the same things the 9/11 \nreport is saying today, that information and analysis are critical to \nour success on international efforts at understanding information and \npotential threats or use of weapons of mass destruction.\n  To me, it is very important that we take to heart the fact that we \nneed more analysts, and how that analyst structure is going to work. We \nlive in an information age. You can say that terrorists, in their \ndecentralized structure, are going to create much more information \nabout their prospects, their attention to different projects, their \ncommunication with cells across the globe. It is this information that \nwe need to acquire, put together, and have analysts working on, on an \nongoing basis.\n  It is safe to say we need a dramatic increase in the number of \nanalysts that we need to recruit into Government, new processes to put \nthis information into a network, and access and assess it on an ongoing \nbasis. I believe this is going to be a very hard challenge for us in \nCongress because we will see it as something that an agency is assigned \nto do, and we will forget about the challenges that face each of these \nagencies as they change their culture and change their structure.\n  We must keep in mind we are facing a threat of a very decentralized \nnature. To face a threat of a very decentralized nature we must build \norganizations and teams of people, including analysts, who also think \nin a decentralized way.\n  The report also talks about technology and the role that technology \ncan play. I am a big proponent of technology in this information age. \nSomething like a biometric standard on fingerprints and identification \ncan be helpful. The report goes into a great deal of detail about \nimplementing those at borders, at airports, at various other \nfacilities. Yes, I want to expedite the speed and flow of individuals \nin and out of the country and have the United States continue to remain \na great place where people want to visit. But in adopting these \ntechnology solutions, we need to work hard, as the 9/11 report says, to \nmake sure the civil liberties and privacy rights of individuals are \nprotected.\n  The United States has its privileges. The right to privacy is one of \nthose. So we need to work on this recommendation in the report with \nthat in mind. I think the structure within the FBI and Homeland \nSecurity needs to have someone, as these recommendations are \nimplemented, who can--as databases are created, as information is \nassessed--help create the safeguards that are necessary.\n  But that should not impede us from working on an international basis \nto make sure that information about terrorist threats is shared through \nnumerous countries in the world, and shared on a systematic database \nform with the United States. That is where I believe we have been \nlacking since 9/11. We have had a visa program and standard that we set \nin the PATRIOT Act and other bills as an objective. Yet we have failed \nto execute those. We should use this report today to continue our \nsharpened focus on getting that standard implemented so we can be sure \nthe same people, like the 9/11 attackers, are not moving in and out of \nthe country.\n  This report is so critical for us now to join together on these \nspecific recommendations. We must not continue to focus on the past but \nfocus on what we can do to get off of orange alert. It is important \nthat we look at international cooperation, organizations, resources for \nanalysts, new technology, and protecting civil liberties. But as I \nthink about this issue, I think about the significant threats we face \nfrom those asymmetrical forms. Yet the results of those could be very \ncatastrophic. That is why we need to get this program implemented.\n\n  I look to my colleagues, when we return in September, to keep away \nfrom what now has been an analysis of the past and look forward to \nimplementing these solutions as quickly as possible, giving Americans \nbetter security in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Troubling Trends\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise this morning because issues are \nbrought to mind that somehow or other have slipped into the background. \nFor example, look at this morning's Washington Post and see there is \ndisturbing news about the impending retirement of air traffic \ncontrollers. This is a subject I have dealt with, even in my previous \nterms, and certainly in my current term in the Senate, sounding the \nalarm that we are going to be woefully short of people to replace \nretirees. We have to be certain that in the middle of what is an \nimpending crisis because of the lack of skilled professionals in the \ntowers, we do not turn to the subject of commercializing this.\n  We went through an enormous amount of pain and dislocation when we \ntook the baggage screeners out of commercial hands and put them into \nGovernment hands because we knew they would operate more efficiently. \nNow the conversation goes that we are trying as well to go back with \nour screeners and put that function into commercial hands.\n  I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 22, 2004]\n\n                FAA Faces Exodus of Traffic Controllers\n\n                          (By Karin Brulliard)\n\n       Federal officials said yesterday that they are preparing to \n     deal with a nationwide wave of retirements by air traffic \n     controllers over the next decade and that passenger safety \n     will not be jeopardized.\n       Regional officials with the Federal Aviation Administration \n     are gauging how a potential exodus of nearly half the \n     nation's air traffic controllers will affect individual \n     airports, including Reagan National, Dulles International and \n     Baltimore-Washington International, said Doug Simons, manager \n     at National's control tower.\n       ``Neither the FAA nor its controllers will permit the \n     system to operate in ways that are unsafe or with staffing \n     that is inadequate to the task,'' Simons told reporters \n     yesterday. ``We will be there, with the numbers of people we \n     need, everywhere, at all times.''\n       The FAA estimates that nearly half of the nation's 15,000 \n     air traffic controllers will be eligible for retirement \n     before 2013. Many of the potential retirees were hired in \n     1982 after President Ronald Reagan fired more than 11,000 \n     striking members of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers \n     Organization the year before.\n       In the Washington region, nearly 700 air traffic \n     controllers direct more than 3,000 daily flights from six \n     towers and radar centers. Ten percent of those controllers \n     will be eligible to retire in 2006, said FAA spokesman Greg \n     Martin.\n       Paul Rinaldi, alternate vice president of the National Air \n     Traffic Controllers Association's eastern region said at \n     least one-third of the controllers at Dulles and BWI will be \n     eligible to retire or will reach the mandatory retirement age \n     of 56 by 2008.\n       The association has warned in recent weeks that the \n     retirements, if not headed off by aggressive recruiting and \n     increased funding, could cause a controller shortage that \n     would result in chronic flight delays, overstressed \n     controllers and safety risks.\n       If we don't have the adequate number of certified \n     controllers to work this system, basically we're not going to \n     be able . . . to\n\n[[Page S8605]]\n\n     safely meet the needs of the traveler, Rinaldi said.\n       The association, which represents 30,000 controllers \n     nationwide, has called on Congress to appropriate an \n     additional $14 million to the FAA to hire controllers. The \n     current budget is $6.2 billion. To stave off a crisis, at \n     least 1,000 controllers must be hired annually for the next \n     three to five years, Rinaldi said. The FAA hired 762 \n     controller in 2003.\n       The retirements will come at a time when air traffic is \n     expected to increase dramatically because of expanded flight \n     schedules, new budget airlines, and growth in the private and \n     charter plane industrys.\n       A shortage could hit Dulles especially hard. The flight \n     schedule there is expanding rapidly, partly because of the \n     arrival of Independence Air, a discount airline that has been \n     based there since June, Rinaldi said.\n       The FAA says it is uncertain how many new controllers will \n     be needed and which of the nation's 300 air traffic \n     facilities will need them, Simons said. He said the agency is \n     studying the situation at each of the facilities and will \n     deliver a report to Congress in December.\n       In the meantime, the agency said, it is taking steps to \n     stem a potential shortage. It has proposed raising the \n     controller retirement age and is focusing on advancements in \n     technology to help reduce the dependence on air traffic \n     controllers.\n       It is also streamlining controller training, an extensive \n     process that can take up to five years, officials said.\n       ``The task at hand is not simply to hire a number of new \n     controllers, but the right number,'' Simons said.\n       Union representatives say there is no time to wait. Hiring \n     must start now so that enough veteran controllers are still \n     in towers to train recruits, said John Carr, national \n     president of the Air Traffic Controllers Association.\n       ``When it comes to having eyes on the skies, we need help \n     and we need help now,'' Carr said.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That speaks to the leadership we have. We see a \nheadline that says, ``War Funds Dwindling, GAO Warns.'' That is \nterrible. We have spent a ton of money.\n  One thing all of us can agree upon, whether Democrat or Republican, \nis that we want our troops protected. We want them to be able to \nconduct their responsibilities in Iraq and Afghanistan with the best \nequipment they can get. Frankly, I have been looking for some time now \nat a way to compensate these service people for the 90 days of extended \nterm that has been demanded by this administration. I want to get a \n$2,000-a-month extra stipend to help them weather the financial storm.\n  The emotional, family storm is terribly painful. We see an unusual \nnumber of suicides--far greater than we have seen in past wars--because \nof the emotional distress. It is overpowering. Soldiers are away from \ntheir families for a year. They are often people with little children. \nThese are people, largely in the Reserve Corps, who are often young, \nhave young families, and are trying to take care of their family and \nfinancial needs at the same time--paying the mortgage payments, paying \nfor the normal sustenance of life.\n  That could not get heard here. It wasn't allowed to be brought up.\n  There are other things that I consider detrimental to the purported \nsupport we want to give our troops. I agree all of us in this body want \nto do what we can for those who are serving so dutifully and \ncourageously. But we see, no matter what we have allocated, the funds \nare short. We have a lack of sufficient numbers of service people \nthere, and we are trying to find our way out of that. We now find that \na promise made recently that we would go from 130,000 down to 90,000 \nservice people there is now kind of canceled. It has fallen into the \nbackground. We are going to maintain 130,000 people there.\n  I submit that is not enough. We know darned well that is not enough \nbecause all we have to do is look at the casualty count and we see now \nwe have finally gone over 900 dead in Iraq.\n  We see we are miscalculating on all fronts--whether it is financial, \nwhether it is service, whether it is the kind of equipment we should \nhave had early on.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 22, 2004]\n\n                     War Funds Dwindling, GAO Warns\n\n                         (By Jonathan Weisman)\n\n       The U.S. military has spent most of the $65 billion that \n     Congress approved for fighting the wars in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan and is scrambling to find $12.3 billion more from \n     within the Defense Department to finance the wars through the \n     end of the fiscal year, federal investigators said yesterday.\n       The report from the Government Accountability Office, \n     Congress's independent investigative arm, warned that the \n     budget crunch is having an adverse impact on the military as \n     its shifts resources to Iraq and away from training and \n     maintenance in other parts of the world. The study--the most \n     detailed examination to date of the military's funding \n     problems--appears to contradict White House assurances that \n     the services have enough money to get through the calendar \n     year.\n       Already, the GAO said, the services have deferred the \n     repair of equipment used in Iraq, grounded some Air Force and \n     Navy pilots, canceled training exercises and delayed \n     facility-restoration projects. The Air Force is straining to \n     cover the cost of body armor for airmen in combat areas, \n     night-vision gear and surveillance equipment, according to \n     the report.\n       The Army, which is overspending its budget by $10.2 billion \n     for operations and maintenance, is asking the Marines and Air \n     Force to help cover the escalating costs of its logistics \n     contract with Halliburton Co. But the Air Force is also \n     exceeding its budget by $1.4 billion, while the Marines \n     are coming up $500 million short. The Army is even having \n     trouble paying the contractors guarding its garrisons \n     outside the war zones, the report said.\n       White House spokesman Trent Duffy said the Defense \n     Department continues to believe that extra funds will not be \n     needed this fiscal year. President Bush had requested a $25 \n     billion reserve to cover shortfalls that may arise between \n     Oct. 1, when the new fiscal year begins, and February, when \n     the White House plans to submit a detailed funding request \n     for military operations. But for now, Duffy said, there are \n     no plans to tap the reserve. He added: ``This president has \n     said repeatedly the troops will have what they need, when \n     they need it. That's why he has stood steadfastly in support \n     of funding for our troops.''\n       Lt. Col. Rose-Ann Lynch, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon's \n     comptroller, said that though the fiscal 2004 budget is \n     tight, ``the department still anticipates sufficient funding \n     to finance ongoing operations.''\n       Democrats quickly pounced on the report, charging that the \n     Bush administration is turning a blind eye to military \n     funding issues to avoid adding to the overall budget deficit \n     or conceding that the Iraq operations are off-course.\n       ``George W. Bush likes to call himself a wartime president, \n     yet in his role as commander in chief, he has grossly \n     mismanaged the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq,'' \n     contended Mark Kitchens, national security spokesman for \n     Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kerry. ``He went to \n     war without allies, without properly equipping our troops and \n     without a plan to win the peace. Now we find he can't even \n     manage a wartime budget.''\n       The GAO report detailed just why a $65 billion emergency \n     appropriation has proved to be insufficient. When Bush \n     requested that money, the Pentagon assumed that troop levels \n     in Iraq would decline from 130,000 to 99,000 by Sept. 30, \n     that a more peaceful Iraq would allow the use of more cost-\n     effective but slower sea lifts to transport troops and \n     equipment, and that troops rotating in would need fewer \n     armored vehicles than the service members they replace.\n       Instead, troop levels will remain at 138,000 for the \n     foreseeable future, the military is heavily dependent on \n     costly airlifts and the Army's force has actually become more \n     dependent on heavily armored vehicles. The weight of those \n     vehicles, in turn, has contributed to higher-than-anticipated \n     repair and maintenance costs. Higher troop levels have also \n     pushed up the cost of the Pentagon's massive logistical \n     contract with Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root.\n       About 4,000 Navy personnel in Iraq and Kuwait were not \n     expected to be there, contributing to a $931 million hole in \n     the Navy's budget for fiscal 2004. The Marine Corps was \n     supposed to have decreased its presence in Iraq but instead \n     has 26,500 Marines in the country and an additional two \n     expeditionary units supporting the war on terrorism.\n       The strain is beginning to add up, the GAO said. The hard-\n     hit Army faces a $5.3 billion shortfall in funds supporting \n     deployed forces, a $2 billion budget deficit for the \n     refurbishing of equipment used in Iraq and a $753 million \n     deficit in its logistics contract. The Army also needs $800 \n     million more to cover equipment maintenance costs and $650 \n     million to pay contractors guarding garrisons.\n       The Air Force has decreased flying hours for pilots, \n     eliminated some training, slowed civilian hiring and \n     curtailed ``lower priority requirements such as travel, \n     supplies and equipment,'' the report said.\n       The Pentagon comptroller told GAO investigators that the \n     Defense Department has sufficient funds to cover the \n     shortfalls, provided Congress gives officials more authority \n     to transfer money among accounts.\n       But the GAO report warned that there will be a serious \n     downside to that approach, especially the deferral of \n     maintenance and refurbishing plans until next year.\n       ``We believe that the deferral of these activities will add \n     to the requirements that will need to be funded in fiscal \n     year 2005 and potentially later years and could result in a \n     `bow wave' effect in future years,'' the report cautioned. \n     ``Activities that are deferred also run the risk of costing \n     more in future years.''\n       A ``bow wave'' refers to a time when deferred costs \n     confront Congress all at once, making it impossible to meet \n     the demands.\n\n\n[[Page S8606]]\n\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. When I look at the morning paper, I see examples of \nwhat the administration has failed to do. Look at the status of things \nin Washington, DC. I assume it is a representative city of urban \ncenters across the country. We see the DC gap in wealth is growing.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that article entitled ``D.C. Gap In \nWealth Growing'' printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 22, 2004]\n\n                       D.C. Gap in Wealth Growing\n\n\n                  Uneducated Suffer Most, Study Shows\n\n                            (By D'Vera Cohn)\n\n       The gap between rich and poor is as great in the District \n     as in any other major city and has grown more here than in \n     most places, a widening chasm that troubles government \n     leaders.\n       A study to be released today by the D.C. Fiscal Policy \n     Institute said the top 20 percent of the city's households \n     have 31 times the average income of the 20 percent at the \n     bottom. The gap in the District is fed by extremes at both \n     ends: The poor have less average income than in most of the \n     country's 40 biggest cities, and the rich have more.\n       The persistent gap between rich and poor has been fueling \n     debate over whether the national economic recovery is helping \n     all Americans. The study deepens the picture of an \n     increasingly fractured city, where poverty and wealth both \n     grew in the last decade. The average household income for the \n     top group was $186,830, and the average income for the \n     poorest group was $6,126.\n       ``The rich got richer and the poor didn't get richer,'' \n     said Stephen Fuller, a regional economist at George Mason \n     University in Fairfax. ``The poor can't afford to get out of \n     Washington to the suburbs. . . . Our wealthy class got \n     wealthier in the 1990s, and it didn't trickle down to the \n     bottom.''\n       The new report identifies the District, Atlanta and Miami \n     as the big U.S. cities with the largest income gaps.\n       Another recent analysis, by the Lewis Mumford Center at the \n     State University of New York at Albany, found that the \n     District now ranks higher among economically polarized cities \n     than it did in 1990. The analysis, by Brian Stults, a \n     sociology professor at the University of Florida, employed a \n     standard technique to analyze income inequality and ranked \n     the District among the five big cities with the largest gap \n     between rich and poor.\n       The D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute study measured 1999 \n     income, but a co-author, Ed Lazere, said the income gap is \n     not likely to have closed since then. Nationally, the gap \n     between rich and poor widened from the 1970s until the early \n     1990s, and has inched up slightly since.\n       The trend, experts say, reflects a growing gap in wages \n     between skilled, educated workers and those with no skills, \n     as well as social changes such as a growing number of single \n     parents, who have lower incomes than married couples. \n     Although some gap is expected, they see the trend as a \n     disturbing reflection of an economy in which people without \n     college educations will be stuck at the bottom.\n       The city's richest and poorest households could not be more \n     different, according to Lazere's analysis. Half of the \n     richest households, with incomes starting at $89,814, are \n     married. Among the poorest, where incomes topped out at \n     $14,000, six in 10 were single, living alone. Single mothers \n     accounted for less than 10 percent of the richest households, \n     and more than a quarter of the poorest ones. Nearly all the \n     working-age adults held jobs in the richest households, but \n     only about half did in the poorest ones.\n       Using numbers from another census survey, Lazere's study \n     calculated that the incomes of the city's richest households \n     rose 38 percent over the decade, while those of the poorest \n     went up 3 percent.\n       Tony Bullock, a spokesman for Mayor Anthony A. Williams \n     (D), said the gap is the product of complex forces, including \n     poor city services and poor schooling, that have persisted \n     for decades and cannot be fixed overnight.\n       ``We have a large concentration of poverty where no matter \n     what we seem to do to bring investment into the District, a \n     certain population is not able to access the kind of \n     employment opportunities that come from a growing tax base,'' \n     he said. ``But it is our hope that we can improve in the \n     future.''\n       Bullock said the attractiveness of the city to high-income \n     households is good for its tax base, and the study agreed. It \n     said high-income families in the Washington region are more \n     likely to live in the city than are affluent families in most \n     other big metro areas.\n       Those at the top benefit from the District's unique job \n     bank of high-paid employment related to the federal \n     government, including lobbying and contracting. A single \n     young professional can earn $100,000 in his or her first year \n     out of law school.\n       At the other end of the income scale, Lazere's study said, \n     the D.C. minimum wage, $6.15 an hour, is worth less when \n     inflation is taken into account than it was worth in 1979. \n     The purchasing power of the city's maximum welfare benefit--\n     $379 for a family of three--fell by nearly a third over the \n     decade, it said.\n       A bill co-sponsored by D.C. Council members David A. \n     Catania (R-At Large) and Sandy Allen (D-Ward 8) would raise \n     the D.C. minimum wage to $6.60 an hour next year and to $7 an \n     hour by January 2006. It would be the first increase since \n     1997 in the D.C. minimum wage, which is set at $1 above the \n     federal level. Catania said yesterday that he is confident \n     that it will pass, and that he also wants the city to beef up \n     its training programs for less-skilled workers.\n       ``I don't want to focus so much on income disparity,'' he \n     said. ``The government should focus more on how to lift these \n     workers out of poverty and help them make better wages.''\n       Lazere said he is concerned that the mayor's efforts to \n     boost the city's population by 100,000 over the next decade \n     and attract high-income residents could squeeze out the poor \n     through gentrification if the city does not expand its \n     assistance to low-income workers.\n       ``At the high end, the city already is attractive.'' he \n     said. ``Specific policies to attract more high-income \n     families may not be needed and may exacerbate the problems \n     for our neediest residents.''\n\n                               INCOME GAP\n [The income gap between the richest and poorest households is at least\n as wide in the District as in the nation's other big cities, according\n to a new study by the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute. The average income\n of the city's richest households was about 31 times that of the poorest\n                                ones.\\1\\]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         Average                Ratio of\n                                         income      Average    highest\n            Rank and city                bottom    income top  income to\n                                        fifth of    fifth of     lowest\n                                       households  households    income\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Fiscal Policy Institute. The\n  difference between D.C., Atlanta and Miami may not be statistically\n  significant.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If you look at the chart and see what has happened in \nterms of the difference in the wage scales, it is atrocious.\n  The wage scale gap at the top of the ladder goes up $186,000 and the \npeople at the bottom of the ladder are at $6,000. Once again, we see a \nfailure of responsibility.\n  I see on television a message that says, ``My name is George W. Bush \nand I approve of this message.'' We see talk about the number of votes \nJohn Kerry has missed but we don't see in the same message what John \nKerry did when he was in Vietnam. Even though he disagreed with the \nwar, he went there and served bravely. He got three Purple Hearts, a \nBronze Star, and a Silver Star--medals of bravery. One of the instances \nthat got him that medal was pulling out of the water one of his \ncolleagues who was practically drowning as bullets were flying \noverhead. He stopped that boat he was in command of and pulled his \nfriend and subordinate out of the water. We don't see that. Instead, it \nsays John Kerry missed these votes.\n  Yes. John Kerry is a man who is always devoted to duty. Right now \nwhat he is doing is important. All of us think the votes are very \nimportant here, but very often these votes are already predetermined by \nthe numbers in the majority and the numbers in the minority--not that \nwe should miss votes. But he has a more important task. He has a task \nof changing the leadership in this country and making sure we are \npaying attention to our responsibilities to the community at large and \nnot just to a particular moment in time but, rather, in the total \npicture of leadership.\n  In my view, it is not how one runs government. What we see is a \nquestion of leadership in the administration--the question of \nleadership of President Bush and Vice President Cheney. If you look at \ntheir prior leadership positions, you will see similar problems.\n  For instance, take Vice President Cheney's recent leadership of \nHalliburton. How did he transform that company?\n  My experience in the corporate world was a very good experience. I, \nwith two other fellows--all three of us coming from poor homes, two \nbrothers--started a business over 50 years ago. It was a very small \nbusiness in its beginning days. We had a few dollars of borrowed \nmoney--not much. We started a business that never looked like it was\n\n[[Page S8607]]\n\ngoing to mature. It took us 12 years to get to the stage where we could \napply computer technology to our business. Today that company we \nstarted--three poor kids with no resources to begin with--has over \n40,000 employees and the longest growth record of any company in \nAmerica, a growth of 10 percent each and every year for 42 years in a \nrow. We grew at 10-percent earnings each and every year. It is \nremarkable.\n  I give that background not to boast but, rather, to try to make a \npoint, the point being that there is a culture associated with our \ncompany--a culture, I am proud to say, has never been challenged in \nover 50 years of business, a culture that says whatever we do we have \nto be honest with our customers, honest with our employees, honest with \nour shareholders, and honest with the public at large. That sets the \ncorporate culture. It tells you how we want that company to operate.\n  A CEO has an impact on a company that should endure beyond his or her \nyears of service. I want to use that example to reflect on what has \nhappened with Halliburton, one of America's largest companies.\n  In the wake of early leadership, Halliburton has been associated with \nbribes, kickbacks, violating terrorist sanctions laws, and sweetheart, \nno-bid Government deals. It doesn't sound very pretty, and it is not.\n  To make matters worse, Vice President Cheney still receives salary \nchecks from Halliburton for well over $150,000 each and every year. It \nhas been 4 years now, somewhere around $700,000. He still holds over \n400,000 unexercised Halliburton stock options. They are exercisable to \n2009. He left the company 4 years ago. If the administration continues \nits service, he will have 4 more years. That is 2008, by my count. But \nthe options exercise in 2009.\n  It is unconscionable that he would have a financial association with \nthis company that disgraced corporate leadership in a time of war.\n  When I was in the Army a long time ago, I enlisted in 1942. I was 18 \nyears old. During that period of time that America was fighting for its \nlife, it was unthinkable that a company could profiteer while a war was \ngoing on; unthinkable. It would have been considered traitorous \nbehavior.\n  But here we are in a session where the Vice President is undermining \nour Nation's ethical credibility here and abroad.\n  On September 14, 2003, the Vice President was asked about his \nrelationship with Halliburton and the no-bid contracts on ``Meet the \nPress.'' This is what triggered my interest. I listened very carefully, \nbecause I have respect for the office, and I think Dick Cheney is \nsomeone who wants to do the right thing but it has hasn't come out that \nway. Vice President Cheney told Tim Russert:\n\n       I have severed all of my ties with the company, gotten rid \n     of all of my financial interest. I have no financial interest \n     in Halliburton of any kind and haven't had now for over 3 \n     years.\n\n  There is a problem with that statement. When he said it, he held over \n400,000 Halliburton stock options and continued to receive a deferred \nsalary from the company.\n  In fairness, the Vice President has said, well, this is insured \nincome, took out an insurance policy not dependent on the operating \nresults of Halliburton. I take him at his word. He said he is going to \ngive profits away from the stock option exercise to charitable \ninstitutions, philanthropic institutions.\n  But it is better for him if the company does well. He has these \noptions, and even if he wants to give away the profits, the more \nprofits the better if you look at the institutes he is giving the \nprofits to. But he does hold 433,000 unexercised Halliburton stock \noptions. Even though most of the exercise prices are above the current \nmarket price, the majority of the options, as I mentioned earlier, \nextend to 2009.\n  Any optionholder has to hope that the stock price will surge relative \nto the value of the options in excess. One way it can happen is to be \nsure that lucrative contracts keep coming from whatever source, whoever \nthe customer is. In this case, the customer is the U.S. Government, and \nit is happening.\n  In the first quarter of 2004, Halliburton's revenues were up 80 \npercent from the first quarter of 2003. Why? Wall Street analysts point \nto one simple factor--the company's massive Government contracts in \nIraq.\n  In addition, as I said, to the stock options, Vice President Cheney \ncontinues to receive a deferred salary. Halliburton has paid the Vice \nPresident a salary of at least $150,000 a year since he has been Vice \nPresident of the United States. I think it is wrong and it ought to \nstop.\n  I heard the Vice President's defense: The deal was locked in in 1999; \nthere was no way for him to get out of his deferred salary deal. That \nis not so. A little checking of the facts shows otherwise. I have \nobtained the terms of Vice President Cheney's deferred salary contract \nwith Halliburton. The bottom line is that the deferred salary agreement \nwas not set in stone.\n  In fact, one need only look at the ethics agreement of Treasury \nSecretary Snow to see what the Vice President should have done in order \nto avoid taking the salary from a private corporation while in public \noffice. Secretary Snow took six different deferred compensation \npackages as a lump sum upon taking office. The Vice President is not a \nvictim of Halliburton's generosity. He could have attempted to take the \ndeferred salary as a lump sum.\n  In the meantime, what has happened to Vice President Cheney's former \ncompany? For starters, Halliburton overcharged the Pentagon a $27.4 \nmillion fee for meals served to troops abroad. The company billed \ntaxpayers for meals never served to our troops. This is not Senator \nLautenberg's concoction. These are the facts printed in news media, \nprinted in contract agreements, printed in Pentagon papers.\n  Another Pentagon investigation is continuing after an audit found \nHalliburton overcharged the Army by $61 million for gasoline delivered \nto Iraq as part of its no-bid contract to operate Iraq's oil industry.\n  Now whistleblowers, former Halliburton employees, have revealed \nHalliburton employees would abandon $85,000 trucks because of flat \ntires--do not bother to fix them, get rid of it--or the need for an oil \nchange. Dump the truck; we can bill the taxpayers. The whistleblowers \nalso said Halliburton spent $45 for 30 canned cases of soda when local \nKuwaiti supermarkets charged about $7. Halliburton has a cost-plus \ncontract so they get reimbursed for their spending plus a calculated \npercentage of profit. That system is being heartily abused and is \ncosting taxpayers a lot of money.\n  In my view, Halliburton is a company that suffers from failures in \nleadership, the same type of leadership that continues.\n  These overcharges are confirmed when the Pentagon, the Department of \nDefense, is refusing to pay bills of $160 million comprised of the \nelements I talked about. The auditors at the Pentagon said, Don't pay \nthem; we do not owe that kind of money.\n  Those are overcharges, Mr. President.\n  In the meanwhile, we see the attack on Senator Kerry, our colleague. \nThey are saying he has misplaced priorities; he missed votes in the \nSenate. What they are unwilling to admit is Senator Kerry and all of us \nare on a critical mission such as those he took on in Vietnam. What he \nis doing is not purposeless, it is not something to be made fun of. He \nis working for a safer, stronger America at home and respect for us \nacross the world.\n  I wish President Bush would talk about the things he did or failed to \ndo and that he would want to correct, such as protecting the purchasing \npower of working families, eliminating the creation of larger and \nlarger deficits, protecting the solvency of Medicare, now estimated to \nbe insolvent in 2019.\n  How about the costs of gasoline to the average person in this country \nsince this administration has taken over? And $2.40 a gallon is not \nunusual for high test; $2.19 for regular gas is not unusual. I don't \nhear the President saying he wants to correct that problem.\n  No, he would rather try to say John Kerry deserted his \nresponsibilities, he is soft on defense. He received three Purple \nHearts. Citizens do not get Purple Hearts for nothing. They even wanted \nto challenge the depth of one wound to see whether it was deserving of \na Purple Heart.\n\n  Look at the cost of prescription drugs. Where are we going with that \nif drug prices go higher and higher? But\n\n[[Page S8608]]\n\nwe do not hear any protest. As a matter of fact, we had a Medicare bill \nthat says within its content that Medicare is forbidden to negotiate \nwith the drug companies to try to get a lower price because of the huge \nvolume of purchasing for Medicare beneficiaries. The VA negotiates drug \nprices and it brings the prices way down, much lower, 20, 30 percent \nlower than those the Medicare beneficiaries pay.\n  How about improving the job market? We see what is happening in the \nstock market. If that is to be a barometer of where we are going, it is \na terrible indication. The market has been reeling from shock and in an \nawesome decline from where it was. This market that was supposed to be \nmaking everybody, the pensioners and the mutual funds and the \ninvestors, happy is not doing so.\n  We should be hearing from President Bush about what he is going to do \nto correct the problems so worrisome to American families today: \nwhether they can afford their mortgage, whether they can afford to \neducate their kids, whether they can afford to take care of a \ngrandparent, if necessary, whether they could guarantee that someone \nwho can learn can get an education. Those are the things we would like \nto hear.\n  Stop this insidious criticism, personal criticism, of Senator John \nKerry. Look at John Kerry's record and look at the record of this \nadministration. What a comparison that is. The Nation is tired of \nhearing this negative stuff. Talk about positive things. Talk about \nwhat you are going to do for America, not about what the other guy \nfailed to do. Talk about what you failed to do and are ready to \ncorrect.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1039\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to legislative session to consider S. 1039, the Wastewater \nTreatment Works Security Act of 2003, that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, and that the Senate return to executive session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend restate the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator asks for a restatement of the \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, please.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Of course.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nlegislative session to consider S. 1039, the Wastewater Treatment Works \nSecurity Act of 2003, that the bill be read a third time and passed, \nand that the Senate return to executive session.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, in committee \nI voted for this matter, to have it reported out. The ranking member, \nSenator Jeffords, did not, as did a number of other people who are in \nthe minority. Their belief is this bill does not require wastewater \nsystems to do basic tasks such as even completing a vulnerability \nassessment. Senator Jeffords believes this legislation is a step \nbackward from existing law for drinking water plants and what we have \nagreed to already for chemical plants. So because of that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to at least mention this is a \nbill that is in the committee I chair. It is one that has been \nrequested by virtually every community we have in Oklahoma. In fact, \nthe Senator who is presiding right now was a cosponsor of this bill. It \npassed the committee by a vote of 12 to 6. It passed the House of \nRepresentatives, once on a voice vote and the second time by a vote of \n413 to 2--413 to 2. Virtually every Republican and Democrat voted for \nit. In fact, every Democrat voted for it. Only two Republicans did not \nvote for it. The House cosponsors include Congressman Jim Oberstar.\n  Wastewater treatment works are responsible for treating municipal and \nindustrial waste to a level clean enough to be released into the \nNation's waterways. I have to say, I cannot think of any one bill that \nmeans more to local communities. Having been a mayor of a major \ncommunity at one time, this is a very critical bill. It is one I am \nhoping there will be no objection to when we come back from this recess \nin September.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         9/11 Commission Report\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to comment about the 9/\n11 Commission report. I think it is an excellent report. Its \nrecommendations ought to be implemented and they ought to be \nimplemented soon by the Congress. Given the fact that we are near \ngridlock in an election season and it is very unlikely in September \nwhen we come back from the August recess we will get anything done, I \nthink we ought to consider coming back after the election and \nimplementing the recommendations of the report. Why? Because the only \nway we protect ourselves from the enemies whom we call terrorists is to \nhave accurate and timely information.\n  The terrorist uses surprise and stealth, and the only way to defeat \nthat is by having accurate and timely intelligence.\n  So whatever we need to do to avoid the colossal intelligence failure \nwe had on September 11 and the colossal intelligence failure we had \nagain prior to going into Iraq, we best get about the job of correcting \nthat information gathering, information flow, and information analysis \nso we can try to continue to thwart the attempts at doing damage to us.\n  Is it not interesting what the 9/11 Commission report said? It \nspecifically defined the terrorist as someone who is usually an \nIslamist fundamentalist who has warped the teachings of Islam so that \nit becomes a passion of hatred, and out of that wanting to do damage to \nthe free world. Of course, we being the superpower are the target of \nthat.\n  It was also noteworthy in the Commission's report, as they are \nsuggesting how to restructure the intelligence apparatus, they have \nsuggested having a national intelligence director and that the \ncounterterrorism center would be a compendium that would report to him. \nIt is also interesting that they still wanted to keep the \nadministration of intelligence gathering and analysis from direct \npolitical involvement. So the Commission did not recommend the new \nintelligence chief be a member of the President's Cabinet but rather be \nwhat they have defined as the National Intelligence Director. Then in \nall of these subdepartments that have a myriad of filling out a flow \nchart, an organizational chart, it is interesting how all of the \ndifferent components of intelligence, the CIA, the DIA, the FBI, would \nthen fit together into this new apparatus.\n  We only have to remember that about a month ago we had another major \ninformation failure, and this was at the time of President Reagan's \nfuneral. We had the Governor of Kentucky on his State airplane, having \nbeen given clearance by the FAA to come in and land at Washington \nNational Airport, and his transponder was not working. He had been \ngiven clearance by the FAA, but the FAA was not communicating with the \nmilitary. So the military, seeing a blip on the radar moving to the \ncenter of Washington, without a transponder, sent out the alert and, of \ncourse, everybody in this U.S. Capitol building and in all of those \noffice buildings off to the side of this building got the emergency \nevacuate order, so much so that the Capitol Police, bless their hearts, \nwere shouting at the top of their lungs, get out of the building, run, \nthere is an inbound aircraft.\n\n[[Page S8609]]\n\n  So how many more of these do we need to have before we come to the \ncommonsense reality that we are not collating and coordinating all of \nthis information like we ought to? So, we best get on the process of \nreforming the system.\n  Now we have a good blueprint with which to do it. We have an \nopportunity to make America safer--and, with our allies, quite a bit.\n  That leads me to the next subject I want to talk about, our allies. \nThe 9/11 Commission report also says something that many of us in this \nChamber have been saying for some period of time: You can't go out and \nbe successful in the war on terror until you can bring in a lot of \ncolleagues, a lot of allies, in a coordinated and planned effort so you \ninternationalize the effort. We did that brilliantly 13 years ago in \nthe gulf war. We did that again brilliantly in Afghanistan when we \nstarted going after bin Laden. But we didn't do that in Iraq. \nEspecially, we didn't do it in Iraq after a brilliant military victory. \nWe didn't do it in the occupation.\n  What the 9/11 Commission is pointing out is that if you want to \nimprove the intelligence-gathering mechanism and analysis, then you \nhave to internationalize the effort. That stands to reason.\n  Fortunately, through Interpol and direct one-to-one relationships \nwith other countries' intelligence services, we get a lot of that \ninformation. But as the 9/11 Commission said, we have to do a lot more.\n  The 9/11 Commission also told us something that we didn't know. It \nsaid the country of Iran may have facilitated al-Qaida. It did not \nsuggest that Iran's Government knew anything about the planning for the \nSeptember 11 attack, but it suggested that some of those operatives \npassed through Iran.\n  There have been a number of us in this body who have been talking \nabout Iran; that after September 11, and the importance of going after \nal-Qaida, that the next imminent threat to the interest of the United \nStates were the countries of Iran and North Korea. Why? Because they \nare trying to acquire or already are building nuclear capability. \nTherefore, I think it is very important that we get our act together \nand implement this Commission report for many reasons. That is just one \nadditional reason.\n  I see the esteemed chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nhas come into the Chamber. I want to say in his presence, as he knows, \nas one of the members of his committee, on a completely different \nsubject, I have spoken out time and time again about the plight and the \ndetermination to find some evidence about CAPT Scott Speicher, the Navy \npilot who was shot down on the first night of the gulf war in 1991.\n  There is a report in the Washington Times--and I will make reference \ndirectly only to what is reported in today's Washington Times--and what \nthe Washington Times says is that a Speicher team has left and has \ngiven up the search. I hope that is not true. The family who lives in \nmy State, in Jacksonville, FL, deserves to have closure. The family has \nbeen through a trauma like hardly any of us could believe. The \nWashington Times gives a great deal of detail. I don't know if it is \ntrue or not, but if it is, then what this country owes to that family \nis to keep searching. If a team has been returned, as the Washington \nTimes has stated, then it is important that whatever the size of that \nteam, that we have a presence. As long as the U.S. military is located \nthere, a fallen flier in the future will always have the confidence to \nknow we are not going to leave him or her there alone, and we are \ncoming to get you. We didn't do that with Scott Speicher.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. First and foremost, I can't comment on the Washington \nTimes article. But yesterday, in the course of an Armed Services \nCommittee briefing by General Dayton, who at this point in time is also \nbriefing the Senate Intelligence Committee--and I just left the \nIntelligence Committee meeting to come to the floor--the matter was \ndiscussed. That much I will confirm, as appropriate. As a member of the \nCommittee of the Armed Services, my able friend knows that at every \njuncture our committee, largely through yourself and Senator Roberts \nmost often, brings up a current report on that.\n\n  I will not say, other than it was a matter that was discussed, and \nGeneral Dayton shared with us his views. But I wish to point out, in \ndiscussing it with General Dayton, he finds that whatever was carried \ntoday, reflects it as his views, and he simply wants to say the final \ndecision rests with the Secretary of the Navy, not General Dayton, as \nto the course of this investigation. So that much I will say. Beyond \nthat, I believe, regrettably, it was a top secret briefing, but \nnevertheless information might well have gotten out. That is \nregrettable.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing it up. I, too, join you in fervently \nwishing and praying for Scott Speicher. The Senator has to be commended \nfor the amount of time he has spent on this situation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank my colleague, my esteemed chairman. I \nam a devoted member of his committee, under his leadership. I thank the \nSenator from Virginia for all the personal encouragement he has given \nto me as we have relentlessly kept after this, trying to find some \nevidence.\n  I do want to say, since my colleague mentioned General Dayton, I \nthink he performed magnificently. He, of course, had many other \nresponsibilities other than just the search for CAPT Speicher. He had \nall the responsibilities of the search for weapons of mass destruction. \nBut he had a special team that was led by Major Eames, who has now been \npromoted to lieutenant colonel. That young officer was as devoted as \nany that I could ever imagine in the search, when I visited with him in \nhis headquarters in Baghdad. At the time we had actually gone to one of \nthe cells where we thought maybe it was Scott Speicher's initials on \nthe wall, having been scratched into the stucco: MSS.\n  All those leads did not pan out. But there are other leads they need \nto follow. It is my hope the U.S. military will continue to do that, \neven though General Dayton is not in Iraq anymore, and he deserves to \nbe home. Even though Colonel Eames is not in Iraq.\n  If those leads would be continued, Colonel Eames would, in fact, be \nback in Iraq in a heartbeat, following up that new information.\n  I want to take the occasion of reminding the Senate that this Senator \nwill continue to speak out on this issue, to remind the U.S. military \nof its obligation to continue to search for evidence so the case of \nScott Speicher can be brought to closure.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my colleague. He has worked very \nhard on the Speicher case and undoubtedly his commitment will carry \nforward. I suggest, based on what was said yesterday, that he will be \nin consultation with the Secretary of the Navy. He has the authority to \nmake disclosures as he sees fit about this case, but I believe General \nDayton, in a very professional and conscientious way, will discharge \nhis duties.\n\n\n                       The 9/11 Commission Report\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to provide this Senator's \nobservations, very preliminary though they may be, with regard to the \nreport of the 9/11 Commission which was made public today.\n  Yesterday I joined about a dozen or so Senators, the distinguished \nmajority leader, and others to receive a brief private briefing. That \nwas our first official glimpse of this report. I have not had the \nopportunity to, of course, go through this rather prodigious volume--\neach Member received a copy--but I do intend to do so because I think \nit is a very important contribution by this Commission. I think many \nparts of it can provide a roadmap for things that must be done.\n  It has been my privilege to serve in the Senate--this is my 26th \nyear, and I commit to work with other colleagues, all colleagues, to \nsee what we can do to strengthen our ability, not only in intelligence, \nbut across the board in all areas of national security.\n  As privileged as I am to be the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I am prepared to listen to how the responsibilities of that \ncommittee should be changed for the better. I will not participate in \nany obstruction simply because of turf. I have been here too long. \nAlso, this changed\n\n[[Page S8610]]\n\nworld in which we live is so very different than when I came to this \ninstitution a quarter of a century ago, and most particularly in the \naftermath of the tragedy of 9/11.\n  So I think it is incumbent upon all of us in the Congress and, \nindeed, the executive branch to have a strong self-examination of the \nareas covered by this report; to use this report, along with input from \nother commissions, groups, and individuals, as a sort of roadmap to \nguide us into those areas which need to be carefully reviewed.\n  Out of that process, which I hope is a carefully thought through, not \nrushed, deliberative process, I hope will evolve such changes as we, \nCongress, deem necessary to strengthen our capability to deter and, if \nnecessary, engage further in this war against terrorism. So, therefore, \nI say with respect, I welcome the recommendations of the Commission. I \ncommit to study them and commit to work with my colleagues.\n  Yesterday a specific question was put to the two cochairmen of the 9/\n11 Commission: Is America safer today? And their unhesitating \nacknowledgment was it is safer today, and I agree it is. Is it as safe \nas we need? None of us believe that. But I think conscientious efforts \nhave been made all along the way to make this a safer Nation, and we \nhave, in large measure, succeeded with the goals within the timetable \nwe have had.\n  I am disappointed, however, that there was not more thorough dialog \nbetween the 9/11 Commission and Members of the Congress. I do not take \nthat personally. I did have an opportunity to visit in my office some 2 \nweeks ago--a very pleasant visit--with one member, at which time we \nexchanged views. Somehow I do not feel that was the type of \nconsultation that enabled us to get into the report and make \nconstructive contributions. I do not suggest all 535 Members of \nCongress troop up before the 9/11 Commission. We do not have time to do \nthat. Somehow it seems to me a better balance could have been struck \nbetween the knowledge and the ideas we have in the institution of the \nlegislative branch of our Government that could have been shared with \nthis Commission. After all, the Commission was, in many respects, \ncreated as a consequence of the actions of Congress.\n  Having said that, I am going to take some specific issue with this \nrather sweeping indictment that we have been dysfunctional in our \noversight.\n  All throughout my public service, I have been privileged to have a \nnumber of jobs, and I am very humble about it, but I am far from \nperfect, and I have always welcomed constructive advice and criticism. \nBut this time this dysfunctional brush that was wiped across struck me \nas not fair to certain things I personally have a knowledge of that \nwere done by this body, the Senate.\n\n  I will start back some years ago in 1987 when, as a member of the \nArmed Services Committee, we structured the Goldwater-Nichols \nlegislation which had sweeping ramifications in our overall defense \nsetup. It has been hailed since that period of time as a landmark \nachievement by the Congress to begin to transform our military from the \ncold war era to the era of the threats today which are so diverse and \nso different as compared to those we confronted during World War II and \nin the immediate aftermath of the cold war.\n  That was quite an accomplishment and, in large measure, is owing to \nSenator Goldwater and Congressman Nichols. Again, I had the privilege \nto serve with those two men for many years, long before we started the \nGoldwater-Nichols Act.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee--and I say with humility \nand personal pride, I was a close personal friend of Senator Goldwater. \nI admired him so much and looked forward to the times we worked \ntogether and traveled together. I remember Congressman Nichols bore the \nscars of World War II, having been a very courageous serviceperson in \nthat war. He was extremely conscientious about his duties on the House \nArmed Services Committee. These two giants in the way of thinking got \ntogether and relentlessly drove this legislation through both bodies of \nthe Congress, and it has withstood the test of time.\n  Contemporaneous with this, I remember my dear friend with whom I came \nto the Senate, Senator Cohen, who later became, after he resigned from \nthe Senate, Secretary of Defense. We worked together as a team with \nothers to carve out of the Department of Defense, taking from the Army, \nthe Navy, the Air Force, and the Marines some of the best and the \nbrightest to create the Special Operations Command.\n  While today most colleagues have seen their magnificent performance \nworldwide, particularly as a front line against terrorism, I remind \nthem it was a tough and long struggle, vigorously resisted by the \nDepartment of Defense, to create this new entity and to give them their \ndedicated assets of modest naval vessels, modest number of airplanes, \nand other equipment which was their own. But we succeeded. Today those \nforces have established themselves in the contemporary military history \nof this country as an essential part of our military structure, much \nadmired by all, much envied by all, and their performance record is \nsecond to none. I do not mean to suggest by that they have outpaced or \noutperformed the basic elements, particularly combat-committed elements \nof the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. No, it is that the whole \nmilitary looks with a sense of pride toward their accomplishments. I am \nproud to have been a part of establishing this important part of our \narmed forces.\n  Then in 1999, when I was privileged for the first time to become \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I went in there and I \nchanged basically a structure that had been in place for decades, the \nsubcommittee structure. Again, I carved out a new subcommittee called \nSubcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. This is 1999. This \nis not in the aftermath of 9/11. This is 1999.\n  I must say, I have had the constructive support of the members of the \ncommittee, and by pure coincidence--I am speaking of the Subcommittee \non Emerging Threats and Capabilities--the first chairman of that \nsubcommittee, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, just \nwalked into the Chamber, and perhaps he will have a word or two about \nthe functions of that subcommittee.\n  Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague, I was saying the \n9/11 Commission has brushed the Congress as being sort of \ndysfunctional, and I was going back in history. The Senator from Kansas \nwas one of my principal supporters on establishing the Subcommittee on \nEmerging Threats and Capabilities. He has been ranking member or \nchairman of that subcommittee, and under his leadership and that of the \nfull committee, we have achieved a great deal, and have helped the \nDepartment of Defense move forward in the areas of joint \nexperimentation, homeland defense, counterterrorism, and future \ntechnologies and concepts that will be needed to confront future \nthreats.\n  That subcommittee was directed to look forward a decade and determine \nwhat are the threats that are going to face the United States of \nAmerica and how best our Department of Defense needs to transform \nitself and allocate assets and men and women to take up the positions \nof responsibility to meet those threats.\n  That subcommittee has done its work and done it admirably and has \nmeasurably enhanced the overall strength of our military today.\n  My distinguished colleague, Senator Roberts from Kansas, is chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee. I am privileged to serve on that \ncommittee today. In years past, I was privileged to serve 8 years. We \nhave this rotation in the Senate, and this is my second tour on that \ncommittee. When I was vice chairman, together with other members of \nthat committee, we fought hard against the cuts in intelligence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that portions of the minority view report be \nprinted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nMinority Views of Senators Warner, Danforth, Stevens, Lugar, and Wallop\n\n       The United States must maintain and strengthen U.S. \n     intelligence capabilities to provide for the future security \n     of the Nation and for the protection of its interests around \n     the globe. The U.S. should commit more resources to \n     achievement of that objective than the fiscal year 1994 \n     intelligence authorization bill reported by the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence would provide.\n\n[[Page S8611]]\n\n       The U.S. faced grave security risks during the Cold War, \n     but it faced them in an international environment that was \n     comparatively stable and predictable. With the end of the \n     Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union and its \n     Warsaw Pact military alliance, the U.S. had hoped for a ``New \n     World Order'' with stable and steady progress toward greater \n     democracy, freedom and free enterprise. What the U.S. faces \n     in the post-Cold War era, however, is a more chaotic \n     environment with multiple challenges to U.S. interests that \n     complicate the efforts of the U.S. and cooperating nations to \n     achieve the desired progress. In an unstable world of diverse \n     and increasing challenges, the need for robust and reliable \n     U.S. intelligence capabilities has grown rather than \n     diminished.\n       America faces a world in which:\n       Ethnic, religious and social tensions spawn regional \n     conflicts;\n       A number of nations possess nuclear weapons and the means \n     to deliver them on a target;\n       Other nations seek nuclear, chemical or biological weapons \n     of mass destruction and the means to deliver them;\n       Terrorist organizations continue to operate and attack U.S. \n     interests (including here at home, as the bombing of the \n     World Trade Center in New York reflects);\n       International drug organizations continue on a vast scale \n     to produce illegal drugs and smuggle them into the U.S.; and\n       U.S. economic interests are under constant challenge.\n       The United States continues to have a vital interest in \n     close monitoring of developments in the independent republics \n     on the territory of the former Soviet Union. The U.S. \n     Government needs accurate and timely intelligence on the \n     nuclear arsenals, facilities and materials located in Russia, \n     Ukraine and other republics; the economic and military \n     restructuring in the republics; and the ethnic, religious and \n     other social turmoil and secessionist pressures in the \n     republics.\n       To the extent that the end of the Cold War allows a \n     reduction of U.S. resources devoted to intelligence \n     capabilities focused on military capabilities of countries on \n     the territory of the former Soviet Union, the U.S. should \n     reallocate the gained resources to strengthen intelligence \n     capabilities to deal with growing risks to America's \n     interests. The U.S. should make such resources available for \n     strengthened intelligence capabilities focused on the \n     problems with which the U.S. Government must deal in the \n     coming decades, including proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, terrorism, international narcotics \n     trafficking, and the illegal transfer of U.S. high \n     technology. In many intelligence disciplines, investment \n     in research and development is needed now to yield \n     intelligence capabilities a decade from now. Absent needed \n     investment, capabilities will not be available when needed \n     and existing capabilities will erode.\n       At the same time as risks to U.S. interest grow, U.S. \n     military power will decline as the U.S. draws down \n     substantially the size of its armed forces following victory \n     in the Cold War. With a diverse and growing array of risks to \n     U.S. interests and a reduced commitment of resources to the \n     Nation's defense, the U.S. will grow increasingly dependent \n     for its security and the protection of its interests abroad \n     upon its intelligence capabilities--the Nation's eyes and \n     ears. Indeed, the substantial cuts of recent years in defense \n     budgets have been premised directly upon the strengthening of \n     intelligence support to the remaining, smaller armed forces. \n     Reducing the Nation's intelligence capabilities magnifies \n     significantly the risks attendant to reductions in resources \n     devoted to the Nation's defense. As this Committee noted in \n     discussing legislation to assist in managing the personnel \n     reductions at the Central Intelligence Agency, ``. . . \n     maintaining a strong intelligence capability is particularly \n     important when military forces are being substantially \n     reduced . . .'' (S. Rept. 103-43, p. 3).\n       The U.S. will depend on effective foreign intelligence in \n     allocating scarce U.S. national security resources \n     effectively. To protect America's interests in times of peace \n     and of conflict, U.S. policymakers and military commanders \n     will depend heavily upon early warning of trouble and early \n     and extensive knowledge of the activities, capabilities and \n     intentions of foreign powers. Effective intelligence will \n     multiply substantially the effectiveness of the smaller U.S. \n     military force.\n       A sampling of the deployment of the U.S. armed forces \n     abroad in the past four years illustrates risks to American \n     interests in the post-Cold War world, likely uses of U.S. \n     military forces in the future, and the importance of \n     effective intelligence in supporting military operations. In \n     late 1989, American troops in Operation JUST CAUSE liberated \n     Panama from the Noriega dictatorship that suppressed \n     Panamanian democracy and threatened U.S. personnel. In 1990 \n     and 1991 in Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM \n     American and coalition forces liberated Kuwait from Iraqi \n     occupation, and those forces remain on station in and around \n     the Arabian Peninsula to enforce United Nations sanctions on \n     Iraq. American forces have rescued American diplomats caught \n     in civil insurrections abroad. U.S. forces have assisted in \n     stemming the flow of illegal immigrants into the United \n     States. U.S. forces have undertaken humanitarian relief \n     operations, to feed hungry people and provide them medical \n     care. The U.S. has assigned its forces as part of or in \n     support of United Nations peacekeeping forces in many \n     countries, including Bosnia, Macedonia, Somalia, and \n     Cambodia. In every one of these operation--from massive \n     operations on the scale of DESERT STORM to the smallest \n     humanitarian relief operations--the successful accomplishment \n     of missions by the U.S. armed forces and the protection of \n     American troops have depended directly upon the high quality \n     and timeliness of the intelligence available to American \n     forces.\n       Reductions in U.S. intelligence capabilities in this period \n     of international instability are unwise and do not serve the \n     Nation's long-term security interests. Defense of America and \n     America's interests abroad requires a greater commitment of \n     resources to U.S. intelligence capabilities than the fiscal \n     year 1994 intelligence authorization bill provides.\n     John Warner.\n     John C. Danforth.\n     Ted Stevens.\n     Richard G. Lugar.\n     Malcolm Wallop.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I have the report that accompanied the 1994 bill. This \nwas written in July of 1993. This report covered the ensuing fiscal \nyear. I wrote the minority views, which were joined in by other \ncolleagues on the committee at that time: Senator Danforth, who is now \nour Ambassador to the United Nations; Senator Stevens, who is currently \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee; Senator Lugar, who is \ncurrently chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; and our former \ncolleague, Senator Wallop.\n  Here is what we had to say, and I do not think this is dysfunctional \nparticipation, but I will let my colleagues judge for themselves after \nI have read portions of this report.\n  The minority views of the following Senators:\n\n       The United States must maintain and strengthen U.S. \n     intelligence capabilities to provide for the future security \n     of the Nation and for the protection of its interests around \n     the globe. The U.S. should commit more resources to \n     achievement of that objective than the fiscal year 1994 \n     intelligence authorization bill reported by the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence would provide.\n\n  We were, of course, members of that select committee.\n\n       The U.S. faced grave security risks during the Cold War, \n     but it faced them in an international environment that was \n     comparatively stable and predictable. With the end of the \n     Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union and its \n     Warsaw Pact military alliance, the U.S. had hoped for a ``New \n     World Order'' with stable and steady progress toward greater \n     democracy, freedom and free enterprise. What the U.S. faces \n     in the post-Cold War era, however, is a more chaotic \n     environment with multitude challenges to U.S. interests that \n     complicate the efforts of the U.S. and cooperating nations to \n     achieve the desired progress. In an unstable world of diverse \n     and increasing challenges, the need for robust and reliable \n     U.S. intelligence capabilities has grown rather than \n     diminished. America faces a world in which: Ethnic, religious \n     and social tensions spawn regional conflicts; a number of \n     nations possess nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them \n     on a target; other nations seek nuclear, chemical or \n     biological weapons of mass destruction and the means to \n     deliver them; terrorist organizations continue to operate and \n     attack U.S. interests (including here at home, as the bombing \n     of the World Trade Center in New York reflects)--\n\n  This is 1993. It is interesting. It was June 30, just about this \ntime--\n\n     international drug organizations continue on a vast scale to \n     produce illegal drugs and smuggle them into the U.S.; and \n     U.S. economic interests are under constant challenge.\n       To the extent that the end of the Cold War allows a \n     reduction of U.S. resources devoted to intelligence \n     capabilities focused on military capabilities of countries on \n     the territory of the former Soviet Union, the U.S. should \n     reallocate the gained resources to strengthen intelligence \n     capabilities to deal with growing risks to America's \n     interests. The U.S. should make such resources available for \n     strengthened intelligence capabilities focused on the \n     problems with which the U.S. Government must deal in the \n     coming decades, including proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, terrorism, international narcotics trafficking, \n     and the illegal transfer of U.S. high technology.\n\n  I shall not read further because I will put it in the Record.\n  This is not dysfunctional action by legislators; this is legislators \nlooking into the future and seeing much of what is occurring today. I \nonly wish we had the opportunity to advise the 9/11 Commission of this \nand other contributions by many others in this Chamber at that period \nof time who were in the service of the Senate and their States. This \nwas not dysfunctional.\n  In the days ahead, we do need to look at how best to organize the \nintelligence elements of our national security structure, along with \nmany other components. We must not, however, do anything precipitously.\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\n  In the specific area of intelligence, our intelligence services, even \nwith the flaws that have been recently pointed out, are the best in the \nworld, by far. They are not perfect, and their business is, by \ndefinition, one of uncertainty--best judgments made with the \ninformation that is currently in hand. Any changes we make must be \ncarefully constructed to preserve existing excellence, while improving \nother functions.\n  As we consider any changes, we must remember that intelligence is an \nintegral part of military operations. Recent military operations by our \nforces in Afghanistan and Iraq have been extraordinarily successful, in \nlarge part because of excellent intelligence, and because of the close \nrelationship between military operations and intelligence that has been \nso carefully built over the years. Intelligence is part of a whole \nDepartment of Defense, as well as part of a larger intelligence \ncommunity. Moving defense intelligence functions under the authority of \nanother cabinet-level official could have unintended consequences--we \nmust move with careful deliberation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute To Tom Diemer\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the retiring \ndean of the Ohio press corps. Tom Diemer, a veteran reporter who spent \nmore than 26 years at the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper, has left \nthe paper to pursue another career.\n  Tom is one of those rare reporters who truly do ``get it.'' Tom \nunderstands Ohio. He understands Ohio government. He understands Ohio \npolitics and certainly national politics. He understands what his \nreaders need and what they want to know.\n  Tom Diemer began working at the Columbus bureau of the Plain Dealer \nin 1978. A few years later, in 1981, Tom was promoted to bureau chief. \nWhen the opportunity came in 1985 to join the Plain Dealer's Washington \nbureau, Tom took it. During his career here in Washington, Tom has \ncovered four Ohio U.S. Senators: first, Howard Metzenbaum and John \nGlenn; later on, myself and then George Voinovich.\n  With a healthy dose of skepticism, Tom reported to his readers in \nCleveland about the activities in the U.S. Senate. But Tom was never a \nreporter to take a press release at face value or a prepared statement \nat face value. I think Tom was a skeptic in a good sense of the term. \nHe required his sources and those he got information from to make the \ncase to him, and he questioned them, questioned them hard. He asked \nthem questions that showed he was looking for the story behind the \nstory. Whether it was local issues, such as the Great Lakes or the \nEuclid Corridor, or national issues, such as a war declaration or the \nPATRIOT Act, we could always expect Tom to dig deeper and go further \nwith his line of questioning than just about anybody else.\n  Tom would want to know the implications of a certain story or he \nwould want some ``color'' for his story so he could capture the \n``feel'' of an event for his readers. He would want to be able to take \nhis readers here to Washington and let them feel and understand how \nthings really work in our Nation's Capital.\n  I always got the feeling that when Tom wrote a story, his editors got \noff pretty easily. They really did not have to do much work. However \nTom wrote it, that was probably just about the way the story appeared \nin the Plain Dealer because Tom got it right. No matter how tough his \nquestions were to me, I always knew any story I read by Tom Diemer \nwould be fair and accurate.\n  In Washington, Tom came to lead the Ohio press corps. His expertise \nabout Ohio politics often made him the go-to person for C-SPAN or CNN \nor any of the national reporters anytime they needed someone to analyze \nthe Ohio political scene during an election year.\n  I have always appreciated Tom's great professionalism, his \nthoroughness, his frankness, his fairness, his kindness, and the way he \ndeals honestly, forthrightly with people.\n  Tom Diemer will still be writing, but he is leaving the Plain Dealer \nto set out now on his own. I certainly will miss him. I will miss my \nfrequent contact with him. I certainly wish him the best of luck.\n\n\n                         Transportation Safety\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to turn to the issue of highway safety. \nOver 43,000 people lost their lives on our Nation's highways last year. \nThat is one death every 12 minutes or the equivalent of two Boeing 747-\n400s filled to capacity going down every week with no survivors.\n  This past May, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nNHTSA, released its 2003 traffic safety report, which details when, \nwhere, and why so many Americans lose their lives on our roads. This \ninformation gives us an idea of how effective our efforts are at the \nlocal, State, and national levels and where we need to focus resources \nin the future to help save lives. Based on the preliminary 2003 data, \nwe have, tragically, a long way to go.\n  Overall, fatalities increased 1 percent, from 42,815 in 2002 to \n43,220 in the year 2003. This is the fourth consecutive increase in \nannual traffic fatalities. This is truly bad news, particularly in \nlight of the progress we made throughout the 1990s, when the norm was a \nreduction in fatalities each year. On the other hand, the number of \ndeaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled stayed constant at 1.5 \nfrom 2002 to 2003. While not an increase, this figure does show how \ndifficult it will be to reach the Secretary of Transportation's very \naggressive goal of reaching 1.0 fatalities per 100 million vehicle \nmiles traveled by the year 2008.\n  The 2003 report also includes a number of other findings that shed \nlight on the direction our country is taking as far as highway safety. \nAmong other things, the report states the following:\n  Standard passenger car fatalities are down but deaths in sports \nutility vehicles, SUVs, are up in the past year, with most of the \nincrease coming from rollover crashes. NHTSA estimates this trend may \ncontinue as SUVs grow as a share of sales volume.\n  Motorcycle crash deaths are up 11 percent from last year, now \ntotaling 3,592. Further, drunk driving death rates are essentially \nunchanged from 2002, with 40 percent of crash fatalities involving \nalcohol in the year 2003.\n  Further, the number of fatal crashes involving young drivers, those \nbetween 16 and 20, declined by 3.7 percent, from 7,738 in 2002 to 7,542 \nin the year 2003.\n  While the report does bring welcome news with regard to young drivers \nwho are much more vulnerable while driving than adults, it is also \nclear that progress needs to be made in a host of other areas, \nparticularly rollover crashes and drunk driving. I have been working in \nthe Senate, along with others, to see that we do just that through \nsafety issues we have added and that the Senate added to the 6-year \nhighway bill currently under consideration by the joint House-Senate \nconference committee.\n  These initiatives are designed to advance our ability to test \nvehicles for passenger protection and rollover crashes, get consumers \nvital crash test information when they need it most, and increase \nseatbelt use and reduce drunk driving through nationwide high-\nvisibility traffic safety enforcement campaigns. Combined with \nincreased seatbelt use, something that in my State of Ohio, Ohio State \nSenator Jeff Armbruster is working diligently to enforce in Columbus, \nbetter driver education, which the Ohio Department of Public Safety is \nfocusing on, and responsible practices, such as using a designated \ndriver, can in fact make a real difference.\n  These initiatives are contained in the Senate-passed bill that is \ncurrently being considered by the House-Senate conference committee. It \nis vitally important that they remain in this conference committee. \nThey will, in fact, save many lives.\n  Traffic safety affects all of us. We all have a role to play in \nmaking sure that when the 2004 numbers come out early next year, they \nare headed in the right direction.\n  In a related matter, I would also like to discuss a very important \ndevelopment in the effort to make our Nation's roads safer. Earlier \nthis month,\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\nDelaware became the 50th and last U.S. State to adopt a .08 blood-\nalcohol content per se drunk driving standard. Now every State in the \nUnion has that standard.\n  This development constitutes the culmination of many years of work \nhere in the Senate to get tough, uniform drunk driving laws on the \nbooks across our country. In 2000, the Senate took decisive action to \nhelp stop drunk driving by implementing mandatory sanctions for States \nthat do not adopt a .08 per-se standard. Now we are finally seeing the \nfull realization of this effort, as all 50 States now have .08 laws.\n  This is so important from a safety perspective because the fact is \nthat a person with a .08 blood-alcohol concentration level is seriously \nimpaired. When a person reaches .08, his or her vision, balance, \nreaction time, hearing, judgment, and self-control are severely \nimpaired. Additionally, critical driving tasks, such as concentrated \nattention, speed control, braking, steering, gear-changing and lane-\ntracking, are negatively impacted at .08.\n  Beyond these facts, there are other scientifically sound reasons to \nhave a national .08 standard. First, the risk of being in a crash \nincreases gradually with each blood-alcohol level, but then rises \nrapidly after a driver reaches or exceeds .08 compared to drivers with \nno alcohol in their systems. The National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration reports that in single-vehicle crashes, the relative \nfatality risk for drivers with blood alcohol levels between .05 and .09 \nis over eleven times greater than for drivers with blood alcohol levels \nof zero.\n  Second, .08 blood alcohol laws have proven results in reducing \ncrashes and fatalities. Some studies have found that .08 laws reduce \nthe overall incidence of alcohol fatalities by 16 percent and also \nreduced fatalities at higher blood alcohol levels. Now that all 50 \nStates have a .08 law, we will have the opportunity to see its effects \non a much larger scale.\n  The reduction in alcohol-related fatalities since the 1970s is not \nattributable to one single law or program. Rather, it is the result of \na whole series of actions taken by State and Federal Government and the \ntireless efforts of many organizations, such as Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving, Students Against Drunk Driving, Advocates for Highway and Auto \nSafety, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Alliance of \nAuto Manufacturers, and many others.\n  I thank my friend from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, for his \ncontinued dedication to fighting drunk driving. His hard work and \nperseverance have made the nationwide .08 standard possible. Mr. \nPresident, .08 was definitely a legislative effort worth fighting for, \nand now that all 50 States have a companion law in effect, I believe we \nwill see why.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Job Growth: Good Jobs\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, shortly we will be going to the Defense \nbill and we will have a UC in a little bit on that. While we are \nwaiting for some final approval on language, I want to take this \nopportunity to comment on the economy, job growth, and jobs.\n  Earlier this week, Chairman Greenspan presented his semiannual \nmonetary policy report to Congress. The chairman's conclusion needs to \nbe highlighted. He said: ``Economic developments of the United States \nhave generally been quite favorable in 2004'' and that this favorable \nsituation ``increasingly supports the view that the expansion is self-\nsustaining.''\n  On the same day the chairman presented his upbeat, optimistic \nassessment of the economy to the Senate Banking Committee, the \nDepartment of Labor released its latest report on State-by-State \nemployment figures for June. The Department of Labor report presents \nhard data that shows the unemployment rate has fallen in 47 States \nsince last June--47 States. Nonfarm payroll employment increased in 41 \nStates in June. Over the past year, employment has increased in 46 \nStates. Today, 37 States have unemployment rates at or below the \nnational unemployment rate of 5.6 percent in June. Further, since last \nAugust, the economy has generated 1.5 million private sector jobs, and \nan average of more than 250,000 jobs have been created each month over \nthe last 4 months. Finally, today, more Americans are working than at \nany time in this country's history--over 139 million Americans.\n  Unable to refute this good news, this positive news, this real and \ncontinually improving news on the job front, some of our Democratic \nSenators and colleagues, including the presumptive Democratic \nPresidential and Vice Presidential nominees, have tried a whole new \napproach in attacking this positive news. They now have decided: OK, \nmaybe there have been jobs created, but they are not good jobs; they \nare low-paying jobs. This is a new approach. As former President Ronald \nReagan would say: There they go again.\n  The question was asked directly of Chairman Greenspan by my \ncolleague, Senator Dole, on Tuesday:\n\n       Does your analysis show that the current jobs being created \n     are basically lower wage jobs with little or no benefits?\n\n  The chairman's answer, in one uncharacteristic word for him:\n\n       No.\n\n  More recently, the University of Pennsylvania's nonpartisan Annenberg \nPublic Policy Center supported research found that after analyzing data \nover the last year from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there was \n``solid growth in employment in relatively higher paying occupations,'' \nincluding construction workers, health care professionals, business \nmanagers, and teachers, and virtually no growth in relatively lower \npaying occupations, such as office clerks and assembly line workers.\n  Factually, the study concluded that we have seen ``good evidence that \njob quality has increased over the past year or more.''\n  I asked my staff to similarly analyze the data since the most recent \njob growth began last August. Using the current population survey data \ndistributed by 11 industries broken down by 14 occupations, 154 \ncategories of workers, there were in these 154 categories 1.8 million \njobs created and 110,000 jobs lost since last August.\n  The median weekly earnings for these 154 categories in 2003 was $541. \nOf the gross 1.8 million jobs created since last August, 1.4 million \nwere in categories where their weekly wage exceeded the median wage of \nall workers in 2003. In other words, 77 percent of all the jobs created \nsince last August have been in occupations with weekly earnings above \nthe median.\n  Of the 1.8 jobs created since last August, 461,000 were in \noccupations with weekly earnings below the median, or 27 percent of the \njobs created were in those below median earnings jobs. Only about \n110,000 jobs created since last August have been in occupations at the \nmedian.\n  The conclusion, supported by other objective analyses, higher paying \njobs are growing faster than other jobs in this recovery.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle who are looking hard to \nfind a way to spread pessimism across the political landscape of this \nelection year are simply wrong in saying the quality of jobs being \ncreated is low.\n  Chairman Greenspan just simply disagrees. The nonpartisan Annenberg \nPublic Policy Center-supported research disagrees, and hard data from \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics disagree.\n  Economic growth is on track, job growth is good, and the quality of \nthose jobs is high. I hope my Democratic friends could at least try to \nget their facts correct, and when they do they will find this latest \nattempt to discredit the progress made is a canard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in executive session.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd pertaining to the introduction of S. 2755 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8614-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if all goes \nwell, Members will not use the full 2 hours. This, I think, is the only \nremaining vote Members would have to worry about tonight unless \nsomething untoward happens. Is that right?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have several business items, one of \nwhich has Transportation, Coast Guard, and other issues. The assistant \nDemocratic leader is right with his implication that this is going to \nbe in all likelihood the only rollcall vote. It is absolutely critical \nthat Members understand we have other items we have to address tonight. \nWe need to do that, and finish with this vote, if all goes well.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if everything goes well, Members may have a \nvote on this very important conference report.\n  There is no objection on this side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, after the vote on the Defense \nappropriations, will there be opportunities for Senators to speak on \nother subjects?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there will be. We will be happy to be here \nthrough the night for morning business--at some reasonable hour, I \nhope. We will be here for a while.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the majority leader.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4613) ``making appropriations for the Department of Defense \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, and for other \n     purposes,'' having met, have agreed that the House recede \n     from its disagreement of the amendment of the Senate, and \n     agree to the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to \n     the same.\n       Signed by all of the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings in the \nCongressional Record of Tuesday, July 20, 2004 (No. 101--Book II).)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, our Appropriations Committee is pleased \nto present to the Senate the Defense Appropriations Conference Report \nfor the Fiscal Year 2005. I believe passage of this measure today \nrepresents the earliest date the Defense bill has ever been sent to the \nPresident for signing.\n  This conference report symbolizes a balanced approach to fulfilling \nthe financial needs for the Department for the fiscal year 2005.\n  It provides $416.2 billion in new discretionary spending authority \nfor the Department of Defense. This amount includes $25 million in \nemergency spending requested by the President for the fiscal year 2005 \ncosts associated with the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. That \nprovision becomes effective immediately upon the signing of this bill \nby the President.\n  The conference report fully funds key readiness programs critical to \nthe global war on terrorism such as land forces training, helicopter \nflying hours, ship steaming days, and spare parts.\n  It fully funds the 3.5 percent military pay raise proposed in the \nPresident's budget, and increases levels for basic allowance for \nhousing, eliminating service members' average out-of-pocket housing \nfrom 3.5 percent to zero in 2005.\n  It provides $1.5 billion above the President's budget request for \nArmy and Marine Corps recapitalization of combat and tactical vehicles, \nhelicopters, and ammunition, and provides a total of $18.2 billion for \nthe Defense Health Program, an increase of $2.5 billion over the fiscal \nyear 2004 enacted level.\n  I urge all Members to support the men and women in uniform who risk \ntheir lives for our country each day by voting for this measure.\n  I would like to thank Larry Lanzillota, the Acting Department of \nDefense Comptroller, for his hard work, dedication, and diligence \nthroughout the past year. He has done a superb job and we wish him \nsuccess in his future endeavors.\n  I also thank my cochairman, Senator Inouye, for his support and \nvaluable counsel, and recognize him for any statement he wishes to \nmake.\n  I wish to put in the Record the names of the diligent staff members \nwho have worked on this bill night and day to be able to present it to \nthe Senate at this time, as follows:\n  Charlie Houy, Betsy Schmid, Nicole DiResta, Sid Ashworth, Jennifer \nChartrand, Kraig Siracuse, Tom Hawkins, Kate Kaufer, Lesley Kalan, \nAlycia Farrell, Brian Potts, Brian Wilson, Janelle Treon, and Mazie \nMattson.\n  I yield to my friend from Hawaii, if he wishes to make an opening \nstatement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Defense \nappropriations conference report that passed the House earlier today.\n  First, I wish to commend my chairman, Senator Stevens, and his \ncapable staff for this agreement.\n  The proposals provided by the conference report represent a careful \nbalance between the recommendations of each body. Moreover, it provides \nwhat the Defense Department needs for the coming year.\n  This is a good bill. It represents a fair compromise. It is the \nproduct of a lot of hard work by the chairman and members of the \ncommittee. I recommend all my colleagues support it.\n   Let me highlight just a couple of key items in this measure.\n   In meeting the conference committee priorities, the bill supports \nthe men and women in uniform. It approves a 3.5 percent pay raise for \nthem. It funds health care requirements to include benefits that are \nauthorized for our guard and reserve forces. And, most important in \nthis very challenging time, it provides significant increases for force \nprotection--specifically up armored ``humvees'', body armor, better \nhelmets, armor plating for other vehicles and new technology to try and \ncounter improvised explosive devices.\n   The bill provides substantial resources to enhance investment \nprograms in the Defense Department to support key programs like the V-\n22, the F-22, the new DDX destroyer, the littoral combat ship, missile \ndefense and significant increases in Army equipment for Stryker combat \nvehicles, trucks, and helicopters.\n   But, I want to inform my colleagues that this bill does not rubber \nstamp the administration's desires. It reduces many programs for which \ninsufficient justification has been provided. While we recognize that \nthe country needs to continue to enhance its space capabilities, \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee have learned the hard way that \nimprovements must be developed prudently. It is a waste of resources to \ntry and accelerate complex new technologies in the manner recommended \nby civilian officials in the Defense Department.\n   The bill also provides $25 billion in emergency spending, the amount \nrequested, but it allocates the funds to meet the priorities and needs \nof the individual military departments, not the\n\n[[Page S8615]]\n\nblank check sought by the administration. It provides adequate \nsafeguards on these funds to ensure proper congressional oversight and \nrequires stringent reporting requirements on its use.\n   I point out also that there are a few items in here that do not fall \nunder the jurisdiction of the Defense Subcommittee. I will defer to \nothers to speak to those.\n   This is a good bill. It represents a fair compromise. It is the \nproduct of a lot of hard work by the Chairman and Members of the \ncommittee. I encourage all my colleagues to support it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore (Mr. Chambliss). Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of my colleague from Hawaii, I \nreserve the remainder of our time. Senator Byrd has his time, Senator \nMcCain will have his time, and we will withhold our time.\n  Our time is reserved?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may require from my \nallotted time.\n  Yesterday, the General Accounting Office released a shocking report \nabout the state of funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nSimply put, our troops are running out of money. But the White House \ndenies that there is a problem.\n  The findings in the General Accounting Office report are alarming. \nThe Army is overspending its fiscal year 2004 operations in maintenance \nfunds to the tune of $10.2 billion. The Air Force urgently needs \nanother $1.4 billion this fiscal year, and the Marines are short by \n$500 million. Our military is cutting back on training at the same time \nthat retired service members are being pressed back into uniform to be \nsent overseas. These budget problems are being compounded by the fact \nthat the White House planned on having only 99,000 troops in Iraq by \nthis point instead of the 140,000 troops we will have there for the \nforeseeable future. This is the most astounding evidence to date that \nthe administration has fundamentally mismanaged the financing for the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The President did not bother to put a \nsingle dime, not one thin dime, in his February budget request for \nthese wars. He insisted that more funding would not be needed until \nJanuary 2005.\n  Even when the administration flip-flopped and came to Congress on May \n13, 2004, to ask for a $25 billion emergency reserve fund, top \nadministration officials denied that there was an urgent need for more \nfunds to support our troops in the field. Deputy Defense Secretary \nWolfowitz described the $25 billion which is contained in the \nconference report of the Defense appropriations bill now before the \nSenate as an insurance plan. That is the way Mr. Wolfowitz described \nit. Secretary Wolfowitz stated in his testimony to the Armed Services \nCommittee that our troops would not run out of funds until February or \nMarch 2005.\n  I didn't buy that line. The administration has fallen down on the job \nin budgeting for these wars, and his budget projections simply are not \nto be trusted. I say ``these wars'' because we are fighting two wars, \none war in Afghanistan, which is the result of the al-Qaida attack upon \nthe United States on September 11, 2001. That was an attack upon the \nUnited States by those individuals who had hijacked planes and flown \nthem into the World Trade Towers, into the Pentagon, and into the field \nin Pennsylvania. That was one war. I supported Mr. Bush on that war. I \nsupport that war today.\n  The second war is the Bush war, the war that is of Mr. Bush and his \nring of people around him in the White House. That is the Bush war. \nThat was an attack upon a sovereign nation which had not provoked us, \nwhich had not attacked us. That was an attack on a nation in support of \nthe Bush doctrine of preemption. I did not support that war then, and I \ndo not support it today.\n\n  I did not buy that line. The administration has fallen down on the \njob of budgeting for these wars, and its budget projections simply are \nnot to be trusted. It should have been clear to anyone who has picked \nup a newspaper in the last 6 months that our troops were beginning to \nrun low on funds, but the administration sent witnesses bearing only \nrosy scenarios.\n  To add insult to injury, the White House asked for a $25 billion \nblank check on the heels of Bob Woodward's revelations in his book, \n``Plan of Attack,'' about the Pentagon hiding from Congress $700 \nmillion in spending to prepare for war in Iraq. This was an astounding \nrequest.\n  Thankfully, Congress has seen through the administration's double \ndealing on funding our troops. I thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Ted Stevens, and his colleague, the \nranking member of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, Senator \nDaniel Inouye, for working to pierce the fog of rhetoric to reshape \nthis $25 billion reserve fund to best help our troops while protecting \nthe constitutional prerogatives of Congress.\n  Instead of being a $25 billion blank check, $23 billion of these \nfunds--that is, 92 percent--is made available for regular \nappropriations accounts. This means that Congress will be better able \nto track how these additional funds are used. In addition, the $25 \nbillion in funding will be available for our troops as soon as this \nbill is signed into law. They will not have to wait until October 1 to \npurchase the critical equipment our troops need to survive in the \ncombat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. Again, I thank Senator Stevens \nand Senator Inouye for working with me to promote fiscal responsibility \nand accountability for how these funds are to be used.\n  Despite the improvements made to the administration's request for \nfunding for the war, I continue to have serious concerns about the \ndirection of the so-called peacetime defense budget; that is, the huge \namount of funds not related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This \nbill contains $391.2 billion for the Pentagon, not including $25 \nbillion for the cost of the wars. That is a massive increase over the \n$287.1 billion appropriated for the Pentagon as recently as fiscal year \n2001.\n  The administration claims this explosion in defense spending is \nnecessary to transform our military into a faster, lighter, and \nstronger fighting force. But today's Los Angeles Times states that the \nArmy is delaying by 2 years the launch of its first modernized unit \nthat is supposed to be the centerpiece of this defense transformation \neffort.\n  In this age of sky-high deficits, could it be that we are getting \nless bang for more bucks? How else can the administration explain a \nstalled transformation effort when defense spending has risen 36 \npercent in 4 years? If this rate of growth continues, this country will \nsoon be spending half a trillion per year on the defense establishment, \nwith no assurance that those funds are being well spent.\n  The Pentagon's accounting systems are a mess, an absolute mess. \nDespite Secretary Rumsfeld's promise to me at his confirmation hearing \nin January 2001 to get this problem fixed, the General Accounting \nOffice has recently issued serious warnings that his accounting reform \neffort is headed down the wrong track.\n  In fact, this Defense appropriations bill cuts funds from this \naccounting reform effort precisely because the Defense Department's \nprogram to fix its accounting systems is underperforming. Tens of \nmillions of taxpayer dollars that were supposed to have been put to use \nin establishing a robust system of financial accountability remain \nunspent. This Congress made the wise decision not to throw more money \nat a problem that is not being fixed. When Secretary Rumsfeld gets his \naccounting reform program back on its feet, I will be the first Senator \nin line to support all necessary funds for that purpose.\n  Senators should also realize this Defense appropriations bill brings \nback from conference something that was never included in the Senate-\npassed bill and something that was never included in the House-passed \nbill. It includes a deeming resolution to increase the annual \ndiscretionary spending limit to $821.9 billion for the fiscal year \n2005.\n  The failure of this Congress to pass its annual budget has led to \nthis move to include a deeming resolution in the\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\nDefense appropriations bill, signaling the complete breakdown in this \nyear's budget process.\n  Setting aside the fact that this provision violates rule XXVIII of \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate, Senators should know that this \ndeeming resolution authorizes $11 billion less than what the \nCongressional Budget Office says is necessary to maintain current \nservices, adjusted for inflation. That $11 billion is needed to \nmaintain services to our veterans, fund health care and education \nprograms for our seniors and our youth, and maintain our mass transit \nand highway programs.\n  In a time of war, each dollar devoted to our military must be put to \nfull use. No matter how many additional hundreds of billions Congress \nmay approve for the Pentagon, defense spending without accountability \nultimately hurts our troops in the field.\n  Each dollar that is spent on wasteful contracts, each dollar that is \nlost in an accounting maze, is one less dollar for our troops to buy \nammunition, to buy fuel, to buy body armor. There must also be a budget \nso Congress can know the spending plan for our troops on the \nbattlefield will be supported in the coming months and years.\n  The administration would do well to listen--just to listen; get off \nits high horse, swallow its false pride, and listen--to this \ncommonsense message. Stop the budget gamesmanship that only endangers \nthe lives of our fighting men and women. Enough of the political \nposturing that denies that our military in the field may have urgent \nneeds. The President of the United States must take responsibility for \nthe fiscal mess that he has created.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I would \nhope to title my remarks at this point ``Homeland Insecurity.''\n  In a mere matter of days, we will officially kick off the 2004 \nPresidential election season, with the convening of the Democratic \nconvention in Boston. The political activities and festivities in \nBoston will also mark the beginning of a tense interlude between the \nconventions and the November elections, during which the Nation has \nbeen told to brace for the possibility of a large-scale terrorist \nattack on the United States.\n  Earlier this month, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and FBI \nDirector Robert Mueller went on national television to warn the \nAmerican people that credible evidence pointed to plans by al-Qaida to \nlaunch a large-scale attack on the United States before the November \nelections in an effort to disrupt our democratic process. Yet in the \nweeks since our Nation's top Homeland Security officials issued that \nblunt and alarming warning, the administration appears to have buried \nits head in the sand, carrying on with business as usual, seemingly \noblivious to the gathering danger predicted by its own experts.\n  This morning the Washington Times newspaper published on its front \npage a chilling account of shadowy groups of Middle Eastern men \ncarrying out surveillance at airports, probing security measures, \nconducting what appear to be dry runs on our aircraft. The reports are \nanecdotal, but regardless of whether the article turns out to be \naccurate or merely an example of scare-mongering, it raises serious \nquestions and underscores serious flaws in the administration's \npreparedness to respond to another terrorist attack on the United \nStates.\n\n  Following the tragic events of September 11, protecting the Nation's \ncommercial aircraft became the top antiterrorism priority of the \nFederal Government in this country. The administration established a \nfirm goal for the number of Federal air marshals so that a high \npercentage of critical flights could be protected. The exact number of \nair marshals is classified. However, it is no secret that the Federal \nAir Marshals Program has never reached the staffing level deemed \nnecessary to protect the American people in the wake of the September \n11 attacks.\n  Worse, as commercial air travel rebounds to its highest level since \nthe September 11 attacks, the number of Federal air marshals is \nactually declining, falling 9 percent below the meager staffing level \nthat the program was initially able to achieve and far further below \nthe administration's stated goal.\n  As air marshals leave the program, budget constraints prohibit the \nhiring of replacements. The number of air marshals continues to \ndwindle, and the number of critical flights they are able to cover \nremains on a steady downward spiral. That is enough to make your hair \nstand on end.\n  At a time when Americans have been told, in the starkest terms \npossible, that al-Qaida is moving forward with plans to attack our \nhomeland, the administration continues to twiddle its thumbs and allow \nour homeland defenses, including protection of commercial aircraft, to \nerode.\n  While the Bush administration claims progress in the war on terror \nand asserts that it is making the Nation safer, the facts belie the \nrhetoric. The assertions are hollow. The administration has \nconsistently put homeland security on the back burner. At the prodding \nof Congress, the administration grudgingly created the Cabinet-level \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Senator Stevens and I wrote language \ninto appropriation bills providing that the head of Homeland Security \nwould require confirmation. No, the administration didn't want to send \nMr. Ridge up before the Appropriations Committee until Senator Stevens \nand I joined in writing that language. Since the creation of this \nDepartment, the administration has failed to provide the Department \nwith the resources needed to make Americans safer.\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\n  The Senate, I am sorry to say, is somewhat complicit in the \nadministration's negligence. The Senate has danced right along to the \nWhite House tune. As Brutus said, in scolding Cicero for attempting to \ntoady up to Antony:\n\n       Our ancestors would have scorned even a gentle master.\n\n  Although the Senate Appropriations Committee passed the Homeland \nSecurity bill more than a month ago, it has been languishing--now get \nthis. Let me say that again. Hear me. Although the Senate \nAppropriations Committee passed the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill more than a month ago, that bill has been languishing on the shelf \nsince then and has yet to see the light of day on the Senate floor.\n  That is the bill making appropriations for homeland security. That is \nthe bill for your protection, may I say to the people who are watching \nthis Senate through those electronic lenses. It is your protection, \nyour security, your children's protection, your property, your \ncommunity. And yet that bill has been languishing, where? On the shelf \nsince then and has yet to see the light of day on this Senate floor.\n  For some reason which I cannot divine, this do-nothing Senate--hear \nme--for some reason which I cannot divine, this do-nothing Senate, \nunder the Senate Republican leadership, has bottled up the Homeland \nSecurity bill, refusing to allow the Senate to debate it and pass it \nand send it to the President of the United States.\n  Here we are, the Senate is about to go out for 45 days, and what \nabout your safety out there? What about the safety of the American \npeople? What about the safety of the communities of this country? What \nabout the safety of the children who attend the schools of this \ncountry? What about them? Are they going to have to wait 45 days before \nthis bill making appropriations for homeland defense is to even be \ncalled up and debated in this Senate? Yes. We are going to go home. We \nare going to go home and leave those people unprotected insofar as new \nmoneys are concerned for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Fie on the administration that would treat the American people so \ncavalierly. Here is a bill that has been waiting. This is not Senator \nStevens' fault. His Appropriations Committee, of which I am the ranking \nmember, has reported out this bill days and days ago. We should have \ntaken that bill up and passed it. Where is it now? It is bottled up, \nand there are no chances--none--of calling this appropriations bill up \nbefore we go home for a 45-day recess. Go home. Go home. And yet amidst \nall of this, this administration has been issuing dire warnings about \nal-Qaida and what may happen in this country in the meantime, and \nparticularly during a time when the American people are going through \nthe democratic processes of nominating a President and Vice President \nof the United States.\n  Now, if that isn't enough to make the hair curl, I would like to know \nwhat we need to make it curl.\n  Unlike the billions upon billions of dollars in funding that the \nPresident has demanded from Congress to fight his war in Iraq, he has \nbeen strangely silent on the need to appropriate homeland security \nfunding to better protect you, Senators, you, the American people at \nhome.\n  In the wake of the most recent terrorist alert, one would think--\nwouldn't one think--that the President of the United States would have \ncalled on Congress to provide supplemental funding for new measures to \nthwart the threat from al-Qaida? Wouldn't one think that?\n  There are so many weak links in our homeland security network for \nwhich added resources could be a true lifesaver. The country needs \nadditional funds to secure our mass transit systems, to increase the \ninspection of air and ship cargo containers, and, yes, to increase the \nnumber of Federal air marshals.\n\n  Yet the White House is doing nothing in this regard--nothing, \nnothing--to press Congress to move on this Homeland Security \nappropriations bill before we close the doors and go home.\n  If the reports of pilots and flight attendants and air marshals cited \nin the Washington Times article are accurate, our Nation's aircraft may \nbe under a renewed threat of attack. If the ``credible evidence'' cited \nby the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the FBI is \naccurate, then the United States is entering an extremely--extremely--\ndangerous period. And if the chairman of the so-called 9/11 Commission \nwas correct in the assessments he made today--I believe he was--then \nthe United States must face up to the mistakes it made in the past and \nto the probability of another terrorist attack of even greater \nmagnitude than that which shook the Nation on September 11, 2001.\n  Yet the White House is doing nothing in this regard. By pretending \nthat funding for homeland security can wait, and by refusing to \nacknowledge that additional resources are needed to protect the Nation, \nthe administration is callously playing fast and loose with the safety \nof the American people.\n  I hope and I pray that America remains safe over the coming months. I \nhope and pray that the reporting is wrong. I hope and pray that the \nevidence collected by our homeland security experts is off the mark. I \nhope and pray that the political conventions will be the scenes of \nnothing more sinister than elbowing for a better view of the platform. \nAbove all, I hope and pray that the administration will come to its \nsenses, drop its pretension that all is well with homeland security, \nand provide the financial resources required to truly protect the \nAmerican people at home.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, the 9/11 Commission released its \nreport and the Commission Chairman, Thomas H. Kearn, said that an \nattack ``of even greater magnitude is possible--even probable.'' In \nfact, intelligence assessments have long warned that al-Qaida is \nseeking weapons of mass destruction to use against Americans in the \nUnited States.\n  The 9/11 Commission specifically recommended today: ``Support the \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program'' and went on to state that it \n``is now in need of expansion, improvement, and resources.'' Yet the \nconference report before us today includes a rescission insisted upon \nby the other body of $50 million in fiscal year 2003 funding for \ncooperative threat reduction programs. In other words, although this \nbill appropriates $409 million for these programs in fiscal year 2005, \n12 percent of that amount from prior appropriations is being taken \naway. I think that is a huge mistake.\n  These programs, known as ``Nunn-Lugar'' programs after former Senator \nSam Nunn and the current distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Lugar, assist countries of the former \nSoviet Union in the safe and secure transportation, storage and \ndismantlement of nuclear weapons and nuclear and chemical materials, as \nwell as preventing the diversion of nuclear materials or equipment. So, \nwe have just cut funding for programs that will help keep nuclear \nweapons out of the hands of terrorists.\n  There has been some confusion about the impact of this cut. The \nofficial at the Defense Department charges with administering these \nprograms believes that she will be able to move funds around \nsufficiently to prevent the cancellation of any programs, this time. I \nhope she is right.\n  The cooperative threat reduction programs are notorious for how \nslowly the money is obligated. That is not because the programs are \nunneeded, or because federal employees are not doing their jobs. \nRather, pay-outs are slow because cooperation from the countries \nconcerned and various statutory certifications are required before the \nfunds can be used.\n  This fact makes the program a tempting target for those looking for a \npot of money to raid. But such critical programs must not be looked at \nas ``bill payers'' for other defense needs.\n  Neither should we view cooperative threat reduction programs as \n``foreign aid.'' That red herring must be put to rest. As former \nDefense Secretary Bill Perry used to say, CTR is ``defense by other \nmeans.'' There is no more pressing national security need than to \nsecure the sources of weapons of mass destruction and keep them out of \nthe hands of terrorists.\n  I want to put the House on notice today that I will vigorously oppose \nfurther cuts in these programs. And should any deobligation of funds be\n\n[[Page S8619]]\n\nnecessary because of this cut, I will urge the President and the \nSecretary of Defense to reprogram funds to prevent the cancellation of \nprograms and contracts.\n  We have no greater responsibility than to protect our Nation from an \nattack with weapons of mass destruction and I, for one, will not stand \nfor this critical program to be chipped away until it becomes \nineffective.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I want to discuss the Defense \nAppropriations conference report. I want to say upfront this \nlegislation is extremely important. At a time when our soldiers are \nstill in harm's way in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world, this \nlegislation provides resources they need.\n  This bill is all the more important because costs of war in Iraq are \nspiraling upward. The GAO has just reported that there is a shortfall \nof over $12 billion in funding for war costs for fiscal year 2004. This \nis on top of the $87 billion supplemental that we passed last year. \nThis year's Defense Appropriations bill makes $25 billion in emergency \nreserve funding for war costs available immediately, helping to cover \nthis shortfall and ensure that our troops have what they need in Iraq.\n  It is important to note that much more is likely to be needed in \n2005. CBO recently estimated that military operations in 2005 could \ncost $55-$60 billion. These estimates demonstrate that the Bush \nadministration has failed to budget properly for the war in Iraq and \ncontinues to understate the likely cost of these operations.\n  While this Defense conference report is extremely important, I want \nto make clear that I am deeply disappointed with the budget provisions \nthat were added to this conference report behind closed doors by the \nmajority, without any debate in the House or Senate. In what I believe \nis an unprecedented move, the majority has inserted deeming language \ninto this defense conference report--setting the overall fiscal year \n2005 discretionary spending level at $821 billion. This deeming \nlanguage should have been debated in the Senate. It is entirely \ninappropriate to add this language outside the scope of conference \nwithout any debate by the Senate or by the Budget Committee. Clearly it \nwas added because the majority knows that members of the Senate will \nnot want to oppose a defense bill while our troops are in harm's way.\n  This is no way to govern. It sets a terrible precedent. Since a \nconference report is not amendable, the majority is effectively \nstifling the ability of the Senate to fully debate and amend the \ndeeming language. But that seems to be the point here. The majority \ndoes not want to give the Senate the opportunity to fully debate and \namend this language.\n  We wouldn't be in this position if the majority had passed a budget \nresolution this year. That is where the overall spending and revenue \namounts are supposed to be determined. Yet, because the majority's \nleadership has refused to restore a strong paygo rule that applies to \nboth tax cuts and spending, the Senate has been unable to get an \nagreement on a budget. Despite the record deficits we now face, the \nmajority and the Bush administration are still fixated on passing more \nand more unpaid-for tax cuts. The Bush administration's fiscally \nirresponsible leadership is driving our nation's finances right off the \ncliff--and at the worst possible time, on the brink of the retirement \nof the baby boom generation.\n  I mentioned that there was no debate on this deeming language. \nGoverning this way is bound to lead to mistakes. In drafting this \ndeeming language, the majority has left out the firewall provisions \nthat guarantee that the gas tax contributions of our Nation's motorists \nwill be used to finance the Nation's highway and mass transit. We have \nhad highway and mass transit firewalls in place for the last 6 years to \nensure that funding for those programs is not diverted to other areas. \nBut now, under this deeming language, the firewalls will be eliminated \nand those highway and mass transit funds could be pilfered to cover \nshortfalls in other areas of the budget. I think this is a significant \nmistake--a horrible precedent to set in advance of a highway \nreauthorization bill.\n  As I said earlier, the funding for our troops contained in this bill \nis very important. But I want to be clear how disappointed I am in the \nway the majority is operating here and in the way they, along with the \nBush administration, are dangerously undermining our Nation's fiscal \nand economic security.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today we are considering the conference \nreport for the fiscal year 2005 Defense appropriations act. While I \nrecognize the importance of passing this legislation prior to the \nupcoming recess, I am once again disappointed that we are acting on the \nappropriations measure prior to enactment of the Defense Authorization \nAct.\n  The responsibilities of authorizers and appropriators are expected to \nbe distinct. The Defense Authorization Act lays out the blueprint for \nthe policies and funding levels for the Department of Defense and its \nprograms. The role of the Appropriations Committee is to allocate \nfunding based on policies provided by authorizations bills. In reality, \nthe appropriators' function, however, has expanded dramatically, and \nthe Appropriations Committee now engages in significant policy decision \nmaking and micromanagement, largely usurping the role of the \nauthorizing committees. I remain hopeful that we will complete action \non the Defense authorization act when we return in September in order \nto provide further clarification of congressional intent to the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  In the meantime, enactment of the Defense appropriations legislation \nis very important, and it will enable us to continue to meet our \nobligations to support service members in the fight against terror. The \nconference report includes many critical funding provisions to which I \nlend strong support, such as the funding to increase Army end strength \nby 20,000 soldiers. Unfortunately, although not surprisingly, the \nconference report also includes a large number of unauthorized and \nunrequested provisions.\n  While I appreciate the hard work and the laudable intentions of the \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee, the number of earmarks \ncontained in this conference report is alarming. This conference report \nand accompanying statement of the managers contains close to 2,000 \nearmarks totaling $8.9 billion in Member adds.\n  With Americans deployed across the globe fighting terror, and with \nlooming budget deficits at home, the Congress faces some tough choices. \nWe must find a way to uphold our fiscal responsibility while fully \nproviding for our military needs. The costs that go along with the \nconflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq demand now, more than ever, a new \nfiscal sanity in approaching our appropriations bills. A half-a-\ntrillion dollar budget deficit means we simply cannot afford business \nas usual. We simply cannot continue the binge of pork barrel spending \nthat consumes an ever growing proportion of our Federal budget. While \nthe cost of an individual project may get lost in the fine print of \nlengthy bills, together, they all do real damage. Collectively, these \nearmarks significantly burden American taxpayers.\n  Not surprisingly, along with the growth in deficit spending over the \npast few years, there has also been a significant growth in earmarks \nand pork barrel spending. In fact, according to information compiled by \nthe Congressional Research Service, CRS, the total number of earmarks \nhas grown from 4,126 in fiscal year 1994 to 14,040 in fiscal year 2004. \nThat is an increase of 240 percent in 10 years. In dollar terms, the \nearmarking has risen from $26.6 billion to $47.9 billion over the same \nperiod.\n\n  Based on the calculations of my office, the fiscal year 2002 Defense \nappropriations act contained $3.7 billion in pork. The conference \nreport on the fiscal year 2003 Defense appropriations act contained \n$8.1 billion in pork. The fiscal year 2004 Senate-passed Defense \nappropriations act contained well over $4 billion in pork. This year \n$8.9 billion was added in the conference report and the statement of \nthe managers, which is more than twice the number in last year's \nSenate-passed version of the legislation. This is real money. Every \nyear, countless important military and domestic programs go unfunded or \nunderfunded. I find it hard to understand why we can find the money to \npay for member add-ons, but then have to battle to fund concurrent \nreceipt or the survivor benefit plan.\n  The Joint Chiefs provided a list of critical requirements above what \nwas\n\n[[Page S8620]]\n\nprovided for in the President's budget request. That list totaled \nnearly $18 billion for fiscal year 2005. I believe that if we have the \nresources, we should do all we can to provide additional defense \nfunding for items and programs which the Joint Chiefs need. But \ninstead, we routinely fund programs just because they are important to \na particular state or district represented by a powerful Member of \nCongress. I find this practice to be a disservice to our military men \nand women, as well as to all American taxpayers.\n  Once again, the appropriators' addiction to tanker recapitalization \nis too great for any amount of medication. The whole tanker love affair \nreads like a bad novel. It is very suspect that the Appropriations \nCommittee added $100 million in this conference report under the \nheading ``Tanker Replacement Transfer Fund.'' Fortunately, the Senate \nprovision prevailed and Chairman Stevens, as he publicly stated he \nwould do, did not allow the House earmark for Boeing 767 tankers to \ncarry through conference. On that point, the Tanker Replacement Fund is \nmuted. Only the report language makes reference to the ``current tanker \nreplacement program of record''--that program, undisput\nedly, is the KC-X program which is in the Air Force's Future Years \nDefense Program.\n  Over the past 3 years, I have spoken at length on the Senate floor on \nthe Boeing 767 tanker lease--it is difficult to understand why we are \nstill debating a tanker program when no money has been included in the \nPresident's defense budget submitted to Congress. Further, the Senate \nArmed Services Committee did not authorize any funding for tanker \nrecapitalization for fiscal year 2005. The Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce, General John P. Jumper, USAF, did not request advance \nprocurement for tanker replacement in his ``Fiscal Year 2005 Unfunded \nPriority List,'' totaling nearly $4 billion, which he submitted to \nCongress in March 2005. The reason is simple--tanker replacement money \nis not needed now. However, the appetite for this scandal-riddled \nprogram is too great, despite the unethical acts of serious misconduct \nby Air Force officials and the firing of several senior Boeing \nofficers, including the very top of the corporation. It is hard to \ncomprehend why the appropriators continue to put tanker \nrecapitalization ahead of greater priorities for our servicemen and \nwomen.\n  Having said this, I congratulate the appropriators for considering \nthe recent Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Aerial \nRefueling Requirements. Critically, the Defense Science Board task \nforce found there is no compelling material or financial reason to \ninitiate a replacement program prior to the completion of the Analysis \nof Alternatives, AoA, and the Mobility Capabilities Study, MCS.' \nMoreover the task force observed that the Air Force greatly overstated \nboth the amount of corrosion throughout the KC-135 fleet and the KC-\n135's operation and support cost growth. It also found that the KC-135E \ncan fly to 2040. In other words, the `dominating rationale' cited by \nthe Air Force to Congress for having taxpayers pay billions of dollars \nmore for leasing Boeing's KC-767A tankers than they would for buying \nthem outright, has been conclusively shown to be without merit. The Air \nForce's representations on this issue remains a matter of continuing \ninvestigative concern. The likelihood that the analysis of \nalternatives, AOA, and mobility capabilities study, MCS, if done \nproperly, will recommend an acquisition method for these tankers now \nknown to be wholly unsuitable here, is probably minimal. So the \nSecretary's decision appears fatal to at least the lease component of \nthe proposal.\n\n  I look forward to seeing the language in the fiscal year 2005 Defense \nappropriations act reconciled with the fiscal year 2005 National \nDefense Authorization Act, which remains in conference. The language in \nthe Senate version of the Defense authorization bill is valuable in \nthat for the first time, it will inject much needed sunlight on a \nprogram whose development has been largely insulated from public \nscrutiny. The tanker provision in the authorization bill ensures that \nany effort by the Air Force to replace its fleet of tankers is done \nresponsibly, as is the case with most defense programs, however, that \nhas not been the case so far. We should expect no less from the Air \nForce.\n  Let me briefly highlight just some of the egregious examples of pork \ncontained either in the conference report or the statement of managers \nfor FY 2005:\n\n       $3.5 million sleep deprivation research. Last night, my \n     staff was here late into the night, conducting tests in sleep \n     deprivation, as they compiled the seventy-plus pages of pork \n     found in the joint explanatory statement. The results: they \n     are tired.\n       $3.4 million for USMC Hitchhiker. Back in my day, you could \n     give a Marine a ride for free.\n       $1 million for the Deep Digger.\n       $1 million for repair to the Biathlon Trail at Fort \n     Richardson, Alaska.\n       $ million to restore the Woody Island and its historic \n     structures.\n       $110 million for the Advanced Procurement of F-15s. The air \n     Force has decided to procure the F-22 to replace the F-15. \n     Yet this earmark keeps the F-15 production line open, so I \n     question the necessity of the F-22 procurement in the numbers \n     of aircraft and at the funding levels requested by the Air \n     Force. Apparently we just decided to pay for both.\n       $1.9 million, for the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial \n     celebration. You don't need to have the exploration skills of \n     Lewis and Clark to see that this is a path to higher \n     deficits.\n       $1 million for the Center for Optical Logic Devices. I am \n     the first one who would pay for logic if we could insert some \n     into our political process, but this earmark won't do it.\n       $7.7 million for the Chameleon Miniaturized Wireless \n     System. Chameleons change colors; but one thing does not \n     change is the unrequested provisions in appropriations bills.\n       $2 million for the Air Battle Captain program at the \n     University of North Dakota. This provision sends students \n     from West Point to North Dakota for their flight \n     lessons. Instead of letting flight schools compete for the \n     ability to train these cadets, we have earmarked their \n     training to North Dakota. We are putting parochial \n     interests over the necessity to provide the best training \n     possible for the best price to our Army cadets.\n       $4.2 million for the LISA inspector. This sounds very \n     interesting.\n       $3.4 million dollars for Project Albert. Hey Hey Hey! Seems \n     like Albert could get pretty fat off all the pork in this \n     bill.\n       $2.8 million for the C-135 Improved Waste Removal System. \n     We need to improve the way we remove waste from this bill. \n     Maybe combined with the Deep Digger, we can find a way.\n\n  I use humor in describing some of these earmarks, but the damage they \ndo is deadly serious. They pull money away from legitimate funding \npriorities and they waste taxpayer dollars. Each year, many of the same \nearmarks appear in appropriations legislation, and each year I come to \nthe floor and point them out to my colleagues. Some of the \nappropriators' perennial favorite projects include:\n\n       $4.3 million for the Smart Truck. This provision, which \n     directly lines the pockets of the auto industry in Detroit, \n     is not exactly smart.\n       $7.5 million for the 21st Century Truck. This program has \n     been around for years and not once has the Department of \n     Defense requested funding for it. While I'm sure we all would \n     love to jump into a truck that could be in a James Bond \n     movie, I'm not sure it is appropriate for the Department of \n     Defense to pay for it.\n       $5.6 million for the New England Manufacturing Supply \n     Chain. This is above and beyond the $14 million for this \n     project already earmarked over the last two years.\n       $33.9 million for the Maui Space Surveillance System. Why \n     should we provide $44 million for this system, when there are \n     many observatories in the United States, such as the Lowell \n     Observatory in Arizona, that already offers many of the same \n     benefits as the Maui site?\n       $1 million for the Brown Tree Snakes. Once again, the brown \n     tree snake has slithered its way into our defense \n     appropriation bill. I'm sure the snakes are a serious \n     problem, but a defense appropriations act is not the \n     appropriate vehicle to address this issue.\n\n  There are many earmarks that funnel dollars to worthy programs--such \nas breast cancer research, but there is no compelling national defense \nreason for these items to be on this piece of legislation. This type of \ncritical research should be funded through the Labor/HHS appropriations \nbill. Our soldiers and sailors need to be provided with the best \nequipment, housing, and support possible. Scarce defense dollars should \nbe used for these defense purposes, not others.\n  Once again, the appropriations earmarks in this defense conference \nreport are funneled primarily in to the home States of those Members \nwho sit on the Appropriations Committee. If you look at the plus-ups in \nthe Counter-Drug Activities the earmarking becomes clear. Plus-ups are \nincluded for the following States: Florida, Indiana, Tennessee, Alaska, \nHawaii, West Virginia,\n\n[[Page S8621]]\n\nKentucky, Nevada, New Mexico. All of these states, I repeat, all of \nthese States have Members on the Appropriations Committee in either the \nHouse or Senate. I find it hard to believe that only States represented \nby appropriators have drug problems.\n  I could go on and on listing examples of pork in this legislation. We \nwould fulfill our objectives better if we reassessed our spending \npriorities.\n  This year's conference report also includes a number of ``Buy \nAmerica'' provisions. For example, it prevents the foreign purchase of \nwelded shipboard anchor and mooring chain four inches in diameter and \nunder. Another provision ensures, that all carbon, alloy or steel \nplates are produced in the United States. Whew. I know we will sleep \nbetter at night knowing that all of our carbon plates are manufactured \nin the U.S. Yet another section prohibits the Department of Defense \nfrom purchasing supercomputers from a foreign source.\n  I continue to be very concerned about the potential impact on \nreadiness of our restrictive trade policies with our allies. Every \nyear, Buy America restrictions cost the Department of Defense and the \nAmerican taxpayers over $5.5 billion. From a philosophical point of \nview, I oppose these types of protectionist policies, and from an \neconomic point of view they are ludicrous. Free trade is both an \nimportant element in improving relations among nations and essential to \neconomic growth. From a practical standpoint, Buy America restrictions \ncould seriously impair our ability to compete freely in international \nmarkets and also could result in the loss of existing business from \nlong-standing trade partners. Not to mention that procurement policy \ndetermined in the Defense authorization bill, not in the appropriations \nbill.\n  I also want to comment briefly about a provision contained in this \nDefense appropriations conference report that is entirely unrelated to \nfunding our national defense needs.\n  A so-called ``technical amendment'' was added to the Senate measure \nat the surprise of a number of us who have been on record for opposing \nsuch a provision when efforts were made to add it to other legislative \nmeasures. Despite the fact that a member of my staff was on the floor \nduring the debate on the Defense appropriations bill and we had been \nassured the opportunity to review all amendments prior to their \nadoption, one amendment was suddenly accepted without the review or \nconcurrence of myself or my staff. That amendment rewrites the Fiscal \nYear 2004 Omnibus Appropriations bill to allow for 23--States plus the \nDistrict of Columbia, to receive over $300 million in additional \nfunding for highway project earmarks. Of course, this project funding \nis on top of the funding they already receive under what many of us \nconsider to be an unfair formula whereby the gas taxes of donor states \nare transferred to pay for the roads in donee states.\n  With the adoption of this new provision that has been retained in the \npending conference report, 23 States plus the District of Columbia, the \nmajority of which are already donee States and receiving more funding \nthan they contribute, will now receive even more money to pay for \nearmarked projects included in the Omnibus. Again, this funding is in \naddition to the funding distributed by formula. While the appropriators \nare taking action to ensure their earmarks are funded outside the \nformula, 27 States, the majority of which are donor States and already \nsubsidizing other States' highways, will get no benefit, thereby \nexasperating highway funding inequity.\n  While it doesn't surprise me that the appropriators found a vehicle \nfor their provision; it does surprise me that they would act in such an \norchestrated manner when they knew fully their efforts faced opposition \nif done so in what most of us consider to be regular order, \nwhereby objectionable amendments are not added just because they are \nsupported by the bill managers. One of the many Senatorial courtesies \nwe all hold dear is that we usually can take Members at their word and \nthat their rights will not be ignored simply for political expediency. \nSadly, that was not the case with the adoption of this provision.\n\n  The ongoing conference on the highway reauthorization bill is on \nlife-support. If the House, Senate, and administration can reach an \nagreement on an overall funding level, I will certainly do all that I \ncan as a conferee to ensure that earmarks are counted towards each \nState's formula distribution. It is only fair that we ensure that once \na formula is determined; a formula that I am confident will still \ninclude donors and donees, that earmarks are not permitted to further \nshortchange donor States' highway funding.\n  I also want to point out that buried at the end of the bill text is a \nlegislative rider that changes our immigration laws. This provision \ncarves out workers in the fish roe processing industry from numerical \nlimitations under the H-2B visa program. While I will be the first to \ntestify to the need to reform our immigration system, and have done so \nrepeatedly, we should not begin to do it on the Defense Appropriations \nbill by giving a benefit to one small segment of the fishing industry.\n  This is not the way to legislate. There are severe problems with our \nH-2B visas. We reached the numerical cap on visas early this year and \ndependent industries are now struggling to hire the labor they need to \noperate. The H-2B is just one example of our flawed immigration system; \nyet carving out a fix for parochial interests; without addressing the \noverall problem is shortsighted. While owners of fish roe processing \nfacilities benefit from the help powerful members of the Appropriations \nCommittee, every other industry- facing a labor shortage because of \nthis cap will continue to suffer.\n  I wish it were not necessary for me to come to the Senate floor with \nevery appropriations bill to criticize the amount of unrequested \nspending in the legislation. I do so because I believe it is critical \nfor American taxpayers to understand where the money from their pockets \nis really going. I urge my colleagues to stop ``porking up'' our \nappropriations bills. In a time of huge spending deficits and scarce \ndollars, it is long past time to stop feeding at the rough. We can do \nbetter.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4613, the Department of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year \n2005, provides $391.170 billion in budget authority and $416.011 \nbillion in outlays in fiscal year 2005 for the Department of Defense. \nOf these totals, $239 million is for mandatory programs in fiscal year \n2005.\n  The bill further provides $28.2 billion in budget authority in fiscal \nyear 2004 designated as emergency requirements. Of this total $26.8 \nbillion is for defense purposes and $1.3 billion is for non-defense \npurposes.\n  The fiscal year 2004 emergency funds for defense include $25 billion \nin supplemental appropriations for on-going operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. While the President requested these funds for fiscal year \n2005, the conference report makes these funds available on enactment. \nThe conference report also includes a repeal of a $1.8 billion defense \nrescission enacted in the 2004 Omnibus Appropriations bill, P.L. 108-\n199--in effect appropriating a new $1.8 billion for defense. In total, \nthe $26.8 billion in fiscal year 2004 emergency defense budget \nauthority generates $19.3 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2005.\n  The bill provides $500 million for wildland fire suppression for \n2004. These funds are consistent with amounts assumed in the 2005 \nbudget resolution. The conference report also includes the following \nnon-defense funds: $685 million for the Iraq embassy and diplomatic \nsecurity expenses; $50 million for convention security in New York City \nand Boston; and $95 million for Sudan humanitarian assistance.\n  The bill provides total discretionary budget authority in fiscal year \n2005, including emergencies, of $390.931 billion. This amount is $1.684 \nbillion less than the President's request and equal to the 302(b) \nallocations adopted by the House of Representatives. This amount is \n$68.4 billion less than fiscal year 2004 enacted levels when \nsupplemental appropriations are included. When supplemental \nappropriations are not included the conference report provides $20.8 \nbillion more than last year's enacted level.\n  The conference report also provides a 2005 302(a) allocation to the \nSenate Appropriations Committee. This will ensure that adequate \nenforcement tools are available as the Senate considers\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\nthe remaining appropriation bills. The allocation in the conference \nreport is consistent with the levels envisioned in S. Con. Res. 95, the \nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget for fiscal year 2005.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing this legislation before the Senate, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the \nbill be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     H.R. 4613, 2005 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS.--SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                            CONFERENCE REPORT\n                     [Fiscal Year 2005, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     Purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report: \\1\\\n    Budget authority.............      390,931          239      391,170\n    Outlays......................      415,772          239      416,011\nHouse 302(b) allocation: \\2\\\n    Budget authority.............      390,931          239      391,170\n    Outlays......................      415,987          239      416,226\n2004 Enacted:\n    Budget authority.............      459,374          226      459,600\n    Outlays......................      424,429          226      424,655\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.............      392,615          239      392,854\n    Outlays......................      418,639          239      418,878\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.............      390,931          239      391,170\n    Outlays......................      415,594          239      415,833\nSenate-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.............      383,773          239      384,012\n    Outlays......................      401,566          239      401,805\n \n  CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority.............            0            0            0\n    Outlays......................         -215            0         -215\n2004 Enacted:\n    Budget authority.............      -68,443           13      -68,430\n    Outlays......................       -8,657           13       -8,644\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.............       -1,684            0       -1,684\n    Outlays......................       -2,867            0       -2,867\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.............            0            0            0\n    Outlays......................          178            0          178\nSenate-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.............        7,158            0        7,158\n    Outlays......................       14,206            0       14,206\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ In addition to the amounts shown above, the bill includes $19.902\n  billion in emergency outlays in 2005 flowing from the $27.656 billion\n  emergency supplemental included in Titles IX and X of H.R. 4613 for\n  2004.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss \nbriefly the 9/11 Commission report and to comment on the status of \nintelligence in the United States.\n  In a context where we have been put on notice by the Director of the \nFBI\n\n[[Page S8623]]\n\nand the Secretary of Homeland Security that we may expect an attack by \nal-Qaida on U.S. soil some time between now and the election, it is of \nutmost importance we move ahead to put under a single umbrella all of \nthe intelligence agencies in the United States.\n  The 9/11 Commission report is one further statement that there is a \nneed to put all the intelligence agencies under one umbrella. When we \ndebated the Homeland Security bill back in 2002, I made the submission \non the floor of the Senate repeatedly--on September 3, September 10, \nSeptember 30, November 14, and November 19--that I thought it \nimperative the new Secretary of Homeland Security should have the \nauthority to direct--not just to ask but to direct--all of the \nintelligence agencies, to have some effective structure to put all of \nthe intelligence agencies under one umbrella.\n  I submitted that contention based upon my view that had all of the \ninformation been at hand, the attack on 9/11 might well have been \nprevented. Had the FBI Phoenix report gotten to the right people in \nheadquarters, had the information on Zacarias Moussaoui been properly \nhandled with an appropriate standard for probable cause, had the \nterrorists in Kuala Lumpur been kept out of the United States--known by \nthe CIA, but let in by Immigration and Naturalization--had those facts \nand others been pulled together, 9/11 might well have been prevented.\n  When I chaired the Intelligence Committee in the 104th Congress, it \nwas apparent to me at that time all of the intelligence agencies should \nbe under one umbrella. I made that suggestion in legislation at that \ntime. The Scowcroft report has made the same conclusion. We recently \nhad a report by the Senate Intelligence Committee which pointed out \nmany deficiencies in the CIA. Today we have had the report by the 9/11 \nCommission, all of which leads to one conclusion, which is hard to \ndispute; and that is, all the intelligence agencies ought to be under \none umbrella.\n  At a news conference earlier today, Senator McCain, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Bayh, and I announced our intention to take the 9/11 \nCommission report and put it into legislative language, to introduce it \nwhen we return after the August break. In so doing, we are not \nsubscribing to all of the provisions of the 9/11 Commission \nconclusions. But we agree there ought to be a focus of attention, and \nthere ought to be debate, and there ought to be action at an early \ndate.\n  It was suggested during the course of that news conference that when \nwe come back in a post-election session, which I think is a virtual \ncertainty, we take up the issue of reorganizing the intelligence \nstructure in the United States. If we do not come back in a post-\nelection session as lameducks to finish much of the unfinished \nbusiness, or to finish all of the unfinished business, then the \nsuggestion was made there ought to be a special session. I repeat that \nin cosponsoring legislation to encompass the 9/11 Commission report, it \nis not in total agreement with all of the provisions. I have \nreservations as to whether it is appropriate to designate a Director as \nopposed to a Secretary with Cabinet rank to take on the onerous job of \nstruggling with the culture of concealment of the FBI and the culture \nof concealment of the CIA and the resistance of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency. We will have an opportunity to consider that in a \nlegislative package.\n  When the Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction filed its report \nin 1999--a commission which I cochaired, a commission which came out of \nthe recommendations of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the 104th \nCongress when I chaired the Intelligence Committee--the structure was \nto give the Vice President of the United States the responsibility to \ncoordinate all of the activities of weapons of mass destruction because \nit was so important and because if you wanted to deal with the \nSecretaries of the various Departments, it would require somebody of \nthe stature of the Vice President to do that.\n\n  It may be that we will revisit the concept of having the Vice \nPresident undertake that kind of a responsibility because we are \ndealing with very strong, powerful forces, which have already started \nresistance--from the Department of Defense not wanting to give up power \nor fiscal control; resistance by the CIA, with the Acting Director \nspeaking out very forcefully in opposition to the 9/11 Commission's \nprospective conclusions, even before the report was filed, and in \ndefending what the CIA had done. There is much which has to be examined \nas to where the FBI stands.\n  When we examined the letter from Special Agent Coleen Rowley--13 \npages, single spaced--at a Judiciary Committee oversight hearing in \nJune of 2002, we found out the FBI did not even have the right standard \nfor probable cause for a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act.\n  When we have seen what the CIA has done in the very strong criticism \nlevied a few weeks ago by the Senate Intelligence Committee, we see \nthere is much, much which has to be done. There have to be improvements \nin the FBI. There have to be improvements in the CIA. And all of this \nnow comes into sharp focus with the events culminating in today's \nfiling of the 9/11 Commission report--again, especially at a time when \nwe are under siege and under threat of an al-Qaida attack between now \nand the election.\n  Recent disclosures by the Senate Intelligence Committee have \ndocumented the failures of the CIA to accurately inform the country, \nincluding the President and Congress, concerning the facts or judgments \non whether Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. As a result, \nsome are now questioning whether the United States made the right \njudgment on going to war with Iraq.\n  The action on going to war with Iraq, I submit, cannot appropriately \nbe judged by 20/20 hindsight. Based on the facts at hand, when the \nSenate voted, the judgment to approve the use of force cannot \nrightfully be faulted. The vote of 77 to 23 encompassed a majority of \nDemocrats, including Senator John Kerry and Senator John Edwards.\n  The decision to use preemptive force was based on the standard of \ninternational law which warrants anticipatory self-defense when the \nthreat of attack is imminent so that the defense of preemption is \nwarranted.\n  This standard was enunciated in 1842 by Secretary of State Daniel \nWebster in dealing with the so-called Caroline incident.\n  In the floor debate on the force resolution on October 10, 2002, I \nquoted Hugo Crotius, considered the father of international law, who \nsaid in his 1925 book ``The Law of War and Peace'' that a nation may \nuse self-defense in anticipation of attack when there is a ``present \ndanger.'' He said, ``it is lawful to kill him who is preparing to \nkill.''\n  In that floor statement, I also quoted another eminent authority on \ninternational law, Elihu Root, who said in 1914 that international law \ndid not require a nation to wait to use force in self-defense until it \nis too late to protect itself.\n  It is important to revisit the Iraq war vote not to second-guess \nourselves but to learn from that experience as we view escalating \nproblems around the world which may pose an imminent threat to this \ncountry. It is important that our intelligence agencies present the \nfull picture to decisionmakers, in particular the President, Secretary \nof Defense, Secretary of State, and the Congress, so the subtleties may \nbe considered in making complicated judgments. Had the decisionmakers \nbeen presented with more objective comprehensive information concerning \nIraq possessing weapons of mass destruction, it is doubtful that the \n``imminence'' test under international law would have been met.\n  It is important, in reviewing the incidents, that we not engage in \nself-flagellation. The comments coming out of Great Britain are \ninformative and instructive. The New York Times reported on July 14 \nthat:\n\n       A major British report released Wednesday found extensive \n     failures both in intelligence gathering on illicit weapons \n     and the government's use of that intelligence to justify the \n     Iraq war. But it cleared Prime Minister Tony Blair of \n     accusations that he or his government distorted the evidence \n     to build a case for war.\n\n  The Times further reported:\n\n       Like an earlier inquiry led by Lord Hutton, the report \n     exonerated the government of the charge that it deliberately \n     exaggerated the threat posed by Mr. Hussein in an effort to \n     deceive the public and Parliament. ``No single individual is \n     to blame,'' Lord Butler said. ``This was a collective \n     operation.''\n\n\n[[Page S8624]]\n\n\n  I suggest very close similarities between British intelligence and \nU.S. intelligence and the reliance of the executive branch and the \nreliance of Congress in our vote to use force and in the action of the \nBritish, that the self-criticism ought not to be levied in the context \nof the findings by the British report that clears Prime Minister Blair \nof accusations that he or his Government distorted the evidence to \nbuild the war and the finding by Lord Hutton that no single individual \nis to blame but, rather, it was a collective operation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the \nmajority leader, and I agree with him on many subjects, but earlier \ntonight he had some pretty harsh words for some of the economic \nstatements that I and others of my colleagues have been making in \nrecent weeks. He called them ``canards'' which is a nice sounding word \nbut means they are false statements.\n  I feel compelled to rise and present what I think is a better version \nof the facts which, as we can see, are very different. The majority \nleader, as I understood his argument, was saying the new jobs that are \nnow being created in the economy are better paying on average than the \naverage of other jobs that were in existence in the year 2003. But that \nmisses the essential point, which is that most of those newly created \njobs pay less and offer lower benefits than the over 2.5 million jobs \nlost during the first 2\\1/2\\ years of the Bush administration. Most of \nthose jobs were good-paying manufacturing jobs, and most of them have \nnot come back. Many of them have been transferred to other countries \nwith lower wages and no standards. They are not coming back at all.\n  Those are the jobs that the unemployed workers of America are now \nfinding and that are paying on average thousands of dollars less than \nthe jobs those workers held before the recession began in March of \n2001. They are among the millions of Americans whose incomes have \nfallen, who used to have jobs with health insurance but now don't.\n  I quote from an editorial in today's New York Times in part which \nstates:\n\n       From three different vantage points . . . the same basic \n     picture emerges: While there has been an increase in job \n     creation over the past four months--an unusually belated and \n     anemic spurt by historical standards--the bulk of the \n     activity has been at the low end of the quality spectrum. The \n     Great American Job Machine is not even close to generating \n     the surge of the high-powered jobs that is typically the \n     driving force behind greater incomes and consumer demand.\n       This puts households under enormous pressure. Desperate to \n     maintain lifestyles, they have turned to far riskier sources \n     of support. Reliance on tax cuts has led to record budget \n     deficits, and borrowing against homes has led to record \n     household debt. These trends are dangerous and unsustainable, \n     and they pose a serious risk to economic recovery.\n       We hear repeatedly that the employment disconnect is all \n     about productivity--that America needs to hire fewer workers \n     because the ones already working are more efficient. This may \n     well be true, but there is a more compelling explanation: \n     global labor arbitrage. Under unrelenting pressure to cut \n     costs, American companies are now replacing high-wage workers \n     here with like-quality, low-wage workers abroad.\n       It was only a matter of time before the globalization of \n     work affected the United States labor market. The character \n     and quality of American job creation is changing before our \n     very eyes. Which poses the most important question of all: \n     what are we going to do about it?\n\n  That is a subject which both of our major party candidates for \nPresident this year need to address--what are we going to do about it?\n  The response of President Bush and his economic apologists thus far \nis to deny even the reality. Fortunately, we have their own earlier \npredictions by which to measure today's economic facts.\n  In May of 2003, the President's own Council of Economic Advisers \nstated that his what was then called jobs and growth plan of more \ndeficit-driving tax cuts for the rich and the super-rich would result \nin the creation, they said, of 5.5 million new jobs by the end of this \nyear. Congress passed the President's plan, and it took effect in July \nof 2003. The actual number of jobs created in the past 12 months is \nover 2.2 million fewer jobs than the President's Council of Economic \nAdvisers forecast. In fact, the job creation in this country has failed \nto meet the President's forecasts in 10 of the last 12 months.\n  Once again, the administration trots out their favorite apologist, \nChairman Greenspan, whose salary now should be paid by the President's \nreelect committee rather than the American taxpayers, who preached \nfiscal responsibility for 8 years to President Clinton's administration \nand to the Congress at that time and was instrumental in creating a \nbalanced Federal budget in the year 2000, after taking out the Social \nSecurity trust fund--the first time in 40 years that the budget of the \nFederal Government, the operating accounts were balanced. He then \nturned around and has acquiesced with every tax cut that has been \npassed and which has led to the deficits that now exceed over $500 \nbillion a year and which the nonpartisan Concord Coalition, chaired by \nformer Republican Senator Rudman, has called the most reckless fiscal \npolicy in this Nation's history.\n  Mr. Greenspan, who acquiesced in those, now comes forward and says \nthe tax cuts prevented a deeper recession. In part, he is probably \ncorrect that the child tax credit, which certainly passed here with \noverwhelming bipartisan support, and the 10-percent bracket had those \nbenefits, but certainly nobody could say eliminating the estate tax in \n2010 was a force in either dampening the recession or speeding our \nrecovery, nor did making the top tax brackets for the rich and the \nsuper-rich even lower, according to most economists, result in that \nkind of economic stimulus. In fact, the Federal Reserve's own \neconometric forecast states that public spending is a better multiplier \nfor jobs and economic growth than the tax cuts.\n  He has gone farther in the last day to say the reason we have lower \npaying jobs in America is now because American workers are not well \nenough educated. It is pretty hard to understand how the educational \nquality of the American workforce could change from what it was prior \nto the recession when employment had expanded at a robust pace for \nalmost 8 years to where it is less than 3 years later. In fact, the \nreality is that many American workers are overeducated for the jobs \nthat are available, as the New York Times editorial and other economic \nanalyses have attested. We are not providing the jobs in this economy \nthat people need with the talents they have. We are not providing the \njobs people need to maintain the standards of living they enjoyed \nbefore. And we are not providing enough jobs for the unemployed and \nunderemployed people of this country. That is the reality, not a \ncanard.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2443, the Coast Guard reauthorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H. R. \n     2443), to authorize appropriations for the Coast Guard for \n     fiscal year 2004, to amend various laws administered by the \n     Coast Guard, and for other purposes, having met, after full \n     and free conference, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, signed by all conferees on the \n     part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings in the \nCongressional Record of Tuesday, July 20, 2004 (Volume 150, Number \n101).\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today as the chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and I am pleased to \nannounce today the successful completion of the conference report for \nH.R.\n\n[[Page S8625]]\n\n2443, The Coast Guard Maritime Transportation Act of 2004. The \nconference report will provide the Coast Guard with the authorization \nbill it desperately needs to carry out all its missions, protect the \nhomeland, and ultimately prepare for the future.\n  This legislation will provide the Coast Guard with an authorization \nfor fiscal year 2004 and several critical programs. First and foremost, \nit authorizes the funding and personnel levels it needs to fulfill its \nobligation to the maritime communities of this Nation. It will provide \nthe Coast Guard with $5.4 B in authorized operating expenses, and a \n$1.1 B authorization for the Integrated Deepwater Program designed to \nallow the Coast Guard to continue the prosecution of its traditional \nmissions, while at the same time combating new and emerging threats.\n  Additionally, the conference report authorizes an increase in the \nactive duty personnel to 45,500 personnel, an increase of nearly 8,000, \nincluding an authorization for up to 6,700 officers that are \ndesperately needed to fill critical homeland security positions.\n  The Secretary of homeland security is now authorized to require vital \nelectronic navigation systems onboard vessels the Secretary deems \nnecessary in order to improve and facilitate safe navigation.\n  A National Coast Guard Museum will be established in New London, CT \nthat will exemplify the fine traditions and heritage that the United \nStates Coast Guard possesses, yet until today, has been unable to \nproperly display. This legislation will now allow the public to witness \nfirst hand, the legacy of what once was the Lifesaving Service, now \nevolved into the modern-day Coast Guard.\n  This legislation also provides many provisions which improve the \nCoast Guard's ability to recruit, reward, and retain high-quality \npersonnel. It addresses personnel management and quality of life issues \nby providing for a critical skills training bonus, retaining \ncommissioned officers with essential skill sets and experiences, \nexpanding property authorities to ease housing shortages, and includes \nseveral measures that grant parity with the other Armed Services. There \nare also many provisions regarding Law Enforcement, Marine Safety, and \nEnvironmental Protection which allow the Coast Guard to better \naccomplish its many missions.\n  Further, the legislation requires increased reporting and targeting \nfor inspection of cargo containers headed to the United States. It also \nprovides for increased research and development to improve and deploy \nport security technology. There are also a number of provisions that \nclarify the role of the Coast Guard in leading the United States' \nefforts to improve port and maritime security.\n  This legislation was crafted in a bi-partisan fashion and it provides \nthe Coast Guard with a solid foundation to do its job both now, and in \nthe future. I am proud to give the Coast Guard the resources it needs \nto carry out its many essential missions that will result in saved \nlives, seized contraband, a cleaner environment, and ultimately the \nprotection of our homeland.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am pleased that the conference committee charged with \nresolving the differences between the House and Senate versions of H.R. \n2443 has reached final agreement on the Coast Guard and Maritime \nTransportation Act of 2004. Through this bill, Congress underscores our \nsupport for a strong and effective Coast Guard.\n  The Coast Guard has always taken on an impressive array of tasks that \nare important for our national security, the protection of our \nresources, and the safety of our mariners. After the tragic events of \nSeptember 11, 2001, we have asked the Coast Guard to take on even more \nresponsibility for our maritime security, all the while continuing to \nexcel in their traditional missions.\n  This legislation provides an authorization of $8,167,610,000 for the \nCoast Guard's fiscal year 2005 budget, an increase of 19 percent over \nfiscal year 2004, and important new authority for the Coast Guard to \nbetter execute its missions. Of this, $5,404,300,000 is authorized for \nthe Coast Guard's operating expenses, an increase of 14 percent over \nfiscal year 2004, with $100 million allocated to cover the costs of the \nCoast Guard's new tempo demands. This will assure that the traditional \ncore missions of the Coast Guard--such as search and rescue of mariners \nin distress and protection of our living marine resources--are not \ncompromised. Most importantly, we authorized approximately $300 million \nfor port security that was not requested by the President. I believe \nthe provision of these funds are essential to the security of our \nports, our waterways, and our maritime transportation industry. In \nparticular, the funds will help implement the Coast Guard's Automatic \nIdentification System, AIS, to track the movement of foreign vessels \noperating in U.S. waters.\n  I have always been a firm supporter of providing the Coast Guard with \nthe tools it needs to get the job done. The Coast Guard needs to \nupgrade its core assets, in particular, its aging fleet of cutters. The \nIntegrated Deepwater Program is the Coast Guard's program for achieving \nthese upgrades, and the administration has not requested sufficient \nfunding in its budgets to even keep this program on track. The bill \nauthorizes $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2005 for the Deepwater Program. \nThis sends an important signal we support the Coast Guard's \nmodernization effort. I do have some reservations as to whether the \nCoast Guard can in reality absorb such a large increase over last \nyear's levels, an issue that GAO raised in testimony before the Senate \nCommerce Committee this year. However, we can consider this issue \nfurther when we take up the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, \nappropriations bill. I am pleased the conference agreed to procurement \nmanagement improvements by requiring the Coast Guard to report on how \nit intends to implement recent GAO recommendations, including measures \nto increase competition of subcontracts, and how it intends to alter \nthe mix of legacy and replacement assets in the future, as well as \nexpected costs of any changes to its original plan. Unless there are \nsignificant changes to the way the Deepwater contracting business is \nconducted, there will be enormous problems in the future that may \nultimately undermine this program.\n  I would also like to thank the conferees for supporting the inclusion \nof various measures that were addressed in S. 2279, the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act of 2004, MTSA 2004, a bill that I \nintroduced to enhance implementation of MTSA 2002. I remain very \nconcerned about the current implementation of port security measures \nand will continue to demand review of implementation policies to ensure \nthat we are aggressively implementing effective security measures. \nSpecifically, the conference agreement includes important requirements \nto review and improve cargo security programs. We must have concrete \ncargo security programs in place to detect and prevent cargo containers \nfrom being used in a terrorist attack. In the event we are attacked \nthrough our ports, we then need to be able to reopen U.S. ports to the \ncommerce that sustains so much of our Nation's economy, with some \ndegree of confidence. We are far from where we should be. Cargo \nsecurity programs must require that we can verify the contents do not \ninclude weapons of mass destruction. Similarly, cargo security programs \nmust be continually inspected to ensure their compliance. Documentary \nevaluation of cargo information, while important, does not substitute \nfor physical verification. Our motto should not continue to be: \n``trust, but don't verify''.\n  I also am pleased that the Coast Guard will be reviewing and \nreporting on Joint Operations Centers such as Operation SeaHawk. \nOperation SeaHawk, established in Charleston, SC, is providing law \nenforcement an opportunity to coordinate their law enforcement and \nsecurity missions, and is being utilized to help implement the security \nand contingency response plans for the whole area. I feel confident \nthat this model will be found to provide the best structure to \ncoordinate law enforcement activities of the various agencies that are \ninvolved in port security and provide a model for the Coast Guard to \nutilize Area Maritime Security plans.\n  I am also pleased that the final bill includes a number of important \nprovisions to address important natural resource issues. For example, \nthe bill includes a number of provisions regarding the Oil Pollution \nAct, including a program to provide loans to fishermen\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\nand aquaculture producers who are damaged by oil spills, a requirement \nfor using electronic charts which will reduce oil spill incidents, as \nwell as a report on a number of important issues such as the \nfeasibility of speeding up the requirement for double hulls, and the \nstate of health of the oil pollution trust fund. The bill also requires \nthe Coast Guard to improve its coordination on fisheries enforcement \nwith NOAA and State and local authorities. Finally, it mandates that \nthe Coast Guard must cooperate with NOAA in analyzing ship routing \nmeasures for certain ports that would reduce ship strikes of the North \nAtlantic right whale.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, \nand the rest of the conference committee for their hard work on this \nbipartisan authorization bill. This legislation provides an \nauthorization of $8.168 billion for the Coast Guard's fiscal year 2005 \nbudget, an increase of 19 percent over fiscal year 2004. This \nconference agreement also includes important new authority for the \nCoast Guard to better carry out its missions and meet the growing \nresponsibilities of a post-September 11 environment.\n  Sadly, when it comes to funding homeland security needs, I believe \nthe congressional intent expressed in this bill will, yet again, be \nignored at the White House.\n  This conference report authorizes $5.4 billion for the Coast Guard's \noperating expenses account--an increase of 14 percent over fiscal year \n2004 levels and over $231 million above the President's fiscal year \n2005 request for the Coast Guard.\n  Over 20 months ago, the President signed the Homeland Security Act \ncreating the Department of Homeland Security. With respect to the Coast \nGuard, that act required that, ``. . .the authorities, functions, and \ncapabilities of the Coast Guard to perform its missions shall be \nmaintained intact and without significant reduction. . . .''\n  Unfortunately, the administration has not held up its end of the \nbargain. The administration has failed to provide the Coast Guard with \nsufficient budgets to maintain both traditional missions and new \nhomeland security responsibilities. As a result, since September 11, \n2001, there has been severe degradation in the Coast Guard's \ntraditional mission areas. Because of the administration's negligence, \nthe number of hours the Coast Guard is spending on many of its mission \nareas has dropped dramatically as compared to pre-September 11, 2001. \nDrug enforcement is down 41 percent; fisheries enforcement is down 26 \npercent; search and rescue is down 22 percent; and marine safety is \ndown 41 percent. The administration's fiscal year 2005 request for the \nCoast Guard falls well short in addressing these serious deficiencies.\n  This conference report also provides $1.1 billion for the Coast \nGuard's program to modernize and/or replace some 100 cutters and 200 \naircraft over a multi-year period, called Deepwater. This is $334 \nmillion above the administration's request and puts the program on \ntrack to be completed in 15 years, compared to 22 years as proposed by \nthe administration. Since the terrorist attacks on 9/11, the Coast \nGuard's ships and planes are being used more today than ever in the \nCoast Guard's history. The Coast Guard Commandant makes no bones about \nthe fact that recapitalizing operational assets is his No. 1 priority. \nIn testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity, the Commandant testified that the current condition of the \naging, technologically obsolete fleet, threatens Coast Guard mission \nperformance. He testified that Coast Guard assets are in a ``declining \nreadiness spiral.''\n  The question that must be asked is, if Coast Guard assets are in a \n``declining readiness spiral,'' why has the administration failed to \naddress the situation. Despite the Commandant's plea for help, the \nPresident's budget for the Deepwater program will take 22 years to \ncomplete. Twenty-two years. This is 2 years slower than the capital \nimprovement program envisioned when Deepwater was conceived prior to \nthe tragic events of September 11th.\n  The funding authorized in this bill addresses some of the operational \nand capital deficiencies that have been ignored by the administration. \nIt is a good bill. However, as a result of the President setting \narbitrary limits on discretionary spending, the Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill, at whatever point the Republican leadership \ndecides to allow the Senate to debate the measure, will not come close \nto funding the Coast Guard at the levels set in this bill.\n  By all indications, the President will sign this bill into law. \nUnfortunately, it will likely be thrown into the pile of other homeland \nsecurity promises that have gone unfulfilled.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Coast Guard \nand Maritime Transportation Act of 2004. Since the Coast Guard was last \nauthorized in 2002 as part of the Maritime Transportation Security Act \nof 2002, its responsibilities and needs have continued to evolve. Last \nyear I introduced the Senate Coast Guard Authorization bill (S. 733), \nthe underlying bill of this conference report, to address many of these \nconcerns. We have successfully finished this critical conference and I \nstrongly believe we need to move forward expeditiously and pass this \nconference report as soon as possible so that we can provide the Coast \nGuard with the authorization bill it desperately needs.\n  In April, as Chair of the Oceans, Fisheries, and Coast Guard \nsubcommittee, I held a hearing to examine the Coast Guard's readiness \nconcerns; review the challenges it faces in balancing its homeland \nsecurity and traditional missions; and ensure that we provide this \nservice with the fiscal year 2005 budget it needs to carry out all of \nits many responsibilities.\n  During this hearing the Coast Guard Commandant, Admiral Collins, \npresented a stark picture of his service's increasing maintenance \ncosts. I was struck by Admiral Collins' testimony as he laid out the \ndepths of the legacy asset sustainment problems faced by the Coast \nGuard. I am greatly concerned about the toll such a high operational \ntempo is taking on his antiquated ships and aircraft and ultimately on \nhis personnel.\n  The conference report we are considering will provide many important \nauthorizations for the Coast Guard. First and foremost, it would \nauthorize the funding and personnel levels it needs. In recent years we \nhave seen an unprecedented growth in the Coast Guard's budget--more \nthan 30 percent over the past 2 years alone--but this has not been \nenough. We must provide the Coast Guard with the funding it needs to \nrestore its non-homeland security missions--such as search and rescue, \nfisheries enforcement, and marine environmental protection--to near \ntheir pre-September 11th levels.\n  Additionally, while we have increased the number of Coast Guard \npersonnel by more than 4,000, we have not raised the statutory cap on \nits authorized number of officers. We are rectifying this before the \nCoast Guard reaches its cap and is forced to terminate reserve officer \ncontracts or delay some officer's deserved commissions and promotions. \nThe Conference report raises this cap to 6,700 and prevents the Coast \nGuard from being forced to implement these drastic measures which would \nunfairly impact individual officers.\n  Secondly, we all know that the Coast Guard currently operates the \nthird oldest of the world's 39 similar naval fleets with several \ncutters dating back to World War II. The administration's fiscal year \n2005 request would put this program on a 22-year time line, which is 2 \nyears behind the original 20-year plans. This is simply not acceptable. \nI strongly believe that we must authorize the acceleration of this \ncritical program because it is the best and most cost effective way to \nremedy the Coast Guard's readiness problems and provide it with the \ntools it needs to carry out all of its missions. That is why, I am \nextremely pleased with the $1.1 billion authorization for the Deepwater \nprogram in this Conference report, which if fully funded, will \naccelerate the program to a 15-year time line.\n  This conference report also provides many non-controversial \nprovisions which improve the Coast Guard's ability to recruit, reward, \nand retain high-quality personnel. It addresses personnel management \nand quality of life issues by providing for a critical skills training \nbonus, retaining commissioned officers with essential skill sets and \nexperiences, expanding property authorities to ease housing shortages,\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\nand includes several measures that grant parity with the other Armed \nServices. There are also many provisions requested by the \nadministration regarding Law Enforcement, Marine Safety, and \nEnvironmental Protection which allow the Coast Guard to better \naccomplish its many missions.\n  This conference report was crafted in a bi-partisan fashion and it \nprovides the Coast Guard with a solid foundation to do its job. I thank \nall of the Members who have actively participated in its development. I \nam proud to give the Coast Guard my full support, and the resources it \nneeds to carry out its many essential missions.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

So to be able to propound this \nunanimous consent request is something that we can briefly comment on \nshortly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8627-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8627-S8633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This Act may be cited as the ``Patient Safety and Quality \n     Improvement Act''.\n\n     [SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       [(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       [(1) In 1999, the Institute of Medicine released a report \n     entitled To Err is Human that described medical errors as the \n     eighth leading cause of death in the United States, with as \n     many as 98,000 people dying as a result of medical errors \n     each year.\n       [(2) To address these deaths and injuries due to medical \n     errors, the health care system must identify and learn from \n     such errors so that systems of care can be improved.\n       [(3) In their report, the Institute of Medicine called on \n     Congress to provide legal protections with respect to \n     information reported for the purposes of quality improvement \n     and patient safety.\n       [(4) The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \n     of the Senate held 4 hearings in the 106th Congress and 1 \n     hearing in the 107th Congress on patient safety where experts \n     in the field supported the recommendation of the Institute of \n     Medicine for congressional action.\n       [(5) Myriad public and private patient safety initiatives \n     have begun. The Quality Interagency Coordination Taskforce \n     has recommended steps to improve patient safety that may be \n     taken by each Federal agency involved in health care and \n     activities relating to these steps are ongoing.\n       [(6) The research on patient safety unequivocally calls for \n     a learning environment, rather than a punitive environment, \n     in order to improve patient safety.\n       [(7) Voluntary data gathering systems are more supportive \n     than mandatory systems in creating the learning environment \n     referred to in paragraph (5) as stated in the Institute of \n     Medicine's report.\n       [(8) Promising patient safety reporting systems have been \n     established throughout the United States and the best ways to \n     structure and use these systems are currently being \n     determined, largely through projects funded by the Agency for \n     Healthcare Research and Quality.\n       [(9) The Department of Health and Human Services has \n     initiated several patient safety projects. The Joint \n     Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations \n     issued a patient safety standard that went into effect on \n     July 1, 2001, and the peer review organizations are \n     conducting ongoing studies of clinical performance \n     measurement of care delivered to beneficiaries under the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act.\n       [(10) Many organizations currently collecting patient \n     safety data have expressed a need for legal protections that \n     will allow them to review protected information so that they \n     may collaborate in the development and implementation of \n     patient safety improvement strategies. Currently, the State \n     peer review protections provide inadequate conditions to \n     allow the sharing of information to promote patient safety.\n       [(11) In 2001, the Institute of Medicine released a report \n     entitled Crossing the Quality Chasm that found that the \n     United States health care system does not consistently \n     deliver high quality care to patients.\n       [(b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       [(1) encourage a culture of safety and quality in the \n     United States health care system by providing for legal \n     protection of information reported voluntarily for the \n     purposes of quality improvement and patient safety; and\n       [(2) ensure accountability by raising standards and \n     expectations for continuous quality improvements in patient \n     safety through the actions of the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services.\n\n     [SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I commend Senator Gregg, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Dodd, Senator Frist, Senator Sessions, and all of the \nother Democratic and Republican members of our Health committee who \nhave devoted extraordinary energy and skill to finding bipartisan \nconsensus on the complex issue of medical errors and improving patient \nsafety.\n  For even one American to die from an avoidable medical error is a \ntragedy. That thousands die every year is a national disgrace--and an \nurgent call to action.\n  More than 4 years ago, the Institute of Medicine reported that \nmedical errors cause 98,000 deaths every year. The IOM recommended that \nhealth care professionals should be encouraged to report medical \nerrors, without fearing that their reports will be used against them. \nOur legislation implements this sensible recommendation by establishing \npatient safety organizations to analyze medical errors and recommend \nways to avoid them in future. The legislation also creates a legal \nprivilege for material reported to these safety organizations, while \nseeing that original records, such as a patient's chart, remain \naccessible to patients.\n  Drawing the boundaries of this privilege requires a careful balance. \nThe legislation is designed to create a culture in which medical \nprofessionals feel secure in reporting errors without fear of \npunishment, and it is right to do so. But we must be careful that in \ndoing so, we do not actually shield those who have negligently or \nintentionally caused harm to patients. We must also make sure not to \ninterfere with existing State laws on reporting.\n  The proposal that the Senate considers today has made substantial and \nwelcome progress on these and other important issues, and I look \nforward to making further progress in conference with our colleagues in \nthe House. I will do all I can to see that we continue the bipartisan \ncooperation that has allowed today's important action. I look forward \nto working with our colleagues in the House to produce a conference \nreport that includes the best features of the Senate and House \nproposals. I believe that several features of the bipartisan House \nlegislation are worth close consideration by the conference, including \nthe strong protections against conflict of interest.\n  I hope that this legislation is the beginning of our action on \npatient safety--not the conclusion. Other steps are also necessary. The \nFederal Government should play a leading role in the quest for \nimproving quality and safety for patients. Indeed, the very title of \none of IOM's most important reports, ``Leadership by Example,'' \nhighlights the central role that the Federal Government must play in \ntransforming the quality of health care.\n  I thank all my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, who came \ntogether and put their differences aside to bring this legislation to \nthe floor. This legislation sends a promising message that every \npatient in America will receive effective, high quality health care.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that today the Senate \nwill pass a measure that many have worked on for many years. The \nPatient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, and similar companion \nlegislation, have been the focus of considerable efforts by many of our \ncolleagues since 1999. I must thank Senator Gregg, Senator Kennedy and \nour other colleagues for all their hard work in bringing S. 720 before \nthe Senate today.\n  In 1999, Americans were shocked by the findings of the landmark \nInstitute of Medicine study on medical errors. As we all know, that \nstudy reported that the number of deaths associated with medical errors \ncould be as high 98,000 each year.\n  Most importantly, the report noted that more than half of these \ndeaths resulted from preventable errors--needless deaths that could \nhave been prevented if we only had a system in place that would help \nproviders learn from each other's mistakes.\n  The bill starts with a simple premise. Let's set up a system that \nhelps our health\n\n[[Page S8632]]\n\ncare providers learn from each other. Let's set up a system that \npromotes the reporting and analysis of medical errors. Let's set up a \nsystem that engenders the trust of providers and the patients they \nserve.\n  Of course, we also live in a complex society, one in which medical \nerrors that may have harmed a patient might also be the basis for \nlitigation. It is a right under our laws to seek a remedy when harmed, \nand we need to preserve access to certain information for this redress \nof grievances.\n  However, an unfortunate consequence of living in a litigious society \nis that hospitals and providers often feel that it's not in their best \ninterests to share information openly and honestly. We know, in fact, \nthat their attorneys and risk managers often advise them not to do so. \nSo, in order for our system to work, it needs to balance these \nsometimes competing demands.\n  The bill we are considering strikes this balance. It calls for the \ncreation of new entities we call Patient Safety Organizations that \nwould collect voluntarily reported patient safety data. This bill \nprovides the protections of confidentiality and privilege to that \npatient safety data, but the bill also sets definite limitations on \nwhat can be considered confidential and privileged.\n  This legislation does nothing to reduce or affect other Federal, \nState or local legal requirements pertaining to health related \ninformation. Nor does this bill alter any existing rights or remedies \navailable to injured patients. The bottom line is that this legislation \nneither strengthens nor weakens the existing system of tort and \nliability law.\n  Instead, the legislation before us creates a new, parallel system of \ninformation collection and analysis, designed to educate our doctors \nand protect patients' safety everywhere. This bill reflects difficult \nnegotiations and many compromises over almost 5 years of consideration. \nThrough the contributions of Members on both sides of the aisle, this \nlegislation has been greatly strengthened since I first introduced it \nback in the 106th Congress. I have appended these remarks with an \narticle I wrote that provides a more detailed description of the \nefforts that have been made to reduce medical errors and I ask \nunanimous consent that it will be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           First, Do No Harm\n\n       With the publication of the Institute of Medicine IOM \n     study, To Err is Human 1999, we were all reminded that \n     Hippocrates' maxim to ``first, do no harm'' is as relevant to \n     the practice of medicine today as it was in 400 B.C. The IOM \n     report was among the first to galvanize national attention on \n     the issue of patient safety when it reported that medical \n     errors contribute to approximately 100,000 patient deaths a \n     year. This startling and troubling statistic has been \n     verified in subsequent studies and cited in peer reviewed \n     articles in the leading journals of biomedical research, \n     including the Journal of the American Medical Association, \n     the Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine.\n       When I was Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions in 1999, I undertook several \n     hearings--five in all--to examine this issue and discuss the \n     recommendations of the To Err is Human report. The testimony \n     overwhelmingly agreed with several of the original Institute \n     of Medicine recommendations.\n       Perhaps the most important of these recommendations stress \n     that improving patient safety requires a learning environment \n     rather than a punitive environment; voluntary data gathering \n     systems as opposed to mandatory systems; and appropriate \n     legal protections--including confidentiality and privilege \n     from discovery--that allow for the review and analysis of \n     medical error information.\n       In response to this focused attention, a myriad of public \n     and private patient safety initiatives have begun. The \n     Department of Health and Human Services has initiated several \n     patient safety projects, including project grants funded by \n     the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ. The work \n     of the Veteran's Administration in developing and \n     implementing innovative patient safety systems--especially in \n     the area of medication management--has drawn attention from \n     throughout the country. In addition, the Quality Interagency \n     Coordination Taskforce has recommended steps to improve \n     patient safety that can be taken by each Federal agency \n     involved in health care, and agency activities to implement \n     these steps are ongoing.\n       In addition, several non-governmental organizations and \n     professional societies have ``stepped up to the plate'' of \n     patient safety. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of \n     Healthcare Organizations, the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, the \n     American Medical Association, and other health care providers \n     including the American Federation of Hospitals and American \n     Hospital Association have launched innovative efforts \n     dedicated to improving patient safety. However, many of the \n     organizations currently collecting patient safety data have \n     expressed the need for legal protections that will allow them \n     to review protected information so that they may collaborate \n     in the development and implementation of patient safety \n     improvement strategies.\n       The work of Lucien Leape, a member of the IOM panel and \n     adjunct professor of health policy at Harvard University, has \n     supported this view. Dr. Leape has argued persuasively that \n     we as a society will continue to have difficulty in reducing \n     medical errors and improving patient safety because our \n     institutions are ``still locked into a blame and punish \n     approach to errors and a focus on individual culpability,'' \n     and that ``the fear of malpractice litigation thus becomes a \n     major barrier to openly discussing and reporting errors.''\n       I have introduced legislation with my colleagues, Senators \n     Bill Frist, John Breaux, and Judd Gregg, which seeks to \n     address these concerns. The legislation raises expectations \n     for higher standards for continuous patient safety \n     improvement and it encourages a new and needed culture of \n     patient safety among health care providers and American \n     hospitals. The bill accomplishes these goals by establishing \n     appropriate legal protections for patient safety information \n     voluntarily shared among patient safety organizations and \n     providers. Our legislation reflects the belief that a culture \n     of patient safety can flourish only in an environment where \n     information, data, process, and recommendations enjoy legal \n     protection and privilege.\n       Because it appropriately addresses an obvious need and \n     concern, the Jeffords Patient Safety and Quality Improvement \n     Act has enjoyed widespread endorsement by hospital, patient, \n     doctor, and consumer advocacy organizations. This degree of \n     support underscores the broad appeal and essential nature of \n     this proposed legislation.\n       In the time since the release of To Err is Human, the \n     Congress has been unable to enact sensible legislation to \n     reduce medical errors and increase patient safety. However I \n     believe we can accomplish that goal this year. The House of \n     Representatives has already passed its version of patient \n     safety legislation and we are working to pass the Patient \n     Safety and Quality Improvement Act in the Senate. I am \n     hopeful that we can reconcile disagreements that have \n     previously stopped this legislation from moving forward and I \n     am committed to seeing that happen.\n       It has been three years since the release of the IOM \n     report. That means, based on the IOM's statistics, that an \n     additional 300,000 deaths and an untold number of injuries \n     have occurred from medical errors. We need to apply \n     Hippocrates' admonition to ``first, do no harm'' beyond the \n     medical community to the legislative community. We need to \n     pass legislation now that will help the health care community \n     stop the needless injury caused by unintentional medical \n     errors.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I offer my appreciation to the many contributions from \nChairman Gregg, Ranking Member Kennedy, and Senators Frist, Breaux, \nEnzi, Sessions, Dodd, and Bingaman.\n  We legislate many essential issues in the Congress, but rarely can we \nsay that what we do is a matter of life and death. This, however, is \none of those issues. The time to act is long overdue. This is an area \nwhere delay will lead to deaths that can be prevented. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to vote in support of this bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk be \nagreed to, the committee amendment as amended be agreed to, the bill as \namended be read a third time, and the HELP Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of H.R. 663, and the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration; provided that all after the enacting clause be stricken \nand the text of S. 720, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof; \nprovided further that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the Senate insist upon its amendment and request a conference \nwith the House of Representatives on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees with a ratio \nof 4 to 3.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that S. 720 be returned to the \nCalendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I was on the \nSenate floor a few weeks ago with the distinguished chairman of the \nHELP Committee. At that time there was an attempt to move the bill.\n  I said at that time this bill could be done. There were ways we could \naccomplish it. This is an extremely important piece of legislation. \nThrough the Chair to the distinguished majority leader, he knows better \nthan I. He is a\n\n[[Page S8633]]\n\nphysician. But from what I know of patient safety, this is an extremely \nimportant piece of legislation, and we have been able to do it. We are \ngoing to be able to go to conference. There has been agreement between \nthe Chair and the ranking member. I think this is an important step \nforward.\n  I would say, through the Chair to my friend who is not here, the \ndistinguished chairman of the HELP Committee, I am glad he brought this \nto the Senate's attention. I am glad we did not agree to what his \nunanimous consent request was at that time. But we were able to get it \ndone, and I am very happy for that.\n  I have no objection. This is an important piece of legislation. I now \nwish the conferees well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3568) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 663), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  The Presiding Officer (Mr. Enzi) appointed Mr. Gregg, Mr. Frist, Mr. \nEnzi, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Jeffords conferees \non the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do want to congratulate Senator Gregg, \nchairman of the HELP Committee, and ranking member, Senator Kennedy. \nThis is a piece of legislation that people can trace. Several years \nago, the Institute of Medicine did an outstanding report. We rely on \nthe Institute of Medicine again and again to objectively, in a \nnonpartisan way, look at a whole range of issues, from the financing of \nhealth care, health care delivery, preventive health care, acute \ntreatment, chronic treatment. They really respond very much to outside \nbodies like the Senate and do studies.\n  One great study they did--people have argued their numbers aren't \nexactly right, too high, too low--but it was that about 100,000 people \ndie every year from systems' lapses, medical errors. Those are, for the \nmost part, preventable deaths, if you improve the systems. This bill \ngoes right at the heart of improving the systems and does so in a way \nthat relies on individuals who may observe something that didn't work \nout, sharing that data with their peers in a way that they do not have \nto fear lawsuits.\n\n  Obviously, if there is wrongdoing, lawsuits would be appropriate. \nBut, if it is an error, minor error, or even a more serious error, it \ncan be addressed upfront in a way that you do not have to be afraid \nsomebody is going to come in and crush you from the outside.\n  I say that because it is a bipartisan bill. It went through the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pension Committee. I think the fundamental \nstructure of the bill went through the committee unanimously. It shows \ntremendous leadership.\n  There were disagreements on a few items that have been worked out, \nwith Senator Gregg's leadership, working with Senator Kennedy. With \nthat, we have a very good bill, a strong bill that will change systems \nof health care in a positive way, and clinics and hospitals and \nphysicians offices such that we can eliminate or greatly reduce the \nnumber of unnecessary medical errors that occur in large part through \nsystems approaches.\n  Just an example would be if somebody is on 10 different medicines and \nsomebody prescribes a new medicine. You don't know the interaction of \nthose medicines. You need a system to identify that. That sort of \norganized, commonsense approach to improve systems is made possible by \nthis bill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Senate this evening has taken a major \nstep toward better and safer health care for all Americans.\n  Tonight, we approved the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act. \nThe goal of this legislation is to allow health care providers some \nfreedom from legal fear so they can do what we all strive to do every \nday--learn from our mistakes.\n  This bill would create a framework through which hospitals, doctors, \nand other health care providers can work to improve health care quality \nin a protected legal environment. It would accomplish this by granting \nprivilege and confidentiality protections to health care providers to \nallow them to report health care errors and ``near misses'' to patient \nsafety organizations.\n  This bill would not permit anyone to hide information about a medical \nmistake. Lawyers would still have access to medical records and other \ninformation that would normally be discoverable in a legal proceeding. \nHowever, the bill would ensure that the analysis of that information by \npatient safety organizations would take place on a separate track in a \nprotected legal environment.\n  Under the bill, patient safety organizations would have the freedom \nto collect and analyze data on health care errors in confidence, and \nthen report their findings to the health care community. These findings \nwould help health care providers understand how mistakes happen in our \nhealth care system, and how to prevent them.\n  If we can reach an agreement in conference in the House and send this \nbill to the President, health care providers will be much more likely \nto share information about honest mistakes, because they will have some \nassurance that the analysis of their information won't result in a tidy \npackage of information that a personal injury lawyer could use against \nthem in court.\n  I express my appreciation for the hard work that the members of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions put into this bill, \nparticularly Chairman Gregg, Majority Leader Frist, the lead sponsor \nSenator Jeffords, and Senators Sessions and Kennedy.\n  I also thank the staff who worked so diligently over the course of \nthis Congress to craft this legislation, particularly Vince \nVentimiglia, Peggy Carlson, David Fisher, Dean Rosen, Jim Hippe, Sean \nDonohue, Megan Clarke, David Nexon, David Bowen, and of course Stephen \nNorthrup with my office.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8633-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     UNITED STATES-MOROCCO FREE-TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a few minutes ago we passed the Department \nof Defense appropriations bill, with a vote of 96 to 0. I want to take \nthis opportunity to congratulate the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, who is also chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, Senator \nStevens, and his ranking member, Senator Inouye, on bringing this first \nappropriations conference report for next year to completion.\n  This is a critically important bill. It provides nearly $418 billion \nin resources to our dedicated men and women in the global war on \nterrorism. The legislation will immediately make available $26.8 \nbillion to the Department of Defense as emergency appropriations to \ncover the costs associated with operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nupon signature by the President.\n  As GAO reported this week, these funds are needed, and they are \nneeded quickly, for the operation and maintenance and military \npersonnel through the end of the current fiscal year. Further, critical \nfunding is provided immediately to the Department of State for our \ndiplomatic programs, for our consular programs, and embassy security in \nIraq.\n\n[[Page S8634]]\n\n  There are other programs funded in this important legislation that I \nwant to thank the conferees for addressing. Mr. President, $95 million \nis provided immediately to USAID and the State Department to address \nthe tragic moral and humanitarian crisis that is occurring in the \nDarfur region of the Sudan.\n  I am hopeful Secretary Powell's and U.N. Secretary General Kofi \nAnnan's discussions today in New York will result in the Sudanese \nGovernment fulfilling its recent commitment to end the attacks in the \nDarfur region by disarming the Janjaweed.\n  I am particularly concerned our new Ambassador--our former colleague \nin this body, Senator John Danforth--is reported today as saying the \nsituation in Darfur is not getting better but is getting worse. Mr. \nPresident, $95 million in humanitarian and refugee assistance provided \nin this legislation is critical, but security and stability must be \nsecured in the region if this assistance which we are delivering is \never to really reach the people who are in need. As we all know, in the \nDarfur region, tens of thousands of people have died, and over a \nmillion people are directly affected in this very large western region \nin Sudan.\n  I wish it were not necessary, but it is good this legislation will \nalso provide $19 million to improve amputee care at the Walter Reed \nMedical Center for prosthetic limb development and applied research. \nMany of us in this body have had the opportunity to visit the men and \nwomen--the soldiers--who have been so directly impacted at Walter Reed. \nWe thank them for their service, we thank them for their patriotism, \nand we are gratified that this $19 million will at least address one \ndimension, and that is the dimension of amputee care at that wonderful, \noutstanding medical center.\n  There is over $18.2 billion for the Defense Health Program, an \nincrease of over $2.5 billion over last year's level. I am pleased this \nlegislation fully funds the 3.5-percent military pay raise and \nincreases our service men's and women's basic housing allowance for \nhousing, putting additional money into their pocket.\n\n  On the domestic front, it is appropriate this legislation also \nprovides a half billion dollars, $500 million, in emergency assistance \nto the Departments of Labor and Agriculture to address the growing cost \nof increasing forest fires this summer that we see in the West, as well \nas in Alaska.\n  We should also point out the legislation provides $50 million to \nBoston and to New York City to help defray some of the costs associated \nwith our upcoming national conventions.\n  Mr. President, this is critical legislation for our national \nsecurity. It is somewhat ironic that we voted on this legislation the \nsame day that the 9/11 Commission released its report because the first \nrecommendation of that report was that the U.S. Government must \nidentify and prioritize actual or potential terrorist sanctuaries. For \neach, it should have a realistic strategy to keep possible terrorists \ninsecure and on the run, using all elements of national power.\n  This legislation funds our national power. It is appropriate it is \nthe first appropriations bill this year to pass and to be sent to \nPresident Bush.\n  Again, I congratulate Chairman Stevens, as well as the ranking \nmember, and all of the committee members of the subcommittee and the \nentire Appropriations Committee for this outstanding piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8634-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8634-S8636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on a separate topic, I want to take a few \nmoments before going out on recess, looking back over the last several \nweeks and sharing with my colleagues some of the very positive things \nwe have been able to accomplish, positive issues and bills that will \nhave a direct impact on people throughout America and also, indeed, \nthroughout the world.\n  We have had a productive year. Among our many legislative \naccomplishments, the Senate passed the Laci and Conner's law, the Crime \nVictims Act, the child nutrition reauthorization, and the Internet \naccess tax moratorium. Each of these initiatives expresses our values. \nEach will help protect the American family.\n  In this past month, since the last recess, we have been able to build \non those successes. I commend my colleagues for their tremendous work, \ntheir hard work, each and every day over July.\n  We had the opportunity today to receive the report from the 9/11 \nCommission, and we have heard about it on the floor of the Senate \ntoday. We heard about it in our briefings today and yesterday. We have \nheard us all commend the 9/11 Commission for their efforts to produce a \ngenuinely bipartisan document. That is the way it was received. In \ntalking to the Commission members, that is the way each step along the \nway the 9/11 Commission acted: in a bipartisan manner.\n  I have not had the opportunity to read the whole report. It is a \nlarge book people have had on the floor today. But I have read the \nsummary and been in on the briefings. The only way I can describe it \nis, it provides a sobering account of the events leading up to \nSeptember 11. It offers valuable recommendations--one I just referred \nto a few moments ago--for how America can better protect itself, how we \ncan act to make America safer.\n  I again thank the Commission members. They have worked hard over the \nlast several months to produce this outstanding document, a document \nthat will be invaluable in the months ahead as we deliberate. There \nwill be a lot of deliberation, and the Democratic leader and I will \ncomment on that a little bit later in a colloquy on how best to \nstrengthen America's defenses.\n  In the meantime, as we wrap up for the August recess and the \nconventions, I would like to take a moment to highlight a few of the \nrecent legislative accomplishments. Yesterday I had the honor of \nattending the Rose Garden signing ceremony for Project Bioshield. It is \nan issue that was first proposed by the President in his 2003 State of \nthe Union Address to Congress. As with his broader efforts to defend \nthe homeland, President Bush has demonstrated once again his \ndetermination to protect the American people, to make America safer, \nand that is exactly what this bioshield legislation does.\n  Because of the President's leadership, the Nation's defenses against \nbiological threats, against chemical threats, against radiological \nthreats will be substantially strengthened. Project Bioshield is a \ngratifying example of, once again, both sides of the aisle working \ntogether in the best interest of the American people. I commend the \nPresident for his leadership in the initial proposal, Chairman Gregg, \nSenator Kennedy, and all of my colleagues who worked together to craft \nthis legislation, including Senator Hatch who was early to see the need \nfor this initiative.\n  Only 2 months ago our enemies detonated a sarin-laced roadside bomb \nin Iraq. Fortunately, their plan did not succeed in effectively \ndispersing the nerve agent. But it underscored the fact that these \nweapons exist, that we must be vigilant. Right here at home we had the \nanthrax assault, used as a weapon up and down the east coast not that \nlong ago, resulting in panic, paralysis, and death. We have had anthrax \nhere in the Nation's Capital. We have had ricin here in the Nation's \nCapital. Project Bioshield allows us to become proactive in developing \na whole range of countermeasures.\n  Earlier today--now about 12 hours ago--in keeping with our commitment \nto secure the homeland, the President signed another bill, a bill \ncalled the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2000. It is a product \nof a number of our colleagues. Our distinguished colleague from \nColorado, Senator Campbell, has worked on this bill for years and \nyears. It was developed in a bipartisan way, once again. On the House \nside, Congressman Duke Cunningham was a real leader on this particular \nbill. This bill had been a No. 1 legislative priority of our Nation's \nlaw enforcement officers, and I am proud of this bipartisan effort to \nsupport law enforcement and public safety. The law allows current and \nretired police officers to carry a concealed weapon in any of the 50 \nStates.\n  What that means is that America will not allow the tens of thousands \nof trained and certified law enforcement officers who are out there \nserving us and out there protecting us every day across the country to \nbe denied the potential opportunity to be called upon, if need be, with \nassistance. In a post-9/\n\n[[Page S8635]]\n\n11 world, it is imperative that we all use every resource possible to \nprotect ourselves, and that includes America's men and women in blue.\n\n  In addition to our efforts to improve security, this month we took \nimportant steps globally in terms of our economic standing in the \nworld. Six days ago we passed the Australia free-trade agreement, and \nearlier this week we passed the Morocco free-trade agreement. I had the \nopportunity to talk to the King of Morocco today and reiterated to him \nthe plus this trade agreement will be for the United States and workers \nin the United States, both the Australia and Morocco free-trade bills, \nbut also to reiterate what the President of the United States had told \nthe King of Morocco when he said: Trade is an important part of good \nforeign policy. It is an important part of making sure Americans can \nfind jobs.\n  The Australia agreement has a huge impact right here in the United \nStates of America. It is expected to create as many as 40,000 new jobs. \nWe can expect an increase of about $2 billion annually in trade for the \nUnited States and Australia by 2010. At $9 billion, our trade surplus \nwith Australia counts as the largest with any nation. More than 99 \npercent of our exports to Australia will enter duty-free once this \nagreement goes into effect. In my home State of Tennessee, Australia is \na powerful market, a large market for our goods. In fact, Tennessee \nexports more to Australia than to France.\n  With regard to Morocco, more than 95 percent of bilateral trade in \nconsumer and industrial products will become duty-free. The Morocco \nagreement is the best yet of any United States free-trade agreement \nwith a developing country.\n  When it comes to a developing continent, earlier this month the \nPresident signed another very powerful bill in terms of its impact in \nAfrica. The bill was the African Growth and Opportunity Act. I am \nespecially pleased by this legislation. I have taken advantage of the \nopportunity of traveling to Africa on a regular basis where one could \nsee upfront, firsthand, the direct impact of this Africa Growth and \nOpportunity Act when it was initially passed--now several years ago--\nthe impact it has had in the stimulation of jobs, creation of work. And \nfor me, most importantly, it creates hope for a continent that \notherwise becomes quite discouraged as it is plagued by so many other \nhuge challenges.\n  The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, which we have passed and which \nis now the law of the land, is a win-win for the United States. It is a \nwin for the African continent, and I would say a win-win for the world. \nThe legislation has not only created new investment opportunities for \nAmerican businesses, but it has helped create over 150,000 African \njobs. When President Museveni from Uganda was here, he said: You use \nthe figure of 150,000, our best estimates are that the impact is not \ncreation of 150,000 African jobs, but 300,000 African jobs.\n  It has helped to pump more than $340 million into the African \neconomies and has forged a place for Africa in the global trade market. \nI hope other countries will look at the success of this program and \nreexamine their trade preferences toward Africa. I hope other countries \nwill take this opportunity, looking at the leadership of the United \nStates, to study their own trade relations with the region and do what \nwe have done in this country, and that is improve them.\n  Domestically, over the last several weeks we have passed a lot of \nlegislation. In one area we had a significant breakthrough in \nconfirming one of President Bush's judicial nominees. I mention this \none in particular because the confirmation of Judge Jay Leon Holmes, \nwho was confirmed to the U.S. District Court, ultimately had bipartisan \nsupport. But it took about 18 months of hard work, where there was a \nlot of attack and a lot of obstruction. Ultimately, Judge Holmes was \nconfirmed this month.\n\n  Unfortunately, today our Democratic colleagues voted against \npermitting three circuit court judges from getting an up-or-down vote. \nJudge Henry Saad, Judge David McKeague, and Judge Richard Griffin all \nreceived support from a majority of Senators, but not this new \nthreshold of having to get a supermajority of 60 votes which is needed \nto break these unprecedented filibusters we have had this session.\n  This brings to 10 the number of judges filibustered and, I would \nargue, as was argued earlier on the floor today, that is 10 too many. \nWe would say that any is too many; that each of these judges deserves \nan up-or-down vote. People can vote how they want, for the judge or \nagainst the judge, but at least we should be given the opportunity to \nvote.\n  We will also continue to fight for legislation that keeps America's \neconomic recovery rolling along. We tried recently with class action--\nwe are going to come back to class action. I am not sure exactly when \nthat timing will be, but I can tell you there is strong bipartisan \nsupport, and I think this body needs to come back as soon as practical \nand address class action reform.\n  I was disappointed by the other side's decision to stop this \nimportant legislation because both sides--again, this is a bipartisan \nbill, and I am confident it can pass with more than 60 votes. These \nclass action lawsuits, as we heard now 2 weeks ago on the floor, have \ngrown exponentially. One recent survey found State court class action \nfilings skyrocketed by 1,300 percent in 10 years.\n  The result of all of this is a glut of claims that ends up clogging \nthe courts, ultimately wasting taxpayers' dollars and inhibiting the \ninnovation and entrepreneurship we all know is so critical to job \ncreation.\n  Election year politics should not get in the way of strengthening our \neconomy. It is our duty to serve America's best interests and not to be \nserving special interests.\n  When we return after the recess, we have a real challenge, and the \nchallenge is to address all of the appropriations bills. I have been in \nconversation with the Democratic leader, the Democratic leadership, and \nChairman Stevens, who has been in discussion with Senator Byrd, and all \nabout the recognition that the month of September is going to focus, in \nlarge part, on these appropriations bills.\n  We also need to turn our attention to finishing the FSC/ETI bill, the \nJOBS bill that we need to get to conference. We have actually appointed \nSenate conferees, and the House will be appointing their conferees. I \nam not sure if they will appoint them later tonight or when we get \nback. It is a very important bill.\n  We have had a lot of discussions over the course of the day on the \nhighway bill, and I think some progress, indeed, has been made on the \nhighway bill. It is going to be challenging to do because we are a long \nway from any sort of consensus on that bill, but we all know how \nimportant it is.\n  Although it has not been on the floor of the Senate every day, at \nsome point there are discussions on the importance of having a national \nenergy plan. I take this opportunity to mention it because a lot of \npeople have said: This was filibustered; that was blocked; you are not \ngoing to be able to come back and address that legislation. Indeed, we \nhave only probably 20 legislative days left in this session, but as \nlong as people keep working in a bipartisan way, we have the potential \nfor more fully addressing our energy challenges.\n\n  All of these pieces of legislation fit into growing our economy, \ncontinuing our economic recovery, accelerating it, as well as security. \nThe JOBS bill alone, the FSC/ETI or so-called JOBS bill, will protect \nmore than a million high-quality manufacturing jobs in the United \nStates. Our roads, ports, energy supply, and economic vitality are all \ncritical to our security and to our safety. We have to have a strong \ninfrastructure to be safe and secure, to be able to withstand threats \nfrom without.\n  I see my colleague from Kansas who has a very important statement to \nmake that refers, in part, to some of my comments earlier about the \nDarfur region, I expect, but let me comment on one issue before turning \nthe floor over to him. It is an issue that again centers on an \ninternational issue, and that is Cambodia.\n  Last Sunday, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen delivered a nationally \ntelevised speech accusing democratic opposition party leader Sam Rainsy \nand his fellow parliamentarians of organizing an armed insurgency to \noverthrow the government. Concerned for their safety, a number of these \nleaders fled the country.\n  I was in touch with my son by e-mail because my son Jonathan happened \nto\n\n[[Page S8636]]\n\nbe in Cambodia at the time and witnessed these events. These \nallegations appear designed to intimidate the democratic opposition \nthere. We should all be disturbed by the rhetoric which appears to be \ndesigned to subvert democracy by these threats and by this \nintimidation.\n  The international community has a great interest in ensuring that \nCambodia's fragile progress toward democracy continues. Cambodia has \npaid too high a price under authoritarian rule in the past. We cannot \nand will not accept the use of fear as an instrument of the state. \nCambodia has made commitments to the international community to respect \nhuman rights, preserve the rule of law, and uphold democracy. I call \nupon the international community to watch these events very carefully.\n  There is a lot to do when we return in September. I know we are going \nto have a very busy fall legislative session. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues, and I look forward to doing the business of the \nAmerican people and moving America forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8636-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8636-S8639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I appreciate the \nmajority leader identifying the successes and what we need to be \nworking on. I also appreciate the first part of his speech when he \ntalked about the Sudan, which is something I wish to address for my \ncolleagues.\n  The House of Representatives has just passed 422 to 0--they rarely do \nthings quite in that fashion--a resolution calling what is taking place \nin Sudan genocide--genocide, the killing of a group of people purposely \nby a government, by a group.\n  I do not think we have ever done that before in the middle of a \ngenocide as it is taking place. We have always adopted a resolution \nafterward, and once the genocide has occurred, we have said: That is \nterrible; that should not have happened; and, oh, by the way, it was \ngenocide. They have taken a bold step, the right step, the proper step \nfor the first time to say, while we are in the middle of this crisis, \nlet's call it genocide now, put pressure on the international community \nto act and address it.\n  I say to my colleagues tonight, we have virtually the identical \nresolution in front of this body that we are seeking to move through by \nunanimous consent. I hope they will consider it and let it through. At \nthis point in time in our sessions, people hold up everything: I am not \ngoing to let anything get on through here. I plead with my colleagues, \npeople who are watching, who are monitoring the Chamber, if you are \nconsidering that on this resolution, please pull it off and please let \nthis one pass on through so both the House and the Senate can speak \nwith clarity and call the situation in western Sudan, this Darfur \nregion, genocide, and stop the killing.\n  While the world debates, people die in Darfur, and that is what is \ntaking place today. I was there about 3 weeks ago and 30,000 had died \nalready. Over 300 villages had been burned out, and about a million \npeople were in refugee camps in western Sudan and Chad. The people were \nin horrific condition and in a very fragile state. They were willing to \nreturn to their villages if security could return to the region, but an \narmed Arab militia was strong through the region, called the Janjaweed, \nwhich are men on horses and camels in some cases, with guns. They go in \nand burn out villages, shooting and killing the men, raping the women, \nand driving people into refugee camps.\n  These are deplorable conditions which, if they are not eased, if the \nsituation does not improve, our own Agency for International \nDevelopment projects that at a minimum 300,000 will die. We are at \n30,000 now. We project 300,000 will die if everything goes well from \nthis point forward, and it could go up from there. That is where we are \nright now: 30,000 dead, projecting 300,000 in the next 6 to 9 months, \nand it could go above that very easily.\n  We have a chance, we really have a moment, that we can actually get \nit right before they die. It was just a couple of months 10 years ago \nthat in Rwanda we saw 800,000 people die. We said after that, ``never \nagain.'' Well, now we have 30,000 and we are headed to 300,000. Are we \ngoing to look back on this one and say, ``never again,'' or are we \ngoing to get in on this one now and say, ``no, let us stop it''?\n  It is a fairly simple solution, putting pressure on the international \ncommunity, putting pressure on the African Union, to bring in troops to \nstabilize this area. It cannot be done by the Government of Khartoum. \nThey have dirty hands. They have armed the Arab militias that are going \ninto the region. It cannot be done by the Arab militias. They are \nkilling the African villagers in this region. They are doing ethnic \ncleansing and raping the women.\n  We interviewed a number of different women who had been raped. All of \nthem said that their rapist said to them: We want to create lighter \nskinned babies. In that region, the paternity determines the ethnicity \nof the child.\n  We cannot let this one keep going when we know it is happening and we \nhave a way to stop it. I plead with my colleagues, just look at this. \nLet this one move on through, then both the House and the Senate will \nhave spoken and called it genocide. We will put pressure on the \ninternational community to act, put pressure on Kofi Annan at the U.N., \nput pressure on the African Union to address this situation before the \nnumbers keep mounting. We can do this.\n  I will show briefly to my colleagues new pictures Congressman Frank \nWolf and I took, as I say, about 3 weeks ago when we were in the \nregion. This is a typical burned-out village that we saw. We drove by a \nnumber of these. These are some of the leaders of the group who are \ntrying to come back to the village. The raids all happened very \nsimilarly. Bombers came in, supplied by the Sudanese Government. \nHelicopters--I will show a picture of one of those in just a little \nbit--supported by the Sudanese Government would come in in an air \nattack. Then the Janjaweed, the Arab militias, would come back on \ncamels, horseback, guns blazing, burn the various houses, kill the men, \nrape the women, pillage, plunder, and steal. As we can see from this \npicture, this is a sparse and difficult climate in which to live. They \ndrive people out of their villages, away from their wells, and people \ndie.\n\n  This next picture is one of the helicopters used in these raids. It \nhas guns mounted on the front. This is old Soviet equipment, yet it \nworks very well in this region when the people they are going against \nare unarmed altogether. They will go in on these runs. We saw this \nparticular helicopter within 100 yards of a Sudanese Government \noutpost, within 50 yards of a Janjaweed encampment.\n  So when the Sudanese Government is saying, Well, it is the Janjaweed \nthat is doing it and we are going to try to disarm them, we are going \nto control them, they are arming them, this is just them doing \nsomething they have done in the south for years, where they arm a \nmilitia so they can have some deniability that it is their hands, but \nin fact it is clearly them who are conducting this.\n  The next picture I want to show is a woman who has been shot. She is \nan amputee. We visited with her. We can see where her leg was shot and \namputated.\n  This final picture is chilling. We went into three different refugee \ncamps. Fortunately, children are children everywhere, and they will \nlighten up. They will be lively. They have smiles on their faces. In \none of the camps they were doing an art project to encourage kids to \nmake different things out of clay or actually out of mud. They were \ndoing the soldiers on horses who had attacked them with guns. They made \nthese little mud figures showing what had taken place. We also have \ndrawings that were brought back, drawn by the children, of villages \nbeing burned. There is nothing quite like seeing the world through the \neyes of a child. It is a very dangerous world and a deadly world these \nchildren have seen.\n  I have a trip report, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n\n     Trip Report--Senator Sam Brownback and Congressman Frank Wolf.\n\n\n                darfur, western sudan--june 27-29, 2004\n\n       It was just 10 years ago--in 1994--when the world stood by \n     and watched as more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis were \n     systematically murdered in Rwanda by rival extremist Hutus.\n       When the killing finally ended after 100 days--and the \n     horrific images of what had taken place were broadcast around \n     the globe--world leaders acknowledged it was genocide, \n     apologized for failing to intervene, and vowed ``never \n     again.''\n       That pledge from the international community is being put \n     to the test today in western Sudan, where an estimated 30,000 \n     black African Muslims have been murdered and more than 1 \n     million have been driven from their tribal lands and forced \n     to live in one of 129 refugee camps scattered across the \n     western provinces of Darfur. More than 160,000 have fled \n     across the border to Chad.\n       The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide describes genocide as \n     acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, \n     national, ethnic, racial or religious groups, such as: \n     Killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or \n     mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting \n     on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about \n     physical destruction in whole or in part; Imposing measures \n     intended to prevent births within the group, or forcibly \n     transferring children of the group to another group.\n       Having recently spent 3 days and 2 nights (June 27-29) in \n     Darfur, we believe what is happening there may very well meet \n     this test.\n       During our trip we visited 5 refugee camps: Abu Shouk; \n     Tawilah; Krinding; Sisi, and Mornay--all sprawling tent \n     cities jam-packed with thousands of displaced families and \n     fast becoming breeding grounds for disease and sickness.\n       We drove past dozens of pillaged villages and walked \n     through what was left of four that were burned to the ground.\n       We heard countless stories about rape, murder and plunder.\n       We even watched the barbarous men who are carrying out \n     these attacks--Arab militiamen called Janjaweed--sitting \n     astride camels and horses just a short distance from where \n     young and old have sought what they had hoped would be a safe \n     harbor.\n       Janjaweed is roughly translated in Arabic as ``wild men on \n     horses with G-3 guns'' Ruthless, brutal killers, the \n     Janjaweed have instigated a reign of terror on Darfur--a \n     region about the size of Texas--for more than a year. They \n     kill men. They rape women. They abduct children. They torch \n     villages. They dump human corpses and animal carcasses in \n     wells to contaminate the water. Their mandate is essentially \n     doing whatever necessary to force the black African Muslims \n     from their land to never return.\n       It is clearly the intent of Janjaweed to purge the region \n     of darker-skinned Africans, in particular members of the Fur, \n     Zaghawa, and Massaleit tribes.\n\n\n                           janjaweed mandate\n\n       From where does this mandate come? The Government of Sudan \n     disavows supporting the Janjaweed. Some officials in Khartoum \n     even deny the existence of a humanitarian crisis in the \n     region. Yet the facts prove otherwise. We witnessed the \n     destruction. We heard horrific accounts of violence and \n     intimidation. We talked to rape victims. We saw the scars on \n     men who had been shot. We watched mothers cradle their sick \n     and dying babies, hoping against all odds that their children \n     would survive. We saw armed Janjaweed waiting to prey on \n     innocent victims along the perimeter of refugee camps.\n       To hear the vivid, heartrending descriptions of the attacks \n     it is clear the Janjaweed have the support--and the \n     approval--of the Government of Sudan to operate with \n     impunity. The same stories were repeated at every camp we \n     visited. The raids would happen early in the morning. First \n     comes the low rumble of a Soviet-made Antonov plane--flown by \n     Sudanese pilots--to bomb the village. Next come helicopter \n     gunships--again, flown by Sudanese pilots--to strafe the \n     village with the huge machine guns mounted on each side. \n     Sometimes the helicopters would land and unload supplies \n     for the Janjaweed. They would then be reloaded with booty \n     confiscated from a village. One man told us he saw cows \n     being loaded onto one helicopter. Moments later, the \n     Janjaweed, some clad in military uniforms, would come \n     galloping in on horseback and camels to finish the job by \n     killing, raping, stealing and plundering.\n       Walking through the burned out villages we could tell the \n     people living there had little or no time to react. They left \n     everything they owned--lanterns, cookware, water jugs, \n     pottery, plows--and ran for their lives. There was not even \n     time to stop and bury their dead.\n       The Janjaweed made certain that there would be nothing left \n     for the villagers to come home to. Huts were torched. \n     Donkeys, goats and cows were stolen, slaughtered or dumped \n     into wells to poison the water. Grain containers were \n     destroyed. In one village we saw where the Janjaweed even \n     burned the mosque.\n       Only the lucky ones--mostly women and children--made it out \n     alive.\n\n\n                            ethnic cleansing\n\n       What is happening in Darfur is rooted in ethnic cleansing. \n     Religion has nothing to do with what has unfolded over the \n     last year.\n       No black African is safe in Darfur. Security is non-\n     existent. The Janjaweed are everywhere. Outside the camps. \n     Inside the camps. They walk freely through the marketplace in \n     Geneina, a town in far western Darfur, with guns slung over \n     their shoulders. One shopkeeper, we were told, was shot in \n     the head by a Janjaweed because he wasn't willing to lower \n     the price of a watermelon.\n       Government of Sudan military and security forces also are \n     omnipresent. At each of the places we visited we were either \n     trailed or escorted by a mixture of military regulars, police \n     forces and government ``minders.'' There have been reports \n     that the government has been folding the Janjaweed into its \n     regular forces as a way to disguise and protect them. At two \n     of the camps we visited, we were told the government had \n     inserted spies to report on what was said or to threaten \n     those who talked. We were told the ``minders'' repeatedly \n     scolded refugees and told them in Arabic to shut up. Yet, \n     even with these threats, refugees in every camp we visited \n     were eager to tell their stories.\n       It should be understood that the Janjaweed are not \n     ``taking'' the land from the black Muslim farmers they are \n     terrorizing. The Janjaweed, whose historical roots are part \n     of the region's roving nomads who have battled with the \n     African farmers for generations, are employing a government-\n     supported scorched earth policy to drive them out of the \n     region--and perhaps to extinction. It also was clear that \n     only villages inhabited by black Africans were being \n     targeted. Arab villages sitting just next to African ones \n     miles from the nearest towns have been left unscathed.\n       On our first day in the region, we met with local \n     Government of Sudan officials in the town of El Fasher, a \n     two-hour plane ride west of Khartoum. They blame the crisis \n     in the region on two black African rebel groups--the Sudan \n     Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement \n     (JEM)--who started an uprising in February 2003 over what \n     they regarded as unjust treatment by the government in their \n     struggle over land and resources with Arab countrymen. The \n     rebel forces actually held El Fasher for a short period last \n     year. A cease-fire was agreed to in April 2004 between the \n     rebel groups and the Government of Sudan, but the Janjaweed \n     have continued to carry out attacks with the support and \n     approval of Khartoum.\n       While local government officials in El Fasher were adamant \n     in saying there is no connection between the Government of \n     Sudan and the Janjaweed, whom they called ``armed bandits,'' \n     the militiamen we saw did not look like skilled pilots who \n     could fly planes or helicopters.\n       We also were told the Janjaweed are well armed and well \n     supplied. If they are traditional nomads, how are they \n     getting modern automatic weapons, and, more importantly, from \n     whom? They also are said to have satellite phones, an \n     astonishing fact considering most of the people in the far \n     western provinces of Darfur have probably never even seen \n     or walked on a paved road.\n       The impunity under which the Janjaweed operate was most \n     telling as we approached the airport in Geneina on our last \n     day in the region for our flight back to Khartoum. In plain \n     sight was an encampment of Janjaweed within shouting distance \n     of a contingent of Government of Sudan regulars. No more than \n     200 yards separated the two groups. Sitting on the tarmac \n     were two helicopter gunships and a Soviet-made Antonov plane.\n\n\n                          HUMANITARIAN CRISIS\n\n       The situation in Darfur is being described as the worst \n     humanitarian crisis in the world today. We agree. But sadly, \n     and with a great sense of urgency, things are only going to \n     worsen. Some say that even under the best of circumstances, \n     as many as 300,000 Darfuris forced from their homes are \n     expected to die from malnutrition and diarrhea or diseases \n     such as malaria and cholera in the coming months. Measles \n     have already spread through Abu Shouk, a large refugee camp \n     outside El Fasher.\n       According to some predictions, the death toll could reach \n     as high as 1 million by next year. The Darfuri farmers have \n     missed another planting season and will now be dependent on \n     grain and other food stuffs provided by the international \n     community for at least another year. The impending rainy \n     season presents its own set of problems, making roads \n     impassable for food deliveries and the likelihood of disease \n     dramatically increasing with the heavy rains.\n       The potential for a crisis of catastrophic proportions is \n     very real, especially since none of the villagers we talked \n     to at the refugee camps believed they will be able to go back \n     to their homes anytime soon. Having been brutally terrorized \n     by the Janjaweed and fearing for their lives, they do not \n     believe Government of Sudan officials who say it is safe to \n     return to their villages. We heard stories of some families \n     who went back to their villages only to return to the camps a \n     week later for fear of being attacked again.\n       The attacks have traumatized thousands of young children. \n     In an effort to cope with what they have endured, programs \n     have been established in the camps to help the young boys and \n     girls deal with their psychological scars. Part of the \n     program encourages them to draw pictures of what they have \n     seen. The crayon drawings are chilling. Huts on fire, red \n     flames shooting through the roof. Planes and helicopters \n     flying overhead shooting bullets. Dead bodies. Depictions, \n     perhaps, of their mother or father.\n\n[[Page S8638]]\n\n       We also saw a group of children who had made clay figures \n     of men on camels and horseback attacking villages. There is \n     no way to measure the impact of these atrocities on the \n     thousands of children living in these camps. Their lives are \n     forever scarred.\n\n\n                      DIFFICULT LIFE IN IDP CAMPS\n\n       Abu Shouk was the first of five IDP (Internally Displaced \n     People) camps we visited. More than 40,000 people live in \n     this sprawling tent city, created in April after El Fasher \n     was overrun with homeless families. Methodically laid out \n     with water stations, a health clinic, a supplemental feeding \n     station and crude latrines, it is being hailed as a ``model'' \n     by humanitarian relief workers in the region.\n       However, aid workers at Abu Shouk are deeply distressed. \n     They observe that malnutrition and child mortality rates at \n     this ``model'' camp have reached alarming levels. They fear \n     what may be happening at the other camps, especially in the \n     more remote areas of Darfur that have not been reached by \n     humanitarian groups.\n       Life in the camps is difficult. Crude shelters made from \n     straw and sticks and covered with plastic sheeting stretch as \n     far as the eye can see. Families arriving at the camps--\n     almost all after walking for days in the hot sun from their \n     now abandon villages--are given only a tarp, a water jug, \n     cookware and a small amount of grain.\n       The sanitary conditions are wretched. The sandy conditions \n     make building latrines difficult. At Mornay, the largest of \n     the IDP camps in Darfur with more than 70,000 inhabitants, it \n     was hard not to step in either human or animal feces as we \n     walked. In a few weeks, when the heavy rains begin, excrement \n     will flow across the entire camp. Mortality from diarrhea, \n     which we were told represents one-third of the deaths in the \n     camps, will only increase.\n       To their credit, all the non-governmental organizations \n     (NGOs) that have been allowed to operate in Darfur have \n     done--and continue to do--a tremendous job under extremely \n     trying circumstances. The Government of Sudan has repeatedly \n     thrown up roadblocks to bringing in aid. It has denied or \n     slowed visa processing for relief workers. It has kept aid \n     vehicles locked up in customs for weeks at a time. It has \n     blocked relief groups from bringing in radios. It has limited \n     access to certain regions of the country. All this has made \n     getting medicine, food and other humanitarian supplies, like \n     plastic sheeting and water jugs, an uphill battle. While the \n     Government of Sudan plays its games, people are dying as \n     needed aid sits on tarmacs.\n       As we approached the Mornay camp on the last day of our 3-\n     day trip, we were stopped by Government of Sudan soldiers and \n     security officers. They followed us throughout the camp, \n     watching with whom we talked. Amazingly, their presence did \n     not inhibit the refugees from recanting the horrors from \n     which they escaped and, for some--mostly women--continue to \n     endure.\n       The men said while they feel somewhat secure inside the \n     confines of the camps, they dare not venture outside for fear \n     of being shot or killed by the Janjaweed. They showed us \n     scars on their arms and legs of the gunshot wounds they \n     received while escaping from their villages. They are \n     despondent over the fact that they are unable to provide food \n     for their families because they cannot farm their fields. \n     They expressed utter sadness and outrage about their wives \n     and daughters who venture outside the borders of the camp to \n     collect firewood and straw, knowing the fate that awaits them \n     at the hands of the Janjaweed. Life and death decisions are \n     made every day: send the men out and risk death or send the \n     women out and risk rape.\n       Rape is clearly another weapon being used by the Janjaweed. \n     Rapes, we were told, happen almost daily to the women who \n     venture outside the confines of the camps in search of \n     firewood and straw. They leave very early in the morning, \n     hoping to evade their tormentors before they awake. With the \n     camps swelling in size and nearby resources dwindling, they \n     often walk several miles. The farther the women go from the \n     camp, the greater the risk of being attacked by the \n     Janjaweed. As we approached Mornay, we saw a number of \n     Janjaweed resting with their camels and horses along the \n     perimeter of the camp, easily within walking distance.\n       We heard the horrific story of 4 young girls--two of whom \n     were sisters--who had been raped just days before we arrived. \n     They had left the camp to collect straw to feed the family's \n     donkey when they were attacked. They said their attackers \n     told them they were slaves and that their skin was too dark. \n     As they were being raped, they said the Janjaweed told them \n     they were hoping to make more lighter-skinned babies.\n       One of the 4 women assaulted, too shy to tell her story in \n     front of men, privately told a female journalist traveling \n     with us that if anyone were to find out she had been raped, \n     she would never be able to marry.\n       We were told that some of the rape victims were being \n     branded on their back and arms by the Janjaweed, permanently \n     labeling the women. We heard the chilling account of the rape \n     of a 9-year-old girl.\n       We also received a letter during our trip from a group of \n     women who were raped. To protect them from further attacks, \n     we purposely do not mention where they are from or list their \n     names. The translation is heartbreaking:\n       ``Messrs. Members of the U.S. Congress\n       ``Peace and the mercy and the blessings of God be upon you.\n       ``We thank you for your help and for standing by the weak \n     of the world, wherever they are found. We welcome you to the \n     . . . region, which was devastated by the Janjaweed, or what \n     is referred to as the government `horse- and camel-men,' on \n     Friday . . . 2004, when they caused havoc by killing and \n     burning and committing plunder and rape. This was carried out \n     with the help of the government, which used the . . . region \n     as an airport and supplied the Janjaweed with munitions and \n     supplies. So we, the raped woman of the . . . region, would \n     like to explain to you what has happened and God is our best \n     witness.\n       ``We are 44 raped women. As a result of that savagery, some \n     of us became pregnant, some have aborted, some took out their \n     wombs and some are still receiving medical treatment. \n     Hereunder, we list the names of the raped women and state \n     that we have high hopes in you and the international \n     community to stand by us and not to forsake us to this \n     tyrannical, brutal and racist regime, which wants to \n     eliminate us racially, bearing in mind that 90 percent of our \n     sisters at . . . are widows.\n       ``[Above] are the names of some of the women raped in the . \n     . . region. Some of these individuals are now at . . ., some \n     are at Towilah and some are at Abu Shouk camps. Everything we \n     said is the absolute truth. These girls were raped in front \n     of our fathers and husbands.\n       ``We hope that you and the international community will \n     continue to preserve the balance of the peoples and nations.\n       ``Thank you.\n       ``From: The raped women at . . .''\n       These rape victims have nowhere to turn. Even if they \n     report the attacks to the police, they know nothing will \n     happen. The police, the military and the Janjaweed all appear \n     to be acting in coordination.\n\n\n                       DIRE SITUATION IS MAN-MADE\n\n       The situation in Darfur is dire, and from what we could \n     see, it is entirely man-made. These people who had managed to \n     survive even the severest droughts and famines during the \n     course of their long history are now in mortal danger of \n     being wiped out simply because of the darker shade of their \n     skin color.\n       The first step in resolving this crisis is disarming the \n     Janjaweed. It must be done swiftly and universally. If not, \n     the Janjaweed will just bury their weapons in the sand, wait \n     for the pressure from the international community to lift, \n     then reinitiate their reign of terror.\n       A system of justice overseen by outside monitors must also \n     be implemented. The heinous, murderous acts carried out by \n     the Janjaweed cannot go unpunished. War crimes and crimes \n     against humanity clearly have been--and continue to be--\n     committed. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\n       Over the course of 3 days, we saw the worst of man's \n     inhumanity to man, but we also saw the best of what it means \n     to be human: mothers waiting patiently for hours in the hot \n     sun so that they could try to save their babies; NGO aid \n     workers and volunteer doctors feeding and caring for the sick \n     and the dying, and the courage and bravery of men, women and \n     children eager to talk to us so that we would know their \n     story.\n       The world made a promise in 1994 to never again allow the \n     systematic destruction of a people or race. ``Never again''--\n     words said, too, after the Holocaust. In Darfur, the \n     international community has a chance to stop history from \n     repeating itself. It also has a chance to end this nightmare \n     for those who have found a way to survive. If the \n     international community fails to act, the next cycle of this \n     crisis will begin. The destiny facing the people of Darfur \n     will be death from hunger or disease.\n       When will the death of innocent men, women and children--\n     who want nothing more in this world than to be left alone to \n     farm their land and provide for their families--be too much \n     for the conscience of the international community to bear?\n       We sat with the victims. We heard their mind-numbing \n     stories. We saw their tears. Now the world has seen the \n     pictures and heard the stories. We cannot say we did not know \n     when history judges the year 2004 in Darfur.\n\n\n                            RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n     The Government of Sudan\n       The Government of Sudan should immediately implement key \n     provisions of the April 8, cease-fire agreement, including: \n     the cessation of attacks against civilians; disarming the \n     Janjaweed, and removing all barriers to the admittance of \n     international aid into Darfur. There should be a strict \n     timetable holding the Government of Sudan accountable for \n     implementing these provisions.\n       The Government of Sudan should renew a dialogue with the \n     Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement \n     to discuss the political, economic and social roots of the \n     crisis.\n     The African Union\n       Additional cease-fire observers should be deployed and \n     violations of the cease-fire reported immediately. The \n     current number of 270 observers is inadequate to monitor the \n     activity of an area the size of Texas.\n     The United States\n       The United States should publicly identify those \n     responsible for the atrocities occurring\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n\n     in Darfur, including officials and other individuals of the \n     Government of Sudan, as well as Janjaweed militia commanders, \n     and impose targeted sanctions that include travel bans and \n     the freezing of assets.\n       The president should instruct the U.S. representative to \n     the United Nations to seek an official investigation and hold \n     accountable officials of the Government of Sudan and \n     government-supported militia groups responsible for the \n     atrocities in Darfur.\n     The United Nations\n       The United Nations should pass a strong Security Council \n     resolution condemning the Government of Sudan. It should call \n     for: an immediate end to the attacks; the immediate disarming \n     of the Janjaweed; the immediate protection of civilians by \n     beginning a review of the security of refugees in Darfur; the \n     determination of the feasibility of sending in U.N. \n     protection forces; an immediate review of bringing legal \n     action against those responsible for the policies of ethnic \n     cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur, \n     and the imposition of targeted sanctions that include travel \n     bans and the freezing of assets.\n       The United Nations should immediately deploy human rights \n     monitors to Darfur.\n       The protection of civilians and access to humanitarian aid \n     should be a primary concern; the Security Council must be \n     prepared to establish a no fly zone if the cease-fire \n     continues to be violated.\n       The United Nations together with other organizations should \n     continue to coordinate a relief strategy for getting aid into \n     those regions of Darfur that have yet to receive humanitarian \n     assistance. Alternative routes and means of delivering aid \n     should be considered if the Government of Sudan continues to \n     impede deliveries.\n       The United Nations should take immediate steps to seek the \n     removal of Sudan from the United Nations Commission on Human \n     Rights.\n       The United Nations should set a deadline for the Government \n     of Sudan to comply with all obligations under the ceasefire \n     and prepare contingency plans in the event those deadlines \n     are not met.\n       We would like to thank everyone involved in organizing, \n     coordinating and implementing our trip. Representatives from \n     the State Department, USAID and the NGOs both in Washington \n     and Sudan deserve special thanks.\n       We would also like to thank Sean Woo, general counsel to \n     Sen. Brownback (R-KS), and Dan Scandling, chief of staff to \n     Rep. Wolf (R-VA), for accompanying us on the trip. They \n     played a critical role in writing this report and took all \n     the photographs. In addition, we would like to thank Janet \n     Shaffron, legislative director, and Samantha Stockman, \n     foreign affairs legislative assistant, to Rep. Wolf, and \n     Brian Hart, communications director, and Josh Carter, \n     legislative aide, of Sen. Brownback, for editing the report. \n     Colin Samples, an intern in Rep. Wolf's office, did the \n     design and layout.\n       We also want to extend our thanks to Secretary of State \n     Colin Powell and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan for \n     visiting the region. Their personal involvement in working to \n     resolve this crisis is critically important.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The hour is late, but I simply ask my colleagues that \nwe pass this by unanimous consent and then both Houses will have \nspoken. This is a situation of Muslim-on-Muslim violence. If people are \nworried about different religions, this is not the case. It is ethnic. \nIt is Arab-on-African violence.\n  Osama bin Laden had been in Sudan for 5 years, 1991 to 1996. This is \nwhere he started organizing violent groups. He did it first in Sudan. \nThe government there has been very efficient in carrying forth what \nOsama had taught them.\n  Finally, we can make a difference in Sudan and, by extension, all of \nAfrica, but we really need to act now. We are going to be out the whole \nmonth of August. By that period of time, thousands more will die. I \nrealize this is a resolution, so it can be said, well, it does not do \nthat much, but it does put pressure on the international community. It \nwill be the first time we spoke ahead of the full genocide taking place \nwhere we actually maybe can stop it and save some lives instead of \nlamenting afterwards that we should have done something. The \nadministration has really done an overall very good job on this issue \nin pushing and pressing it, but let's not stop there. Let's keep moving \nand let's try to get something done.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8639-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8639-S8640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I received the 9/11 \nCommission report earlier today. It looks as if the Commission did a \nthorough job and that their writeup is fair and balanced. It is \ncertainly well-documented.\n  Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton deserve our praise for their bipartisan \nleadership.\n  The Commission did not play the blame game. Rather, they focused on \nhow the United States can learn from past mistakes to make all \nAmericans safer in the future.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join with the distinguished majority \nleader in expressing my gratitude to Commissioner Chairman Thomas Kean \nand Vice Chairman Hamilton and the rest of the Commissioners as well. \nThey were able to operate above partisan differences and produce a \nunanimous report in an incredibly charged political environment. The \nCommission has painstakingly outlined the numerous missed opportunities \nto prevent the tragic events of September 11 and provided the Bush \nadministration and the Congress with a solid set of recommendations \nthat I believe, if enacted, can help make us more secure.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we do want to assure everyone that while \nmistakes, failures, and missed opportunities occurred in the past, as \ntheir report chronicles, the United States still has a very good system \nto protect the country.\n  There are thousands of dedicated Americans in the military, the \nintelligence community, law enforcement, and so on who endeavor every \nday to keep us safe. They deserve our appreciation and support.\n  But we can and must do better. We have to get it right 100 percent of \nthe time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Commission divided its \nrecommendations into two major categories. The first lays out a new \nglobal strategy for dealing with the threats we face today. This \nsection contains 28 recommendations on what our Government should do to \nenhance our national security.\n  The second section contains 13 suggestions for how our Government--\nexecutive branch as well as Congress--should be reconfigured to \nincrease our prospects for achieving our national security objectives.\n  Senator Frist and I intend to work together with our colleagues in a \nbipartisan manner to examine all of the Commission's proposals. We both \nagree change is long overdue, and we cannot afford to let another \nopportunity to make these changes slip by.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the threat of terrorism will be with us for \na long time. We need to fix the problems and correct the shortcomings \ncited by the Commission so that we can make America safer.\n  That is why Senator Daschle and I intend to ask the Government \nAffairs Committee, in close consultation with other committees with a \nstake in these changes, to carefully evaluate the Commission's \nproposals regarding reorganization of the executive branch and \ndetermine how best to implement them. It is our hope that the \nGovernment Affairs Committee shall begin conducting hearings on these \nissues as soon as possible.\n  It is also our expectation that the other committees with an interest \nin this legislation will conduct their own hearings. It is also our \nhope that the Government Affairs Committee, working closely with the \nother interested committees, will carefully evaluate each of the \nCommission's proposals and factor in their views before coming forward \nwith a legislative package. No committee shall lose its rights to \nreview parts of the legislation under its jurisdiction. It is our hope \nthis package will be assembled and presented to the Senate no later \nthan October 1.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senator Frist and I have also agreed to \nset up a working group that examines how best to implement the 9/11 \nCommission's recommendations that deal with reform of the Senate, such \nas improving intelligence oversight.\n  Over the coming days we will meet to discuss how best to organize and \nfocus this group.\n  Our intent would be for this group to similarly present a plan of \naction by October 1 on how to implement the recommendations made by the \nCommission that deal with the Congress.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in closing, the Democratic leader and I \nagree that the Commission has come forward with important \nrecommendations that deserve urgent consideration by this body. We are \nhopeful that the process we outlined above will give them the \nbipartisan attention they deserve and the American people expect.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Many of us have felt the need to express ourselves on this \nimportant matter prior to the time we leave for recess.\n  I thank the distinguished majority leader and a number of colleagues \non both sides of the aisle.\n  It is an important statement to be made. The administration needs to \nhear it, the international community needs to hear it, and certainly \nthe Sudanese Government, which tolerates if not assists in genocide, \nneeds to hear it.\n  I note, also, this concurrent resolution would not have been possible \nwithout the tireless effort of the Congressional Black Caucus. I \nespecially want to note the efforts of Congressman Don Payne, \nCongressman John Conyers, and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Their \ntireless efforts for human rights ought to be recognized tonight. I \ncongratulate them and I thank them for their work. I am very proud to \nbe associated with that effort and with this resolution tonight.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take a moment to honor Rebecca Sadler, \nwho is this year's winner of my annual 6th Grade Essay Contest. Rebecca \nis from Brentwood, TN, and attends Woodland Middle School.\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\n  This year's topic was ``A Salute to Community Heroes.'' Rebecca chose \nher dad, Jerry M. Sadler. Mr. Sadler died of cancer on November 11, \n1999. While we have a few minutes before closing, I thought I would \nread a few paragraphs from Rebecca Sadler's salute to her dad. It is \nentitled ``My Hero.''\n\n       Heroes can be just about anyone. Some have earned Nobel \n     prizes. Some have led marches and protests. Some are world \n     leaders and some have been to the moon. Many have recorded \n     hit singles in the music industry. Others have made millions \n     from a simple story. But what really makes a hero? Are heroes \n     born or made? Do heroes look like movie stars or do they look \n     like the guy who waxes the floors at the end of the day? Are \n     they brave enough to take down an evil terrorist? Or are they \n     just brave enough for a roller coaster?\n       My hero hasn't been to the moon. And he hasn't led a \n     protest. He didn't win a Nobel prize and he wasn't a world \n     leader. My hero was a friend, a husband, a brother, a cousin, \n     a father, a pilot, and one of the bravest people I've ever \n     known. My hero is my dad. He was a commander in the Navy \n     Reserve. He flew packages for FedEx. He had a wife, three \n     kids, four brothers, three sisters, a mother-in-law, sisters-\n     in-law, brothers-in-law, numerous cousins, nieces and \n     nephews, and innumerable friends.\n       The thing that made my dad a hero was that he was never \n     afraid and if he was, he never showed it. He was incredibly \n     honest. My dad was a friend to everyone. My dad would have \n     given his life for his family and his country. There was \n     nothing that my dad couldn't do. He was so strong. Every \n     morning I would walk into his room and say good morning. He \n     would gather up all his strength and as soon as I walked in \n     he would sit up, smile, and act like nothing was wrong.\n       Heroes don't have to be superstars and they do not have to \n     beat any world records. They can be a parent, a teacher, a \n     counselor, or even a garbage man. But heroes have to be a \n     couple of things.\n       They should be loving, honest, brave, loyal, and kind. They \n     should be kind to people who might not be as fortunate, \n     loving to family, and brave no matter what. They should be \n     loyal to friends, family, God, and their country. They must \n     be honest to their friends so you can trust them.\n       My dad inspires me because he was all of the things that \n     make a hero. He inspires me because he never gave up, even in \n     the face of death.\n       My dad inspires me to do the very best I can and to be the \n     very best I can be. He inspires me to fly someday. To say, \n     ``Yes, I can'' in the face of failure. He taught me to never \n     give up, no matter what, and he taught me to succeed. He \n     showed me how to be brave. He inspires me to be loyal to our \n     country, God, friends, and family. He taught me to be kind to \n     everyone, even complete strangers, and loving to family. He \n     inspires me to be me. My dad is my hero.\n  That essay is from Rebecca Sadler, 6th grade essay contest winner. It \nis a contest I have all over the State on a different subject each \nyear. This year was ``A Salute to Community Heroes.''\n  Rebecca's dad Jerry M. Sadler, died of cancer on November 11th, 1999.\n  She concludes:\n\n       I was 7 years old and in the second grade. He left behind a \n     wife, three children, four brothers, three sisters, and many \n     others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8642-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President last week, Kurdish security forces captured \n15 militants in Kirkuk. Among them is a man purported to be second in \ncommand of Ansar al-Islam, an Iraq-based terrorist group linked with Al \nQaeda.\n  Meanwhile, Iraqi security forces swept through a downtown Baghdad \nneighborhood and arrested over 500 suspected criminals. The operation, \nwhich was conducted without the assistance of U.S. soldiers, was the \nlargest operation of the interior ministry since the fall of Saddam \nHussein.\n  The developments in Kirkuk and Baghdad are positive signs of Iraq's \nprogress. The interim government is taking on the tough responsibility \nof defending its citizens and confronting terrorists. We know that it \nwill be a long and difficult process. The governor of the Nineveh \nprovince was gunned down last week by terrorists. Jordanian militant \nAbu Musab al-Zarqawi claims credit for the vicious murder. And on \nTuesday this week, the interim governor of Basra was assassinated as he \nwas heading to work.\n  The ongoing violence is frustrating and painful. Still, the Iraqi \npeople remain optimistic. As my colleagues, Senators Lieberman and Kyl, \npointed out in their excellent editorial in the Washington Post this \nweek, a BBC/Oxford Research International poll finds released this \nmonth finds that a majority of Iraqis believe their lives today are \nquite good or very good, and a majority believes that their lives will \nbe better next year.\n  Meanwhile, Saddam will soon face his crimes. And Iraq is working to \nbecome a free and peaceful country in the heart of the Middle East that \ndoesn't threaten its neighbours or terrorize its citizens.\n  Which brings me to pre-war Iraq, and the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee report on what we knew and what we did not know.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee has issued a detailed report on the \nintelligence community's estimate of Iraq's WMD. I commend my \ncolleagues for their hard work and commitment. They launched a thorough \ninvestigation and produced a unanimous judgment. Indeed, their 12-month \ninquiry is, and I quote Senator Pat Roberts, ``without precedent in the \nhistory of the Senate Intelligence Committee.''\n  Acting together with clear purpose, the committee has produced a \nreport that genuinely addresses an issue of critical importance to our \nNation's security.\n  Their efforts are an example of the best of the Senate working in a \nbipartisan manner to advance the interests of the American people.\n  The report is tough and detailed. It reveals disturbing lapses in our \nintelligence gathering and processing methods, and it points to the \nclear need for major reforms not media driven or politically expedient \nmeasures, but deep and serious changes to how we gather intelligence--\nthe critical information we need to protect ourselves from stealthy, \nvicious, and determined enemies.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of the Senate report is that \nfollowing 1998, our Government had no human intelligence sources inside \nIraq collecting against the WMD target. That is unacceptable.\n  Meanwhile, what information we did collect was not properly shared \namong intelligence agencies. Again, unacceptable.\n  It must be acknowledged, however, that from the United Nations to \nintelligence agencies all around the world, informed people believed \nthat Saddam had WMD and the means to produce and deliver them.\n  Following Saddam's defeat in Desert Storm in 1991, inspectors found \nstockpiles of chemical weapons and biological agents. They also found a \nnuclear program that was believed to be less than 2 years from \ncompletion.\n  Then, for the next decade, Saddam refused to provide a clear \naccounting of his weapons programs. He defied 16 Security Council \nresolutions, ultimately defying Resolution 1441 passed in 2002.\n  So we know that Saddam used chemical weapons in the past, that he \nobtained dual-use materials, that he had nuclear scientists on his \npayroll, and that he had billions of dollars of oil money with which to \npursue his goals. In addition, we know that he invaded two neighboring \ncountries, lobbed missiles at a third, and declared America to be a \nmortal enemy.\n  A new British report further amplifies these facts. Led by Lord \nButler, the British investigative team determined that the claim that \nSaddam attempted to buy uranium from Africa was ``well founded.'' And I \nquote:\n\n       We conclude that, on the basis of the intelligence \n     assessments at the time, covering both Niger and the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo, the statements on Iraqi \n     attempts to buy uranium from Africa in the Government's \n     dossier, and by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, \n     were well-founded.\n       By extension, we conclude also that the statement in \n     President Bush's State of the Union Address of 28 January \n     2003 that: `The British Government has learned that Saddam \n     Hussein recently sought significant\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\n     quantities of uranium from Africa' was well-founded.\n\n  The report also rebuts many of the widely circulated claims made by \nAmbassador Joe Wilson about his role in the mission to Niger; the \nreport he made to Washington upon his return; and later his claims that \nthe administration manipulated intelligence. This report reveals that \nAmbassador Wilson's repeated attacks on the President's credibility \nwere misleading, at best, and without merit.\n  Furthermore, both reports find that no political pressure was applied \nto influence intelligence estimates. President Bush and Prime Minister \nBlair were, in fact, scrupulous in their presentation of the evidence \nas it was known.\n  Saddam Hussein intended to resume his illegal weapons programs, and \nwas taking steps to do so. The Butler report corroborates that, prior \nto the war, Iraq was ``carrying out illicit research and development, \nand procurement activities to seek to sustain its indigenous \ncapabilities.''\n  In other words, Saddam was a threat to our peace, security, and \ninterests. He never abandoned his ultimate goal to acquire WMD. Saddam \nmay have been biding his time, but as the President told the nation, in \nthis case, time was a ticking bomb.\n  I applaud the efforts of both our Intelligence Committee and our \nBritish allies. Their examinations of the intelligence problems and \nmisjudgments prior to the war are crucial to making the reforms \nnecessary to winning the war on terrorism. This war, more than any \nother, depends on information.\n  I look forward to the discussion of how we can strengthen our \nintelligence gathering and analysis. Brave men and women are out in the \nfield, right now, risking their lives to defend America's freedom. They \nneed an intelligence system that backs them up. America needs an \nintelligence system that works, and works well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8643-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ASBESTOS UPDATE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to report briefly on where \nthings stand on the asbestos negotiations Senator Daschle and I have \nbeen conducting for the last couple of months.\n  There is wide agreement that the current asbestos litigation system \nis disastrous for victims, for jobs, and for the economy.\n  More than 700,000 individuals have filed claims; approximately \n300,000 claims are still pending; more than $70 billion has already \nbeen spent trying to resolve these claims; and more than 70 companies \nhave filed for bankruptcy as a result.\n  And yet we have very little to show for it. We have a system where \nthe sickest victims of asbestos exposure have to wait in line with \nthousands of unimpaired claimants.\n  There are many things that we in Congress cannot agree upon. But \neveryone can agree that this system is a mess and must be fixed.\n  Senators Hatch and Leahy ironed out a unique solution to the problem. \nThey created a no-fault trust fund for claimants funded by business and \ninsurance that would pay truly sick claimants fair claims values in a \nprompt manner.\n  S. 1125 embodied this idea and was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee in July of 2003. That bill provided $108 billion in mandatory \nfunding for claimants.\n  On April 7, 2004, Senator Hatch and I, along with Senators Miller, \nDeWine, Voinovich, Chambliss, Hagel, and Domenici, introduced a \nsubstitute bill, S. 2290. S. 2290 increased the funding for claimants \nto $114 billion.\n  Unfortunately, on April 22, that bill only received 50 votes on the \nfloor of the Senate. Why? The opponents' primary complaint was that the \nfunding was insufficient.\n  I did not want to give up on finding a solution to this crisis. \nFortunately, neither did the Democrat leader. So we met and decided to \nask Judge Becker, a respected Third Circuit Court of Appeals judge who \nhad been working on asbestos issues with Senator Specter, to try to \nmediate the parties' differences. He did so over a 2-week period in May \nand was able to get Organized Labor to move from $153 billion to $149 \nbillion.\n  The business and insurance side of the equation moved from the $114 \nbillion into the mid-$120 billion range. But no deal was reached.\n  In June, the minority leader and I met again and agreed to try to \nnegotiate this matter between us, along with the help of the interested \nparties.\n  Soon after those negotiations began, the business side made yet \nanother move, this time offering to fund a $131 billion trust fund. \nThey were told that was still insufficient.\n  So, at my request, Senator Daschle put together a proposal. He \nproposed a $141 billion trust fund. He also indicated how his side \nbelieved the start up of the fund and pending claims should be handled, \namong other issues.\n  In response, I encouraged the business and insurance communities to \nmake their best and final proposal on the size of the fund. I told them \nthat the end-game was near and that it was time for them to do the best \nthey could in terms of a proposal.\n  As a result, they made a huge move and agreed to fund a $140 billion \ntrust fund, with roughly $40 billion funded in the first 5 years.\n  Now here is the rub. Time is running out. It is now the end of July, \nand we are set to begin a long recess. We only have 21 days left in \nthis session of Congress to get a bill completed.\n  So I sat down with Senator Daschle earlier this week to try to push \nnegotiations forward. To get a bill, we must begin to tackle the tough \nissues.\n  Those tough issues concern funding and pending claims. Because we \nhave reached the bottom line for business and insurance when it comes \nto funding, it is time to intensify negotiations on the so-called \n``start-up'' and ``pendings'' issues.\n  Business and insurance will not agree to a $140 billion trust fund \nand, simultaneously, continue to pay massive sums for ongoing \nlitigation. Either a trust fund is the solution to our problems or it \nis not.\n  I have asked Senator Daschle to let me know whether he believes his \nside can move in our direction and not permit leakage in the tort \nsystem. If so, substantial progress can be made.\n  Today, I received a letter from Senator Daschle and 12 other \nDemocrats expressing their commitment to ``work over the August recess \nto narrow our differences and secure a compromise that provides \nnecessary relief to victims and businesses.''\n  I deeply appreciate their steadfast commitment to this issue and look \nforward to hearing from them about how we can solve the asbestos \nlitigation crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8643-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8643-S8645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMERICA IS MOVING FORWARD\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the past few months, my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have come to the Senate floor in a vain \neffort to convince America that we are worse off than we were 4 years \nago.\n  They offer a pessimistic litany of distorted statistics to discredit \nthe measurable progress America has made in the last 4 years. Just last \nFriday, the minority leader came to the Senate floor to cast a negative \nlight on America's astonishing rebound from the triple shock of \nterrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and a recession inherited from \nthe Clinton administration.\n  It is critical that the American people know the truth.\n  Far from the other side's woeful depiction, America is moving forward \nand gaining strength. We have been tested, and we have proven ourselves \nto be a tough, resilient and resourceful nation.\n  America remains the economic engine of the world. While our European \nfriends struggle with double digit unemployment, America's unemployment \nrate is at historic lows and dropping.\n  Are we better off? Four years ago, President Bush inherited an \neconomy that measured $9.8 trillion. Today, the economy has grown \nalmost $1 trillion more.\n  Are we better off? Four years ago, President Bush inherited an \neconomy that was the equivalent to roughly $25,000 for every person. \nToday, that number has grown to nearly $30,000.\n  Are we better off? Four years ago, President Bush inherited an \neconomy that employed 136.9 million people. Today, the number of people \nworking has grown by nearly 2 million and is on track to create 1.2 \nmillion jobs this year.\n  Contrary to claims made by critics, the quality of jobs being created \nis excellent. Three quarters of the new jobs\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\ncreated in May were in industries that, on average, pay a higher hourly \nrate than the overall average.\n  Are we better off? Manufacturing jobs have grown this year for the \nfirst time since the mid-90's; 64,000 jobs have been added in the \nmanufacturing sector since January, alone, and there are more jobs to \ncome.\n  More manufacturers have been reporting increased activity and new \norders than at any time in the last 20 years. The ISM Manufacturing \nemployment index in April hit its highest level in 15 years.\n  Are we better off? Four years ago, President Bush inherited an \neconomy that was constructing only 1.5 million new houses per year. \nToday, homeownership is at an all time high, including minority \nhomeownership. Americans are investing in themselves and their futures.\n  Are we better off? Productivity is its highest in 50 years. \nUnemployment is lower now than it was in the 70s, 80s and 90s--lower, \nin fact, than during the Clinton years.\n  Are we better off? The answer is, clearly, a resoundings yes.\n  Because of President Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, Americans now \nhave more money to invest, save, or spend as they choose. Business \nowners have more opportunities to realize their entrepreneurial \npotential.\n  America is moving forward because President Bush and the Republican-\nled Congress believe in the ingenuity, creativity, and common sense of \nthe American people.\n  When it comes to fighting crime, American law enforcement has the bad \nguys on the run. The statistics are remarkable.\n  Fire-arm related violent crime is down. Burglary, robbery and theft \nare all down.\n  Simple and aggravated assault is down. Violent crimes, including \nrape, sexual assaults and robberies, are now at their lowest levels \nsince the government began collecting crime data in 1973. Violent crime \nis falling in all regions of the country, whether measured by race, \nethnicity, age or income.\n  Property crimes continued a more than 20-year decline.\n  Gun-related crimes have continued to fall.\n  The fall in the crime rates has coincided with more aggressive \nprosecutions of criminals. Average sentences for violent criminals are \nincreasing, and violent felons comprise a growing share of the prison \npopulation.\n  Real, positive change is taking place in America's neighborhoods. \nAmerican's are safer and more secure at home.\n  When it comes to improving major social programs, a Republican-led \nCongress has delivered on major new reforms.\n  Seniors now have, for the first time, prescription drug coverage \nunder Medicare.\n  The other side of the aisle had eight years to enact Medicare reform. \nThey didn't. Instead, they played politics with seniors' health. And \nnow that we have made historic improvements, opponents to reform are \ntrying to scare seniors from enjoying their new benefits.\n  The truth is, under Republican leadership, America's seniors are \ngetting vastly improved Medicare services.\n  Under the bipartisan Medicare Modernization Act signed by President \nBush in December, for the first time, all seniors will have access to \n$400 billion in expanded drug benefits. Low-income seniors and those \nwith high drug costs will get the most help. Millions of seniors will \nget comprehensive prescription drug coverage with no gaps in coverage, \nno premium, and no more than a $5 copay.\n  Even now, only 6 months after the Medicare legislation became law, \nthe Bush administration is providing immediate relief from the high \ncost of drugs through its prescription drug discount program. Millions \nof seniors are getting $1,200, just like cash, on top of 10-25 percent \noff of the cost of their drugs.\n  Seniors will have expanded access to an array of preventive \nbenefits--including an annual physical examination--that simply were \nnot part of the program before.\n  Moreover, all Americans will pay less for prescription drugs because \nwe took steps to speed the delivery of lower cost generic drugs to \nconsumers.\n  We have also given all Americans more affordable coverage through \ntax-free health savings accounts so they could take more control over \ntheir health care needs and hard-earned dollars.\n  When it comes to education, again, Republican leadership is \ndelivering major reform.\n  Because of the No Child Left Behind Act, passed by a Republican-led \nCongress and signed into law by President Bush, millions of \ndisadvantaged children are now getting the focus and attention they \nneed and deserve.\n  Reading and math scores in America's large urban schools have \nimproved.\n  Parents of children in struggling schools have powerful new options, \nand they are using them. If their school is struggling to teach their \nchildren the basics, such as math and reading, parent now can send \ntheir kids to a better public school or get their children special \ntutoring.\n  Under No Child Left Behind, States and local school districts are now \nbeing held accountable for ensuring every child learns--regardless of \nrace, parents' income, disability, geography, or English proficiency. \nAs President Bush has said time and again, every child can learn, and \nevery child should be given a fair chance. The No Child Left Behind Act \nis helping to make sure the promise is becoming a reality.\n  As a result of the No Child Left Behind Act, the Federal Government \ntoday is spending more money on K-12 education than at any other time \nin the history of the United States. Federal K-12 education funding to \nstates and local schools has increased by a historic $6.9 billion since \nthe hallmark education reform legislation was signed into law.\n  Title I aid for disadvantaged students, the cornerstone of the No \nChild Left Behind Act, has increased by over 40 percent since 2001.\n  In fact, aid for disadvantaged students received a larger combined \nincrease during the first 2 years of President Bush's administration \nthan it received in the previous 7 years combined under President \nClinton.\n  Our economy is stronger, crime is down, education is improving. \nAmericans have good reason to be optimistic about the future.\n  And when it comes to environment, we are also seeing major progress. \nEmissions are down and water quality is improving.\n  All signs are encouraging.\n  More, however, can be done, starting with strengthening America's \nenergy independence. President Bush has offered a long-range plan to \ndiversify our energy supply and encourage the use of renewable energy \nsources.\n  Senate Democrats, however, are committed to a strategy of \nobstruction. They come to the Senate floor to lament America's energy \nproblems. Meanwhile, they block the very reforms that would lessen \nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil supplies.\n  Likewise, the other side of the aisle bemoans rising health premiums \nwhile continuing to block medical malpractice reforms that would lower \nmedical costs.\n  Which brings me to the larger point.\n  This year, the other side has been engaged in an unprecedented \ncampaign of obstructionism. Their obstructionism is costing billions of \ndollars that could be growing the economy and hundreds of thousands of \njobs that could be employing America's workers.\n  The campaign to poor-mouth America's progress may be an election year \nstrategy to immobilize the process, but it is also unfairly discredits \nthe efforts of every American working hard, paying taxes, and leading \nthis country back to economic health. The distorted statistics and \nmisleading charts are meant to sow doubt and confusion. They are meant \nto make Americans question their own success.\n  It will not work, and it must not work. We are a strong, robust, and \nprosperous nation. Optimism is the essence of our success. It drives \nour creativity and emboldens our entrepreneurial spirit. It is what \nmakes us invest in the future and accomplish our highest aims.\n  I am confident the American people will look at the gains we are \nmaking everyday as a nation and as individuals, and that we will \nrecognize our success, take heart, and keep moving forward. It is the \nAmerican spirit, and it is the American way.\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8643-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8643-S8645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMERICA IS MOVING FORWARD\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I stand here today in memory of a \ncourageous young American who gave his life for freedom. He gave his \nlife for the people of Iraq, he gave it for his fellow Americans, and \nhe gave it especially for those he loved. SGT Kyle Brinlee at the age \nof 21 gave up his life for the sake of others, and for his service and \nhis sacrifice, I am proud to honor him on the Senate floor today.\n  SGT Kyle A. Brinlee of Pryor, OK, was deployed from Fort Sill and \nserved as a masonry and carpentry specialist with the 120th Combat \nEngineering Battalion in Iraq. When he went to Iraq in February, he \nleft the familiar comfort of Pryor, OK, for the unknown hostility of \nthe Middle East. He left his family, friends, and neighbors, expecting \nto be home within 6 months or a year at the most. Only 3 months passed \nbefore these same people lined the streets of Pryor as his funeral \nprocession passed.\n  On May 11, near Alasad, Iraq, an explosive device destroyed the \nvehicle in which Kyle Brinlee was riding. He died while securing the \nfreedom of millions of Americans, while trying to secure a chance of \nthat freedom for the Iraqi people.\n  Sergeant Brinlee, the first Oklahoma guardsman to give his life in \nIraq, was eulogized in May in front of a crowd of 1,300 people at the \nPryor High School auditorium. Kyle was remembered as an outstanding \nsoldier, a morale builder who was always willing to be the first to \nvolunteer, and as someone who all will miss. After his death, the \nNational Guard awarded Kyle the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. He \nhas also earned my admiration and prayers and those of many other \nAmericans. His choice was that of a true hero: He endangered his own \nlife for the sake of something greater, and that courage to act for the \ngood of all will mark his legacy forever.\n  Sergeant Brinlee stands as a true example of bravery. He knew of the \ndangers that awaited him. He knew he might never have another \nopportunity to see his family, but he also knew his mission. He knew \nthat American freedom does not come from the complaints of the many but \nfrom the sacrifices of the few. SGT Kyle Brinlee was man enough to be \ncounted amongst those noble few. Kyle Brinlee was a true American hero.\n  Mr. President, on each trip I take overseas as one of the members of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, the message I get back from the \ntroops in the field is always the same: Why is it that people in \nAmerica do not understand what we are doing? I think the media has done \na lousy job, distorting the true reality of the freedoms that are \ntaking place in Iraq, of all the good things that are happening over \nthere.\n  I hear from these brave young troops. They know what their mission \nis. They know America is in its most threatened position today. They \nknow they are risking their lives, yet they are willing to do it. \nCertainly SGT Kyle Brinlee is one of those, a very good, heroic \nexample.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8645-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8645-S8646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           S. 2844, CONTINUITY IN REPRESENTATION ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this evening the Senate is expected to \nconsider H.R. 2844, the Continuity in Representation Act of 2004. While \nthere are significant problems with this bill, I believe it is in the \nbest interest of ensuring the continuity of government that the Senate \npass the bill, as received from the House, without amendment, before we \nbegin this extended recess.\n  The most troubling problem with this bill is that it may have the \nunintended consequence of disenfranchising overseas military voters who \nare serving this Nation in combat. So in taking this action tonight, \nlet me suggest that our work will not be done. I strongly encourage my \ncolleagues in the House to review this legislation in light of these \nconcerns and to consider adopting technical corrections to this bill to \naddress its unintentional consequences.\n  The bill before the Senate today is, at best, a stopgap measure which \nattempts to provide a way to reconstitute the House of Representatives \nin the event that in excess of 100 vacancies occur in its membership. \nUnlike vacancies in the Senate, which under the Seventeenth Amendment \ncan be immediately filled, the House has no way to reconstitute itself \nshort of holding elections. In essence, H.R. 2488 requires the States \nto hold expedited special elections to fill vacancies which occur under \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  The House-passed bill provides that upon the announcement by the \nSpeaker of the House that more than 100 vacancies exist in the \nmembership of the House, the States affected must hold a special \nelection within 45 days of the announcement, unless there is a \nregularly scheduled general election scheduled within 75 days of the \nannouncement. This overly optimistic time line all but ensures that \noverseas military voters and overseas voters will not have their \nballots counted in such an election.\n  In an attempt to address the issue of overseas military voters and \nother overseas voters, the House adopted language which calls on the \nStates, but does not require them, to issue absentee ballots or voting \nmaterial to overseas military voters within 15 days of the Speaker's \nannouncement. However, the bill then requires such States to accept and \nprocess such ballots for up to 45 days from the date that the State \ntransmitted the ballot to the voter. On its face, those deadlines would \nrequire that an election be held no sooner than 60 days after an \nannouncement by a Speaker of the House in order to ensure that such \nabsentee military ballots are counted.\n  However, the situation may be much worse. Because the House bill does \nnot require States to transmit ballots to overseas military voters by \nany specific date, under certain State laws, such voters can receive \nabsentee ballots up to literally the day before the election. In such a \ncase, a State would be required to accept the overseas military ballot \nup to 45 days after that date, or 90 days after the Speaker's \nannouncement.\n  The obvious result of these two provisions is to potentially extend \nthe date of the election beyond the required 45 days after the \nSpeaker's announcement--ranging from 46 days to 90 days. And therein \nlies the problem: are overseas military ballots that are received by \nthe State from 1 to 90 days after the actual election date still \ncounted, or are they ignored unless the election is close?\n  The unintended consequence of this bill is to tell our brave men and \nwomen in uniform, who are literally putting their lives on the line for \nthis Nation in combat overseas, that while they may be able to cast a \nvote, there is no guarantee that their vote will be counted. That is \nsimply an unacceptable result.\n  On the other hand, if the result is to hold an election open until \nall possible overseas ballots are received, then this bill does not \nprovide for expedited elections at all. In fact, the result may be the \ninability of our Government to function for as long as 90 days after a \ncatastrophe. That would be contrary to the stated purpose of the bill.\n  And that is why our work is not done. This bill may be a necessary \ninterim measure, but to ensure that there is no lapse in the authority \nof the House, and the ability of Congress, to exercise its \nconstitutional responsibilities, may require a constitutional amendment \nproviding for an appointment to fill a vacancy. In the meantime, until \nan amendment to the Constitution can be adopted and ratified providing \nfor the immediate reconstitution of the House, this measure provides \nsome assurance that our representative form of government will \ncontinue.\n  Numerous organizations have called on the House to adopt a \nconstitutional approach, not the least of which is the Continuity of \nGovernment Commission, chaired by our distinguished former colleague, \nAlan Simpson, and the respected Lloyd Cutler. While I respect the \nconcerns of my House colleagues that we preserve the House as an \nelected body, the Framers did not intend that such a noble principle \nbecome the undoing of the people's representative branch of government.\n  We must find a rational and workable way to ensure that our \nGovernment continues to function despite the intent of terrorists and \nothers who would render the people's House silent. But we must do it in \na way that ensures\n\n[[Page S8646]]\n\nthat all voters, and particularly those military voters who are serving \noverseas during a time of war, have an equal opportunity to not only \ncast a vote, but to have that vote counted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8646-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ELECTIONS IN MONGOLIA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am concerned by reports from Mongolia \nof alleged election irregularities following a July 17th revote at a \ncertain polling station in the capital city of Ulaan Baatar.\n  According to observers on the ground, the revote occurred less than \n12 hours after it was announced at 8 p.m. on July 16th. While I do not \nknow the nocturnal habits of the Mongolian people, I doubt that voters \nin Ulaan Baatar--or anywhere else in Mongolia, for that matter--can be \nfully and adequately informed of the revote in such a short time.\n  Field reports seem to bear this out. According to the International \nRepublican Institute, turnout at that polling station in the June 27th \nelections exceeded 70 percent; on the July 17th revote, it totaled some \n46 percent. Nearly one-quarter of those who voted in June did not cast \na ballot in July.\n  Further troubling are allegations of a systematic pattern of denying \nsupporters of the Motherland Democracy Coalition, MDC, the right to \nvote, refusal to permit MDC observers inside the polling station, the \nuse of Mongolian law enforcement officials to prohibit access to the \npolling station, and vote buying in favor of the ruling Mongolian \nPeople's Revolutionary Party, MPRP.\n  If proven true, these irregularities would mark a major departure \nfrom Mongolia's previous election experiences, where voting was \ngenerally orderly and according to applicable laws and regulations.\n  My colleagues might find it interesting that the seat in question was \nwon in the first round of balloting by MDC candidate and businessman \nOtganbayer by a 222 vote margin. The revote found MPRP Defense Minister \nGurragchaa winning the seat by 1,239 votes.\n  There is no question that reports of irregularities and chicanery \nmust be fully and impartially investigated by the relevant election \nauthorities, and that any and all violators of election laws and \nregulations be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of \nMongolian law. It is my hope that this process is more transparent than \nthe counting of ballots at that particular polling station. It is \noutrageous that MPRP officials prohibited independent election \nobservers to witness the opening of ballot boxes and the counting of \nballots--in violation, I understand, of Mongolian law.\n  Mongolia's leadership would be wise to consider that the country's \nreputation--and inclusion as an eligible recipient for increased \nforeign assistance under the Millennium Challenge Corporation--is at \nstake. Any government that is formed that does not reflect the real \nwill of the Mongolian people will lack credibility and the respect of \nthe international community.\n  Ulaan Baatar should take note that Washington--and the world--is \nwatching.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8646-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR BEN TAYLOR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Kentuckian, Ben ``Buster'' Taylor, a retired Special Forces \nsergeant major and former Letcher County Sheriff. Sergeant Major Taylor \nis not one to brag about his accomplishments, but he should be honored \nfor his courageous and selfless acts during the two decades he spent \nserving this Nation in the U.S. military.\n  In 1950, inspired by the heroism of World War II veterans, Taylor \njoined the United States Army's 11th Airborne Division at Camp \nCampbell, KY, which is now known as Fort Campbell. As he worked his way \nthrough various divisions, the Army began organizing its Special Forces \nBranch, the Green Berets. Taylor enthusiastically joined the Green \nBerets and spent the better part of two decades serving with his \ncomrades in Japan, Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines, Burma, \nChina, Laos, and Vietnam.\n  Taylor's missions exemplified his bravery and altruism. During his \ntours of duty, he was awarded 24 medals and 18 ribbons, among these \nfour bronze stars. With each honor, a story revealing his heroism is \ntold. He has notebooks full of citations and commendations that tell of \nthe many times he risked his own life to save others. But of all these \nhonors, the one most memorable to Taylor is the role he played in the \nfuneral of President John F. Kennedy. Taylor was selected to represent \nthe Green Berets at President Kennedy's funeral. He walked alongside \nthe casket of the fallen Commander in Chief.\n  Today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing a \ntrue American hero, Sergeant Major Ben Taylor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8646-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR.

Earlier this \nyear, Dr. Himes was named Central Kentucky News-Journal's 2004 Man of \nthe Year. The title is one that Dr. Himes has earned.\n  Dr. Himes has always strived to live life to its very fullest and \ngive 110 percent. After serving 4 years in the U.S. Air Force, he \ncompleted his bachelor's degree at Kentucky Wesleyan College. He went \non to finish his formal education by earning a masters degree from \nAppalachian State University and a doctorate from Vanderbilt \nUniversity. For 40 years, he was a professor of history and political \nscience at Kentucky's Campbellsville University. He was an inspiring \neducator, mentor, and friend to students and colleagues. While he no \nlonger teaches classes, he continues to support and encourage younger \ngenerations.\n  Beyond his role as an educator, Dr. Himes has been a businessman, a \nstalwart volunteer for the Republican Party, and an instrumental figure \nin creating the Central Kentucky Arts Series. Furthermore, he is a \ndevoted husband, father, grandfather, and now a great-grandfather.\n  Dr. Himes is truly an inspiration. He persevered through a childhood \nduring the Great Depression and a battle with cancer. If there is one \nthing to learn from Dr. Bobby Russell Himes, it is his philosophy for \nliving. Dr. Himes believes that, ``By setting goals--even if you don't \nachieve them--you're going to go further just because you set them.''\n  May we please take this time to honor the man whom so many look up \nto, Dr. Bobby Russell Himes, Central Kentucky News-Journal's 2004 Man \nof the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8646-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8646-S8647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO R.J. CORMAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I pay tribute to a fellow Kentuckian, \nMr. R.J. Corman. Mr. Corman is a remarkable man who has overcome life's \nadversities and achieved great business success.\n  Mr. Corman got his start in the railroad business working a backhoe \nfor L Railroad. Little did he know, but this initial exposure would \nlead to his lifetime work. He founded and continues to operate the R.J. \nCorman Railroad Group in his hometown of Nicholasville, Kentucky. His \nbusiness has grown over the years and now operates in 19 States, has \nabout 630 employees, and will have at least $120 million in sales this \nyear. The goal of the R.J. Corman Railroad Group is to please customers \nand perform their services better, faster, and more efficient than \nanyone else.\n  While Mr. Corman's companies are incredibly successful and expansive, \nit is his personal successes that I pay tribute to most. Three years \nago, Mr. Corman was diagnosed with cancer and given 3 years to live. A \nman not used to sitting idly by, he successfully completed a stem-cell \nbone marrow transplant in November 2001 and today his cancer is in \ncomplete remission. In fact, Mr. Corman is doing so well that at the \nage of 48 he ran in the 108th annual Boston Marathon.\n  Mr. Corman came from humble beginnings, the son of a state highway \nworker and homemaker. But he hasn't forgotten where he came from or the \nlessons his grandfather taught him about hard work and honesty. His \nnever give up attitude has led to business success and overcoming \nserious\n\n[[Page S8647]]\n\nillness.

Mr. President, I pay tribute to an outstanding \nKentuckian, fellow Louisvillian and friend, Mr. Owsley Brown Frazier. \nOwsley recently fulfilled one of his life-long dreams by opening a \nmuseum to showcase his collection of historic weaponry--the Frazier \nHistorical Arm Museum. I was honored to join him at the grand opening \nto get a sneak peak at his impressive collection.\n  The Frazier Historical Arms Museum is more than guns in cases and \nmaps on walls. Inside this $32 million, 100,000-square-foot museum \nweapons are displayed based on the stories they tell. The museum is \nhome to Teddy Roosevelt's ``Big Stick,'' a rifle owned by George \nWashington, a bow and arrow used by Geronimo, and General George \nArmstrong Custer's Colt Navy revolvers. Not only does the museum house \nOwsley's collection of American artifacts but also holds collections on \nloan from the British Royal Armories in the Tower of London. These \nartifacts are combined with guides dressed in period attire, short \nfilms, and interactive computer stations. It is definitely a ``must \nsee'' while in Louisville.\n  Owsley wanted to give back to his hometown and the museum was his \ngift. The museum is a testament to his work ethic and his values. It \nreflects his philanthropic nature that he has contributed $500 million \nto charities during his lifetime, including tens of millions for his \nbiggest passion--education. He has used his own money, but also \nmillions of dollars of contributions from his family's company to \npreserve historic buildings, build housing for low-income families and \nof course, support our local colleges and schools.\n  His friends describe him as a simple man who loves fishing at his \nShelby County farm, breakfast at the Waddy Truck Stop, and would rather \nwatch sports on television than attend cocktail parties. Owsley and I \nalso share a special passion: University of Louisville Athletics. In \nfact, he once even skipped a family member's wedding because the \nCardinals had a game that day.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this incredible \nman. Owsley has a genuine and sincere love for the city of Louisville, \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky, and most importantly his fellow man. I \ncan only hope he will inspire us all to share that same benevolent \npassion and commitment in our lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8647-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ISRAEL SECURITY FENCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, they say good fences make good neighbors.\n  I do not know if that is always true, but I do know that the security \nfence Israel is building along the West Bank has been good for the \nsecurity in the region.\n  Already, the fence has resulted in a 90 percent drop in terrorism \ncoming from the northern West Bank. In 2004, no Israeli nationals were \nkilled or wounded by suicide bombings in areas protected by the fence, \nwhile 19 Israeli citizens were killed and 102 wounded by suicide \nattacks in areas without the fence.\n  So, it is clear that this fence is saving innocent lives.\n  Like so many others who know the region and have traveled to Israel \nand Palestine many times, I wish that a fence was not necessary. In an \nideal world, neighbors would not need fences, and Israel and Palestine \ncould have a more open border where goods, services and people move \nfreely.\n  But that is not the world we live in, and that is not the position in \nwhich Israel finds itself. We know that terrorist organizations \noperating in the West Bank and elsewhere have sworn themselves to one \nmain goal: the destruction of the State of Israel.\n  These murderers target innocent civilians, women and children in \nIsraeli busses, markets and cafes. Since the start of the Intifada some \n4 years ago, almost 1,000 Israelis have been killed. Every man, woman \nand child in Israel lives with the fear that a terrorist attack could \nbe carried out at any time, on any given day, and in any given \nlocation.\n  When confronted with such threats, free nations look to their \nmilitary, their law enforcement personnel, and above all else, they \nlook to the rule of law.\n  A commitment to the rule of law separates free nations from \ndictatorships. It separates democracies from corrupt and dangerous \nregimes. It is what binds people together under common values, shared \nprinciples and an agreed framework to live in peace.\n  Israel has a right to live in peace. It has a right, under law, to \nprotect itself and to defend its people from attack. This is not only \nwhat the law allows, it is what the people are entitled to. Much of the \nUnited Nations Charter, in fact, is based on the inherent right to \nself-defense.\n  That is why the recent International Court of Justice, ICJ, advisory \nopinion on the security fence is so wrong, and why it sets a very \ndangerous precedent. It is yet another low point for this court and for \nthe UN.\n  The ICJ declared itself ``not convinced'' that the barrier Israel is \nbuilding is a security necessity. I suppose such judgments are easy to \nmake when sitting in the opulence of the Hague some 2,000 miles away. \nLet the judges live along the Israeli border to the West Bank for some \ntime, and then let them call the fence unnecessary.\n  Beyond the wrongness of the opinion, the court should never have \ntaken the case to begin with.\n  The ICJ had no business interfering in the security of a sovereign \nnation. Israel's democratic institutions and its commitment to the rule \nof law make it more than able to handle issues arising from the \nconstruction of the fence without interference from the ICJ.\n  Israel's supreme court, for example, ruled that a segment of the \nsecurity fence must be re-routed to reduce the impact on the \nPalestinian population, even though the judges noted that ``in the \nshort term, this judgment will not make the state's struggle against \nthose rising up against it any easier.''\n  This is what democratic nations do; they act in accordance to the \nlaw. They make outside interference by the ICJ not only unwelcome and \nunnecessary, but even dangerous.\n  Although the ICJ opinion is non-binding, it could lead to the \nintroduction of anti-Israel measures at the UN and strengthen attempts \nto isolate Israel.\n  This is why some 40 nations, including the United States, submitted \nbriefs to the ICJ objecting to the court's consideration of the case.\n  This is why I, along with 78 other Senators, wrote the UN Secretary \nGeneral, calling upon him to reject the ICJ's interference with \nIsrael's right to self defense.\n  Unfortunately, the UN's action and the ICJ's opinion is another in a \nlong line of anti-Israel positions they have taken. There have been \nsome 400 anti-Israel Resolutions passed at the UN since 1964, while the \nterrorist atrocities committed against the Jewish people have never \nbeen investigated by the UN.\n  This is wrong, and it is an assault against Israeli sovereignty and \nits legal systems.\n  Israel's allies must continue to speak out against this wrong-headed \naction by the ICJ. This is why Senate has introduced and I have co-\nsponsored another bi-partisan resolution condemning the recent ICJ \ndecision on the legality of Israel's security fence and urging no \nfurther action by the UN to delay or prevent the fence's construction.\n  We need to pass that resolution, keep the pressure on the UN, and \ncontinue to protect Israel's right to self defense. The law authorizes \nit, and the people of the region deserve it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8647-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8647-S8648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING REV.

Bennett's tremendous contributions to Nevada's spiritual, civic, \nand political life.\n  Reverend Bennett's dedicated service and inspired leadership of the \nZion United Methodist Church in Las Vegas has spanned over four \ndecades. During his tenure, he oversaw the relocation of the Church to \nits current West Las Vegas site, and spearheaded the development of a \nmuch-needed day care center in the community.\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\n  Reverend Bennett's commitment to public service, however, has \nextended well beyond his West Las Vegas congregation. As president of \nthe Las Vegas Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People from 1963-1967 and 1971-1973, Rev. Bennett was among the \nforemost leaders in the struggle for civil rights in Nevada. He has \ncontinued to remain active in the Las Vegas NAACP as an executive board \nmember for the past 30 years.\n  Reverend Bennett also served as a member of the Nevada State Assembly \nfor 10 years. As chairman of the Health and Welfare Committee, he \nworked hard to ensure that the State's health care and social welfare \nservices kept pace with Nevada's dramatic growth and development. In \ndoing so, Reverend Bennett helped expand the opportunities available to \nNevadans and improve the quality of life in the Silver State.\n  His lifetime of service to his church and community has been \nrecognized by many organizations including the University of Nevada, \nwhich conferred upon him its Distinguished Nevadan Award.\n  I also want all within the sound of my voice to understand the \nquality of friend Reverend Bennett has been to me. The quality has been \nthe best, for which I will always be grateful.\n  In short, Reverend Bennett has led a distinguished career and life. \nPlease join me in congratulating him on his recent retirement from the \nZion United Methodist Church, and wishing him health and happiness in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8648-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF JOE TRUJILLO\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I honor a long-time member of my staff, \nJoe Trujillo. I usually call him Joseph, but my staff and most of those \nfrom my home State of New Mexico refer to him as ``Joe T.'' I do not \nwant misunderstanding--he is not retiring, because his work is not \ndone. However, Joseph Trujillo has served as a member of my staff, in \none capacity or another, for 25 years.\n  His always positive outlook is remarkable, and his smile is \ncontagious. His jovial attitude and eagerness to deal with challenges \nis admirable. His keen understanding of people is tied to his own rich \npersonality, and it is Joe's rich personality that I, and those from my \nhome State, have come to know and love the most.\n  Joe is a New Mexico native. He grew up in Los Alamos, and graduated \nfrom Los Alamos High School in 1964. He was the first New Mexico \nHispanic to be awarded the Phi Beta Kappa key at the University of New \nMexico.\n  After graduating from UNM in 1968, he worked on a collaborative \nproject to help Albuquerque's inner city poor. We first met in 1969, \nwhile I was chairman of the Albuquerque City Commission. Joe later \nbecame a City of Albuquerque employee. In 1976, he began working for \nAlbuquerque mayor, Harry McKinney, as the city's federal grants \ncoordinator. Mayor McKinney dispatched him to work out of my office \nhere in Washington, and after awhile I convinced him to become a member \nof my staff.\n  Right after coming to work for me in 1979, he became the member of my \nstaff who dealt with Indian affairs. But he did much more. Over the \npast 25 years he has been given more responsibilities than I can count. \nFrom appropriations and budget, to banking, Indian affairs and economic \ndevelopment, and everything in between, Joseph has done it all. His \nwealth of experience is beyond compare. For all who know Joe, it has \nalways been clear that his passion is working to help those who are \nless fortunate.\n  Joe has done more for Indians than most Senators. Through the years, \nJoe has been instrumental in bringing tribal leaders to the table to \ndiscuss their dilemmas. He arranged several economic summits in the \nState to help Indians develop their infrastructure and local economies. \nHis hard work and dedication wrought a successful economic development \nstrategy, along with an education and healthcare plan to help Indians \nin New Mexico and across the Nation.\n  In 2001, after 22 years in my Washington office, he returned to New \nMexico to serve as a member of my State staff where he continues his \nfine work at the local level on Indian issues and rural development \ninitiatives.\n  Joe Trujillo is loyal, and one on whom I trust and depend. He has \nbeen a member of my staff since June 19, 1979. In that time, we have \naccomplished much, and I am extremely proud of those accomplishments. \nMost importantly, he is my good friend. Joseph, for all you have done \nfor me, and for all you have done for the people of New Mexico; you \nhave my utmost respect and deepest gratitude. Thank you, and keep up \nthe good work, amigo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8648-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8648-S8650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TIME FOR IRAN TO COME CLEAN\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, when historians look back on American \nforeign policy in the early 21st century, they will ask a few basic \nquestions. One will be whether we used our immense military strength \nwisely. Another will be whether we took effective action to avert \ngenocide in the world. But the biggest question will be whether we did \nall we could to avert the use of weapons of mass destruction, and \nespecially a nuclear catastrophe.\n  The resolution before us addresses one of the most sensitive nuclear \nnon-proliferation issues of our day, that of Iran. Over the last 2 \nyears, public allegations and International Atomic Energy Agency \ninspections have uncovered nearly two decades of covert nuclear \nprograms that Iran has pursued in violation of its obligations under \nsafeguards agreements with the IAEA. While Iran insists publicly that \nthese programs are all peaceful, all the signs and much of the \npolitical rhetoric in Iran point to a nuclear weapons program that has \nbeen conducted under the cover of peaceful nuclear activities.\n  Nearly a year ago, Iran promised to come clean on its nuclear \nprograms and to suspend all its uranium enrichment and reprocessing \nactivities. But Iran has yet to comply fully with its commitment. \nInstead, it has hidden some of its activities and forced IAEA \ninspectors to pull teeth in order to get information about its \nprograms; it has delayed inspections and, at times, suspended all \ncooperation; it has continued production of components for uranium \nenrichment centrifuges; and it has announced an intent to test its \nuranium conversion facility in a manner that will produce feed material \nfor uranium enrichment centrifuges. All those actions are violations of \nIran's legal and political commitments.\n  More importantly, those actions suggest that Iran still has something \nto hide. They relate to nuclear activities that are difficult to \nexplain as peaceful programs. Some of those actions relate to programs \ninvolving the same criminal network that aided Libya and provided it \nwith a nuclear weapon design. And they are accompanied by political \nstatements that suggest Iran may well want to develop nuclear weapons. \nIf Iran wants to gain the confidence of the international community, \nthat is certainly not the way to go about it.\n  I do not believe that Iran poses an imminent threat of testing or \ndeploying nuclear weapons. There is hence no need at this time to \nthreaten or undertake military action, and the resolution before us \ndoes not threaten, encourage or authorize such action.\n  Some journalists interpreted a similar resolution in the House of \nRepresentatives as authorizing military action, despite the denials of \nthose who supported that resolution, including its co-author, \nRepresentative Lantos of California. That is because the House \nresolution used the words ``all appropriate means,'' which sounded too \nsimilar to previous resolutions on other issues that did authorize the \nuse of force. To make it absolutely clear that the resolution before us \ndoes not do that, the authors of the substitute amendment have deleted \nthe word ``all'' from that phrase. We do not intend this resolution to \nencourage the use of military force by any country.\n  Neither can any concurrent resolution authorize the use of force by \nthe United States. Under our Constitution and under the War Powers \nResolution, only legislation signed by the President can do that. A \nconcurrent resolution has no legal effect and cannot do so.\n  What we do intend by this resolution is to encourage all countries to \nhelp convince Iran that its national security is best served by giving \nup the urge to develop a nuclear weapons capability. An Iran with \nnuclear weapons--or with the ability to produce\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\nsuch weapons--will not be a more secure Iran. Rather, it will only \nprompt great concern among its neighbors and risk their developing \nnuclear weapons as well; and it will estrange itself from all countries \nthat support the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or that believe in \nkeeping one's international obligations.\n  If Iran wants to understand what nuclear weapons will bring about, it \ncan look to North Korea, which is reduced to begging and threatening \nthe international community in order to feed its people and to provide \neven minimal energy resources. Those are the wages of proliferation: \nnot security, but insecurity; not acclaim, but ostracism.\n  If the nations of the world--and especially the industrialized \ncountries in Europe and elsewhere that have important trade relations \nwith Iran--will band together to deliver this message, I believe that \nIran will hear it and heed it. But the message may well have to be \ndelivered with more than words. Countries may have to take forceful \ndiplomatic and economic actions in order to demonstrate to Iran the \nrisks that it runs if it insists upon building a nuclear weapons \ncapability. The IAEA Board of Governors may well have to report Iran's \nnoncompliance to the United Nations Security Council, and the Security \nCouncil may have to take action under Articles 39 through 41 of the \nUnited Nations Charter to encourage or order Iran to cease its programs \nthat would contribute to building that nuclear weapons capability.\n  Countries can also remind Iran that concerns which may have prompted \nits covert nuclear programs are now largely dissipated. The Soviet \nUnion is gone, and Russia does not threaten Iranian sovereignty. Saddam \nHussein is now a criminal in the dock, rather than a dictator with \nimperial ambitions. And the case of Libya demonstrates that the United \nStates will readily adjust its policy toward a country that renounces \nweapons of mass destruction and international terrorism. Iran's \nsecurity concerns can be met--indeed, can best be met--without its \ndeveloping or producing any weapons of mass destruction.\n  It is time that we have a serious discussion with Europe about \nharmonizing our policies toward Iran. Europe has pursued a strategy of \noffering positive incentives for Iran to change its behavior, but no \npenalties if it does not--effectively the reverse of U.S. policy. By \ncoordinating more closely, the United States and Europe are more likely \nto affect Iran's actions. We should clearly state that if Iran ends its \npursuit of a nuclear weapons program and gets out of the terrorism \nbusiness, then we would be willing to change our policy of isolating \nand sanctioning Iran.\n  I hope that enactment of the resolution before us will help galvanize \nworld attention to the threat of nuclear proliferation in Iran and to \nthe need to convince Iran to change its ways. I hope that it will also \nencourage Iran to choose the path of non-proliferation and base its \nfuture on engagement with the world, rather than increasing, self-\nimposed isolation.\n  I want to thank the original sponsors of S. Con. Res. 81, Senators \nFeinstein and Kyl, for their cooperation in developing a substitute \ntext that we can all support. I believe that Representatives Hyde and \nLantos, whose H. Con. Res. 398 provided much guidance to us, will also \nfind this text something that they can accept so as to achieve \nenactment of this important resolution. And I appreciate the work of \ntheir staffs over the past several weeks. My own staff and Chairman \nLugar's staff were also instrumental in bringing this work to what I \nbelieve will be a successful conclusion.\n  We have all been guided not by politics, but by the importance of the \nmatter before us. When the issue is nuclear proliferation, uncountable \ninnocent lives hang in the balance. On such an issue, the world must \nact as one.\n  Mrs. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the fires \nthat are burning in my State of Alaska. To date, there are 117 active \nfires in Alaska that have burned over 3.8 million acres. That is larger \nthan the entire State of Connecticut, and 11 of these fires started \nyesterday. This year is the 3rd most active fire season in Alaska since \nrecords have been kept, 1955.\n  Alaskans have been living with these fires since early June. All told \nthere have been 479 of them since the start of fire season.\n  On Monday July 5, I visited the fire camp of the Boundary Fire, which \nwas threatening residences north of Fairbanks, AK.\n  It rained while I was visiting the camp. Rain and changes in the \nwinds can bring an abrupt end to fire season. I was hopeful that the \nchange in weather would allow firefighters to put down the Boundary \nFire in short order.\n  Unfortunately, it was not to be. Shortly after I left the fire camp, \nresidents of the Haystack subdivision were told it was safe to return \nhome. Just a few days ago, the Haystack subdivision was evacuated for \nthe second time this summer. This evacuation affects 150 residents and \n80 homes.\n  A total of 34 structures have been lost to the fires now burning in \nthe State. Haze from the fires in the interior of Alaska is being \nexperienced as far south as Juneau--that is a distance of about 800 \nmiles.\n  The heroes of this fire season are the 2,711 firefighters: many from \nAlaska Native villages and others from the lower 48 who are working \nnight and day to protect homes, private property, and subsistence \nresources. I am grateful to the coordinated efforts of the Alaska Fire \nService and the State Division of Forestry for their tireless work in \ncombating these fires. This week, the community of Fairbanks is \ncelebrating ``Golden Days''--their annual summer carnival. I don't know \nif any of the firefighters will be able to break away from their duties \nto attend the parade on Saturday, but I can promise you that they will \nbe warmly received by the residents of our Golden Heart City.\n  I want to commend the Federal fire managers for getting our Nation's \naerial firefighting resources back in the air. We may have some \ndifferences of opinion about how long it took to accomplish this or how \nmany planes are certified to fly, but I am prepared to leave this \ndiscussion for a future time.\n  The total aerial resources in Alaska include one federally certified \nheavy air tanker, two heavy air tankers under contract to the State of \nAlaska, three single-engine air tankers, and three CL 215's. These \nresources are prepositioned around the State to be used, when needed.\n  Thus far, the brave men and women on our fire lines have been \nsuccessful in holding the fire away from primary residences--not only \nin and around Fairbanks, but also in rural communities like Chicken, \nCircle, Central, Eagle, Evansville, Tanacross, Galena, and Venetie.\n  The firefighters remind me that the proximity of the fires to \npeople's homes creates a ``teachable moment.'' The operative words are \n``be firewise.'' We need to all remember building defensible space \naround structures not only increases the likelihood that a building \nwill survive a fire. It also increases safety to residents and our \nfirefighters.\n  I want to reemphasize my strong support for the fuels reduction \nprovisions of the President's Healthy Forest Initiative. This \ninitiative is needed more than ever now. Our Nation's forestry policy \nhas to allow for responsible forest management that includes the \nability to remove, when appropriate, wildfire fuel from forests. \nDeteriorating forest and rangeland health now affects more than 190 \nmillion acres nationwide, an area twice the size of California.\n  In Alaska, the damage caused by the spruce bark beetle, especially \nalong the Kenai Peninsula has been devastating. Over 5 million acres of \ntrees in south central and interior Alaska have been lost to insects \nover the last 10 years. Expedited fuel reduction treatment on Federal \nland on which the existence of disease or insect infestation is a \ncritical provision in this new law.\n  In addition to treating our Federal lands, treating State and private \nlands is also important. Such lands benefit from the U.S. Forest \nService's State and Private Forestry Program. As we know, wildland \nfires do not discriminate among land ownership patterns. On the Kenai \nPeninsula alone, State, native corporation, and private lands have \nbeetle kill in addition to Federal lands on the Chugach and Kenai \nNational Wildlife Refuge. There are still over 200,000 acres of \nuntreated hazardous fuels within the Wildland-Urban\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\nInterface, leaving many Alaskan communities at risk.\n  Another critical program is the Forest Land Enhancement Program \n(FLEP), which is part of the Farm Bill. This program helps communities \nand individuals to obtain grants for reforestation and thinning of \nlands impacted by beetle kill.\n  In Alaska alone, a total of 478 private landowners, along with 19 \nnative corporations are eligible for FLEP funds for wildfire fuels \nreduction and timber stand improvements. Without this funding, eligible \nAlaskan landowners have no opportunity to make needed forest health \nimprovements on their lands. The farm bill in 2002 authorized $100 \nmillion from the Commodity Credit Corporation over a 5-year period \nending in fiscal year 2007. Only a total of $20 million was used for \nlandowner cost-share and technical assistance in fiscal year 2003 with \n$50 million transferred from FLEP to cover Forest Service wildfire \nsuppression costs. While supporting wildfire suppression, we must and \nshould utilize funding for those State and private forestry programs \nthat aid communities in fuel reduction work to reduce these \ncatastrophic wildfires we witness each year.\n  We must work across party lines to get the needed resources, \nrecognizing fiscal responsibility, to all landowners to reduce fuel \nload. This is a responsibility for all of us in Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8650-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SENATOR BOB DOLE AND THE WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Memorial Day, my wife Marcelle and I \nwere honored to attend the dedication of the gleaming new World War II \nMemorial. This memorial is not only a testament to the sacrifice of the \n16 million courageous men and women who served in that grand struggle, \nbut, in some ways, it speaks to the tireless energy of our friend and \nformer Senate majority leader, Bob Dole.\n  Senator Dole received a Purple Heart in Italy, yet never let the \nlingering effects of his very serious wounds stand in the way of his \noverall effectiveness and ability to lead the Senate. After he left \noffice, he turned his special brand of energy and intelligence towards \nensuring the completion of the new memorial. He helped raise awareness \nof the project across the country and was critical to helping gain \ncongressional approval of the measure.\n  During the dedication, Senator Dole gave a moving tribute to his \ncomrades-in-arms. These remarks helped give further context and meaning \nto the pillars, plaques, and fountains that make up this grand \nmemorial.\n  I will ask to have these remarks included in the Record, and I \nimplore all of my colleagues to take a few minutes to read this speech.\n  Today is a particularly fitting day to read Senator Dole's remarks, \nas today is his birthday. I want to wish my friend a very happy \nbirthday.\n  I ask unanimous consent the speech be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks of Senator Bob Dole--National WWII Memorial Dedication, May 29, \n                                  2004\n\n       In the first week of January 1945, a hungry and lonesome \n     second lieutenant from small town Kansas dispatched a message \n     to his folks back home: ``You can send me something to eat \n     whenever you are ready,'' he wrote. ``Send candy, gum, \n     cookies, cheese, grape jelly, popcorn, nuts, peanut clusters, \n     Vicks Vapo Rub, wool socks, wool scarf, fudge, cookies, ice \n     cream, liver and onions, fried chicken, banana cake, milk, \n     fruit cocktail, Swiss steaks, crackers, more candy, \n     Lifesavers, peanuts, the piano, the radio, the living room \n     suite, the record player and Frank Sinatra. I guess you might \n     as well send the whole house if you can get it into a five-\n     pound box. P.S., keep your fingers crossed.''\n       In authoring that only slightly exaggerated wish list I \n     merely echoed the longings of 16 million Americans whose \n     greatest wish was for an end to the fighting. Sixty years on \n     our ranks have dwindled for the thousands assembled here on \n     the Mall and the millions more watching all across America in \n     living rooms and hospitals and wherever it may be--our men \n     and women overseas and our friends in Great Britain and our \n     allies all around the world. Our final reunion cannot long be \n     delayed.\n       Yet if we gather in the twilight it is brightened by the \n     knowledge that we have kept faith with our comrades. \n     Sustained by over 600,000 individual contributions, we have \n     raised this memorial to commemorate the service and sacrifice \n     of an entire generation. What we dedicate today is not a \n     memorial to war, rather it's a tribute to the physical and \n     moral courage that makes heroes out of farm and city boys and \n     that inspires Americans in every generation to lay down their \n     lives for people they will never meet, for ideals that make \n     life itself worth living.\n       This is also a memorial to the American people who in the \n     crucible of war forged a unity that became our ultimate \n     weapon. Just as we pulled together in the course of a common \n     threat 60 years ago, so today's Americans united to build \n     this memorial. Small children held their grandfather's hand \n     while dropping pennies in a collection box. Entire families \n     contributed in memory of loved ones who could win every \n     battle except the battle against time. I think of my brother, \n     Kenny, and my brothers-in-law Larry Nelson and Allen Steel, \n     just three among the millions of ghosts in navy blue and \n     olive drab we honor with this memorial.\n       Of course, not every warrior wore a uniform. As it happens, \n     today is the 101st birthday of Bob Hope, the GI's favorite \n     entertainer who did more to boost our morale than anyone next \n     to Betty Grable. And I can already hear Bob . . . ``but I was \n     next to Betty Grable.'' And it's hard to believe, but today \n     is also the 87th birthday of John F. Kennedy, a hero of the \n     south Pacific, who, a generation after the surrender \n     documents were signed aboard the USS Missouri, spoke of a new \n     generation of Americans tempered by war that was nevertheless \n     willing ``to pay any price, bear any burden, meet any \n     hardship, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and \n     success of liberty.'' And we shall always honor the memory \n     of our great leader and our American hero, General \n     Eisenhower, who led us to victory all across the world.\n       As we meet here today, young Americans are risking their \n     lives in liberty's defense. They are the latest link in a \n     chain of sacrifice older than America itself. After all, if \n     we met the test of our times, it was because we drew \n     inspiration from those who had gone before, including the \n     giants of history who are enshrined on this Mall, from \n     Washington, who fathered America with his sword and ennobled \n     it with his character . . . from Jefferson, whose pen gave \n     eloquent voice to our noblest aspirations . . . from Lincoln, \n     who preserved the Union and struck the chains from our \n     countrymen . . . and from Franklin Roosevelt, who presided \n     over a global coalition to rescue humanity from those who had \n     put the soul itself in bondage. Each of these presidents was \n     a soldier of freedom. And in the defining event of the 20th \n     century, their cause became our cause. On distant fields and \n     fathomless oceans, the skies over half the planet and in \n     10,000 communities on the home front, we did far more than \n     avenge Pearl Harbor. The citizen soldiers who answered \n     liberty's call fought not for territory, but for justice, not \n     for plunder, but to liberate enslaved peoples around the \n     world.\n       In contending for democracy abroad, we learned painful \n     lessons about our own democracy. For us, the Second World War \n     was in effect a second American revolution. The war invited \n     women into the workforce. It exposed the injustice on African \n     Americans, Hispanics and Japanese Americans and others who \n     demonstrated yet again that war is an equal opportunity \n     employer. What we learned in foreign fields of battle we \n     applied in post-war America. As a result, our democracy, \n     though imperfect, is more nearly perfect than in the days of \n     Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt. That's what \n     makes America forever a work in progress--a land that has \n     never become, but is always in the act of becoming. And \n     that's why the armies of democracy have earned a permanent \n     place on this sacred ground.\n       It is only fitting when this memorial was opened to the \n     public about a month ago the very first visitors were school \n     children. For them, our war is ancient history and those who \n     fought it are slightly ancient themselves. Yet, in the end, \n     they are the ones for whom we built this shrine and to whom \n     we now hand the baton in the unending relay of human \n     possibility.\n       Certainly the heroes represented by the 4,000 gold stars on \n     the freedom wall need no monument to commemorate their \n     sacrifice. They are known to God and to their fellow \n     soldiers, who will mourn their passing until the day of our \n     own. In their names, we dedicate this place of meditation, \n     and it is in their memory that I ask you to stand, if \n     possible, and join me in a moment of silent tribute to remind \n     us all that at sometime in our life, we have or may be called \n     upon to make a sacrifice for our country to preserve liberty \n     and freedom . . .\n       . . . God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8650-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8650-S8651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               U.S.-CENTRAL AMERICA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, just yesterday the Senate passed the \nU.S.-Morocco Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act by a vote of 85 to \n13. This followed on the heels of Senate approval of the U.S.-Australia \nagreement by a vote of 80 to 16. The Australia bill itself was preceded \nby renewal and extension of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, \nwhich passed the Senate by unanimous consent on June 24 of this year. \nPrior to that, the Senate was able to work out its differences and pass \nthe JOBS Act by a vote of 92 to 5. I will note that each of these bills \npassed in an election\n\n[[Page S8651]]\n\nyear, a year in which many pundits argued that nothing on trade would \nget done.\n  Well we proved them wrong. In fact, this has been one of the most \nactive years on trade in the Senate in recent memory. I say, why stop \nnow? We should continue our efforts to open foreign markets to U.S. \nexports. That is why I am calling on President Bush to send up the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement at the earliest opportunity.\n  The CAFTA is an important part of our continuing efforts to open \nforeign markets to U.S. goods and services. This market access is \ncritical if we are going to continue to grow our exports to the world. \nFor my home State of Iowa, the CAFTA brings important new market access \nopportunities for our soybean, corn, pork and beef as well as Iowa's \nmanufacturers and service providers.\n  Under the current framework, many products from the CAFTA nations get \naccess to our market but we do not get the same access to theirs. The \nCAFTA will change that. It will level the playing field for U.S. \nproducers so they can compete in this growing market.\n  The CAFTA also sends a strong message to our Latin American \nneighbors. It shows our strong desire to reach out and form deeper and \nlasting bonds with the international community, particularly in Latin \nAmerica. The agreement will help to lock in economic reform and \nincrease transparency in the region. There is no doubt about it. The \nCAFTA can serve as a cornerstone of economic growth and democracy for \nthe region which will enhance the standard of living for millions of \nour southern neighbors.\n  A free trade agreement with these nations represents a unique \nopportunity not only for U.S. farmers, ranchers, businesses and \nworkers, but also for promoting development, security and prosperity in \nthis region. It is a good agreement for the United States and for \nCentral America. I will work closely with President Bush and my Senate \ncolleagues to do all I can to lay the groundwork for a successful vote \non CAFTA later this year.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the United States-\nMorocco Free-Trade Agreement, which was passed in the Senate yesterday \nby a vote of 85 to 31. Nearly a year and a half of negotiations were \ndevoted to crafting this agreement by U.S. and Moroccan officials. I \nvoted in support of the implementing legislation to this agreement, and \nit is my hope that both of our countries will soon move to adopt the \nagreement.\n  Every year, the United States exports roughly $475 million worth of \ngoods to Morocco. While this amount is not high when we compare it with \nU.S. exports to Australia--approximately $13 billion in 2003--it is \nsignificant if we view it in the dual contexts of leveling the playing \nfield for American exporters, and, second, development and economic \ngrowth. The United States-Morocco FTA will ease the burden on \nAmericans, who, according to the United States Trade Representative, \ncurrently face an average tariff of over 20 percent on products they \nexport to Morocco.\n  Hopefully, this agreement will also spur domestic economic growth in \nMorocco and encourage that nation to raise its labor and environmental \nstandards. Like all nations, Morocco seeks to develop and modernize its \neconomy. If distributed equitably amongst a nation's citizens, economic \nmodernization and prosperity are important tools in the fight against \nextremist ideologies that promote terrorism. I hope that will be the \ncase in Morocco.\n  Indeed, prospects of a United States-Morocco FTA have already in the \nlast year prompted that nation to reform its labor laws. Now it is \nimportant that Morocco take all necessary steps to enforce these laws. \nThe U.S. should also encourage Morocco to pursue further labor and \nenvironmental reform and strengthen its domestic enforcement of \ninternational standards.\n  That is not to say that this agreement is perfect. No agreement will \nbe perfect--although I still believe that the Jordan FTA, which passed \nthe Senate just a few years ago by a vote of 100 to 0, should serve as \na benchmark and guide for the crafting of free trade agreements. Few \nbills, especially free trade agreements, pass with such overwhelming \nsupport. I believe that support was a testament to the inherent quality \nof that agreement.\n  Despite my overall support for the pending agreement, I do have a \nsignificant concern here. First, as my colleagues are aware, the United \nStates-Morocco FTA, like the United States-Australia FTA, includes \nlanguage that would allow prescription drug manufacturers to prevent \nthe reimportation of their products.\n  For a variety of reasons, we are unlikely to import drugs from \nMorocco in the near future. So as a practical matter, like the United \nStates-Australia FTA, this provision will not affect drug prices in the \nU.S. And as the United States-Morocco FTA was negotiated around the \nsame time as the United States-Australia FTA, it is not surprising that \nthis provision appears in both agreements. But, in my view, this \nprovision must not be viewed as a precedent by the Bush administration, \nand I would discourage its inclusion in any future trade agreements \nentered into by the U.S. Nor do I believe that it prevents us from \nadopting laws related to drug importation in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8651-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8651-S8652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    JUST SEVEN LEGISLATIVE DAYS LEFT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week is the last week that Congress is \nin session before the August recess and there is only one additional \nweek to act before the Assault Weapons Ban expires on September 13th. \nThis past Monday, one of our former colleagues, Senator Howard \nMetzenbaum, wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post. In his article, \nSenator Metzenbaum highlights the broad support this law has among \nAmericans, as well as the inconsistencies between the stated positions \nand the actions of President Bush on the reauthorization of this \ncritical law.\n  As my colleagues know, in addition to banning 19 specific weapons, \nthe existing ban makes it illegal to ``manufacture, transfer, or \npossess a semiautomatic'' firearm that can accept a detachable magazine \nand has more than one of several specific military features, such as \nfolding/telescoping stocks, protruding pistol grips, bayonet mounts, \nthreaded muzzles or flash suppressors, barrel shrouds or grenade \nlaunchers. These weapons are dangerous and they should not be on \nAmerica's streets.\n  In April of this year, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence \njoined hundreds of local elected officials and senior law enforcement \nofficials to urge President Bush to push for reauthorization of this \ncritical piece of gun safety legislation. Since then, the support for \nthis important law has grown exponentially. In addition to former \nPresidents Ford, Carter, and Clinton, nearly every major law \nenforcement organization in the country, gun safety organizations, a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate, and countless local leaders have \nadded their names to the list of supporters. I commend them for their \nefforts in support of this commonsense gun safety legislation.\n  In 1994, I voted for the assault weapons ban and in March of this \nyear I joined a bipartisan majority of the Senate in voting to extend \nthe assault weapons ban for 10 years. Unfortunately, despite Senate \npassage of the amendment, it appears that this important gun safety law \nwill be allowed to expire. The House Republican leadership opposes \nreauthorizing the law and President Bush, though he has said he \nsupports it, has done little to help keep the law alive.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed from Senator Metzenbaum be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my statement. I also ask that the \nlist of organizations in support of this critical piece of gun safety \nlegislation be printed in the Record following Senator Metzenbaum's op-\ned.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 America Wants the Assault Weapons Ban\n\n                       (By Howard M. Metzenbaum)\n\n       A decade ago I was privileged to lead a fight with Senator \n     Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on what for me has become a \n     deeply personal issue: the federal ban on assault weapons. \n     These killing machines had no place on our streets in 1994 \n     and they have no place now. Yet as the days pass, it is \n     becoming clear that many members of Congress are content to \n     skip through the summer months doing nothing while awaiting \n     this fall's\n\n[[Page S8652]]\n\n     greatest prize--not the elections, but the sunset of the \n     assault weapons ban.\n       Ten years after that great victory we are facing the \n     extinction of an important public safety law that was an \n     unusual piece of bipartisan lawmaking. In 1994 I had the \n     support of two men whom I would rarely call my allies, \n     Republican icons Ronald Reagan and Rudy Giuliani. As a \n     result, Congress was able to put public safety ahead of \n     special-interest politics.\n       What's going on these days, by contrast, is typical \n     political doublespeak. The president speaks publicly in \n     support of the assault weapons ban but refuses to lobby \n     actively for it. The House majority leader, Tom DeLay of \n     Texas, says the president never told him personally that he \n     wants the assault weapons ban renewed, so DeLay isn't going \n     to pass it.\n       There you have it. The president says he supports the \n     assault weapons ban but refuses to lift a finger for it. And \n     the powerful House majority leader--who does not support the \n     ban--is pretending that all it would take to pass it is a \n     word from the president.\n       This is a tragic development for many reasons, not the \n     least of which is that the public wants this legislation. A \n     new study, ``Unconventional Wisdom,'' by the Consumer \n     Federation of America and the Educational Fund to Stop Gun \n     Violence, found that a substantial majority of likely voters \n     in 10 states support renewing and strengthening the federal \n     assault weapons ban, as do most gun owners and National Rifle \n     Association supporters. The survey found that:\n       Voters in Midwestern states supported renewing the assault \n     weapons ban slightly more than those in Southwestern states. \n     Midwestern states (Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Missouri) \n     averaged 72 percent support for renewal. Southwestern states \n     (Arizona and New Mexico) averaged 67 percent. In Florida, 81 \n     percent of likely voters support renewing the ban.\n       Rural states, traditionally seen as very conservative on \n     gun issues, strongly favored renewing the ban. Sixty-eight \n     percent of voters in South Dakota and West Virginia support \n     renewal.\n       Majorities of gun owners in all but two states favored \n     renewing the ban. Even in those two states, Missouri and \n     Ohio, only slightly less than 50 percent of gun owners and \n     NRA supporters favored renewing the ban.\n       In nine of 10 states surveyed, union households supported \n     renewing the ban by at least 60 percent. In Pennsylvania, 80 \n     percent of union households supported renewing the ban and 73 \n     percent supported strengthening it.\n       At least 60 percent of current and former military members \n     and military families supported renewing the ban in all \n     states surveyed. In Wisconsin, more than three-fourths, 77 \n     percent, of current and former military members and military \n     families support renewing the ban.\n       In March the Senate passed a renewed ban as an amendment to \n     a gun industry immunity bill, which was the NRA's top \n     legislative priority. President Bush issued a statement of \n     administration policy calling the assault weapons ban \n     amendment ``unacceptable.'' The amendment passed on a \n     bipartisan vote, 52 to 47, but the underlying bill was \n     defeated. It was a stunning loss for the gun lobby. The NRA \n     opposes even a straight renewal of the ban. It maintains that \n     most Americans don't want the ban renewed, let alone \n     strengthened, and that Congress should let the ban expire. \n     Not true.\n       The gun industry is licking its chops waiting for the ban \n     to expire. In an upcoming report from the Consumer Federation \n     of America, ``Back in Business,'' one assault weapon \n     manufacturer's sales and marketing director told us, ``When \n     the AWB sunsets, which I fully expect it to do, we will be \n     manufacturing pre-ban style weapons and shipping them to the \n     general public through distribution systems and dealers the \n     very next day without doubt. . . . We look forward to Sept. \n     14th with great enthusiasm.''\n       After 19 years in the Senate, I understand differences of \n     opinions, ideologies and constituencies. What I cannot \n     understand is why congressional leaders and the \n     administration think that the American public won't notice \n     that the ban expired. We'll notice, and they'll be sorry.\n       Reauthorizing the assault weapons ban is supported by:\n       Fraternal Order of Police\n       International Association of Chiefs of Police\n       Major City Chiefs\n       National Association of Police Organizations\n       National Organization of Black Police Officials\n       International Brotherhood of Police Officers\n       Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association\n       American Probation and Parole Association\n       National League of Cities\n       US Conference of Mayors\n       National Association of Counties\n       US Conference of Catholic Bishops\n       National Education Association\n       American Bar Association\n       NAACP\n       Americans for Gun Safety\n       Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence United with the \n     Million Mom March\n       Church Women United\n       Episcopal Church, USA\n       American Academy of Family Physicians\n       American Public Health Association\n       Family Violence Prevention Fund\n       National Coalition Against Domestic Violence\n       National Network to End Domestic Violence\n       National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems\n       National Association of Social Workers\n       Physicians for a Violence Free Society\n       American Association of Suicidology\n       Mothers Against Violence in America\n       Child Welfare League of America\n       Alliance for Justice\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8652-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On August 12, 2002, Stephanie (Wilbur) Thomas, age 19, was driving \nher friend Ukea (Deon) Davis, age 18, home in southeast Washington, DC. \nThe two young transgendered women were members of Transgender Health \nEmpowerment, an African-American transgender support group. A car drove \nup beside them, and a gunman fired shots from an automatic weapon. The \ngunfire killed Ukea Davis and critically wounded Stephanie Thomas. The \ngunman then got out of the car and fired additional shots into Thomas' \ncar. Though police have not determined if they will file this as a hate \ncrime, the additional shots fired at Thomas after the initial shooting \nseem to indicate an overkill factor common in many murders of \ntransgendered people in the U.S.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8652-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8652-S8653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I regret that the President and the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate continue to choose division over \ncooperation and confrontation over consensus on the Presidents' most \ncontroversial judicial nominees. Senators can work together, \nRepublicans and Democrats. The conflict we are experiencing on the \nSenate floor, which has the collateral consequence of disrupting \nimportant and unfinished work of the Senate, is by Republican partisan \ndesign. It is bad for the Senate and the country.\n  Earlier this morning I was at the White House for the signing of the \nLaw Enforcement Officers Safety Act. Senator Campbell and I were the \nlead sponsors in the Senate on this successful effort, which we know as \nthe ``Steve Young Act'' to honor an outstanding law enforcement \nofficer.\n  Another example of our bipartisan cooperation is the resolution the \nSenate passed unanimously last night regarding with the consequences of \nthe Supreme Court's decision in the Blakely case and the need to \nclarify Federal criminal sentencing law, S. Con. Res. 130. The Senate \nhas now said, consistent with the record we developed at our recent \nJudiciary Committee hearing, that the Supreme Court should \nexpeditiously clarify the status of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. \nThe Second Circuit Court of Appeals urged expedited consideration. The \nDepartment of Justice is bringing cases to the Supreme Court and should \nseek expedited consideration to afford the opportunity needed to obtain \nthat necessary guidance.\n  There are scores of other measures on the Senate Calendar of Business \non which we should be acting and could have been acting this week. We \nstill need to enact the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, S. 2013; \nthe Ag Workers bill, S. 1645; the Dream Act, S. 1545; the judicial pay \nraise, S. 1023, the Anti-Atrocity Act, S. 710; the authorization for \nmental health courts, S. 2107; and other needed legislation on which \nthere is so much bipartisan agreement.\n  With all this to do, with the 13 appropriations bills as yet \nunfinished, without a budget, without serious oversight of significant \nproblems, it is incredible\n\n[[Page S8653]]\n\nto me that the Republican Senate leadership is devoting this week to \ndivisive cloture votes on controversial nominations. Why they choose to \nsow division rather than make progress on matters that could improve \nthe lives of so many Americans across the country is for others to \nexplain.\n  Criticism of this ``do-nothing'' Congress is becoming universal. \nConservative writers who are more prone to promote the Republican \nagenda than criticize its leadership have even joined in the chorus. \nMaybe that explains this misguided exercise, maybe it is reaction to \nall the criticism and an effort to shore up the extreme right-wing of \nRepublican support. I do not know.\n  I fear more and more that some want the Senate to become a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of this Presidency and the Federal courts to become an \narm of the Republican Party. That is wrong, that is unwise, that is \nunsound. The American people need to say no and preserve this great \ndemocracy.\n  Rather than doing the people's business, the Senate is being forced \ninto contrived stunts for partisan political purposes. I urge the \nRepublican leadership to use the upcoming recess to learn about the \nSenate and its role in our Federal Government. Maybe read Master of the \nSenate, the extraordinary and award winning book by Robert Caro, or the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  The American people deserve better. The Senate deserves better. \nSenator Byrd has spoken to this situation. Senator Daschle, Senator \nReid and all Democratic Senators have demonstrated over and over again \nour good faith and commitment to moving forward. Let us all, \nRepublicans and Democrats, come back from the upcoming hiatus in our \nSenate proceedings with a commitment to find the common ground that \nSenator Daschle spoke about so well last month in the interests of the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8653-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           OUR MIDEAST POLICY\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I recently wrote a column on Mideast \nPolicy for the Post and Courier in Charleston, SC. I want to share it \nwith my colleagues and ask unanimous consent the July 9 article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Now We Know: It's Our Mideast Policy That's Creating Enemies\n\n                        (By Ernest F. Hollings)\n\n       Now we know: (A) That there are no weapons of mass \n     destruction in Iraq. (B) There was no al-Qaida in Iraq on 9/\n     11. (C) From 1993 until we attacked in 2003--for 10 years--\n     there was no terrorism by Saddam against the United States. \n     (D) Saddam was not involved in the 9/11 attack on the United \n     States. (E) Mideast people are generally of the Islam \n     religion and tribal in culture. The Islam religion is \n     strong--those who don't adhere are considered infidels. (F) \n     Mideast countries don't yearn for democracy--Kuwait, \n     liberated from Saddam, didn't opt for democracy. (G) In ``A \n     World Transformed,'' President ``Papa'' Bush warned, ``We \n     should not march into Baghdad . . . turning the whole Arab \n     world against us . . . assigning young soldiers . . . to \n     fight in what would be an unwinnable urban guerrilla war.'' \n     (H) We went into Baghdad anyway. (I) As the CIA author of \n     ``Imperial Hubris'' wrote, ``There is nothing that bin Laden \n     could have hoped for more than the invasion and occupation of \n     Iraq.'' (J) Now we are the infidel. Our invasion has turned \n     Iraq into a shooting gallery and a recruitment center for al-\n     Qaida. (K) The majority of the Iraqi people want us gone. (L) \n     Even with Saddam out, many feel it wasn't worth the lives of \n     900 killed, 5,000 maimed for life and $200 billion. (M) Now \n     most people of the United States think the invasion of Iraq \n     was a mistake.\n       1. We also know that: (A) Terrorism did not start on 9/11. \n     Terrorism has been going on in Northern Ireland for 35 years. \n     Terrorism now persists between India and Pakistan and between \n     the Kurds and the Turks. (B) Terrorism is not a war but a \n     weapon. We don't call World War II the Blitzkrieg War or the \n     Battle of the Light Brigade the Cavalry War. (C) Terrorism \n     against the United States is based on our policy in the \n     Mideast. Osama bin Laden hit us because of our presence in \n     Saudi Arabia and policy in Israel/Palestine. (D) Everyone \n     knows that Israel is a U.S. commitment. (E) We have \n     maintained this commitment for 37 years with an evenhanded \n     policy between the Israelis and the Palestinians. (F) But \n     President Bush changed the policy of negotiations, confirming \n     Israeli settlements, and invading Iraq to secure Israel by \n     democratizing the Mideast. (G) U.S. News & World Report and \n     others keep parroting that terrorists hit us ``because of our \n     values'' and hate us ``because of who we are.'' Not so! It is \n     our Mideast policy they oppose.\n       The way to win the ``war on terrorism'' is to (1) Seek out \n     al-Qaida and the Taliban and eliminate them. (2) Secure Iraq \n     so that democracy can work. (3) Publicly renounce pre-emptive \n     war. (4) Rather than invasion, use capitalism to spread \n     democracy, which is now working in China. (5) Return to the \n     evenhanded policy of negotiations with Israel and Palestine. \n     (6) Start rebuilding both Israel and Palestine.\n       Everyone laments our predicament after just one year's \n     occupation of Iraq. Imagine 37 years' occupation of \n     Palestine. Anyone with get up and go has gotten up and gone. \n     Palestine is left with the hopeless and embittered. There is \n     no leadership, hardly anything to lead. But embittered \n     refugees from without lead with terrorism. A Palestinian \n     state must first be built in order to be recognized. It can't \n     be built while homes are bulldozed, settlements extended and \n     walls are constructed. Our hypocrisy is obvious. We hail \n     President Reagan for saying, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this \n     wall,'' but now we say, ``Mr. Sharon, put up this wall.'' \n     There are 1 million Arabs in Israel's population of 6 \n     million. For years the people of Israel and Palestine were \n     learning to live together. The Arab soccer team just won the \n     national championship of Israel. But the young of Israel and \n     Palestine are now learning to kill together rather than to \n     live together. This is creating terrorists big time, long \n     term.\n       People the world around respect America for its stand for \n     freedom and individual rights. It's time to stop this wag of \n     people ``hating us'' and against us ``because of our \n     values.'' It's not our values or people, but our Mideast \n     policy they oppose. We need to return to evenhandedness and \n     active negotiations in the Mideast. Then we can begin to win \n     the ``war on terrorism'' and regain our moral authority in \n     the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8653-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8653-S8656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADMINISTRATION MEMORANDUMS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we go out of session for the long recess \nat the end of this week, I am disappointed to report that Congress \nseems content to let the issue of foreign prisoner abuse linger without \neffective congressional oversight.\n  The House Armed Services Committee made it clear weeks ago that it \nbelieved the ongoing military investigations into the abuses were \nsufficient. Until today, the Senate Armed Services Committee had not \nheld a hearing on the prisoner abuse issue in more than a month. \nChairman Warner called a hearing this morning to hear a report on one \nof the investigations: an assessment of Army detention operation \ndoctrine and training, completed by the Army Inspector General.\n  Waiting for the administration to investigate itself is not the \nanswer. There are at least four completed and seven ongoing military \nreviews into the treatment of prisoners held in detention facilities in \nIraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. While these reviews are \nnecessary, they fail to address critical issues: What role did White \nHouse officials, the Justice Department and other agencies play in \ndeveloping the policies that allowed these abuses to occur? The \nmilitary investigations may uncover what went wrong at the bottom of \nthe chain of command, but it will take aggressive congressional \noversight to discover what went wrong at the top of the chain.\n  We need to get to the bottom of this scandal, but we also need to get \nto the top of it. Only by doing that can we responsibly put it behind \nus and repair the damage it threatens to our security, to our \ncredibility and to the safety of our troops.\n  Numerous attempts in Congress to uncover the truth have failed \nbecause Republicans have circled the wagons and refused to support \noversight efforts. In the past week, Democratic members of the House \nintroduced resolutions requiring the Secretary of State and the \nAttorney General to turn over all documents related to the treatment of \nprisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. The resolutions \nfailed on straight party-line votes, first on July 15 in the House \nInternational Relations Committee, and yesterday in the House Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee tried to make \nprogress as long ago as June 17, 2004, but the Committee, on a party-\nline vote, rejected a subpoena resolution for documents relating to the \ninterrogation and treatment of detainees. Since that date, no action \nhas been taken by the Senate Judiciary Committee, despite the clear \nneed to resolve these issues.\n  In the June 17 Committee meeting, and in subsequent days on the \nSenate Floor, several Senators said that we\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\nshould give the administration more time to respond to inquiries, even \nthough some of us had been asking for information for more than a year. \nQuestions were submitted to the Attorney General on June 15, following \nhis appearance before the Committee a week earlier. In the June 8 \nhearing, the Attorney General refused to provide information and \nessentially demanded that the Committee issue a subpoena for the \nrequested materials.\n  On June 17, Democratic Judiciary Committee members were urged to \nwithhold a subpoena and to give the Attorney General until the end of \nthe month to respond. At that time, Chairman Hatch said he believed the \nadministration should comply; he said that it was ``the right thing to \ndo.'' He said that if the administration did not respond by the end of \nJune, then ``I may very well vote for a subpoena at that time.'' That \nsame day, Senator DeWine said, ``I think the administration has to \n[clarify the policy] and has to release the information that will \nclarify that.'' Senator Specter said, ``I believe that this committee \nought to know what the interrogation practices are and I am prepared to \npursue them.'' But all in all, the Republicans asked us to give the \nDepartment more time, to wait for the Attorney General to answer our \nquestions.\n  And then, the Attorney General--through an aide--on July 1, again \nthumbed his nose at his obligations to the Committee of jurisdiction \nover the Department of Justice. He refused to provide a comprehensive \nset of answers to questions submitted by the nine Democratic members of \nthis Committee, he refused to provide almost all of the documents that \nwere requested, and, again, he refused even to provide an index of the \ndocuments being withheld. Because of the continued stonewalling by the \nadministration, Congress and its committees of jurisdiction over the \nDepartment of Justice remain largely in the dark about these pertinent \nmatters.\n  Other Senate committees have faced similar obstacles, even when there \nhave been bipartisan requests for information. The Pentagon played \ngames with the Senate Armed Services Committee for seven weeks before \nshowing members the reports on treatment of prisoners in Iraq produced \nby the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC. While such \nreports are generally not released, the ICRC agreed early on that \nmembers of Congress should have access to them on a confidential basis. \nMembers of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees were first \nshown ICRC reports on Iraq last Wednesday, July 14, after having \nrequested them in early June.\n  Access to these reports was extremely limited, causing some Members \nof the House Armed Services Committee to complain that the information \nwas stale and that Pentagon briefers were unable to shed light on the \nabuses. It is puzzling that Members of Congress--and specifically \nMembers of the committees of jurisdiction--should be treated so \nincidentally.\n  The ICRC reports did make an important contribution, however. They \napparently confirm that U.S. officials should have been alerted to the \nprisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison months before the Pentagon \nannounced an investigation on January 16, 2004, and before General \nTaguba was assigned to lead this inquiry on January 31, 2004. According \nto House members, the ICRC reports alleged serious abuses at Abu Ghraib \nlast fall, a time period that coincides with the point at which U.S. \nmilitary intelligence reportedly took control of certain cellblocks of \nAbu Ghraib. In addition to the ICRC reports, the New York Times has \nreported that in November 2003, a small group of interrogators at Abu \nGhraib began sharing allegations of prisoner abuse with senior \nofficers. It is hard to comprehend the administration's apparent \nfailure to respond to the ICRC and to internal military reports of \nabuse for weeks or months in late fall and early winter.\n  Some individuals who committed abusive acts are being punished, as \nthey must be. But this issue runs much deeper. What of those who gave \nthe orders, set the tone, or looked the other way? What of the White \nHouse and Pentagon lawyers who tried to justify the use of torture in \ntheir legal arguments? The White House has now disavowed the analysis \ncontained in the August 1, 2002, Office of Legal Counsel memorandum. \nThat memo, which was sent to the White House Counsel, argued that for \nacts to rise to the level of torture, they must go on for months or \neven years, or be so severe as to generate the type of pain that would \nresult from organ failure or even death. The White House and the \nDepartment of Justice now call that memo ``irrelevant'' and \n``unnecessary'' and say that DOJ will spend weeks rewriting its \nanalysis.\n\n  A troubling editorial in the July 15 Washington Post charges that \nseveral detainees in secret CIA custody have probably been tortured, \nand that the August 1, 2002, memo was written after those acts occurred \nin order to justify the acts as legal.\n  Meanwhile, we continue to hear of more documents. The Department of \nJustice admitted in the July 1 letter to the Judiciary Committee that \nit had ``given specific advice concerning specific interrogation \npractices,'' but would not disclose such advice to members of the \nCommittee, who are duly elected representatives of the people of the \nUnited States, as well as members of the committee of oversight for the \nDepartment of Justice. USA Today reported on June 28 that the Justice \nDepartment issued a memo in August 2002 that ``specifically authorized \nthe CIA to use `waterboarding,' '' an interrogation technique that is \ndesigned to make a prisoner believe he is suffocating. This memo is \nreportedly classified and has not been released. According to USA \nToday: ``Initially, the Office of Legal Counsel was assigned the task \nof approving specific interrogation techniques, but high-ranking \nJustice Department officials intercepted the CIA request, and the \nmatter was handled by top officials in the Deputy Attorney General's \noffice and Justice's Criminal Division.''\n  While former administration officials grant press interviews and \nwrite opinion articles denying wrongdoing, and the White House and \nJustice Department hold closed briefings for the media to disavow the \nreasoning of this previously relied upon memoranda and to characterize \nwhat happened, Senators of the United States are denied basic \ninformation and access to the facts. I would hope that the significance \nof such unilateralism and arrogance shown to the Congress and to its \noversight committees will register with each and every Member of this \nbody.\n  These memos, which may have governed official action for nearly two \nyears, are of particular concern because so much of what is happening \nin detention centers remains hidden. In addition to Abu Ghraib in Iraq, \nBagram in Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay, several shadowy detention \ncenters are operated by the intelligence agencies or possibly the \nmilitary, some under total secrecy. A report on secret detentions was \nreleased on June 17, 2004, by Human Rights First, a non-profit research \nand advocacy organization formerly called the Lawyers Committee for \nHuman Rights. This report raises many important questions on the issue \nof foreign prisons. I will ask unanimous consent that the introduction \nbe printed in the Record. The report, Ending Secret Detentions, \ndescribes a number of officially undisclosed locations that sources--\ntypically unnamed government sources quoted in the press--have \ndescribed as detention centers for terrorism suspects. These sources \nhave discussed facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Jordan, Diego \nGarcia, and on U.S. war ships. The ICRC has not been allowed to visit \nthese facilities. It issued a public statement in March expressing its \ngrowing concern over ``the fate of an unknown number of people captured \n. . . and held in undisclosed locations.'' To date, its requests for \naccess to the prisons have been denied.\n  In Iraq, where the Bush administration claims to be following the \nGeneva Conventions, Human Rights First states that it is unclear if the \nICRC has access to all detention facilities in the country. Even if it \ndid, the Secretary of State admitted in June that he had approved \nrequests to hide certain detainees from the International Red Cross.\n  And what of the secret detention centers? Have these facilities been \nmanaged by officials operating under the legal analysis contained in \nDOJ memos that argue for a very narrow reading of\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\nthe prohibition on torture? Have they been managed by officials acting \nin accordance with the President's determination that al-Qaeda and \nTaliban suspects are not protected by the Geneva Conventions? What is \nthe legal status of these individuals? Even in Iraq, where, as I just \nmentioned, the administration claims to be applying the Geneva \nConventions, there is a great deal of ambiguity. The Human Rights First \nreport describes new categories of prisoners in Iraq, including \n``security detainees,'' ``high value detainees,'' and a group of \nprisoners whose status the Coalition Provisional Authority declined to \ndiscuss. These are not categories of prisoners defined in the Geneva \nConventions, and without full access given the ICRC, no one can verify \nthe circumstances under which they are being held and interrogated.\n  The administration can provide a significant amount of information \nabout its practices in handling foreign detainees without jeopardizing \nnational security and while still protecting sensitive information. \nThis should include relevant facts about detention centers, and an \naccounting of the number of detainees, their nationality, and the legal \nauthority under which each is held. I also restate my longstanding \nrequest for the documents produced by the White House, the Justice \nDepartment, the Pentagon and other agencies that form the legal basis \nfor this Administration's treatment and interrogation of foreign \nprisoners.\n  With his words, President Bush says he wants the whole truth, but \nwith his actions he and his administration instead have cynically \nblocked the doors that lead to the answers. The American people and the \nAmerican troops who are put at risk by these policies and abuses need \nand deserve to understand how this happened, and they need to know it \nwill not happen again. For the sake of our national security interests \nand our credibility, we need to show the world the right way that a \ndemocratic society corrects its mistakes. Thwarting adequate oversight \nand avoiding accountability will not make this problem go away, it will \ncompound it.\n  I ask unanimous consent the report to which I referred be printed in \nthe Record.\n  (There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:)\n\n                  [From Human Rights First, June 2004]\n\n                        Ending Secret Detentions\n\n               (By Michael Posner and Deborah Pearlstein)\n\n\n                            I. Introduction\n\n       More than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in \n     many countries. Many others have met a different fate. Put it \n     this way, they're no longer a problem to the United States \n     and our friends and allies. (President George W. Bush, State \n     of the Union Address, February 4, 2003)\n       In April, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in \n     the cases of Jose Padilla and Yaser Hamdi--both U.S. citizens \n     who have been held in military detention facilities for more \n     than two years. One justice wondered aloud how the Court \n     could be sure that government interrogators were not abusing \n     these detainees. You just have to ``trust the executive to \n     make the kind of quintessential military judgments that are \n     involved in things like that,'' said Deputy Solicitor General \n     Paul Clement! Later that evening, CBS's 60 Minutes broadcast \n     the first shocking photographs of U.S. troops torturing Iraqi \n     prisoners at the Abu Ghraib detention center in Iraq.\n       The photos from Abu Ghraib have made a policy of ``trust \n     us'' obsolete. But they are only the most visible symptoms of \n     a much larger and more disturbing systemic illness. Since the \n     attacks of September 11, the United States has established a \n     network of detention facilities around the world used to \n     detain thousands of individuals captured in the ``war on \n     terrorism.'' Information about this system--particularly the \n     location of U.S. detention facilities, how many are held \n     within them, on what legal basis they are held, and who has \n     access to the prisoners--emerges in a piecemeal way, if at \n     all, and then largely as a result of the work of \n     investigative reporters and other non-governmental sources. \n     The official secrecy surrounding U.S. practices has made \n     conditions ripe for illegality and abuse.\n       Several of these facilities, including the U.S. military \n     bases at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and at Bagram Air Force Base \n     in Afghanistan, are well known. The existence of these \n     facilities--and the fact of unlawful conduct within them--\n     have been widely publicized and well documented. Nonetheless, \n     there is still no or only conflicting information about how \n     many individuals are held there, troubling information about \n     inadequate provision of notice to families about the fact of \n     detainees' capture and condition, and unclear or conflicting \n     statements about detainees' legal status and rights. While \n     the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has \n     visited these facilities, their visits have been undermined \n     in ways contrary to the letter and spirit of binding law.\n       In addition, there are detention facilities that multiple \n     sources have reported are maintained by the United States in \n     various officially undisclosed locations, including \n     facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Jordan, on the \n     British possession of Diego Garcia, and on U.S. war ships at \n     sea. U.S. Government officials have alluded to detention \n     facilities in undisclosed locations, declining to deny their \n     existence or refusing to comment on reports of their \n     existence.\\3\\ A Department of Defense official told Human \n     Rights First in June 2004 that while Abu Ghraib and \n     Guantanamo's Camp Echo were open to discussion, ``as a matter \n     of policy, we don't comment on other facilities.\\4\\ \n     Similarly, Captain Bruce Frame, a U.S. army spokesman from \n     CENTCOM, the unified military command that covers Africa, the \n     Middle East, and Central Asia, told Human Rights First only \n     that there ``may or may not'' be detention centers in \n     countries other than Iraq and Afghanistan in CENTCOM's area \n     of responsibility.\\5\\\n\n\n                           The Known Unknowns\n\n       What is unknown about this detention system still outweighs \n     what is known about it. But facilities within it share in \n     common key features that--while having unclear benefits in \n     the nation's struggle against terrorism--make inappropriate \n     detention and abuse not only likely, but virtually \n     inevitable.\n       First, each of these facilities is maintained in either \n     partial or total secrecy. For the past half-century, the \n     United States has considered itself bound by international \n     treaties and U.S. military regulations that prohibit such \n     blanket operating secrecy. Yet in this conflict, the ICRC--\n     which the United States has long respected as a positive \n     force in upholding international humanitarian law--has \n     repeatedly sought and been denied access to these \n     facilities.\\6\\ As the ICRC recently noted in a public \n     statement:\n       Beyond Bagram and Guantanamo Bay, the ICRC is increasingly \n     concerned about the fate of an unknown number of people \n     captured as part of the so-called global war on terror and \n     held in undisclosed locations. For the ICRC, obtaining \n     information on these detainees and access to them is an \n     important humanitarian priority and a logical continuation of \n     its current detention work in Bagram and Guantanamo Bay.\\7\\\n       Indeed, Human Rights First has been unable to identify any \n     official list of U.S. detention facilities abroad employed in \n     the course of the ``war on terrorism.'' There is likewise no \n     public accounting of how many are detained or for what reason \n     they are held. And there has been a disturbing absence of \n     serious congressional oversight of both known and undisclosed \n     detention facilities.\\8\\\n       Second, these facilities have thrived in an environment in \n     which the highest levels of U.S. civilian leadership have \n     sought legal opinions aimed at circumventing the application \n     of domestic and international rules governing arrest and \n     detention. Where it would have once seemed crystal clear to \n     military commanders and on-the-ground military custodians \n     alike that the Geneva Conventions governed the arrest and \n     detention of individuals caught up in the conflicts in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan, this Administration has challenged the \n     applicability of those rules. In several recently leaked \n     legal opinions from White House Counsel, and the Departments \n     of Defense and Justice, it has become clear that some in the \n     Administration have given a green light to the wholesale \n     violation of these rules.\\9\\\n       As a result, it remains unclear what legal status has been \n     assigned to those being detained at these U.S.-controlled \n     facilities. Are they prisoners of war, civilians who took a \n     direct part in hostilities (who the Administration calls \n     ``unlawful combatants''), or are they suspected of criminal \n     violations under civilian law? The Administration has applied \n     no clear system for defining their status. It also is unclear \n     under many circumstances which U.S. agency is ultimately \n     responsible for their arrest or the conditions of their \n     confinement. And it now seems that U.S. military and \n     intelligence agencies are involved in their interrogation, as \n     well as civilian or foreign government contractors to whom \n     aspects of detention and interrogation has been outsourced. \n     It is likewise unclear to whom a family member or legal \n     representative can appeal to challenge the basis for their \n     continued detention.\n       Finally, the U.S. government has failed to provide prompt \n     notice to families of those captured that their family member \n     is in custody, much less information about their health or \n     whereabouts. In such cases, the families of individuals \n     removed to such unknown locations have had no opportunity to \n     challenge detentions that may continue for extended \n     periods.\\10\\ For example, Saifullah Paracha, according to \n     information his family received from the ICRC, has been \n     detained at Bagram Air Force Base for more than 11 months. \n     His wife and children remain in the dark, not only of the \n     reason for his detention, but also when they can expect Mr. \n     Paracha to be released or tried.\\11\\ Other individuals \n     captured more than a year ago remain in detention at other \n     undisclosed locations.\\12\\ The lack of information to family \n     members about these detainees violates U.S. legal obligations \n     and sets a negative precedent for treatment that may be \n     directed at U.S. soldiers in the future. It also engenders\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\n     great anguish and suffering on the part of the families of \n     detainees--no less than did the practice of ``forcible \n     disappearance'' in past decades--while engendering enormous \n     hostility toward the United States.\n\n\n                  in the interest of national security\n\n       The Administration has argued that, faced with the \n     unprecedented security threat posed by terrorist groups ``of \n     global reach,'' \\13\\ it has had to resort to preventive \n     detention and interrogation of those suspected to have \n     information about possible terrorist attacks. According to \n     the Defense and Justice Departments, a key purpose of these \n     indefinite detentions is to promote national security by \n     developing detainees as sources of intelligence. And while \n     much of what goes on at these detention facilities is steeped \n     in secrecy, intelligence agents insist that ``[w]e're getting \n     great info almost every day.'' \\14\\\n       Whatever the value of intelligence information obtained in \n     these facilities--and there is reason to doubt the \n     reliability of intelligence information gained only in the \n     course of prolonged incommunicado detention\\15\\--there is no \n     legal or practical justification for refusing to report \n     comprehensively on the number and location of these \n     detainees--or to fail to provide the identities of detainees \n     to the ICRC, detainees' families, their counsel, or to others \n     having a legitimate interest in the information (unless a \n     wish to the contrary has been manifested by the persons \n     concerned).\n       The United States is of course within its power to ask \n     questions and to cultivate local sources of information. And \n     the United States certainly has the power to detain--in \n     keeping with its authority under the Constitution and \n     applicable international law--those who are actively engaged \n     in hostilities against the United States, or those suspected \n     of committing or conspiring to commit acts against the law. \n     But it does not have the power to establish a secret system \n     of off-shore prisons beyond the reach of supervision, \n     accountability, or law.\n       Finally, even if some valuable information is being \n     obtained, there are standards on the treatment of prisoners \n     that cannot be set aside. The United States was founded on a \n     core set of beliefs that have served the nation very well \n     over two centuries. Among the most basic of these beliefs is \n     that torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment \n     is wrong; arbitrary detention is an instrument of tyranny; \n     and no use of government power should go unchecked. The \n     refusal to disclose the identity of detainees, prolonged \n     incommunicado detention, the use of secret detention centers, \n     and the exclusion of judicial or ICRC oversight combine to \n     remove fundamental safeguards against torture and ill-\n     treatment and arbitrary detention. Current practices which \n     violate these principles must be stopped immediately.\n       The abuses at Abu Ghraib underscore the reason why, since \n     the United States' founding, Americans have rejected the idea \n     of a government left to its own devices and acting on good \n     faith in favor of a government based on checks and balances \n     and anchored to the rule of law. As James Madison noted, \n     ``[a] popular Government without popular information, or the \n     means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or \n     Tragedy.'' \\16\\ This nation's history has repeatedly taught \n     the value of public debate and discourse. To cite one \n     example, the United States learned this 30 years ago when a \n     series of congressional investigations uncovered widespread, \n     secret domestic spying by the CIA, NSA, FBI, and the Army--\n     revelations whose impact on the intelligence agencies was, in \n     former CIA Director Stansfield Turner's words, \n     ``devastating.'' \\17\\\n       We should be clear--the United States has important and \n     legitimate interests in gathering intelligence information \n     and in keeping some of this information secret. But we are \n     not demanding the public release of any information that \n     would compromise these interests. What we are calling for is \n     an official accounting--to Congress and to the ICRC--of the \n     number, nationality, legal status, and place of detention of \n     all those the United States currently holds. We ask that all \n     of these places of detention be acknowledged and open to \n     inspection by the ICRC, and that the names of all detainees \n     be made available promptly to the ICRC and to others with a \n     legitimate interest in this information. Neither logic nor \n     law supports the continued withholding of the most basic \n     information about the United States' global system of secret \n     detention. Trust is plainly no longer enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8656-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RETIREMENT OF VICE ADMIRAL GORDON S. HOLDER, UNITED STATES NAVY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \ngreat patriot, sailor and fellow Floridian, VADM Gordon S. Holder. Vice \nAdmiral Holder is retiring after a distinguished 36-year career in the \nUnited States Navy.\n  Gordon Holder entered naval service in 1968 after graduating from \nFlorida State, University in Tallahassee and completion of the Officer \nCandidate School in Newport RI. Since then he as served with \ndistinction in peace and war in a variety of command and staff \npositions on shore and at sea.\n  Vice Admiral Holder's illustrious career includes sea duty on the USS \nWilliam C. Lawe (DD 763) as First Lieutenant and Combat Information \nCenter Officer, USS Brumby (DE 1044) as Operations Officer, USS Boulder \n(LST 1190) as Chief Engineer, and USS Hermitage (LSD 34) as Executive \nOfficer. His first command at sea was USS Inflict (MSO 456), with \nsubsequent commanding officer afloat tours in USS Whidbey Island (LSD \n41) and USS Austin (LPD 4). He has also served staff tours with \nCommander Seventh Fleet and Commander Naval Forces, U.S. Central \nCommand as Fleet Exercises and Amphibious Warfare Officer, and with \nAmphibious Group Two as Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations and \nPlans.\n  Shore tours include Aide to the Commandant Sixth Naval District and \nCommander Naval Base Charleston, Company Officer and Special Assistant \nto the Commandant, U.S. Naval Academy, and Assistant Surface Commander \nAssignments Officer, Naval Military Personnel Command. In 1980, Vice \nAdmiral Holder graduated with distinction from the Air Command and \nStaff College at Air University, Montgomery, AL.\n  Vice Admiral Holder was selected for promotion to flag rank in \nDecember 1993 and has served as Commander Naval Surface Group Middle \nPacific and Commander Naval Base Pearl Harbor, Commander Naval Doctrine \nCommand, Commander Amphibious Group Two, and Commander, Military \nSealift Command.\n  Vice Admiral Holder assumed his current duties as Director for \nLogistics on the Joint Staff on September 4, 2001 just one week prior \nto the fateful attacks on U.S. soil. In this capacity he has worked \ntirelessly and with great success to plan, organize and direct the \nmassive logistics effort of the nation in support of our Armed Forces \nin the global war on terrorism, including successful combat operations \nin Afghanistan and Iraq. At the same time, he has been instrumental in \nguiding the transformation of military logistics to a true 21st century \nstructure that links industry, supply, transportation, maintenance and \nmanagement systems capable of supporting our forces around the globe. \nVice Admiral Holder has had direct and far-reaching influence on \nnumerous policies, programs and operations that support our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines, including, most notably the rotation of \nforces in Operation Iraqi Freedom, the largest movement of American \nforces since World War II.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Vice Admiral Holder for \nthe leadership he has provided, for the care and concern he has \ndemonstrated for our service members and their families and for his \ndedicated and honorable service to our Nation and Navy. As he turns to \nretired life, we wish him, his wife Pat and family Godspeed and all the \nbest in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8656-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8656-S8657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to rise today to talk for a \nfew minutes about a bill I am cosponsoring, the National Health \nInformation Technology Adoption Act, S. 2710. This bill, introduced \nyesterday by Senator Gregg, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee, takes an important step forward in \nbringing our Nation's medical system into the 21st century.\n  In today's society, it seems that almost everything is computerized \nand on-line. You can pay your bills on-line, order your groceries on-\nline, and even file your taxes on-line. However, for the most part, \nmedical records are still on paper and in files. This means these \nrecords are uneasily shared between doctors treating the same patient \nor are not readily available during an emergency.\n  Earlier this year, the Bush administration made computerizing the \nNation's medical record and building a nationwide health network a \npriority. Yesterday, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson \nreleased a 10-year plan for doing just that.\n  S. 2710 is similar to the administration's plan and takes some \nimmediate steps to start fulfilling this goal, including establishing \nan official office at the Department of Health and Human Services to \ncoordinate health information technology at the national level. The \nbill also provides assistance\n\n[[Page S8657]]\n\nto local communities linking their health care systems, along with \nproviding grants for purchasing health information technology.\n  Creating a safe, secure and reliable system for medical records won't \nbe easy, but if done properly, it could help health care providers \nreduce medical errors and provide better care to their patients. We \ncould also see a substantial savings in administrative costs which will \nhelp lower health care costs for everyone.\n  S. 2710 is a good first step, and I am proud to be a co-sponsor. I am \nhopeful that the members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions can work together to pass this bill soon, and that \nwe can get it to the President's desk by the end of the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8657-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LABOR-HHS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senate will soon have the opportunity \nto consider the 2005 Labor-Health and Human Services Appropriations \nbill recently passed the House. Included in that bill is a provision \nthat would divert $500,000 in funding from the Office of the General \nCounsel at the Food and Drug Administration--FDA. As chairman of the \ncommittee with oversight over the FDA, I believe that such a provision \nis not only misguided, but based upon a flawed understanding of both \nthe Agency and the facts.\n  According to the sponsors of this provision, such a punitive measure \nis warranted because the current Chief Counsel, Dan Troy, is taking the \nAgency ``in a radical new direction'' by filing amicus curiae briefs in \nproduct liability cases. Sponsors of this provision also claim that Mr. \nTroy's involvement in one such case is suspect because it involved \nPfizer, a client of Mr. Troy's when he was with the law firm of Wiley, \nRein & Fielding. Such charges are patently without merit, and I would \nlike to take this opportunity to set the record straight.\n  First, Mr. Troy has not broken any new ground by having the FDA \ninterject in product liability cases on the side of a defendants \nwithout the court requesting the Agency's position. I have here a \nletter addressed to me from five former FDA chief counsels--two of \nwhich are Democrats--affirming that Mr. Troy's actions are neither \n``radical'' nor ``novel.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 21, 2004.\n     Re Hinchey Amendment to cut $500,000 from the appropriations \n         for the FDA Office of Chief Counsel\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Gregg: The undersigned comprise all of the \n     former Chief Counsel to the Food and Drug Administration (in \n     both Republican and Democratic Administrations), except for \n     one who is currently an attorney in the Office of the General \n     Counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services. We \n     are writing to recommend reconsideration of the amendment to \n     the FDA appropriations bill by Representative Hinchey of New \n     York on the floor of the House of Representatives, which \n     would reduce the appropriation for the FDA Office of Chief \n     Counsel by $500,000 and would increase the appropriation for \n     the Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising, and \n     Communications in the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and \n     Research by a corresponding amount. We support additional \n     funds for the Division of Drug Marketing, but we believe that \n     the reduction of the appropriation for the Office of Chief \n     Counsel and Representative Hinchey's reasons for penalizing \n     that Office cannot be supported.\n       FDA's Office of Chief Counsel performs critical functions \n     in the administration and enforcement of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws administered by FDA. \n     The substantial reduction in the funding of that Office, \n     therefore, would materially impair its ability to meet the \n     needs of its client, FDA. Such impairment would be contrary \n     to the public interest.\n       Representative Hinchey's reasons for penalizing the Office \n     of Chief Counsel and criticizing FDA Chief Counsel Daniel E. \n     Troy are set forth in the House Debate on the FDA \n     appropriations legislation as reported in 150 Cong. Rec. \n     H5598-H5599 (July 13, 2004). Representative Hinchey states \n     that Mr. Troy ``has taken the agency in a radical new \n     direction'' by submitting amicus curiae briefs in cases in \n     which courts have been asked to require labeling \n     for pharmaceutical products that conflicts with FDA \n     decisions about appropriate labeling for those products. \n     Representative Hinchey characterizes this activity as a \n     ``pattern of collusion between the FDA and the drug \n     companies and medical device companies'' in a way that has \n     ``never happened before.''\n       These characterizations are inaccurate.\n       In Weinberger v. Bentex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 412 U.S. 645 \n     (1973), the Supreme Court agreed with the briefs filed by the \n     Department of Justice on behalf of FDA that the agency has \n     primary jurisdiction over new drug issues. In Jones v. Rath \n     Packing Co., 425 U.S. 933 (1977), the FDA took the position \n     in an amicus curiae brief submitted by the Department of \n     Justice that federal food labeling requirements preempt \n     inconsistent state requirements, and the Supreme Court \n     agreed. In subsequent private tort litigation, FDA has taken \n     the position, through amicus curiae briefs filed by the \n     Department of Justice, that FDA decisions regarding drug \n     product labeling and related issues preempt inconsistent \n     state court determinations, and the courts have agreed. E.g., \n     Bernhardt v. Pfizer, Inc., 2000 U.S. Dist. Lexis 16963 \n     (November 16, 2000); Eli Lilly & Co. v. Marshall, 850 S.W. 2d \n     164 (Texas 1993). All of this was to protect a uniform \n     national system of food and drug law. All of it occurred \n     before Mr. Troy assumed his current position. In none of \n     these cases did any court request FDA's opinion. Thus, there \n     is ample precedent for the actions that Mr. Troy has recently \n     been undertaking. His action is not radical or even novel.\n       The amicus curiae briefs filed by the Department of Justice \n     at the request of Mr. Troy protect FDA's jurisdiction and the \n     integrity of the federal regulatory process. There is a \n     greater need for FDA intervention today because plaintiffs in \n     courts are intruding more heavily on FDA's primary \n     jurisdiction then ever before. In our judgment, Mr. Troy's \n     actions are in the best interests of the consuming public and \n     FDA. If every state judge and jury could fashion their own \n     labeling requirements for drugs and medical devices, there \n     would be regulatory chaos for these two industries that are \n     so vital to the public health, and FDA's ability to advance \n     the public health by allocating scarce space in product \n     labeling to the most important information would be seriously \n     eroded. By assuring FDA's primary jurisdiction over these \n     matters, Mr. Troy is establishing a sound policy of national \n     decisions that promote the public health and, thus, the \n     public interest.\n       We therefore recommend that the $500,000 cut from the \n     appropriations for the FDA Office of Chief Counsel be \n     restored.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Peter Barton Hutt (1972-1975).\n     Richard A. Merrill (1975-1977).\n     Richard M. Cooper (1977-1979).\n     Nancy L. Buc (1980-1981).\n     Thomas Scarlett (1981-1989).\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, second, as stated in the letter from the \nfive former FDA chief counsels, the FDA has been filing amicus briefs \nfor such purposes since long before Mr. Troy's tenure. Mr. Troy is \nresponsible for safeguarding the FDA's ability to carry out the \nresponsibilities Congress has given the Agency, and his interest in \nthose cases has been to preserve the FDA's authority and to safeguard \nthe Agency's primary jurisdiction.\n  Finally, if Mr. Troy's previous work for a client--in this case \nPfizer--automatically precluded him from representing a federal agency \nin any matter affecting that client, such a policy would not only \ndiscourage, but make it extremely difficult for any private sector \nattorney from taking a job in government. Additionally, I know from \npersonal experience that Mr. Troy has the character and the integrity \nto recuse himself from a matter when appropriate. On at least one \noccasion in which my office was required to interact with the FDA, Mr. \nTroy recused himself from involvement in the matter, citing his \ninterest in complying strictly with FDA rules.\n  Mr. Troy's actions are neither inappropriate nor unprecedented. \nRather, these are examples of Mr. Troy doing his job and enforcing the \nlaw. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider these facts before \nsupporting any provision, such as this one, that would undermine the \nFDA's ability to protect the public health and patient access to safe \nand effective life-saving therapies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8657-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8657-S8660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AVIATION SECURITY\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the 9/11 Commission released its report \ntoday on the events leading up to 9/11, and the security failures that \nprecipitated this tragedy. The Senate Commerce Committee has spent a \ngreat deal of its time and attention on aviation security over the \nyears. I have served in the U.S. Senate for more than 38 years. This \ninstitution can be slow to make decisions, but when needed, this body \ncan move quickly and effectively. After 9/11, we acted immediately\n\n[[Page S8658]]\n\nto create the Transportation Security Administration in an effort to \nforce real change in our aviation security regime. Fast action to \nbolster our Nation's aviation security was critical to restore the \ntrust of travelers in an air transportation system that was on the \nverge of collapse.\n  Congress has often acted decisively during the deliberation of \naviation security issues. For example, following the work of a prior \npresidential commission, a bipartisan group, led on the Senate side by \nSenator Lautenberg and former Senator D'Amato, investigated the 1998 \ndestruction of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and made \nnumerous recommendations. We took up and passed many of them as part of \nthe Aviation Security and Improvement Act, P.L. 101-604. I also was in \nthe Senate as a wave of hijacking to Cuba in the late 1960s and early \n1970s led to the wide use of metal detectors at commercial airports.\n  Unfortunatley, the current threat to security is a more sophisticated \none, and one that has forced our government to change the way we deal \nwith security in general. Prior to 9/11, we had a poorly paid screener \nworkforce, with a high turnover rate. Post 9/11, we have a better \ntrained, better paid workforce with a relatively low turnover rate. \nSome, however, want to turn back the clock. We cannot let that happen.\n  Even prior to 9/11, there are indicators that FAA was concerned with \na number of events around the world regarding hijackings. Following Pan \nAm 103, we pushed to put bomb detection equipment in airports, but \nuntil TWA 800 blew up over Long Island in July of 1996, there was no \nreal effort to fund aviation security.\n  Today TSA is spending $5.3 billion annually on all transportation \nsecurity, and it is not enough. We have underfunded capital \nconstruction at airports, causing a delay in the installation of \nExplosive Detection Systems. We have a cap on the number of security \nscreeners that can be hired, causing huge lines at many of our airports \nbecause we will not provide the money needed to do the job right. But \naviation, comparatively, is in far better shape than maritime and \nrail--areas that are woefully underfunded. I have made this point to \nthe new head of TSA, Admiral Stone, but it is OMB and the \nadministration that are stonewalling the security funding. Simple as \nthat.\n  With all we know about the threats, one would think that we would be \nable to fully fund our security needs, but OMB continues to play the \ntypes of games it plays with all agencies. Look at our Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations bill--no direction on how funds need to be \nallocated or which areas need greater attention. We have given the \nadministration a blank check to spend the money on programs it believes \nwill protect us, but it is not enough. If we keep refusing to take the \nproper actions to improve our transportation security, I am afraid that \nwe will find ourselves once again responding to a national tragedy that \ncould have been stopped with the proper actions and preparation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a New York Times editorial on \naviation security in the Record, as well as a memorandum detailing \nhijackings from 1983 to 1991.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 11, 2004]\n\n                    A Dangerous Retreat on Security\n\n       Bashing federal bureaucracies is a favorite sport among \n     Republicans on Capitol Hill, but their fun should not come at \n     the expense of national security. That is what is likely to \n     happen if airport security checkpoints are once again turned \n     over to profit-driven private contractors. Under a little \n     noticed provision of the post-9/11 aviation security law that \n     would undoubtedly shock most travelers, airports may soon \n     have that option.\n       Air travelers find it reassuring that federal employees now \n     guard the front lines in the war on terror, which makes it \n     all the more surreal that a Sept. 10 mind-set could still \n     persist on Capitol Hill. The Bush administration and House \n     Republican leaders initially opposed the creation of the \n     federal Transportation Security Administration after the 2001 \n     terrorist attacks, arguing that private contractors should \n     continue screening passengers. They gave in to the public \n     demand for a federal takeover, but they made sure to plant \n     the seeds of the effort's rollback. They set an arbitrary cap \n     on the number of federal screeners and set up a pilot program \n     of five airports that would continue being served by private \n     companies, though their screeners have to meet the agency's \n     standards and are paid the same.\n       Republican leaders are loath to see the federal government \n     grow on their watch, and security industry lobbyists are \n     eager to get a larger slice of the billions being spent to \n     protect air travelers. So both want to see the pilot program \n     expanded. Under the 2001 law, individual airports will be \n     able to apply to opt out of the federal system later this \n     year, and rely on private contractors overseen by the T.S.A.\n       None of this makes any sense. It has taken a herculean \n     effort to deploy the agency's tens of thousands of officers \n     at more than 400 airports in two years. The agency has vastly \n     improved airport security, without perfecting it, and is \n     still making progress.\n       It's true that the security provided by private firms at \n     San Francisco and four lesser airports is a far cry from the \n     lax pre-9/11 standard. Studies claim it is no better or worse \n     than the security provided by the T.S.A. But that has been in \n     a period when the federal agency was just getting up to \n     speed, and when companies knew they were essentially on \n     probation.\n       To privatize security at a time of growing complacency \n     would be a dangerous step back. Air travelers do not want to \n     see airports compromise security for the sake of convenience, \n     or federal standards for the sake of profit margins.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Special Analysis--Civil Aviation Incidents in the United States, 1983-\n                                  1992\n\n       This report is an ACI-200 analysis of 36 incidents \n     involving the hijacking or commandeering of aircraft, which \n     occurred in the United States and Puerto Rico between January \n     1, 1983 and October 1, 1992. The most recent of these \n     incidents took place in February 1991. Twenty-nine of the \n     incidents were hijackings, six were commandeerings, and one \n     was a potential hijacking that was prevented at a security \n     checkpoint. The purpose of this review is to determine what \n     elements, if any, were common to these events. Incidents \n     involving general aviation aircraft are not included in this \n     report.\n\n\n                    Hijacker Weapons and Explosives\n\n       Persons who hijacked aircraft used a variety of methods, \n     including the use and/or claim of real or fake weapons, \n     explosive devices, or incendiary devices. In some instances, \n     more that one method was used in a single incident.\n       Real weapons were used during five hijackings. Small knives \n     (blade length of four inches or less), the most frequently \n     employed weapon to hijack aircraft, were used in three \n     incidents. One of these involved three persons using two \n     knives. A handgun, a small pistol of unknown caliber, was \n     used in only one hijacking. This incident involved an \n     escorted prisoner who disarmed his three guards after he \n     obtained a weapon apparently cached in the aircraft's \n     lavatory by persons and means unknown. A plastic flare gun \n     was used in another hijacking.\n       Flammable liquids (or liquids claimed to be flammable) were \n     used in seven hijacking incidents. Hijackers threatened to \n     ignite liquids in bottles or aerosol hair spray-type cans \n     with cigarette lighters, candles, or matches. Fake explosive \n     devices were displayed in ten incidents and explosive devices \n     were claimed in eight others. Fake weapons, including a \n     starter pistol and a realistic looking toy pistol, were used \n     in three hijackings and weapons were claimed in two others. \n     One hijacker neither used nor claimed a weapon or explosive \n     device. None of the hijacking incidents involved the use of \n     an actual explosive device.\n       Except for the escorted prisoner who had been searched, all \n     of the individuals who used real weapons to effect a \n     hijacking went through preboard screening procedures at \n     airport security checkpoints. Weapons were usually hidden in \n     carry-on luggage or on the hijacker. The hijacker who used a \n     starter pistol to effect his act passed it through screening \n     in carryon luggage. He also had a pair of scissors and two \n     knives in his carry-on, but these were well within acceptable \n     standards of the time and were not used in the hijacking. \n     Although it does not appear that there were any especially \n     intricate attempts at concealment, a cassette radio was \n     reportedly used to hide a knife in one incident.\n       A potential hijacking was prevented when two individuals \n     were arrested before the aircraft became airborne. Three \n     individuals who had aroused suspicion prior to boarding their \n     flight were searched at the security checkpoint. One person \n     passed through the checkpoint and went on into the aircraft; \n     however, one of his accomplices was found to have a plastic \n     flask of gasoline strapped to his leg. The first individual \n     was again searched and was found to have a toy pistol as well \n     as a flask of gasoline. Their accomplice was not caught.\n\n\n                             Commandeerings\n\n       Real weapons--two knives, two handguns, and a fire ax--were \n     used in five commandeering incidents, and a fake explosive \n     device was used in a sixth. Although access was gained to \n     aircraft in five incidents, a ticketed passenger was involved \n     in only one. None of the aircraft that were commandeered \n     became airborne, and the situations were resolved through \n     negotiations and/or arrests.\n       Two commandeering incidents involved persons who went \n     through preboard screening. In one incident, an individual \n     had a fishing knife in his carry-on luggage. Although\n\n[[Page S8659]]\n\n     he had no ticket, he realized from observing the screening \n     procedure that he did not need one co enter the sterile area. \n     Once through the security checkpoint, he ran past a gate \n     attendant during boarding and on to a jetway where he used \n     his knife to force his way into the aircraft. The second \n     incident involved a ticketed passenger who, upon boarding his \n     flight, displayed a device consisting of wires and an \n     electrical switch.\n       Persons who circumvented security checkpoints were involved \n     in three commandeering incidents. Security procedures were \n     observed by the suspects in two of these. One individual, who \n     after watching screening procedures realized she would not be \n     able to pass her handgun through the checkpoint, determined \n     that she could walk quickly past security personnel via the \n     passenger exit ramp; the other individual waited until \n     deplaning passengers caused an automatic door to open. Both \n     of these persons brandished handguns (.22 and .25 caliber) \n     when challenged, and each was able to access an aircraft. In \n     a third incident, an individual grabbed a knife at a food \n     concession area. He ran past a security checkpoint to the \n     door of the aircraft, which was closed, and was thus \n     prevented from gaining access to the plane.\n       One commandeering incident also involved a passenger who \n     had been deplaned and was already in the sterile area. He \n     broke through an alarmed door and gained access to the Air \n     Operations Area. He then entered an aircraft being serviced \n     and held several crew members hostage with a fire ax he found \n     on board.\n\n\n                            Mental Disorders\n\n       Nine of the 36 incidents (25%) were committed by persons \n     who were diagnosed as either being mentally incompetent to \n     stand trial or suffering from various mental disorders. For \n     example, charges were dismissed against the ticketed \n     passenger who displayed a fake explosive device upon boarding \n     the aircraft because he was determined to be suffering from a \n     mental disorder. In another situation, the individual who \n     held hostages aboard an aircraft with a fire ax was suffering \n     from a mental disorder; he committed his act because he \n     believed ``Mafia hit men'' were about to kill him.\n       Real weapons were used in three incidents by persons \n     suffering a mental disorder; two had handguns, and one person \n     obtained a fire ax on board in aircraft. Security measures \n     were circumvented on two occasions. One hijacker suffering a \n     mental disorder used a fake weapon, a starter pistol, but \n     also bad a pair of scissors and two knives in his carry-on \n     luggage.\n       Five of the nine incidents that involved persons suffering \n     mental disorders were hijackings, and four were \n     commandeerings. Claims of explosives or weapons occurred in \n     three incidents. Fake explosive devices were displayed in two \n     incidents; in one of these, the hijacker displayed a fake \n     device but had a two liter soda bottle filled with gasoline, \n     which he apparently had intended to use, in baggage he was \n     made to check.\n       Specific destinations were given in five of the situations \n     involving persons with mental disorders. In one commandeering \n     incident, the individual wanted to take control of the \n     aircraft and immediately crash it in order to commit suicide.\n\n\n                           Hijackings to Cuba\n\n       Cuba was the destination of choice in 22 of the 29 \n     hijackings since January 1983. Fourteen of the first 16 \n     flights hijacked to Cuba, between May 1, 1983, and December \n     31, 1984, actually landed in Havana. No flights have \n     successfully been hijacked to Cuba since.\n       Of the 14 hijackings that ended in Cuba, real weapons were \n     used in three. A flare gun was used in one incident, a \n     handgun was used by the escorted prisoner in another, and a \n     knife and aerosol spray can was used in the third incident. \n     Fake explosive devices were displayed in six incidents; two \n     of these were used in combination with a claim of a flammable \n     liquid and/or a fake weapon. Two hijackers also claimed to \n     possess an explosive device. Incendiary devices were claimed \n     in six incidents, sometimes in connection with the use of \n     other devices or claims. In one such incident, the hijacker \n     poured a liquid that smelled like gasoline or kerosene on \n     himself and his seat and then sat holding a lit candle.\n       Eight of the hijacked flights did not divert to Cuba. A \n     real weapon, a knife, were used in just one of these \n     incidents. Another incident involved the use of a fake weapon \n     (starter pistol) and a claim of explosives. Fake explosive \n     devices were exclusively claimed in one incident and used in \n     three others, once with a claim of a flammable liquid. A \n     weapon was alleged in one incident, and one incident occurred \n     in which neither a device nor a weapon was used or claimed.\n       Many of the hijackers who sought to go to Cuba had arrived \n     in the United States during the Mariel Boatlift in the early \n     1980s and wanted to return. Their motivations included \n     homesickness, financial problems, discouragement, and a \n     desire to see family or sick relatives. These individuals \n     usually spoke and understood only Spanish. Several hijackers, \n     however, were non-Cubans who committed their acts for \n     political reasons, that is, to escape the United States and/\n     or find support for the ``revolution.'' Some of the hijackers \n     who wanted to go to Cuba, furthermore, suffered from mental \n     disorders.\n       Most, if not all, of the hijackers who landed in Cuba were \n     arrested and subsequently tried, convicted, and sentenced to \n     prison. This fact was widely publicized in the United States \n     and may have been a factor in a sharp drop in the number of \n     subsequent hijackings to Cuba (17 between May 1983 and \n     January 1985, and one each year from 1987 through 1991).\n\n\n                            Other Hijackings\n\n       Of the seven hijackings in which Cuba was not given as a \n     destination, two aircraft landed where the hijacker demanded \n     and the others continued on course. The hijackers used fake \n     explosive devices in two incidents, claimed explosives in \n     three, and claimed weapons in two. Real weapons were not used \n     in these incidents.\n\n\n                           Multiple Hijackers\n\n       Only three of the 36 incidents involved more than one \n     person. Two of these were hijackings, neither of which was \n     especially sophisticated, and the third was a \n     potential hijacking that was prevented at the security \n     checkpoint. None of the commandeering incidents involved \n     more than one person.\n       In one incident, a hijacker produced a bottle of liquid \n     that smelled like gasoline and locked himself in the rear \n     lavatory, while an accomplice went to the forward galley \n     holding a device that was later determined to be fake. The \n     two hijackers were seated one row apart. The second incident \n     occurred when a passenger in the aft galley grabbed a flight \n     attendant and held a knife to her throat. At the same time, \n     two accomplices arose from their seats; one held a knife and \n     the other a can of aerosol spray and a cigarette lighter. The \n     potential hijacking involved the two individuals detected \n     with flasks of gasoline tied to their legs. One person had \n     passed through the security checkpoint and was on board the \n     aircraft when his accomplice was stopped at the checkpoint. \n     The first individual was again searched and was found to have \n     a toy pistol in addition to the flask of gasoline. Both \n     individuals stated that a third person who was with them, and \n     who was not caught, paid them to transport the devices.\n       One other incident occurred in which a hijacker was \n     supposed to have accomplices. He and three others had planned \n     to commit the hijacking, but, unknown to him, the others did \n     not board the flight after one had been detected with a knife \n     at the security checkpoint. It was only after the hijacker \n     rose from his seat and announced his demand to go to Cuba \n     that he realized he was alone.\n\n\n                              Other Facts\n\n       Only two of the individuals involved in the 36 incidents \n     were females. One woman successfully hijacked a flight to \n     Cuba using a plastic flare gun, and the other ran past a \n     security checkpoint with a handgun, gained access to an \n     aircraft, and held several hostages before being arrested. \n     This second individual was determined to be suffering from a \n     mental disorder.\n       Many of the individuals involved in the hijackings had \n     purchased flight tickets paid for in cash. More often than \n     not, these were same-day purchases of one-way, economy class \n     tickets. A few of the hijackers remained in their assigned \n     seats throughout the incident. More than half of the \n     hijackings were initiated by the hijacker either notifying a \n     flight attendant orally or in writing, or by physically \n     accosting a crew member. Several hijackers simply stood up \n     and announced their act, and a few locked themselves in a \n     lavatory. A few also created disturbances, such as pouring \n     liquid on themselves or their surroundings and threatening to \n     ignite it. There is evidence of preplanning in all but one of \n     the incidents. Finally, there are no indications that any \n     hijackers were familiar with the operation of an aircraft.\n\n\n                                analysis\n\n       During the past nine years, several elements common, to the \n     36 hijackings and commandeering incidents in the U.S. are \n     evident: Generally only one person was involved in each \n     incident; one-fourth of all suspects were suffering from some \n     form of mental disorder; international terrorists were not \n     involved in any of the incidents; most incidents were \n     preplanned acts rather than spur of the moment decisions; \n     actual explosive devices were not used; hijackers frequently \n     claimed to possess explosive or incendiary devices; actual \n     weapons were used more frequently during commandeering \n     incidents than in hijacking situations; many of the \n     perpetrators simply wanted to go somewhere for a variety of \n     economic, social, or family reasons, and either could not \n     afford a ticket or had no other means of transport; and there \n     were no deaths to passengers or aircraft crew members.\n       Many of the incidents occurred either within the sterile \n     area or on board aircraft. Although security procedures at \n     screening checkpoints do not appear to have been at fault in \n     the majority of these cases, some security failures did \n     occur. Actual weapons were taken through screening \n     checkpoints in six incidents. Small knives were used in three \n     hijackings, a plastic flare gun in one incident, and a \n     handgun in another. A small fishing knife was used in a \n     commandeering incident. Fake weapons, a realistic looking toy \n     pistol and a starter pistol, were used in three hijackings.\n       Several hijackings were committed with common, innocuous-\n     looking items. More than one-third of these incidents were \n     committed by persons carrying hoax explosive devices, for \n     example, a pump toothpaste container attached to a \n     flashlight, a large chalice-like cup, and a cellular \n     telephone. Threats were also made to ignite gasses in aerosol \n     cans or flammable liquids (as claimed) in bottles and flasks \n     in some incidents.\n       There were, however, some security successes. One hijacking \n     was prevented at a security checkpoint and another did not \n     take\n\n[[Page S8660]]\n\n     place as planned. The first incident involved the two \n     individuals each of whom had a flask of flammable liquid tied \n     to his leg. In the second incident, the discovery of a knife \n     at a checkpoint resulted in the boarding of only one of four \n     persons who planned to hijack the aircraft to Cuba.\n       At the same time that these types of incidents were taking \n     place in the United States, a different kind of aircraft \n     hijacking was occurring in other parts of the world. These \n     incidents, some of which involved U.S. registered carriers, \n     were noteworthy because of their complexity, duration, and \n     deadliness. They include the hijackings of Trans World \n     Airways Flight 847 and Kuwaiti Air Flight 422, which involved \n     multiple and often zealous, well-armed, well-trained, and \n     disciplined hijackers. Unlike their contemporary U.S. \n     counterparts, these individuals often demonstrated a \n     willingness to die rather than fail and to kill others if \n     their demands, which were frequently politically-motivated, \n     were not met. In many instances, passengers were killed as a \n     result of the actions of such hijackers.\n       Why such incidents did not occur in the United States \n     during the past nine years is a matter of conjecture. Many \n     theories have been advanced, including logistical and \n     operational problems for international terrorists, non-\n     interest by U.S. domestic terrorist groups, and difficulties \n     (or perceived difficulties) in accessing targets. It should \n     not be presupposed from this, however, that such hijackings \n     will never occur in the U.S. Politically motivated hijackings \n     by multiple hijackers have, in fact, taken place in the U.S., \n     but not within the past 9 years.\n       During the past nine years, hijackers in the United States \n     have acted in striking contrast to some of their more \n     noteworthy international counterparts. They usually have not \n     been motivated by the same political forces, such as the \n     freeing of political prisoners or providing publicity for a \n     cause, and they have not exhibited the lame propensity to die \n     and kill others rather than fail.\n       The fact that handguns were seldom used and actual \n     explosive devices never used in domestic hijackings during \n     the past nine years is interesting, but it should not be \n     assumed that future hijackers will act similarly. It is not \n     known why this occurred; it may be a reflection of either \n     better screening procedures or a perception that it is too \n     difficult to pass a gun on board an aircraft. Since several \n     small knives and other items, such as a pair of scissors and \n     a starter pistol, were successfully passed through screening \n     checkpoints in a carry-on bag, however, the system is not \n     infallible.\n       Although most U.S. hijackings during the past nine years \n     were committed by persons acting alone, it should not be \n     assumed that future incidents will follow this format. If \n     there are accomplices, however, they will likely identify \n     themselves in the beginning of the incident rather than \n     remain hidden. Based on past experiences, the hijacker(s) may \n     possess ore or more weapons or a flammable liquid, a fact \n     which they likely will make known, or they may claim to \n     possess an explosive device.\n       Hijackings should be taken seriously unless it is obvious \n     that there is no threat or danger. It is often difficult to \n     determine if a claimed weapon, explosive device, or \n     incendiary device is real. The hijacker(s) should be given \n     the benefit of the doubt until circumstances prove otherwise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8660-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL PURPLE HEART RECOGNITION DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am in support of S. Con. Res. 112 which \nsupports the goals and ideals of National Purple Heart Recognition Day. \nThis award was created by General George Washington, who established \nthe Honorary Badge of Distinction in the figure of a heart in purple \ncloth or silk on August 7, 1782. Since that time, more than 1,535,000 \nAmericans have received Purple Hearts, and their numbers are growing \ndaily as the war in Iraq continues to take its toll.\n  Over 5,000 Americans have been wounded in Iraq, many of them \nsuffering horrific injuries. One such American is SP Gabe Garriga, one \nof my constituents. Specialist Garriga volunteered for the Illinois \nNational Guard right after September 11, when he was just 17 years old, \nbecause he felt obligated to go and make a difference.\n  In the summer of 2003, his unit was deployed to Iraq. On July 14, \n2003, Specialist Garriga was rushing to help defend a checkpoint in \nBaghdad. The checkpoint had been breached by an Iraqi car that sped \nthrough without stopping, and U.S. soldiers feared that this was yet \nanother suicide bomber. In the rush to defend the checkpoint, Garriga's \nHumvee slammed into another Humvee and he was thrown from his gun \nturret directly into burning fuel canisters.\n  The wounds this young man suffered were absolutely horrendous. He had \nsecond and third degree burns over almost half his body and severe \nabdominal injuries. Doctors gave him a 1 percent chance for survival, \nbut he beat those daunting odds.\n  Specialist Garriga deserves everything this Nation can give him in \nreturn for his service and sacrifice and that includes a Purple Heart.\n  This award was reinstated in 1932, a century and a half after General \nWashington created his Badge of Military Merit. At that time, Army \nregulations defined the conditions for the award as ``a wound which \nnecessitates treatment by a medical officer and which is received in \naction with an enemy.''\n  There is no doubt that Specialist Garriga's wound necessitated \nmedical treatment--27 operations are blunt testimony to that terrible \nfact. And there is no doubt in my mind that Gabe was involved in action \nwith an enemy when he and his comrades were rushing to defend that \nbreached checkpoint in a time of war. Nonetheless, over a year later, \nhe has still not received a Purple Heart.\n  Current Army regulations reiterate the conditions spelled out in 1932 \nand add ``It is not intended that such a strict interpretation of the \nrequirement for the wound or injury to be caused by direct result of \nhostile action be taken that it would preclude the award being made to \ndeserving personnel.''\n  Seeking to prevent a suicide bombing against U.S. troops or officials \nor against innocent Iraqi civilians is the act of a soldier engaged in \nthe fight against terrorism. President Reagan, in fact, explicitly \nexpanded the terms of the award to include those wounded or killed as \nthe result ``of an international terrorist attack.''\n  So, this year, as the anniversary of the creation of this \ncommendation approaches and as we vote to recognize this day, I also \nurge the Army to award Specialist Garriga the Purple Heart as a symbol \nof our recognition of his sacrifice in the war in Iraq. He has earned \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8660-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8660-S8661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION REPORT\n\n   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to call to the attention of my \ncolleagues the release on June 15 of the 2004 Report to Congress of the \nUnited States-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n  The Commission was created by Congress on October 30, 2000, as part \nof the National Defense Authorization Act for 2001. Its principal \nsponsor in the Senate was Senator Byrd. The charter of the Commission \nprovides that it be composed of 12 Commissioners, 3 of whom are \nappointed by each of the Congressional leaders in both the House and \nSenate. The Commission is thus bipartisan, and reflective of the \nleadership of both the House and the Senate.\n   The purpose of the Commission, according to its charter, is to \n``monitor, investigate and report to Congress on the national security \nimplications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between \nthe United States and the People's Republic of China.'' The Commission \nis required by its charter to submit an annual report to Congress, \nwhich must include a full analysis, along with conclusions and \nrecommendations for legislative actions, if any, of the national \nsecurity implications for the United States of trade and current \naccount balances, financial transactions, and technology transfers with \nthe People's Republic of China.\n  In preparation for its 2004 annual report, the Commission held 11 \npublic hearings, including field hearings in Columbia, SC, and San \nDiego, CA. Through these hearings the Commission heard the perspectives \nof members of Congress, current and former senior government officials, \nrepresentatives of industry, labor and finance, academics, journalists, \nand citizens. The Commission took testimony from more than 130 \nwitnesses.\n  The Commission's fact-finding and examination process also included \nfunding statistical analyses of China's role in world trade and \ninvestment, and its compliance record with its WTO commitments. \nMoreover the Commission contracted for the translation of articles from \ninfluential publications within China discussing Beijing's economic and \nsecurity strategies and its perceptions of the United States.\n  During the course of its deliberations, the Commission developed a \nbroad bipartisan agreement on the issues it was charged by Congress to\n\n[[Page S8661]]\n\nexamine, and adopted its 2004 report by a unanimous vote.\n  Among the key findings of the report are that in 2003 the United \nStates ran a global goods trade deficit of $545.5 billion, of which \n$124 billion was attributable to U.S. trade with China. The U.S. trade \ndeficit with China constituted over 23 percent of the total U.S. goods \ndeficit. Further, with U.S. exports to China of $28 million and imports \nfrom China of $152 billion, U.S. trade with China constitutes our most \nlopsided trading relationship. The report notes that over the past 10 \nyears, the U.S. trade deficit with China has grown at an average rate \nof 18.5 percent, and if it continues growing at this rate, it will \ndouble to $248 billion within 5 years. The report further notes that \nsince 1998, the United States has moved from a global trade surplus in \nadvanced technology products, ATP, of $29.9 billion to a deficit of $27 \nbillion in 2003, of which $21 billion is attributed to our trade with \nChina.\n  The Commission report unanimously finds that, ``The magnitude of the \ngoods trade deficit threatens the nation's manufacturing sector, a \nsector that is vital for our national and economic security.'' It \nfurther notes that China has a ``coordinated sustainable vision for \nscience and technology development'' and urges our country to develop a \n``comprehensive national policy to meet China's challenge to our \nscientific and technological leadership.''\n   The report finds that China is systematically intervening in the \nforeign exchange market to keep its currency undervalued, and that this \nhas contributed to the size of the U.S. trade deficit with China and \nhas hurt U.S. manufacturers. The report further notes that China has \npolicies in place to attract foreign direct investment ($57 billion in \n2003) and to develop its national productive capacity in ``pillar \nindustries''. These policies include tariffs, limitations on access to \ndomestic marketing channels, requirements for technology transfer, \ngovernment selection of partners for joint ventures, preferential loans \nfrom state banks, privileged access to land, and direct support for \nresearch and development.\n  In order to begin to help correct our trading relationship with \nChina, the Commission urges that the U.S. immediately seek to have the \nyuan revalued substantially upward against the dollar and then to be \npegged against a trade weighted basket of currencies. After such an \nimmediate revaluation, the Commission recommends that China, as it \naddresses problems in its banking system, move to a market-based \ncurrency. It further recommends that Congress should charge USTR and \nthe Commerce Department to undertake a comprehensive examination of \nChina's industrial policies, described in the report, to determine \nwhich may be illegal under provisions of the WTO, and to lay out \nspecific steps the U.S. can take to address these practices through the \nWTO or other means. It urges the U.S. to make more active use of WTO \ndispute settlement if we cannot persuade China by negotiation to carry \nout its WTO commitments.\n\n  The report discusses a number of other aspects of United States-China \ntrade and political relations. It makes a number of recommendations to \nhelp manage the relationship to minimize security risks and to enhance \nprospects of moving China toward a more open, democratic and law-based \nsociety to the benefit of both countries.\n  In my view, this 2004 report of the Commission makes a very valuable \ncontribution to our policy deliberations on China. I salute Senator \nByrd for his wisdom in calling for the creation of the Commission, and \nthank all the Commissioners for their contribution to our knowledge of \nthe United States-China economic and political relationship. The \nBaltimore Sun ran an editorial which strongly praised the report and \nfound that ``the case for `urgent attention and course corrections' to \nU.S. policies on China is well made.'' I ask that the Baltimore Sun \neditorial be inserted in the Record after my statement.\n  I strongly commend the 2004 report of the United States-China \nEconomic and Security Review Commission to my colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, June 17, 2004]\n\n                          The China Trade-Off\n\n       In the past year, some large foreign investors were for the \n     first time allowed to enter China's domestic stock market to \n     buy shares of Chinese firms. This includes shares of part of \n     Norinco, China North Industries Group--a transnational \n     conglomerate that was founded by the People's Liberation \n     Army, that retains strong military ties, that makes \n     everything from baby shoes to missiles, and that has drawn \n     U.S. sanctions for arming Iran.\n       Given the lack of disclosure in China, foreign investors \n     and technology traders with Norinco and other Chinese firms \n     cannot know if their resources will end up serving China's \n     long-term, well-coordinated strategic plan to compete with \n     American economic, military and political power. That \n     potential danger is the basis for the very strong alarms \n     sounded this week by the U.S-China Economic and Security \n     Review Commission, a bipartisan congressional group \n     monitoring U.S.-China relations.\n       In its wide-ranging annual report, the commission warns \n     that rapidly increasing trade, investment and technology \n     flows between the two nations are far too lopsided in China's \n     favor--eroding U.S. economic strength, abetting China's \n     military build-up and its development as a high-tech \n     manufacturing platform, and potentially threatening U.S. \n     security interests. Worse, the commission found that the U.S. \n     government often is far too blind to these hazards in \n     arguably its most important long-term relationship.\n       The report will be criticized by some for demonizing \n     Beijing just as the West is penetrating Chinese markets and \n     succeeding in dramatically drawing China into the community \n     of nations. But in general, the case for ``urgent attention \n     and course corrections'' to U.S. policies on China is well \n     made.\n       For starters, the commission is urging the United States to \n     use the World Trade Organization to more aggressively press \n     China on its undervalued currency and on state subsidies for \n     export manufacturers, both underlying factors in America's \n     $124 billion trade deficit with China last year. It also \n     recommends comprehensive monitoring of: advanced technology \n     transfers to China via U.S. investments, joint ventures and \n     research and development projects; China's U.S. investments; \n     and bilateral exchange and education programs.\n       The lengthy commission report paints a picture of China \n     leveraging the short-term financial ambitions of diverse U.S. \n     interests to capture money and technology vital to its highly \n     focused, long-term goal of trumping the United States--and of \n     the U.S. government at best adrift in monitoring and managing \n     its side of this imbalanced and critically important \n     relationship. It's a caution worth the highest attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8661-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8661-S8662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONTINUING FAILURE TO ADDRESS H-2B VISA CRISIS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I came to this floor more than 2 months ago \nto decry the Senate's failure to respond to a crisis, caused by Federal \npolicy, that has disrupted the operations of small and large businesses \nthroughout the United States. This crisis has continued unabated since \nthen, but the requests for help from these businesses have continued to \nfall on deaf ears.\n  In March, the Department of Homeland Security announced that for the \nfirst time ever, the annual cap for H-2B visas had been met. These \nvisas are used by a wide range of industries throughout the Nation to \nfill temporary labor needs. In my home State of Vermont, they are used \nprimarily by the tourist industry.\n  The Department of Defense appropriations conference report, before us \ntoday, includes a very narrow solution to this problem, benefiting a \nsingle industry that uses H-2B visas. The conference report exempts \naliens seeking jobs in the ``fish roe'' industry from counting against \nthe H-2B cap. The provision does nothing to help the broad categories \nof employers who use H-2B visas.\n  Across the country, businesses in a wide range of industries have \nbeen scrambling this summer, having been forced to discard business \nplans that relied on the foreign employees who had always before been \navailable to them. For years, these employers had applied in the spring \nfor the employees they needed for the summer, filling positions for \nwhich they were unable to find American workers. The cap had never been \nreached, and they had no reason to believe this year would be \ndifferent. I know that the March announcement came as a shock to many \nemployers in my State, and dozens of them contacted my office to see \nwhat could be done. This setback fell equally hard on employers in \nother States.\n  In response to these requests, I joined with a substantial bipartisan \ncoalition in introducing S. 2252, the Save Summer Act of 2004. Senator \nKennedy is the lead sponsor of the bill, which has 18 cosponsors, \nincluding 8 Republicans.\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\nOur bill would add 40,000 visas for the current fiscal year, providing \nrelief to those summer-oriented businesses that had never even had the \nopportunity to apply for visas. Unfortunately, the Republican \nleadership has refused to move this bipartisan bill. The leadership has \nrefused even to move a bill that Senator Hatch introduced, and which \nwas supported only by Republicans. Instead, a tiny minority of Senators \nhas been given a veto over doing anything to address this problem for \nthe current fiscal year or years to come.\n  The Senate must act in a comprehensive way to solve this problem. I \nurge the majority leader to bring H-2B legislation to the floor as soon \nas possible, so we can assure that the summer of 2005 will not be a \nreplay of the summer of 2004.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8662-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8662-S8663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WASTEWATER TREATMENT WORKS SECURITY ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nWastewater Treatment Works Security Act of 2003.\n  In the wake of September 11, 2001, I believe that it is imperative \nthat the Nation takes every reasonable action we can to prevent \nterrorism, create effective response and recovery mechanisms, and find \nways to minimize any impacts should an event occur.\n  The Congress has a key role in facilitating these actions by \nestablishing authorities for Government agencies, establishing the \nlegal framework in which homeland security improvements will occur, and \nappropriating adequate funding for the homeland security mission. \nProtecting our Nation's critical infrastructure is a major piece of our \nhomeland security strategy.\n  The water sector has been identified as an element in our Nation's \ncritical infrastructure since the issuance of Presidential Decision \nDirective 63 (PDD-63), issued in by President Clinton in May 1998, \nwhich was the first major governmental action focused on reducing the \nvulnerability of our Nation's critical infrastructure.\n  At that time, and in each document outlining homeland security \nresponsibilities since that time, the Environmental Protection Agency, \nEPA, was designated as the lead for water infrastructure protection.\n  The security needs are significant in the water and wastewater \nsectors. There are over 16,000 publicly owned treatment works in the \nUnited States, serving almost 190 million people. These industrial \nfacilities use large quantities of toxic chemicals in their treatment \nand disinfection processes. They are located near population centers \nand other critical infrastructure. A chemical accident would pose a \nserious threat. In addition, collection systems run beneath every city \nand town in America, creating potential corridors for travel or \nopportunities for access.\n  There are also serious public health risks associated with a \ndisruption or service failure at a wastewater treatment plant. \nTreatment works clean wastewater that comes from our toilets, showers, \nand sewers and send it back into our rivers, streams, lakes, and \noceans. Those same bodies of water are our drinking water sources. \nWithout proper treatment, we would see the public health effects of the \nsame type of water-borne disease outbreaks such as cholera that we saw \nin Iraq earlier this year due to the failure of wastewater treatment \nplants.\n  I believe that the Congress should take the risk to wastewater \ntreatment plants seriously. Unfortunately, S. 1039, the Wastewater \nTreatment Works Security and Safety Act, provides security for our \nNation's wastewater infrastructure in name, only.\n  First, this bill is a rollback of current law requiring vulnerability \nassessments and emergency response plans at drinking water utilities. \nIn 2002, the Congress passed H.R. 3448, the Public Health and \nBioterrorism Preparedness Response Act of 2002, P.L. 107-188. This act \nrequires community water systems to conduct vulnerability assessments \nand develop an emergency response plan that incorporates the results of \nthe vulnerability assessment. Vulnerability assessments are to be \nsubmitted to EPA. The threats posed by drinking water and wastewater \nfacilities are similar. These plants are often colocated. It makes no \nsense to adopt weaker standards for one sector of the industry than the \nother. The Bioterrorism Act ensures that water systems take basic \naction to first identify and then address security needs.\n  Second, S. 1039 increases wastewater security in name only. It does \nnot require the most basic security precautions--completion of a \nvulnerability assessment and the incorporation of the results into a \ntreatment works' emergency response plan. Under the provisions of S. \n1039, we do not know if individual publicly owned treatment works will \nchoose to complete a vulnerability assessment because there is no \nrequirement to do so. We do not know if they will incorporate their \nfindings into emergency response plans that are designed to protect \ncommunities surrounding those plants because there is no requirement to \ndo so. These most basic actions are not too heavy a burden for the \nwastewater treatment industry to bear.\n  S. 1039 also does not require, and may actually preclude, the \nsubmission of vulnerability assessments that are completed to the \nFederal Government--a serious obstacle in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's ability to perform its mission. Providing the results of a \nfacility's vulnerability assessment and its emergency response plan to \nthe Federal Government is a vital step both to ensure that \nvulnerability assessments are completed in critical infrastructure \nsectors and to ensure that the Federal Government has all of the \ninformation it requires to secure the Nation against a potential \nterrorist attack.\n  The President's National Strategy for Homeland Security, issued in \n2002, states, ``A complete and thorough assessment of America's \nvulnerabilities will not only enable decisive near-term action, but \nguide the rational long-term investment of effort and resources.'' Not \nonly does DHS plan to use vulnerability assessments to evaluate threat \ninformation and provide warnings, but also to allocate resources. I \nagree that one of the most efficient ways to spend limited resources is \nto dentify where we are vulnerable and where we are threatened, then \ntarget resources to the cross-section of those two areas.\n  Under S. 1039 as reported, it is unclear where DHS will get the \ninformation they require to complete a national vulnerability \nassessment and make resource allocation decisions that will increase \nthe level of security in our Nation. What is clear is that DHS is \nlikely to receive only partial information, if any, from a subset of \nwastewater plants that voluntarily choose to complete a vulnerability \nassessment and that voluntarily choose to share the information they \ncollect. Without the best, most up to date, accurate information \navailable, DHS will be unable to fully perform its mission.\n  In addition, elected officials in Congress have a constitutional \noversight role over Federal agencies and the laws they implement. Under \nS. 1039, Congress will not be accountable to the public for the purpose \nor implementation of this law--Congress will not be able to request or \naccess information from the Federal agencies because the agencies will \nnot have such information.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, I introduced the Wastewater \nTreatment Works Security and Safety Act, S. 779. This legislation \nmirrors existing law for drinking water systems. It requires all \nwastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and to \ndevelop or modify emergency response plans to incorporate the results \nof the vulnerability assessments. It requires that these documents be \npresented to the EPA for review, and it includes significant security \nmeasures designed to protect this information from unauthorized \ndisclosure. It authorizes $185 million for assistance in completing \nvulnerability assessments, for immediate security improvements, and for \nassistance to small treatment works. It authorizes $15 million for \nresearch to identify threats, detection methods, and response actions. \nThis bill will clearly enhance the security of our Nation by taking \nreal actions to improve the security of wastewater treatment works.\n  The Federal Government has a responsibility to protect the American \npeople. If S. 1039 becomes law, the Federal Government will not know if \npublicly owned treatment works will voluntarily conduct a vulnerability \nassessment, if they will voluntarily implement the security needs \nidentified,\n\n[[Page S8663]]\n\nor if they will incorporate the results into their emergency response \nplans, and there will be no way of finding out. The Department of \nHomeland Security's mission to increase the security of the country \nwill be hindered. I believe that S. 1039 fails to take responsible, \nbasic steps to protect our wastewater infrastructure security from \nterrorist attack, putting Americans at risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation and support my \nalternative bill, S. 779.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8663-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8663-S8664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MODIFIED VERSION OF S. 849\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a modified version \nof S. 849, the Northern Arizona National Forest Land Exchange Act, \nwhich I cosponsored last year with Senator Kyl. Since introducing that \nbill, I have met with hundreds of Arizonans and learned first-hand of \nthe significant water issues raised by this proposed exchange of about \n50,000 acres of private and Federal land in Northern Arizona. I am \nintroducing this modified version of the legislation with the sincere \nhope of achieving a compromise agreement that can be enacted prior to \nadjournment.\n  Let me be clear. I am not offering amendments to this bill to slow \nits progress, but rather I want to take this opportunity to address one \nof the most crucial challenges facing Arizona: sound management of its \nprecious water resources. The persistent drought that is draining our \nreservoirs makes all of us aware of the limits of our water supplies. I \nstrongly believe that the State of Arizona is at a crucial point where \ndecisions regarding growth and water use must be made with the \nassurance of long-term availability of water supplies without draining \nour ground and surface waters dry. I am afraid we are currently on a \ncollision course with the reality of our finite and dwindling water \nsupplies and the future economic and environmental welfare of the \nState.\n  In the context of this proposed exchange, it would be irresponsible \nof the Federal Government to transfer public lands into private hands \nin an area where water problems currently exist without an \nunderstanding of the potential water supply impacts. I have spent \nconsiderable time and effort in trying to develop a reasoned, \ncompromise proposal that balances the various Arizona interests and \nachieves a fair and equitable exchange in the public interest. \nTherefore, it is my hope that the release of this amended bill with a \nnew title addressing the associated water issues will be carefully \nconsidered by all interested parties.\n  My objective is to encourage the formation of a partnership between \nFederal, State, and local stakeholders in order to facilitate sound, \nscience-based water resource planning and management in the Verde River \nBasin. In my view, the development of such a collaborative decision-\nmaking body, modeled on the Upper San Pedro Partnership, would be a \nvital step in assuring the wise use of the finite water resources \nwithin the Verde River Basin.\n  An earlier draft proposal of the partnership title to this bill was \nwidely circulated in Northern Arizona and generated productive \ndiscussion and comment. This valuable input is reflected in the measure \nI am offering today. It encourages the creation of a multi-stakeholder \npartnership and clarifies the Federal role in providing scientific, \ntechnical, and financial assistance to State and local water resource \nplanning and management efforts. With this important support, I expect \nthat State and local interests that share ground and surface water \nresources will come together to advance protection and wise use of \nfinite water supplies.\n  I became fully aware of the crucial need for this Federal assistance \nthrough public meetings I held last December in Flagstaff and Camp \nVerde. More than 600 people gathered in Camp Verde to express their \nstrongly held views of the proposed land exchange. The primary concern \nvoiced was whether or not adequate water supplies are available in the \narea to provide for future development given that residents are already \nexperiencing water supply problems. The U.S. Geological Survey \npresented information about its ongoing studies and what is not known \nabout the hydrologic systems or water use impacts within the Verde \nBasin. The fact is that we simply do not have sufficient information to \ndetermine the quantity of water supply available over the long-term \nwithout adverse effects.\n\n  I believe that it would be irresponsible of the Federal Government to \ntransfer lands into private hands in an area where water problems \nalready exist without an understanding of the potential impacts. That \nis why I am interested in expediting essential water studies in the \nVerde Basin to provide a scientific basis for sound decisionmaking by \nthe partnership. In the short-term, I envision that the first task of \nthe partnership would be to make a recommendation, based on a water \nbudget analysis for the Verde Valley, regarding available water supply \nfor future use on the Federal parcel in Camp Verde. Long-term water \nresource planning and management efforts within the region could also \nbe developed through the partnership and informed by the ongoing water \nstudies and analyses.\n  I would like to briefly explain some of the provisions in this \nmodified bill.\n  First, under Title I of the bill, it would allow the cities of \nFlagstaff, Williams, and Camp Verde, as well as several local camps, \nthe option to purchase lands directly from the Forest Service if they \nare unable to reach an agreement to purchase such lands from the \nYavapai Ranch. These communities and camps are very interested in \nexploring the economic opportunities that would be afforded through the \nacquisition of certain lands currently held by the Federal Government. \nThe bill also would eliminate the 820-acre Federal parcel in Clarkdale \nfrom exchange, at the request of that community.\n  Next, the bill establishes a new Title II, which is designed to \nestablish a framework to begin addressing the very serious water \nresource and management issues in Northern Arizona. The purpose of this \ntitle is to authorize assistance for a collaborative and science-based \nwater resource planning and management partnership for the Verde River \nBasin, consisting of members that represent Federal, State, and local \nagencies, along with economic, environmental, and community water \ninterests. The bill language makes it clear that this is not a Federal \nintrusion into State and local jurisdiction and responsibility for \nwater management and control.\n  Under Title II, Federal assistance would be authorized upon the \nformation of a Verde River Basin Partnership. The measure would \nauthorize the Secretary of Agriculture to assist the Arizona Department \nof Water Resources and the Yavapai Water Advisory Council by \nparticipating in the formation of the partnership. While the \npartnership would not be a Federal entity, it would be eligible for \nFederal assistance through the Secretary of Agriculture and the \nSecretary of the Interior.\n  The amended bill directs the partnership to develop a plan for \nconducting water resource studies within the Verde River Basin. The \nplan would include; a list of specific studies and analyses that are \nneeded to support the planning and management objectives of the \npartnership, identify any ongoing or completed water resource or \nriparian studies that are relevant to water resource planning and \nmanagement for the Verde River Basin, provide study timeliness and cost \nestimates, and designate as a study priority the compilation of a water \nbudget analysis for the Verde Valley.\n\n  To assist the partnership, the bill directs the U.S. Geological \nSurvey, in cooperation with ADWR, to prepare and submit a report to the \nPartnership that provides a water budget analysis of the portion of the \nVerde River Basin within the Verde Valley. The partnership would then \nuse the information, along with any other relevant information, and \nsubmit a preliminary report with its findings and recommendations \nregarding long-term available water supply within the Verde Valley to \nthe Secretary, the Governor of Arizona, and representatives of the \nVerde Valley communities. Following this preliminary report, the \npartnership is expected to continue its work and submit a comprehensive \nreport to the Secretary and the Governor of Arizona within 4 years. The \ncomprehensive report would include the results of any water resource \nassessments conducted\n\n[[Page S8664]]\n\nunder this in the Verde River Basin. It also would identify: any areas \nin the Verde River Basin that are determined to have groundwater \ndeficits or other current or potential water supply problems; long-term \nwater supply management options for communities and water resources \nwithin the basin; and water resource analyses and monitoring needed to \nsupport the implementation of management options.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Secretary of Interior and the Secretary \nof Agriculture to enter into a memorandum of understanding authorizing \nthe U.S. Geological Survey to access Forest Service land, including \nstream gauges, weather stations, wells, or other points of data \ncollection on the Forest Service land, to carry out necessary water \nstudies.\n  I want to do my part in moving the proposed land exchange forward, \nand it must be done in a manner that is fair to the current residents \nof Arizona and the Federal taxpayers. In order to do so, it simply must \naddress the affected area's water supply. I remain hopeful that all the \ninterested parties who strongly support the proposed exchange will \ncarefully consider the proposal that I am introducing today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8664-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8664-S8670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with Senator \nHatch the Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, \nFiscal Years 2005 through 2007. I thank Senator Hatch, the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, for his hard work and support of this \nlegislation.\n  In the 107th Congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives \nproperly authorized spending for the entire Department of Justice, (DOJ \nor the Department,) for the first time since 1979. Congress extended \nthat authorization in 1980 and 1981. Until 2002 Congress had not passed \nnor had the President signed an authorization bill for the Department. \nIn fact, there were a number of years where Congress failed to consider \nany Department authorization bill. This 23-year failure to properly \nreauthorize the Department forced the appropriations committees in both \nhouses to reauthorize and appropriate money.\n  We ceded the authorization power to the appropriators for too long, \nbut in the 107th Congress Senator Hatch and I joined forces with House \nJudiciary Chairman Sensenbrenner and ranking member Conyers to create \nand pass bipartisan legislation that reaffirmed the authorizing \nauthority and responsibility of the House and Senate Judiciary \nCommittees--the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act, Public Law 107-273. A new era of oversight began \nwith that new charter for the Justice Department, with the Senate and \nHouse Judiciary Committees taking active new roles in setting the \npriorities and monitoring the operations of the Department of Justice, \nthe FBI and other law enforcement agencies, and that bill helped our \noversight duties in many ways. And, as we have learned in the past 3 \nyears, the fight against terrorism makes constructive oversight more \nimportant than ever before.\n  Already this Congress, House Judiciary Committee Chairman \nSensenbrenner and ranking member Conyers have authored and shepherded \nthrough the House of Representatives a new Department of Justice \nAppropriations Authorization Act for fiscal years 2004 through 2006, \nH.R. 3036. I commend both Chairman Sensenbrenner and ranking member \nConyers for working in a bipartisan manner to pass that legislation in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  The Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, fiscal \nyears 2005 through 2007 is a comprehensive authorization of the \nDepartment based on H.R. 3036 as passed by the House of Representatives \non March 30, 2004. Our bipartisan legislation authorizes appropriations \nfor the Department for fiscal years 2005 through 2007, provide \npermanent enabling authorities which will allow the Department to \nefficiently carry out its mission, clarify and harmonize existing \nstatutory authority, and repeal obsolete statutory authorities. The \nbill also establishes certain reporting requirements and other \nmechanisms intended to better enable the Congress and the Department to \noversee the operations of the Department. Finally, our bill \nincorporates numerous other pieces of legislation--on such issues as \npreventing and recovering missing children, cigarette trafficking, \nintellectual property, going after terrorists who commit violent acts \nagainst American citizens overseas, among others--currently pending \nbefore Congress that enjoy strong bipartisan support.\n  I will now highlight a number of the provisions that make up this \nauthorization bill.\n  Title I of our bill authorizes appropriations for the Department of \nJustice for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2007. With minor \nexceptions, these authorizations generally reflect the President's \nbudget request.\n  Title II makes numerous improvements and upgrades to the Department's \ngrant programs that assist law enforcement and criminal justice \nagencies; build community capacity to prevent, reduce and control \ncrime; assist victims of crime; and prevent crime.\n  We decided to combine the current Byrne formula grant, Byrne \ndiscretionary grant and Local Law Enforcement Block Grant, LLEBG, \nprograms into one Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant \nProgram with an authorization of $1.075 billion and a list of 35 uses--\na combination of the traditional Byrne and LLEBG grants regulations--\nfor which these grants may be used.\n  I am a longtime supporter of the Edward Byrne Memorial State and \nLocal Law Enforcement Assistance Program and the LLEBG, both of which \nhave been continuously targeted for elimination by the Bush \nadministration. LLEBG, which received $225 million this year, provide \nlocal governments with the means to underwrite projects that reduce \ncrime and improve public safety, and allow communities to craft their \nown responses to local crime and drug problems. The Edward Byrne \nMemorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program, which \nCongress funded at $659,117,000 in FY 2004, makes grants to States to \nimprove the functioning of the criminal justice system, with emphasis \non violent crimes and serious offenders, and to enforce State and local \ndrug laws. As a senator from a rural State that relies on LLEBG and \nByrne grants to combat crime, I have been concerned with the \nPresident's proposals for funding and program eliminations of these \nwell-established grant programs. Our legislation makes it clear that \nthe same authorized funding levels and uses will be available under the \nnew consolidated grant program as under the previous two grant \nprograms.\n  I am pleased that Title II also extends the authorization of \nappropriations for the Regional Information Sharing System, RISS, at \n$100 million for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2007. RISS serves as \nan invaluable tool to Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nagencies by providing much-needed criminal intelligence and \ninvestigative support services. It has built a reputation as one of the \nmost effective and efficient means developed to combat multi-\njurisdictional criminal activity, such as narcotics trafficking and \ngang activity. Without RISS, most law enforcement officers would not \nhave access to newly developed crime-fighting technologies and would be \nhindered in their intelligence-gathering efforts.\n  By providing State and local law enforcement agencies with rapid \naccess to its secure, state-of-the-art, nationwide information sharing \nsystem, RISS gives law enforcement officers the resources they need to \nidentify and apprehend potential terrorists before they strike. With \nthis in mind, I authored Title VII of the USA PATRIOT Act, Public Law \n107-56, to increase information sharing for critical infrastructure \nprotection. The law expanded RISS to facilitate information sharing \namong Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies to investigate \nand prosecute terrorist conspiracies and activities, and increased \nauthorized funding to $100 million.\n  Proper funding provides RISS with the means to maintain six \nregionally-based information sharing centers that allow for information \nand intelligence services to be disseminated nationwide addressing \nmajor, multijurisdictional crimes. In addition, as the September 11 \nterrorist attacks and calls for increased vigilance against future \nattacks demonstrated, RISS requires additional support to intensify \nantiterrorism measures.\n\n[[Page S8665]]\n\n  Each RISS center has up to 1,600 member agencies, the vast majority \nof which are at the municipal and county levels. Over 400 State \nagencies and over 850 Federal agencies, however, are also members. The \nDrug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. \nAttorneys' Offices, Internal Revenue Service, Secret Service, Customs, \nand the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among \nthe Federal agencies that participate in the RISS Program.\n  Unfortunately, the Consolidated Appropriations law for FY 2004 did \nnot provide full funding for RISS, instead including $30 million for \nthe program. For the coming fiscal year, the President has proposed $45 \nmillion. We must ensure that RISS can continue current services, meet \nincreased membership support needs for terrorism investigations and \nprosecutions, increase intelligence analysis capabilities and add staff \nto support the increasing numbers of RISS members.\n  This title also contains a reauthorization of the Crime Free Rural \nStates program that we created in the DOJ Authorization bill in the \nlast Congress. This program authorizes $10 million annually for rural \nStates to address specific crime problems plaguing their areas. In \nVermont, for example, this funding could be used to battle heroin abuse \nand its consequences.\n  This authorization bill contains a number of provisions of great \ninterest to victim service organizations and those who administer \nFederal grants for victim assistance and compensation. In particular, I \nam pleased that we have responded to repeated requests from the field \nto increase the amount that State assistance and compensation programs \nmay retain for administrative purposes. I have been proposing such an \nincrease for many years, without success.\n  Under current law, not more than 5 percent of victim assistance and \ncompensation grants may be used for the administration of the State \nprogram receiving the grant. The House bill effectively decreases this \nalready-low apportionment by combining administrative costs with \ntraining costs--currently 1 percent under guidelines promulgated by the \nOffice for Victims of Crime, OVC. By contrast, we propose raising the \namount that can be used for both worthwhile purposes to 7.5 percent of \nthe grants. While this is still less than 10 percent retention \npermitted, for example, by the Violence Against Women Act, it will help \nStates to accommodate the addition of training purposes in their costs.\n  Our bill will also amend the Victims of Crime Act, VOCA, to clarify \nthe provisions establishing the Antiterrorism Emergency Reserve in \nvarious ways. The original H.R. 3036 permits replenishments of the \nemergency reserve based upon amounts obligated rather than amounts \nactually expended in any given fiscal year. Our bill includes two \nadditional clarifications that I proposed. First, it makes explicit \nthat the emergency reserve may be replenished only once each fiscal \nyear, and may not be continually replenished as amounts are obligated \nor expended. Allowing continual replenishments could result in the \nobligations or expenditures exceeding the $50 million emergency reserve \nmaximum. Second, we have ensured that all emergency reserve funds--\nwhether carried over, used to replenish the reserve, obligated or \nexpended--fall above the cap on spending from the Crime Victim Fund as \nset by appropriations legislation.\n  Section 242 of the House-passed bill authorized the Assistant \nAttorney General for the Office for Justice Programs, OJP, to impose \nspecial conditions and determine priorities for formula grants. It was \nunclear to me why the authority to determine formula grant priorities \nwas necessary and what its real impact would be on local victim \nservices. Could it be read to authorize OJP to infringe on the \ndiscretion of each State to meet its own needs, as for example by \nmandating that State VOCA programs give priority to public agencies \nover nonprofit community organizations, or fund faith-based programs \nbefore secular programs? Priorities are already set out by Congress in \nthe authorizing statutes, as is the requirement that programs \ncoordinate public and private victim services in their communities, and \nthe Justice Department should not be allowed to override those \ncongressional directives. Moreover, VOCA already has extensive \nreporting requirements that enable the Department to monitor how States \nare distributing these funds. We have therefore deleted the authority \nto determine formula grant priorities, while retaining the special \nconditions provision.\n\n  Subtitle D of Title II deals with approaches to prevent crime. I am \nespecially pleased that we included provisions that will specifically \naid in preventing rural crime because rural States and communities face \na number of unique law enforcement challenges. We added these \nprovisions from Senator Daschle's Rural Safety Act, S. 1907, of which I \nam proud to be an original cosponsor. I commend our Democratic leader \nfor his commitment to providing real and meaningful investments to \naddress the unique set of challenges facing rural law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Rural law enforcement officers patrol larger areas, operate under \ntighter budgets and with smaller staffs than their urban and suburban \ncounterparts. This legislation creates programs specifically designed \nto meet the many complex needs of rural law enforcement agencies and \nofficers. Methamphetamine production and use, for example, is a growing \nconcern for Vermonters. Because the ingredients and the equipment used \nto produce methamphetamines are so inexpensive and readily available, \nthe drug can be manufactured or ``cooked'' in homemade labs. This has \nbecome one of the major problems facing law enforcement agencies \nnationwide. Last month, the Vermont State Police busted the first known \nmethamphetamine lab in the state. We must help our law enforcement \nagencies as they struggle to keep up with its troubling growth.\n  To help law enforcement combat the spread of methamphetamine and \nother challenges, we authorize in this bill $20 million in grants for \nFY 2005 to provide for the cleanup of methamphetamine laboratories and \nrelated hazardous waste in units of local government and tribal \ngovernments located outside a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area; \nand the improvement of contract-related response time for cleanup of \nmethamphetamine laboratories and related hazardous waste in units of \nlocal established methamphetamine prevention and treatment pilot \nprograms in rural areas, and provide additional financial support to \nlocal law enforcement.\n  We also establish a rural 9-1-1 service program to provide access to, \nand improve a communications infrastructure that will ensure a reliable \nand seamless communication between, law enforcement, fire, and \nemergency medical service providers in units of local government and \ntribal governments located outside a Standard Metropolitan Statistical \nArea and in States. Grants--authorized at $25 million for fiscal year \n2005--under this program will be used to establish or improve 9-1-1 \nservice in rural communities. Priority in making grants under this \nprogram will be given to communities that do not have 9-1-1 service.\n  I am pleased that our bill includes the Campbell-Leahy-Hatch \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2003, a bill to reauthorize \nan existing matching grant program to help State, tribal, and local \njurisdictions purchase armor vests for use by law enforcement officers. \nThis bill was passed by the Senate by unanimous consent a year ago this \nmonth and it awaits consideration by the House of Representatives.\n  This measure marks the third time that I have had the privilege of \nteaming with my friend and colleague Senator Campbell to work on this \nlegislation. We authored the Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act of \n1998 in response to the tragic Carl Drega shootout in 1997 on the \nVermont-New Hampshire border, in which two State troopers who did not \nhave bulletproof vests were killed. The Federal officers who responded \nto the scenes of the shooting spree were equipped with life-saving body \narmor, but the State and local law enforcement officers lacked \nprotective vests because of the cost.\n  Two years later, we successfully passed the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act of 2000, and I hope we will go 3-for-3 this time \naround. Senator Campbell brings to our effort invaluable experience in \nthis area and during his time in the Senate he has been a leader in the \narea of law enforcement. As a former deputy sheriff,\n\n[[Page S8666]]\n\nhe knows the dangers law enforcement officers face when out on patrol. \nI am pleased that we have been joined in this effort by 12 other Senate \ncosponsors.\n  Our bipartisan legislation will save the lives of law enforcement \nofficers across the country by providing more help to State and local \nlaw enforcement agencies to purchase body armor. Since its inception in \n1999, this highly successful Department of Justice program has provided \nlaw enforcement officers in 16,000 jurisdictions nationwide with nearly \n350,000 new bulletproof vests. In Vermont, 148 municipalities have been \nfortunate to receive to receive funding for the purchase of almost 1200 \nvests. Without the Federal funding given by this program, I daresay \nthat there would be close to that number of police officers without \nvests in Vermont today.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2003 will further the \nsuccess of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program by \nreauthorizing the program through fiscal year 2007. Our legislation \nwould continue the Federal-State partnership by authorizing up to $50 \nmillion per year for matching grants to State and local law enforcement \nagencies and Indian tribes at the Department of Justice to buy body \narmor.\n  We know that body armor saves lives, but the cost has put these vests \nout of the reach of many of the officers who need them. This program \nmakes it more affordable for police departments of all sizes. Few \nthings mean more to me than when I meet Vermont police officers and \nthey tell me that the protective vests they wear were made possible \nbecause of this program. This is the least we should do for the \nofficers on the front lines who put themselves in danger for us every \nday. I want to make sure that every police officer who needs a \nbulletproof vest gets one.\n  We also included in this authorization bill the Prevent All Cigarette \nTrafficking, PACT, Act, as passed by the Senate by unanimous consent on \nDecember 9, 2003, but which has yet to be taken up and passed by the \nHouse. I commend Senators Hatch and Kohl for their leadership on this \nmeasure and thank them for working with me, among others, to craft the \ncompromise language that we include in this bill to crack down on the \ngrowing problem of cigarette smuggling, both interstate and \ninternational, as well as to address the connection between cigarette \nsmuggling activities and terrorist funding. I am proud to join Senator \nHatch, Senator Kohl and 10 others as a cosponsor of the standalone \nbill.\n  I also thank the National Association of Attorneys General and the \nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids for working with us and contributing to \nthis language. I want to say a special thanks to Vermont Attorney \nGeneral Bill Sorrell, who also serves as the current Chair of the NAAG \nTobacco Committee, for his valuable input on the problems with \ncigarette smuggling that States are facing and his support for this \ncompromise measure. I also want to thank the Vermont Grocers \nAssociation, the Vermont Retail Association, the Vermont Association of \nChiefs of Police, and the National Conference of State Legislatures for \ntheir support for this measure.\n  The movement of cigarettes from low-tax areas to high-tax areas in \norder to avoid the payment of taxes when the cigarettes are resold has \nbecome a public health problem in recent years. As State after State \nchooses to raise its tobacco excise taxes as a means of reducing \ntobacco use and as a source of revenue, many smokers have sought \ncheaper means by which to purchase cigarettes. Smokers can often \npurchase cigarettes and tobacco from remote sellers, Internet or mail \norder at substantial discounts due to avoidance of state taxes. These \nsellers, however, are evading their tax obligations because they \nneither collect nor pay the proper State and local excise taxes for \ncigarette and other tobacco product sales.\n  We have the ability to dramatically reduce smuggling without imposing \nundue burdens on manufacturers or law abiding citizens. By reducing \nsmuggling, we will also increase government revenues by minimizing tax \navoidance. My friend General Sorrell has told me that this has become a \nrapidly growing problem in Vermont as more and more tobacco product \nmanufacturers fail to collect and pay cigarette taxes. Criminals are \ngetting away with smuggling and not paying tobacco taxes because of \nweak punishments, products that are often poorly labeled, the lack of \ntax stamps and the inability of the current distribution system to \ntrack sales from State to State. These lapses point to a need for \nuniform rules governing group sales to individuals.\n\n  The PACT Act will give States the authority to collect millions of \ndollars in lost State tax revenue resulting from online and other \nremote sales of cigarette and smokeless tobacco. It also ensures that \nevery tobacco retailer, whether a brick-and-mortar or remote retailer \nof tobacco products, play by the same rules by equalizing the tax \nburdens.\n  Moreover, the PACT Act gives States the authority necessary to \nenforce the Jenkins Act, a law passed in 1949, which requires cigarette \nvendors to report interstate sales of cigarettes. This legislation \nenhances States' abilities to collect all excise taxes and verify the \ndeposit of all required escrow payments for cigarette and smokeless \ntobacco sales in interstate commerce, including internet sales. In \naddition, it provides Federal and State law enforcement with additional \nresources to enforce state tobacco excise tax laws.\n  Finally, at the request of the National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral and many State Attorneys General, we have added a new section \nto provide the States with authority to enforce the Imported Cigarette \nCompliance Act to crack down on international tobacco smuggling. This \nadditional authority should further reduce tax evasion and eliminate a \nlucrative funding source for terrorist organizations.\n  We must not turn a blind eye to the problem of illegal tobacco \nsmuggling. Those who smuggle cigarettes are criminals and we must close \nthe loopholes that allow cigarette smuggling to continue.\n  The United States has from its inception recognized the importance of \nintellectual property laws in fostering innovation, and vested in \nCongress the responsibility of crafting laws that ensure that those who \nproduce inventions are able to reap economic rewards for their efforts. \nI am pleased that we can today include, as part of the Department of \nJustice Authorization Act, the Cooperative Research and Technology \nEnhancement Act of 2004, the CREATE Act, legislation that I cosponsored \nalong with Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl, Senator Feingold, Senator \nSchumer, Senator Grassley, Senator Johnson, and Senator Cochran. This \nbill will provide a needed remedy to one aspect of our Nation's patent \nlaws. On June 25, 2004, the CREATE Act passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent.\n  When Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980, the law encouraged \nprivate entities and not-for-profits such as universities to form \ncollaborative partnerships in order to spur innovation. Prior to the \nenactment of this law, universities were issued fewer than 250 patents \neach year. That this number has in recent years surpassed two thousand \nis owed in large measure to the Bayh-Dole Act. The innovation this law \nencouraged has contributed billions of dollars annually to the United \nStates economy and has produced hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  However, one component of the Bayh-Dole Act, when read literally, \nruns contrary to the intent of that legislation. In 1999, the United \nStates Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit ruled, in Oddzon \nProducts, Inc. v. Just Toys, Inc., that non-public information may in \ncertain cases be considered ``prior art''--a standard which generally \nprevents an inventor from obtaining a patent. Thus some collaborative \nteams that the Bayh-Dole Act was intended to encourage have been unable \nto obtain patents for their efforts. The result is a disincentive to \nform this type of partnership, which could have a negative impact on \nthe U.S. economy and hamper the development of new creations.\n  However, the Federal circuit in its ruling invited Congress to better \nconform the language of the Bayh-Dole Act to the intent of the \nlegislation. The CREATE Act does exactly that by ensuring that \nnonpublic information is not considered prior art when the information \nis used in a collaborative partnership under the Bayh-Dole Act. The \nbill also includes strict evidentiary burdens to ensure that the\n\n[[Page S8667]]\n\nlegislation is tailored narrowly in order to solely fulfill the intent \nof the Bayh-Dole Act.\n  I am pleased that the PIRATE Act, which I cosponsored with Senator \nHatch, will be included as part of this bipartisan bill. Like the \noverall bill, the PIRATE Act is a consensus bill that will give the \nJustice Department new and needed tools--in this case, these tools are \nspecific to the fight against piracy. This bill was unanimously passed \nby the Senate on June 25, 2004. By including this measure in the \nDepartment of Justice Authorization Bill, we hope to muster more forces \nto combat the growing problem of digital piracy.\n  For too long, Federal prosecutors have been hindered in their pursuit \nof pirates, by the fact that they were limited to bringing criminal \ncharges with high burdens of proof. In the world of copyright, a \ncriminal charge is unusually difficult to prove because the defendant \nmust have known that his conduct was illegal and he must have willfully \nengaged in the conduct anyway. For this reason prosecutors can rarely \njustify bringing criminal charges, and copyright owners have been left \nalone to fend for themselves, defending their rights only where they \ncan afford to do so. In a world in which a computer and an Internet \nconnection are all the tools you need to engage in massive piracy, this \nis an intolerable predicament.\n  The PIRATE Act will give the Attorney General civil enforcement \nauthority for copyright infringement. It also calls on the Justice \nDepartment to initiate training and pilot programs to ensure that \nFederal prosecutors across the country are aware of the many difficult \ntechnical and strategic problems posed by enforcing copyright law in \nthe digital age.\n  This new authority does not supplant either the criminal provisions \nof the Copyright Act, or the remedies available to the copyright owner \nin a private suit. Rather, it allows the Government to bring its \nresources to bear on this immense problem and to ensure that more \ncreative works are made available online, that those works are more \naffordable, and that the people who work to bring them to us are paid \nfor their efforts.\n  I am pleased that the Koby Mandell Act of 2003 was included in this \nlegislation. I am a proud cosponsor of the stand-alone bill. The act \nwould establish an office within the Department of Justice with a \nmandate to ensure equal treatment of all victims of terrorist acts \ncommitted overseas. Its primary role would be to guarantee that \nvigorous efforts are made to pursue, prosecute, and punish each and \nevery terrorist who harms Americans overseas, no matter where attacks \noccur. It would also take steps to inform victims of important \ndevelopments in international cases, such as status reports on efforts \nto capture terrorists and monitoring the incarceration of those \nterrorists who are imprisoned overseas. This is important legislation \nthat would send a strong message of resolve that we are committed to \nfinding and punishing every terrorist who harms Americans overseas.\n  I am pleased that we have included part of S. 1286, the Seniors \nSafety Act, which I introduced last year. This bill would create an \nenhanced sentencing penalty for those who commit crimes against the \nelderly, create new civil and criminal penalties for pension fraud, and \ncreate a centralized service to log complaints of telemarketing fraud.\n  We would also provide the Attorney General with a new and substantial \ntool to prevent telemarketing fraud--the power to block or terminate \nservice to telephone facilities that are being used to defraud innocent \npeople. The Justice Department could use this authority to disrupt \ntelemarketing fraud schemes directed from foreign sources by cutting \noff the swindlers' telephone service. Even if the criminals acquire a \nnew telephone number, temporary interruptions will prevent some seniors \nfrom being victimized.\n  We have agreed to incorporate the Federal Prosecutors' Retirement \nBenefit Equity Act of 2004, which was originally introduced as a stand-\nalone bill with my good friends Senator Hatch, Senator Mikulski and \nSenator Durbin. This bill would correct an inequity that exists under \ncurrent law, whereby Federal prosecutors receive substantially less \nfavorable retirement benefits than other nearly all other people \ninvolved in the Federal criminal justice system. The bill would \nincrease the retirement benefits given to Assistant United States \nAttorneys by including them as ``law enforcement officers,'' LEOs, \nunder the Federal Employees' Retirement System and the Civil Service \nRetirement System. The bill would also allow the Attorney General to \ndesignate other attorneys employed by the Department of Justice who act \nprimarily as criminal prosecutors as LEOs for purposes of receiving \nthese retirement benefits.\n\n  The primary reason for granting enhanced retirement benefits to LEOs \nis the often dangerous work of law enforcement. Currently, Assistant \nUnited States Attorneys, AUSAs, and other Federal prosecutors are not \neligible for these enhanced benefits, which are enjoyed by the vast \nmajority of other employees in the criminal justice system. This \nexclusion is unjustified. The relevant provisions of the United States \nCode dealing with retirement benefits define an LEO as an employee \nwhose duties are, ``primarily the investigation, apprehension, or \ndetention'' of individuals suspected or convicted of violating Federal \nlaw. See 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  8331(20) & 8401(17). AUSAs and other \nFederal prosecutors participate in planning investigations, \ninterviewing witnesses both inside and outside of the office setting, \ndebriefing defendants, obtaining warrants, negotiating plea agreements \nand representing the government at trials and sentencings, all of which \nfall within the definition of the duties performed by law enforcement \nofficers. Indeed, once a defendant is brought into the criminal justice \nsystem, the person with whom they have the most face-to-face contact, \nand often in an extremely confrontational environment, is the Federal \nprosecutor.\n  Although prosecutors do not personally execute arrests, searches and \nother physically dangerous activities, LEO status is accorded to many \ncriminal justice employees who do not perform such tasks, such as \npretrial services officers and probation officers and accountants, \ncooks and secretaries of the Bureau of Prisons. Moreover, because they \nare often the most conspicuous representatives of the government in the \ncriminal justice system, Federal prosecutors are natural targets for \nthreats of reprisals by vengeful criminals. Indeed, there are numerous \nincidents in which assaults and serious death threats have been made \nagainst Federal prosecutors, sometimes resulting in significant \ndisruption of their personal and family lives.\n  I am pleased that S. 710, the Leahy-Hatch Anti-Atrocity Alien \nDeportation Act, was included in this legislation. This measure would \nexpand the grounds for removing alien human rights violators from the \nUnited States, or for denying them entry in the first place. We have \nheard many accounts of abusers who have taken advantage of America's \nfreedoms after committing horrifying violations of their fellow \ncitizens in their native lands. We need to stop that from happening \nagain.\n  This bill passed the Judiciary Committee last November but has been \nsubject to an anonymous hold on the floor. A similar version of it \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent in the 106th Congress. It is \nlong past time to make it law.\n  I would note that on May 12, a Rwandan man wanted on international \ncharges of genocide and crimes against humanity was arrested at his \nsuburban Chicago home by agents from the Bureau of Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, ICE. Before I and others began to raise the issue \nof the war criminals among us, it was my impression that the former INS \npaid little attention to rooting out these thugs. I am pleased that the \nissue has taken on greater importance at ICE and urge the Senate to \npass this bill so that we can expand the grounds of inadmissibility and \nremovability for human rights violators.\n  I am pleased that the DREAM Act has been included in this bill. I am \na cosponsor of the bill, which Senators Hatch and Durbin introduced \nlast year and was passed last fall by the Judiciary Committee. It would \nbenefit undocumented alien children who were brought to the United \nStates by their parents as young children, by restoring States' ability \nto offer them in-State\n\n[[Page S8668]]\n\ntuition and offering them a path to legal residency. It has been \ndistressing that a bill with committee approval and 48 sponsors has \nbeen unable to get a vote on the floor of the Senate, and I hope that \nincluding the DREAM Act in this legislation will give it added \nmomentum.\n  I am proud that we include Schumer-Specter legislation to honor the \nsacrifice of the September 11, 2001 terrorist victims by creating \ncongressional medals that would be awarded to their families and loved \nones by the President. I am proud to have joined my friends as a \ncosponsor of this legislation, as have 18 other Senators.\n  The tragedy of September 11, 2001 demanded unprecedented sacrifices \nof everyday American civilians and rescue workers 3,000 of whom lost \ntheir lives in the attacks. In recognition of their heroic actions on \nthat day, the bipartisan Fallen Heroes of 9/11 Act would create a medal \nto be awarded posthumously to the victims of the September 11 terrorist \nattacks. The medal would be designed by the Department of Treasury and \nawarded to representatives of the deceased by the President. The \nproduction of the medals would be paid for by the sale of duplicate \nmedals to the public. Those of us who lost loved ones almost 3 years \nago can never have them back, but a medal of honor could recognizes the \nsacrifices and heroic efforts of our fallen citizens.\n  I am pleased that our Department of Justice authorization bill \nincludes legislation that Senator Hatch and I introduced together to \nreauthorize and expand the Department of Justice grant program for Boys \n& Girls Clubs. The original version of this legislation, S. 2363, \ncurrently enjoys 44 cosponsors and passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent last month. It was considered and reported out of the House \nJudiciary Committee by voice vote earlier this month but still awaits \nfloor consideration.\n  Children are the future of our country, and we have a responsibility \nto make sure they are safe and secure. I know firsthand how well Boys & \nGirls Clubs work and what topnotch organizations they are. When I was a \nprosecutor in Vermont, I was convinced of the great need for Boys & \nGirls Clubs because we rarely encountered children from these kinds of \nprograms. In fact, after I became a U.S. Senator, a police chief was \nsuch a big fan that he asked me to help fund a Boys & Girls Club in his \ndistrict rather than helping him get a couple more police officers.\n  In Vermont, Boys & Girls Clubs have succeeded in preventing crime and \nsupporting our children. The first club was established in Burlington \n62 years ago. Now we have 22 club sites operating throughout the State: \nseven clubs in Brattleboro, one in Springfield, two clubs in \nBurlington, one in Winooski, two clubs in Montpelier, five clubs in \nRandolph, one club in Rutland, two clubs in Vergennes and one in \nBristol. There are 10 additional project sites that will be on board \nand serving kids by the end of 2005: one in Bennington, two in \nBurlington, one in Duxbury, one in St. Johnsbury, one in Hardwick, \nthree in Randolph and one in Ludlow. These clubs will serve well over \n10,000 kids statewide.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have \npushed for more Federal funding for Boys & Girls Clubs. Since 1998, \nCongress has increased Federal support for Boys & Girls Clubs from $20 \nmillion to $80 million in this year. Due in large part to this increase \nin funding, there now exist 3,300 Boys & Girls Clubs in all 50 States \nserving more than 3.6 million young people. Because of these successes, \nI was both surprised and disappointed to see that the President \nrequested a reduction of $20 million for FY 2005. That request will \nleave thousands of children and their Clubs behind and we cannot allow \nsuch a thing to happen.\n  In the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act, which Senator Hatch and I worked together to pass in \nthe 107th Congress, we included a provision to reauthorize Justice \nDepartment grants to establish new Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide. By \nauthorizing $80 million in DOJ grants for each of the fiscal years \nthrough 2005, we sought to establish 1,200 additional Boys & Girls \nClubs nationwide. This was to bring the number of Boys & Girls Clubs to \n4,000, serving no less than 5 million young people. The bill we \nintroduce today will build upon this: We authorize Justice Department \ngrants at $80 million for fiscal year 2006, $85 million for fiscal year \n2007, $90 million for fiscal year 2008, $95 million for fiscal year \n2009 and $100 million for fiscal year 2010 to Boys & Girls Clubs to \nhelp establish 1,500 additional Boys & Girls Clubs across the Nation \nwith the goal of having 5,000 Boys & Girls Clubs in operation by \nDecember 31, 2010.\n  If we had a Boys & Girls Club in every community, prosecutors in our \ncountry would have a lot less work to do because of the values that are \nbeing instilled in children from the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. \nEach time I visit a club in Vermont, I am approached by parents, \neducators, teachers, grandparents and law enforcement officers who tell \nme ``Keep doing this! These clubs give our children the chance to grow \nup free of drugs, gangs and crime.''\n  You cannot argue that these are just Democratic or Republican ideas, \nor conservative or liberal ideas. They are simply good sense ideas. We \nneed safe havens where our youth--the future of our country can learn \nand grow up free from the influences of drugs, gangs and crime. That is \nwhy Boys & Girls Clubs are so important to our children.\n  We also incorporated language similar to the Leahy-Grassley-Lincoln \nMissing Child Cold Case Review Act of 2004, S. 2435, which will allow \nan inspector general to authorize his or her staff to provide \nassistance on and conduct reviews of the inactive case files, or ``cold \ncases,'' involving children stored at the National Center for Missing & \nExploited Children, NCMEC, and to develop recommendations for further \ninvestigations. The only alteration we made to the original bill was to \ninclude language to also allow the Inspector General of the Government \nPrinting Office to authorize his or her staff to work on cold cases.\n  Speed is everything in homicide investigations. As a former \nprosecutor in Vermont, I know firsthand that speed is of the essence \nwhen trying to solve a homicide. This focus on speed, however, has led \nthe law enforcement community to generally believe that any case not \nsolved within the first 72 hours or lacking significant leads and \nwitness participation has little likelihood of being solved, regardless \nof the expertise and resources deployed. With time, such unsolved cases \nbecome ``cold,'' and these are among the most difficult and frustrating \ncases detectives face because they are, in effect, cases that other \ninvestigators, for whatever reason, failed to solve.\n  Our Nation's law enforcement agencies, regardless of size, are not \nimmune to rising crime rates, staff shortages and budget restrictions. \nSuch obstacles have strained the investigative and administrative \nresources of all agencies. More crime often means that fewer cases are \nvigorously pursued, fewer opportunities arise for followup and \nindividual caseloads increase for already overworked detectives.\n  All the obstacles that hamper homicide investigations in their early \nphases contribute to cold cases. The National Center for Missing & \nExploited Children our Nation's top resource center for child \nprotection presently retains a backlog of cold cases involving children \nthat law enforcement departments nationwide have stopped investigating \nprimarily due to all these obstacles. NCMEC serves as a clearinghouse \nfor all cold cases in which a child has not been found and/or the \nsuspect has not been identified.\n  This provision will allow an inspector general to provide staff \nsupport to NCMEC for the purpose of conducting reviews of inactive case \nfiles to develop recommendations for further investigation and similar \nactivities. The inspector general community has one of the most diverse \nand talented criminal investigative cadres in the Federal Government. A \nvast majority of these special agents have come from traditional law \nenforcement agencies, and are highly-trained and extremely capable of \ndealing with complex, criminal cases.\n  Under current law, an inspector general's duties are limited to \nactivities related to the programs and operations of an agency. This \nmeasure would allow an inspector general to permit criminal \ninvestigators under his or her supervision to review cold case files, \nso long as doing so would not interfere\n\n[[Page S8669]]\n\nwith normal duties. An inspector general would not conduct actual \ninvestigations, and any inspector general would only commit staff when \nthe office's mission-related workloads permitted. At no time would \nthese activities be allowed to conflict with or delay the stated \nmissions of an inspector general.\n  From time to time a criminal investigator employed by an inspector \ngeneral may be between investigations or otherwise available for brief \nperiods of time. This act would also allow those resources to be \nprovided to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. \nCommitment of resources would be at a minimum and would not materially \naffect the budget of any office.\n  We have before us the type of bipartisan legislation that should be \nmoved easily through the Senate and House. It is supported by the \nDepartment of Justice Office of the Inspector General. I applaud the \nongoing work of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children \nand hope that we can soon provide NCMEC with the resources it requires \nto solve cold cases involving missing children.\n  This authorization bill includes a provision that would help colleges \nand universities in Vermont and across the nation. It would allow \nforeigners who are pursuing ``distance learning'' opportunities at \nAmerican schools to enter the country for up to 30 days to fulfill \nacademic requirements. Under current law, these students do not fall \nunder any visa category, and many are being denied entry and are thus \nunable to complete their educations. This is a loophole that harms both \nthose students and the institutions that serve them.\n  In recent months, serious questions have been raised in the media and \nin several congressional hearings about deficiencies within the \ntranslation program at the FBI. Nearly, 2 years ago I began asking \nquestions in Judiciary Committee hearings about the FBI's translation \nprogram. Most of these remain unanswered. As a result, members of our \ncommittee are no closer to determining the scope of the issue, \nincluding the pervasiveness and seriousness of FBI shortcomings in this \narea, or what the FBI intends to do to rectify personnel shortages, \nsecurity issues, translation inaccuracies and other problems that have \nplagued the translator program for years.\n  Section 205 of the USA PATRIOT Act included an important reporting \nrequirement by the Attorney General to the Senate and House Judiciary \nCommittees about (1) the number of translators employed by the FBI, (2) \nlegal and practical impediments to using translators employed by other \nFederal, State, or local agencies, on a full, part-time, or shared \nbasis, and (3) the needs of the FBI for specific translation services \nin certain languages, and recommendations for meeting those needs. To \ndate, the Attorney General has not made the report required by Section \n205 most likely because there is no date certain written in the law by \nwhich the report must be made. This provision fills that gap by \nrequiring the report ``not later than 30 days after the date of \nenactment and annually thereafter .with respect to the preceding 12 \nmonth period.'' It also expands the reporting requirement to include \ntranslators ``contracted'' by the government in addition to those \n``employed.''\n  I have worked my entire professional life to protect children from \nthose who would prey on them. Preventing child exploitation through the \nuse of the Internet is one concrete and important way to help this \nimportant cause. In this regard, under the Protection of Children from \nSexual Predators Act of 1998, Public Law No. 105-314, remote computing \nand electronic communication service providers are mandated to report \nall instances of child pornography to the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children. I respect and applaud the work of NCMEC and its \ntireless efforts in this important national priority.\n  In March 1998, Congress mandated that NCMEC initiate the CyberTipline \nfor citizens to report online sexual crimes against children. In \nDecember 1999, Congress passed Public Law No. 106-113 to modify 42 \nU.S.C. Sec. 13032(b)(1) to set forth a ``duty to report'' by ISPs. \nAccording to NCMEC, many U.S. electronic communications service \nproviders are not complying with the requirement that they register and \nuse the CyberTipline to report child porn found on their services \nbecause supporting regulations required to be promulgated by the \nDepartment of Justice on matters such as the contents of the report \nwere never done so.\n  In this authorization bill we propose language that amends the ``duty \nto report'' language by providing specific guidance on what information \nis required to be included in the ISP reports. The information required \nincludes the content and images of the apparent violation, the Internet \nProtocol Address, the date and time associated with the violation, and \nspecific contact information for the sender.\n  America's film heritage is an important part of the American \nexperience, an inheritance from previous generations that helps tell us \nwho we are and who we were as a society. They offer insight into our \nhistory, our dreams, and our aspirations. Yet sadly, this part of \nAmerican heritage is literally disintegrating faster than can be saved. \nToday, I am delighted that with the help of Senator Hatch, the National \nFilm Preservation Act can be included in our Department of Justice \nreauthorization bill.\n  I introduced the National Film Preservation Act last November, a bill \nthat will reauthorize and extend the National Film Preservation Act of \n1996. We first acted in 1988 in order to recognize the educational, \ncultural, and historical importance of our film heritage, and its \ninherently fragile nature. In doing so, Congress created the National \nFilm Preservation Board and the National Film Preservation Foundation \nboth of which operate under the auspices of the Library of Congress in \norder to help save America's film heritage.\n  The National Film Preservation Act will allow the Library of Congress \nto continue its important work in preserving America's fading \ntreasures, as well as providing grants that will help libraries, \nmuseums, and archives preserve films and make those works available for \nstudy and research. These continued efforts are more critical today \nthan ever before. While a wide range of works have been saved, with \nevery passing day we lose the opportunity to save more. Fewer than 20 \npercent of the features of the 1920s exist in complete form and less \nthan 10 percent of the features of the 1910s have survived into the new \nmillennium.\n  The films saved by the National Film Preservation Board are precisely \nthose types of works that would be unlikely to survive without public \nsupport. At-risk documentaries, silent-era films, avant-garde works, \nethnic films, newsreels, and home movies frequently provide more \ninsight into the American experience than the Hollywood sound features \nkept and preserved by major studios. What is more, in many cases only \none copy of these ``orphaned'' works exists. As the Librarian of \nCongress, Dr. James H. Billington, has noted, ``Our film heritage is \nAmerica's living past.''\n  I would like to thank Senator Hatch again for working with me to \ninclude the ``National Film Preservation Act'' in the bill we are \nintroducing today.\n  The House-passed bill included an important reporting requirement \nauthored by Rep. Adam Schiff and adopted by the House Judiciary \nCommittee. Specifically, this provision required the Department of \nJustice to submit an annual report to Congress specifying the number of \nU.S. persons or residents detained on suspicion of terrorism, and \ndescribing Department standards for recommending or determining that a \nperson should be tried as a criminal defendant or designated as an \nenemy combatant. A Washington Post editorial dated April 3, 2004, \npraised this provision, while noting that ``If more members of the \nHouse took their duty to legislate in this critical area seriously, \nCongress would craft a bill that actually imposed standards rather than \nsimply inquired what they were.'' I agree, and regret that was unable \nto persuade Chairman Hatch to retain this modest oversight tool.\n  I am disappointed that we will not be including the privacy officer \nprovision referred to us by the House. It is critical that the \nDepartment have a designated leader who is consistently mindful of the \nimpact of the Department's activities on privacy rights. While there \nhas been some history of a\n\n[[Page S8670]]\n\nprivacy official at the Department, these positions have been \nnonstatutory, and thus there has been no guarantee of consistent vigor \nand accountability on these issues. Given that the Department's mission \nincreasingly involves gathering and assessing personal information, we \nsimply can't afford to have a lapse in accountability on privacy. \nMoreover, this is not an untested idea. Congress created a privacy \nofficer for the Department of Homeland Security, and it has been \nrecognized as a successful example of how this role can be helpful in \nassessing and addressing privacy concerns. We need to follow this lead, \nand the privacy officer provision would have been a good opportunity to \ndo so.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Hatch, Congressman \nSensenbrenner and Congressman Conyers to continue the important \nbusiness of reauthorizing the Department of Justice. Clearly, regular \nreauthorization of the Department should be part and parcel of the \ncommittees' traditional role in overseeing the Department's activities. \nSwift passage into law of the Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act, Fiscal Years 2005 through 2007 will be a significant \nstep toward enhancing our oversight role.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8670-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8670-S8671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to speak \nabout the DREAM Act, an immigration reform bill that the Senate should \nact on as soon as possible.\n  Immigration reform is an urgent priority for our nation. There are \nsome who want to ignore this issue, especially because it is an \nelection year. Immigration reform is too important to set aside for \npolitical reasons.\n  Our immigration system is broken. It harms our national security and \nour economy. It also treats hard-working immigrants, especially \nimmigrant children, unfairly.\n  In recent months, there has been a lot of discussion about President \nBush's immigration proposal. I have some serious concerns about the \nsubstance of the proposal, but the President did a good thing by coming \nforward with it. He reopened the national debate about immigration.\n  Since the President made his proposal in January, nothing has \nhappened. The proposal has not even been introduced as a bill. Clearly, \nCongress will not act on it this year.\n  But we cannot wait to act on immigration reform. The problem is too \nurgent. Congress should back up the President's words with action. We \nshould pass the DREAM Act this year.\n  The DREAM Act is the only immigration reform proposal reported to the \nSenate floor in the 108th Congress. It is a narrowly-tailored, \nbipartisan bill that would provide immigration relief to a select group \nof students who are long term U.S. residents, have good moral character \nand are pursuing a college education or have enlisted in the military.\n  I introduced the DREAM Act with the senior Senator from Utah, Orrin \nHatch, and I thank him for his leadership on this issue. We are an \nunlikely political couple, and it speaks volumes about the urgent need \nfor immigration reform that we have come together in support of the \nDREAM Act.\n  The DREAM Act has broad public support. According to a recent poll of \nlikely voters, 59 percent support the bill, while only 25 percent \noppose it.\n  The DREAM Act has 48 cosponsors and was reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee on an overwhelming 16-3 vote. If brought to a vote, \nthere is every reason to believe it would pass by a wide margin.\n  The DREAM Act was reported to the floor last October, over eight \nmonths ago. The Senate's leadership should bring the DREAM Act to a \nvote as soon as possible.\n  Why is the DREAM Act so important? Because of the extraordinary young \npeople it would help. Let me tell you about two of them, whom I have \nhad the pleasure of meeting.\n  Diana was born in Mexico, but raised in Chicago, in my State of \nIllinois. Her parents brought her to this country at the age of 6. Her \nfather works construction for $25,000 per year; her mother is a manager \nin a fast food restaurant who earns $15,000 per year.\n  Last year, Diana graduated from high school in the top 5 percent of \nher class with a GPA of 4.4 on a 4.0 scale. She is studying to be an \narchitect and she has won first place in a number of architecture \ncontests. Diana is very active in her church and last year she won the \nnational New Leadership Award from the U.S. Catholic Conference of \nBishops.\n  Diana was accepted to Northwestern University, a prestigious \ninstitution, but due to her immigration status, was unable to attend. \nLast fall, Diana became the first member of her family to attend \ncollege when she enrolled in the architecture school at an Illinois \nstate college.\n  Tereza was also raised in Illinois; her Korean parents brought her to \nthe U.S. when she was two. Her mother, the family's sole breadwinner, \nearns $20,000 per year working 12-hour days at a dry-cleaner.\n  Tereza began playing piano when she was eight. She became a musical \nprodigy, winning the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Youth Auditions, which \nenabled her to perform with the Orchestra.\n  I first learned about Tereza when her family called to ask for my \nhelp. Tereza first discovered that she was undocumented when she was \npreparing to apply to colleges. The top music schools in the country \nhad recruited Tereza, but when they learned about her immigration \nstatus, most would not permit her to apply. I called the INS to ask for \ntheir help and they told me that Tereza should go back to Korea.\n  Tereza now attends one of the top music schools in the country.\n  One of her music teachers told me:\n\n       I worry that our country, the richest and most blessed in \n     the world, will not permit this very large talent to be \n     developed. We are not such a rich land that we can afford to \n     throw away the talents of our residents.\n\n  Due to support from their communities, Diana and Tereza are among the \nlucky ones who have been able to attend college. However, their futures \nare uncertain--they could be deported at any time.\n  Diana and Tereza are not alone--thousands of other young people are \nprevented from pursuing their dreams by our immigration laws.\n  They are honor-roll students, star athletes, talented artists, \nhomecoming queens, and aspiring teachers and doctors. Their parents \nbrought them to the United States when they were young children. They \nhave lived in this country for most of their lives. It is the only home \nthey know. They have followed the rules and worked hard in school. \nUnfortunately, they are undocumented, so their options are greatly \nlimited and they could be deported at any time.\n  The DREAM Act would help these students. It would permit them to \nbecome permanent residents if they are long-term U.S. residents, have \ngood moral character, and attend college or enlist in the military for \nat least 2 years.\n  The DREAM Act is not an amnesty. It is narrowly tailored to assist \nonly a select group of young people who earn legal status. It is unfair \nto punish these students for the mistakes of their parents.\n  The DREAM Act would also repeal a provision of federal law that \nprevents states from granting in-state tuition rates to undocumented \nstudents. It would not create any new tuition breaks. It would not \nforce states to offer in-state tuition to anyone. It would simply \nreturn to states the authority to determine their own tuition policies.\n  This is not just the right thing to do, it is good for America. The \nDREAM Act would allow students with great potential and ambitions to \ncontribute more fully to our society.\n  Diana and Tereza are just like millions of immigrants who have come \nto this country over the course of our history.\n  I am the proud son of an immigrant. Over 90 years ago my grandmother \ncarried my mother, then a 2-year-old infant, down a gangplank and off \nthe ship that brought them here from Lithuania.\n  As this poor family made its way through the streets, I am sure \nsomeone commented, ``Not more of these people.'' This resistance to new \nAmericans has always been with us.\n  We need to view immigrants for whom they really are: men and women \nwith the courage to leave behind everything they knew to build a new \nand\n\n[[Page S8671]]\n\nbetter life for themselves and their children.\n  Immigrants have made us the greatest country in the world. The best \nand brightest have come here from all over the world, creating a rich \ndiversity that continually renews and drives our society to new \nheights.\n  As we mourn the passing of President Ronald Reagan, all Americans \nshould recall his vision of our Nation as a shining city upon a hill. \nHere is what President Reagan said about the shining city and \nimmigration:\n\n       If there have to be city walls, the walls have doors and \n     the doors are open to anyone with the will and the heart to \n     get here. . . . The city is a beacon a magnet for all who \n     must have freedom, for all pilgrims from all the lost places \n     who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home.\n\n  Like me, President Reagan was the son of an immigrant. We had very \ndifferent political philosophies, but President Reagan understood the \nimportance of immigrants to our great country.\n  I recently received a letter, in support of the DREAM Act, from a \ngroup of Americans who lost loved ones in the September 11 terrorist \nattacks. They wrote:\n\n       We will all be safer if we unite against the terrorists and \n     if our immigration system can be made more rational and \n     reflective of our values as a nation.\n\n  These brave Americans, who have suffered so much, understand that, as \nwe fight the war on terrorism, we must stand by the ideals that made \nour country great. We shouldn't deport extraordinary young people like \nDiana and Tereza. They make America a stronger country. We should \nextend a welcoming hand to them by passing the DREAM Act this year.\n  These young people cannot wait any longer--many of them will have \nbeen deported by the time the next session of Congress begins.\n  For example, four honor-roll students from Wilson High School in \nArizona are currently in deportation proceedings. They have lived in \nthe United States since they were toddlers. Under current law they have \nno options, but the immigration judge who is considering their case \ngranted a continuance to give Congress time to pass the DREAM Act.\n  The Senate should vote on the DREAM Act. I ask the Senate's \nleadership to schedule a vote on this important bill as soon as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8671-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RURAL COMMUNITY ARSENIC RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue that is just now \nemerging in rural America, but one that is important and has the \npotential to devastate, economically, small cities and towns across the \ninter-mountain West--like in my State, of Idaho.\n  The new Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standard of 10 \nparts per billion for arsenic is something the current Administration \ninherited from the prior Administration and is now trying to implement. \nI would remind my colleagues, however, that the new lowered arsenic \nstandard was not universally supported in Congress when it was \nproposed.\n  There were Senators--not many, but I was certainly one of them--that \nknew that the cost of complying with the new arsenic standard was going \nto cripple economically--was going to break the back financially--of \nrural communities and small towns across the western United States.\n  I fought this new standard on the floor of the Senate. I knew the \ncosts were crippling and the health benefit was bogus. I also knew that \nthe science to support the lower standard is being exposed as based on \nexamples and sample populations that were very, very flawed. The \nscience is now revealing that extrapolating from those sample \ncommunities to the whole of the United States was a very, very flawed \nbasis for the drinking water standard.\n  I fought this new standard, but I did not succeed.\n  There are communities now in Idaho that will not be able to come into \ncompliance with this new standard by the time it takes effect. Some of \nthese Idaho communities have estimated that it would take double or \ntriple their entire city budget, just to try to come into compliance--\nand that would mean that no other city services could be paid for.\n  That kind of situation is clearly ridiculous, and I will fight as \nlong and as hard as I can to find solutions to this problem.\n  For example, this past March I discussed this issue with EPA \nAdministrator Mike Leavitt. Mike Leavitt is a Westerner--his folks in \nUtah are having some of the same problems.\n  I discussed that with him and I think he will try to be reasonable. I \nwill keep discussing it with him. The problem is that EPA bureaucrats--\nwho are so good at being bureaucrats--think they know Idaho better than \nIdahoans do. Some of our Idaho communities have requested of EPA Region \n10 that EPA exercise some flexibility with this standard. This is \nflexibility that EPA has already incorporated into its final agency \nrule on the arsenic standard.\n  Unfortunately, EPA bureaucrats are doing what they are good at. They \nare saying no to flexibility and hey, by the way, Castleford, Idaho or \nNew Plymouth, Idaho--this won't disadvantage you economically as much \nas you say. That is what EPA says to the communities of Idaho. We know \nbetter than you.\n  Seeing that EPA cannot be reasonable, I have worked with my \ncolleagues Senator Nelson of Nebraska and Senator Domenici of New \nMexico. Both of their States have similar problems. The product of our \ncollaboration is the bill we are introducing today.\n  With this bill, we are trying to force States--and in Idaho's case, \nthe EPA since Idaho is what they call a ``non-primacy state''--to \napprove requests from communities to delay their compliance with the \nnew arsenic standard.\n  The bill is straightforward, it is vital, and it is needed. It will \nsave some of these communities from bankruptcy or from discontinuing \nessential community services. Many other states--other than Idaho, \nNebraska, and New Mexico--face this same crisis. I implore my \ncolleagues to learn about what their small communities are facing, and \nto join with us in enacting this essential regulatory relief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8671-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 HONORING KATIE PENN AND HILLARY RAINEY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

They will \nbe representing their community and Kentucky as young leaders and \nproblem-solvers.\n  America's Promise was founded in 1997 to make children and youth a \nnational priority. Their mission is to mobilize people from every \nsector of American life to build the character and competence of youth \nby fulfilling the following promises: providing caring adults, safe \nplaces with structured activities after school, a healthy start, \nmarketable skills through education, and opportunities to serve.\n  As ambassadors for the America's Promise program, Katie and Hillary \nwill organize a project for National Youth Service Day in April 2005 in \ntheir community. In addition, they will dedicate 2 to 3 hours every \nmonth volunteering in their community, and will have the opportunity to \nearn the President's Volunteer Service Award for their activities. They \nwill also be participating in monthly training sessions to build their \nleadership skills.\n  Young people are part of the solution to problems we face in this \ncountry, and we need to utilize their assets. I join my fellow \nKentuckians to congratulate Katie Penn and Hillary Rainey being named \nambassadors for this program and thank them for their dedication to \ncommunity service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8671-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8671-S8672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO MINNESOTA RADIO STATION, KTCZ-FM\n\n Mr. DAYTON.

The Award \nhonors KTCZ-FM for its continuous commitments and exceptional \ndedication to community service throughout its listening region.\n  KTCZ-FM, which is known locally as ``Cities 97,'' deserves this honor \nfor its many charitable contributions. Last\n\n[[Page S8672]]\n\nyear, the station donated over $2.7 million in airtime, which enabled \nnonprofit service organizations to raise almost $5 million for their \nimportant work. The station also aired over $1 million worth of public \nservice announcements and provided almost 80 hours of public affairs \nbroadcasts.\n  Their tremendous community support previously earned KTCZ-FM the Camp \nHeartland Heart of Hope Award, the Make-A-Wish Recognition Award, the \nUniversity Pediatrics Foundation Corporate Friend Award, and a \nProclamation by the Governor of Minnesota.\n  KTCZ-FM's employees share the station's dedication to helping others. \nLast year, they donated over 2,500 hours of their own time to help \nworthy causes.\n  On behalf of the thousands of Minnesotans who have been helped by \nCities 97's generosity, I thank the station, its management, and its \nemployees for their extraordinary contributions. I congratulate them \nfor winning a 2004 Crystal Radio Award.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Judith L. \nLichtman, who stepped down recently after serving for 30 years as \npresident of the National Partnership for Women and Families.\n  I have been privileged to work with Judy Lichtman for the past \nquarter century on numerous issues of importance to American women and \nfamilies. Judy took the lead in efforts to combat gender-based \ndiscrimination in the workplace, to protect a woman's right to choose, \nto provide each and every American with affordable health care, and to \nin so many other ways help working families across our Nation.\n  Judy began her career at the National Partnership for Women and \nFamilies in 1974, when it was known as the Women's Legal Defense Fund. \nAt the time, she was its executive director and only paid staff member. \nUnder her leadership, the National Partnership has become an \norganization that has been at the forefront of many major legislative \ninitiatives concerning women and families for the past three decades.\n  Judy was particularly instrumental in the successful effort to pass \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act, legislation I was privileged to \nauthor in the Senate. Judy recognized decades ago that each and every \nday, men and especially women in America are forced to make difficult \nchoices between advancing their careers and caring for their families. \nThe FMLA hasn't eliminated these difficult choices entirely. But by \nproviding working men and women with up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave \nto care for a sick loved one or a newborn child, it has been an \nenormous help to women and men as they strive to balance the competing \ndemands of work and family.\n  In this legislative body, and around our country, we often hear \nrhetoric about ``family values.'' Judy understands that if ``family \nvalues'' as a term means anything, it must be accompanied by policies \nthat actually value families by providing them with access to \naffordable health care, by helping parents care for their children, by \ngiving working mothers opportunities for equal jobs with equal pay, and \nby fighting practices that discriminate against parents in the \nworkplace.\n  Judy understands that the American family's priorities are America's \npriorities. The family is the fundamental building block of our \nsociety. And when we make the American family stronger, we make America \nstronger.\n  Judy has won praise from wide circles for her tireless efforts. \nPresident Clinton called her ``a remarkable national treasure,'' and I \necho those words today. The occasion of Judy's retirement is indeed a \nbittersweet one. But I have no doubt that she will continue to lend her \nexpertise and passion to the National Partnership as she continues on \nin the role of senior advisor.\n  I don't know anyone who is a more passionate, tenacious, and \nintelligent advocate for women and families than Judy Lichtman. She is \na model for generations to come, and I have truly enjoyed the time I \nhave spent working together with her over the years.\n  I thank Judy for her many, many years of dedicated work, and I wish \nher luck as she moves on to this new stage in her life and her \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8672-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF FERN HOLLAND\n\n   Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the \nmemory of a special woman, Fern Holland, who left the comfort of her \nwork as a lawyer in private practice to serve the poor, the oppressed, \nand the marginalized. She volunteered for the Peace Corps in Namibia, \nAfrica, and worked with the American Refugee Committee to set up legal \nclinics in Guinea. Finally, she worked for the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development and the Coalition Provisional Authority as a \nhuman rights lawyer organizing women's groups and human rights groups \nin south central Iraq. Fern is someone who deserves to be remembered \nboth for what she did in life and what she gave in life in service to \nour country.\n  On March 9, 2004, she was brutally gunned down south of Baghdad, near \nthe city of Hilla. Her friend and colleague, Salwa Oumashi, was also \nkilled. Fern worked tirelessly to set up women's centers in south \ncentral Iraq. She was working for our Government to provide safe places \nfor Iraqi women to discuss and pursue active roles in their \ncommunities. During her time in Iraq, she wanted to give women in \nplaces like Hilla and Karbala a voice because she feared they might be \nforgotten otherwise.\n  Iraqi women are struggling every day to participate in the rebuilding \nof their country, but they confront many obstacles, not least of which \ninclude the daily challenges to their own personal security. Today, the \ncenters Fern helped to establish are playing a crucial role in the \nwomen's movement in Iraq. Fern knew the danger that she faced, but she \nwanted to volunteer her services to further democracy and freedom and \nto help Iraqi women come out from behind the walls of oppression in \norder to take their rightful place in a new Iraq.\n  Fern was in constant e-mail contact with many of us on Capitol Hill. \nShe wrote about the dreams of the Iraqi women she met and what needed \nto be done to make those dreams come true. Of Fern her Iraqi colleagues \nwrote: ``Fern lost her life, but won our love and this is unique in \nlife. We must follow Fern in the same way and show to the murderers \nthat we will walk on in her spirit.''\n  Fern Holland held two core beliefs: that all people deserve basic \nhuman rights, and that one person really can make a difference in the \nlives of others--and she did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8672-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING GREGORY B.

Throughout his life, he was an \noutstanding businessman, perhaps best exemplified by his founding the \nsuccessful Harrisonburg Fruit and Produce, which would later become\n\n[[Page S8673]]\n\nSysco Food Services of Virginia. His entrepreneurial skills were only \noutshone by his philanthropic skills as Mr. Showker kindly used his \ngreat success in business to give back to his community through his \nvarious charitable projects.\n  More than anything, Zane Showker was an exceptionally kind and \ngenerous gentleman who cared greatly for the Shenandoah Valley. As \nGovernor, I was proud to appoint Zane to the JMU Board of Visitors, \nwhere he served with distinction. His work at JMU and throughout the \nValley had a truly positive effect on the lives of countless \nVirginians. Like so many others, I will always have fond memories of \nhis warm personality and hospitality at his wonderful home, Breezy \nHill.\n  Today, my thoughts and prayers go out to the Showker family during \nthis difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8673-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING RAYMON THACKER\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

John has made tremendous contributions to the institution through \nhis dedication to educational excellence, and I am pleased to \ncongratulate him today.\n  John has served as a member of the University of Alabama management \nteam since 1979, most recently as executive assistant to the chancellor \nand secretary of the board of trustees of the University of Alabama. \nRecognized nationally for his accomplishments in higher education \nadministration, John has made countless contributions to the \nuniversity.\n  John has been an integral part of the university's efforts to recruit \nsenior leadership, resulting in the selection of 10 campus presidents \nand four chancellors. Additionally, John's responsibilities at the \nuniversity include oversight of the activities and meetings of the \nboard of trustees as well as leadership in strategic planning and \ncrisis management issues.\n  As ambassador of the University of Alabama system in the U.S. and \nabroad, John has represented the Board and its entities in activities \nof the Association of Governing Boards of American Colleges and \nUniversities, the American Council on Education, the College and \nUniversity Personnel Association, the Japan-America Society of Alabama, \nand the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant \nColleges.

Mr. President, in a few weeks we are going to be \ncheering on our champion athletes at the Olympics in Athens, Greece. I \nrise today to tell America the unique and inspiring story of a 12-year-\nold Marylander and record-breaking swimmer named Jessica Long.\n  Jessica was born in Russia and adopted with her brother Joshua as an \ninfant. Though Jessica has faced health difficulties and worn \nprosthetic legs since she was a little girl, she has always been on the \nmove. She began swimming seriously several years ago, pushing off the \nwall of the pool with her knees, and using her upper body for the \nmajority of her swimming strength. She has since set 11 National and 2 \nPan American records for disabled swimmers. Jessica is now going to \ncompete in the 50-, 100-, and 400-meter freestyle events at the \nParalympics Games in Athens.\n  Jessica also finds time to just have fun and be a kid.

Mr. President, I am pleased and proud \nto congratulate a leading Nebraska company that this year is \ncelebrating its 50th anniversary as the world's preeminent mechanized \nirrigation manufacturer. Valmont Industries' development of the center \npivot technology has revolutionized agricultural production, not just \nin the United States, but around the world. At the same time, this \ntechnology uses far less water than other traditional means of \nirrigation such as flood and drip, and preserves water quality by \nreducing nonpoint source pollution because it lessens the use of \npesticides and fertilizers. Valmont's products allow us to grow \nsignificantly more crops and produce greater crop revenue, all while \nprotecting our vital natural resources.\n  I am sure my colleagues are familiar with the center pivot. When you \nfly across the country and see huge circles in the middle of farmland, \nthose are created by the center pivots manufactured in my home town of \nMcCook and Valley, where they were first developed. In fact, the brand \nname is popularly known as Valley pivots.\n  You can also see Valley center pivots and linear and corner machines \nat work in over 100 countries. All told, the company maintains \nirrigation manufacturing and distribution facilities in five states and \nsix countries on six continents.\n  I worked with Valmont officials during my tenure as Governor, and I \ncontinue to work with Mogens Bay, chairman and chief executive officer \nfor Valmont; Bob Meaney, senior vice president; and Tom Spears, \npresident of the Irrigation Division; as well as the company's \nWashington representatives at Bob Lawrence & Associates. In addition, I \nam also quite familiar with other Valmont products, since it is also \nthe world's foremost manufacturer of engineered poles for electrical \ntransmission, lighting, traffic signs and signals, and wireless \ncommunications.\n  Today, a half century after Bob Daugherty improved and marketed the \nfirst center pivot, Valmont has produced an estimated 145,000 center \npivots, linear, and corner machines, which successfully irrigate more \nthan 14 million crop acres, and can effectively promote the growth of \nvirtually any crop.\n  I congratulate Valmont and its dedicated workers for their half \ncentury of innovation and initiative as well as for\n\n[[Page S8674]]\n\ntheir success in helping to feed the world while protecting our \nenvironment. These are truly remarkable legacies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8674-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THOMAS H. WARDLEIGH\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I pay tribute to Mr. Thomas H. \nWardleigh, Alaskan aviation legend, who left us for new horizons on \nJuly 7, 2004, following a long battle with cancer.\n  A World War II Navy veteran, Tom moved to Alaska in 1951 and \ncontinued his aviation career as a mechanic with the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service, keeping its fleet of Grumman aircraft in operation \nfor decades. He completed his federal service at the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. He then devoted the rest of his life to promoting \nsafety enhancements for Alaskan aviation. In 1984 he became chairman of \nthe Alaskan Aviation Safety Foundation and produced more than 1,000 \nweekly episodes of a TV show called ``Hangar Flying'' which was \nbroadcast all over Alaska. Because of the value of the instruction, the \nnational organization, Aircraft Owner and Pilots Association, recently \ngave a grant to the University of Alaska Archives to transfer all of \nthe programs to DVD so that future aviators will be able to learn from \nhis timeless wisdom.\n  Tom Wardleigh logged over 33,000 flight hours in numerous types of \naircraft. He was in great demand as an advanced flight instructor, and \nwas one of the few multiengine sea plane instructors. Many, many \nAlaskan pilots were Tom's students over the years.\n  Although he was a tenacious fighter, Wardleigh was soft spoken, \nfriendly, and always a gentleman, perhaps some reasons he was such a \nsuccessful advocate for aviation safety enhancement, whether in \neducation or technology. He was most recently instrumental in the \ndevelopment of the FAA Capstone Project which has been credited as a \nsignificant factor in lowering the accident rate in rural Alaska. While \nhis work was primarily in Alaska, Tom participated in forums and \nprojects all over the United States as well as in other countries whose \naviation leaders often came to Alaska to personally seek Tom's advice \non developing their safety programs.\n  The list of commendations Tom had received over the years is long, \nand includes AOPA's Laurence P. Sharples' national award in 1994 for \nhis lifetime of service. Last year, FAA Administrator Marion Blakey \npersonally recognized Tom with one of the agency's most significant \nhonors in U.S. civil aviation, the Distinguished Service Award--this in \naddition to having previously bestowed on him the Charles Taylor Master \nMechanic and the Wright Brothers' Master Pilot Awards.\n  While Tom Wardleigh may have taken his last flight, pilots and \npassengers alike will fondly remember this special aviator as they turn \nonto Wardleigh Drive at the Anchorage Ted Stevens International \nAirport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8674-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NEW JERSEY STATE SOCIETY BIDS FAREWELL TO JOHN AND HELEN PANNULLO\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this \nopportunity to acknowledge the outstanding contributions of John and \nHelen Pannullo in strengthening the New Jersey State Society. This \nvaluable organization has played a major role in the professional and \nsocial lives of so many present and former New Jersey residents who \nlive and work in the National Capital area. Unfortunately, their \ncolleagues and many friends must bid them a fond farewell as they \nfinally retire and move from this area.\n  John is a former association executive who has represented a number \nof associations in New Jersey and Washington, DC. Helen is retiring \nafter 31 years of Federal Government service during which she held a \nvariety of management positions in the information technology field and \nserved on the board of Executive Women in Government.\n  In 1997 John assumed the Presidency of the New Jersey State Society, \nand Helen became its secretary. Under their expert leadership, the NJSS \nhad a period of unprecedented growth and activity. They created an \nannual membership directory and quarterly newsletter. They also \ninitiated the participation of the NJSS in 10 to 12 high-profile events \neach year, including New Jersey Day at the National Cathedral, the \nBattle of the Beltway to raise funds for the Cystic Fibrosis \nFoundation, and the National Book Fest on the Mall. One of the \nhighlights of this period was the 2001 New Jersey inaugural gala \nattended by more than one thousand NJSS members and their guests.\n  During their tenure the income of the society has increased ten fold, \nand the membership has gone from fewer than 100 to nearly 900.\n  I am sincerely grateful for John and Helen's dedication to the New \nJersey State Society and their noteworthy accomplishments on behalf of \nthe citizens, businesses, labor organizations and educational \ninstitutions in our State. While we will miss them, I wish them every \nsuccess and much happiness in this new chapter of their very successful \nand productive lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8674-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF CHATOM, ALABAMA\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the town of Chatom in my home state of Alabama. On October 4, \n2004, the Town of Chatom will celebrate its 100th birthday. Named the \ncounty seat of Washington County in 1907, the town later became the \nhome of the county's first high school. Washington County Hospital and \nNursing Home, where an uncle of mine was ably cared for, was founded \nthere in 1952. In 1956, Chatom citizens founded the beautiful \nWashington County Public Library. Chatom became a regional leader in \naviation when Roy Wilcox Airport was established there in 1963. In \n1995, the town extended its appeal to additional tourists and golf \nenthusiasts by opening an eighteen hole golf course. Reflecting the \nhospitable environment of the town, residents established the Chatom \nCommunity Center in 2000. Lake Ellis opened that same year, providing \nincreased avenues for fellowship and leisure to both residents and \nvisitors. Currently, the Town of Chatom encompasses a population of \n1,205.\n  I firmly believe that it is out of the small towns and rural \ncommunities of America that there arises the rich values that shape our \nState and Nation. People know and care for one another. They go to \nchurch. They encourage the children of the community. They stand up for \ntruth, justice and common sense. That is the way they were raised and \nthat raising forms the basis for a fierce sense of independence, a \nrespect for the ownership of property, and a love of democracy, where \npeople from the heart of America rule. They love and respect America, \nthey understand the exceptional character of our country, obey her \nlaws, and send their sons and daughters to defend her just national \ninterests. Without the people of Chatom and millions like them, we \nwould cease to bear the stamp, ``American''.\n  Chatom has been a commercial and educational center for southwest \nAlabama for many years. In fact, I recently found a diploma of another \nuncle, Harry A. Powe, Jr., who came down from Black Creek outside Silas \nto graduate from Chatom High School in the 1920s.\n  The rich history and character of Chatom are proof of the leadership \npotential of Americans intent upon the pursuit of the American dream \nand the promotion of American ideals. Since its founding on October 4, \n1904, the Town of Chatom has been a leader of Washington County, due \nnot only to its expanding educational and economical opportunities but \nalso to the hard work and good hearts of its people. As Chatom prepares \nto celebrate its centennial, we should pause to look forward to the \nfuture achievements of its citizens. I congratulate and commend Chatom \nfor its accomplishments and continued growth. I thank the residents of \nChatom for their examples of American ideals and southern \nhospitality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8674-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8674-S8675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF JEREMY TODD BOWLING\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Not only was he part of our Greatest \nGeneration, he was a true hero, aptly defined as one who inspires \nthrough manners and actions, who leads through personal example and \naccomplishments requiring bravery, skill, and determination. As \ncommander of the famed ``Memphis Belle'' during World War II, and at a \ntime when German anti-aircraft fire brought down 8 in 10 bombers, \nColonel Morgan repeatedly risked everything for his country. In this \nextremely dangerous environment he piloted the first heavy bomber to \ncomplete 25 combat missions in the European Theater, an unprecedented \nachievement and the magic number to be sent home.\n  Colonel Morgan's exceptional courage did not end in the European \nTheater. He continued his valiant service to his country in the Pacific \nTheater and again made history when his B-29 named ``Dauntless Dotty'' \nwas chosen to lead the first B-29 raid on Tokyo. A native of Asheville, \nNC, Colonel Morgan represented the American Spirit--courage in the face \nof seemingly insurmountable odds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8675-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF JESSE DUKE WELTE\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I publicly congratulate Paul \nStabile on a very successful career helping individuals with \ndisabilities obtain jobs. He is retiring from the Black Hills Workshop \non September 13, 2004.\n  Over the years, Paul has been extraordinarily committed to exploring \nnew roles for people with disabilities in the workforce throughout the \nUnited States. Paul began his career with the Black Hills Workshop in \n1973 when philosophies about the people with disabilities were making \ndramatic changes. The de-institutionalization of people with \ndisabilities in South Dakota was reflective of what was happening all \nover the United States. Paul's friends recall that Paul welcomed dozens \nof men and women to Black Hills Workshop and the Rapid City community \nwho had spent their entire lives living in an institution in Redfield. \nPaul offered them support in living, working and assuming a quality of \nlife that people with disabilities had never before known.\n  In 1996, a separate corporation, Black Hills Services, was formed to \nprovide services to the Department of Defense and employment \nopportunities at Ellsworth Air Force Base. Paul was selected to lead \nthe new corporation.\n  Paul's association with the U.S. Air Force has provided thousands of \njob opportunities to people with disabilities and provided the Air \nForce with much-needed support. Paul's partnership with the Air Force \nhas been a shining example to Human Service Agencies around the country \nfor people with disabilities.\n  During Paul's tenure, Black Hills Services, and the people with \ndisabilities that it serves, has been recognized with some of the \nhighest honors that can be bestowed by the Air Force. These awards \ninclude Best Large Commissary in the United States, Best Large \nMerchandise Department-Commissary, R.T. Riney Award, Best Food Services \nand the prestigious Hennessy Award for Best Air Force Dining Facility \nWorldwide.\n  Paul also served on the Rapid City Mayor's Committee on Employment of \nPeople with Disabilities. Paul's leadership has gone beyond South \nDakota. From 1996 to 2003, Paul was a member of the NISH Board of \nDirectors where he served as treasurer and secretary. NISH is the \nnonprofit organization that assists work centers in obtaining and \nmaintaining contracts with the Federal Government. In March 2004, in \nrecognition of Paul's years of service on behalf of NISH, the Javits-\nWagner-O'Day, JWOD, Program and people with disabilities, the NISH \nBoard of Directors granted him the status of emeritus Board member.\n  Paul was recently honored with the prestigious Milton ``Milt'' Cohen \nLeadership Award, which recognizes an individual from a Community \nRehabilitation Program, CRP, working within the JWOD Program. The \nhonoree must have demonstrated national leadership qualities leading to \nenhanced employment opportunities for people with severe disabilities. \nMilton Cohen was a respected national leader in the field of vocational \nrehabilitation.\n  I've appreciated Paul's insight, advice and counsel on issues of \nimportance to people with disabilities in South Dakota. His undying \ncommitment and dedication have helped open countless doors of \nopportunities to people with disabilities. Paul's efforts have helped \ntear down barriers--barriers set for those set in attitudes. I wish \nnothing but the best for him and his family. It is with great honor \nthat I share his impressive accomplishments with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8675-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8675-S8676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING HAWAII PARTICIPANTS IN 2004 ECONOMICS CHALLENGE\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I congratulate the team of \nstudents from Iolani School of Honolulu, HI, for logging a national \naccomplishment in the National Economics Challenge recently held in New \nYork City. The team traveled over 5,000 miles to represent not only \nHawaii, but the western region in the competition, at which they \nachieved a second-place finish in their category, the David Ricardo \ndivision, which is for students enrolled in single-semester economics \ncourses.\n  The National Economics Challenge is sponsored by the National Council \non Economic Education, NCEE, and the Goldman Sachs Foundation, which \ncreated the Challenge in 2000 to promote student interest in economics, \nreinforce classroom instruction, advance academics, and reward \nscholarship. Preliminary rounds began in April with more than 3,600 \nstudents on over 700 teams participating in 33 State and 4 regional \ncompetitions. I commend the Hawaii Council on Economic Education for \nsponsoring the State-level competition in my State and, on a constant \nbasis, training teachers and working to improve economic and financial \nliteracy in Hawaii's schools. Student teams in the final round at the \nnational level faced difficult questions on complex economic concepts \nand theories involving microeconomics, macroeconomics, international \neconomics, and current events. The final round of the competition was \nheld before a crowd of hundreds at the New York High School of \nEconomics and Finance\n\n[[Page S8676]]\n\nin Manhattan. The Iolani team competed and placed second in their \ndivision, for which I congratulate them wholeheartedly.\n  As a former teacher and principal, I am aware of the many hours of \nwork that these students dedicated to develop the necessary knowledge \nto participate in this national competition. They have surmounted many \nchallenges at the State, regional and national levels, and have emerged \nwith not only a placing finish to show for it, but also the experiences \nand memories of all they have learned along the way. Economic and \nfinancial education are crucial components needed to build our future \nleaders, and I applaud all students who participate in this competition \nfor their hard work.\n  I am pleased to enter the names of the Iolani team members for the \nRecord: Stephani Le, Kimberlee Collins, Kyle Sombrero, and Brando \nInouye. I also take this opportunity to recognize their coach Richie \nKibota for his contributions in helping the Iolani team prepare for the \nnational competition. Of particular interest are their classmates and \npeers who rose to the same challenges, whose names I would also like to \nenter into the Record. This includes another Iolani School team who \ncompeted and placed at both State and regional levels in the Adam Smith \ndivision for advanced placement, international baccalaureate, and \nhonors students, with team members Jeffrey Lawi, Brad Kawitaki, Ronald \nKwok, Keone Nakoa, and Krystal Ching, and coach Dick Rankin. Also \nincluded are other Hawaii State participants: a third team from Iolani \nSchool and other teams from Kamehameha Schools, Maryknoll School, \nKaimuki High School, and Nanakuli High and Intermediate School.\n  Again, I congratulate the students and the faculty of Iolani School, \nand I join the people of Hawaii in expressing my pride in their \nimpressive achievements. It is these types of efforts that are \nsupported by the Excellence in Economic Education Act, and these kinds \nof efforts that will ensure that our students and future leaders have \nthe tools they need to make wise economic and financial decisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8676-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SALUTE TO HARRY AND DAVID\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, 70 years ago--in the fall of 1934--\nHarry Holmes from Medford, OR traveled to New York City armed with \nnothing more than a dream and 15 boxes of Royal Rivera pears, which had \nbeen grown on the orchard in the beautiful Rogue Valley owned by Harry \nand his brother David. Their goal--in the midst of an economic \ndepression--was to convince New York business executives that a box of \ntheir pears was a perfect Christmas gift.\n  A week of meetings, however, yielded no success, and the pears were \nbeginning to ripen. In an attempt to prolong the pears, Harry kept the \nwindow of his hotel room wide open, transforming his room into a make-\nshift refrigerator.\n  With just 2 days left in his trip, Harry was introduced to G. Lynn \nSumner, an advertising man. Sumner met with Harry that afternoon, and \nbefore business was discussed, Harry had Sumner tuck a towel into his \nshirt collar and taste one of the pears.\n  ``I took a bite out of my pear and found that Harry had taken a wise \nprecaution,'' said Sumner. ``The juice burst . . . and poured down over \nme. . . . At the same time, I sensed the full flavor of the most \nluscious pear I had ever tasted.''\n  Sumner was so impressed he immediately agreed to help Harry promote \nhis product. That night he drafted a letter to be sent with each box of \npears, asking the recipient just to taste a pear and imagining what a \nwonderful Christmas gift a box of them would make.\n  The next morning, each of the 15 boxes of pears, along with a copy of \nthe letter, were sent to America's most prominent business leaders. \nBefore Harry left New York to return to Oregon, he had 500 orders in \nhand.\n  Seven decades later, Harry and David is the Nation's largest and most \nwell-known direct marketer of gourmet food and fruit gifts. It ships \nmore than 7.5 million gifts per year, including 4 million during the \nChristmas holiday season. Harry and David's parent company, Bear Creek \nCorporation, is also a leading employer in Southern Oregon, providing \n3,000 full-time and part-time jobs year around, and 11,000 jobs during \nthe holiday season.\n  I am proud to congratulate the good folks at Harry and David for 70 \nyears of providing millions and millions of families around the world \nwith delicious food and countless Christmas memories.\n  I am also reminded of the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said, \n``Cultivators of the earth are the most valuable citizens. They are the \nmost vigorous, the most independent, the most virtuous, and they are \ntied to their country and wedded to its liberty and interests by the \nmost lasting bands.''\n  In saluting Harry and David, I do more than salute a business. I also \nsalute the ``cultivators of the earth''--the farmers and orchardists \nwho do the work necessary to make the land blossom with an abundance of \ntreasures. I am confident that their hard work and the hard work of all \nthose at Harry and David will help to ensure that the best days of this \ncompany are yet to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8676-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8676-S8677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN RECOGNITION OF THE HATCH CHILE FESTIVAL AND NEW MEXICO CHILE GROWERS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I recognize the Hatch Chile \nFestival and to recognize my home State of New Mexico as the largest \nchile growing State in the Nation. Soon it will be September. For those \nfrom the Land of Enchantment, that means the recently harvested green \nchile is ready for roasting.\n  The chile pepper is thought to have originated in South America. \nDuring the 1500s, Spanish explorers and colonists introduced new crops, \nincluding chile, to the Southwest.\n  Although producers have been plagued by continuing drought \nconditions, agriculture continues to be a major contributor to our \nState's economy. Chile is one of New Mexico's most valuable commodities \nin terms of revenue, and is the State's most important agricultural \ncrop both culturally and historically. New Mexico produced over 85,000 \ntons of chile in 2003, and planted acreage was estimated at 15,800 \nacres. Additionally, the value of the crop was estimated at around $41 \nmillion in 2003.\n  The Hatch Chile Festival is an annual event which dates back 33 \nyears. The festival celebrates the chile and its cultural influence on \nNew Mexico and its people. The festival is held on Labor Day weekend \nand draws hundreds of participants to the small town of Hatch, located \njust west of the banks of the Rio Grande.\n  Chile harvest usually begins in late July or early August and \ncontinues through the red chile harvest or up through the first frost. \nAfter harvest, the chile arrives from the farms in almost every \ncontainer imaginable from bushel baskets and burlap bags, to wooden \ncrates and cardboard boxes--all filled with freshly picked green chile \nwaiting to be roasted.\n  The roasting process brings out its robust flavor and is most \ncommonly done using a cylindrical tumbler. During harvest season, these \ngas-powered chile roasters can be seen going almost nonstop--outside \ngrocery stores, in backyards, and of course, at the Chile Festival in \nHatch.\n  The festival spreads across the entire town, making room for visitors \nto take in the sights and smells of the Chile festival and all its \nactivities. The smell of roasting green chile is subtle, but \nunmistakable. The flavor of roasted green chile, like that of any food, \nis hard to describe to someone who has never experienced it.\n  Chile, and its history, is as much a part of our New Mexico culture \nand heritage as hot dogs, hamburgers, and apple pie is to our national \nheritage. So much so, that we even have an official State question, \n``Red or Green?''\n  In the past, the Hatch Chile Festival was a small town event which \nattracted mostly native New Mexicans or people familiar with the town \nof Hatch. However, in 2003 the Festival was featured on cable \ntelevision's Food Network, resulting in a significant jump in \nattendance.\n  Regardless of its new found fame, the festival has not lost its small \ntown charm, and I expect it never will. The festival brings great \nrecognition to Hatch valley locals, and much pride to native New \nMexicans and visitors\n\n[[Page S8677]]\n\nalike. For that, and for all the accomplishments of chile producers and \nfestival organizers, I am proud, and I salute them all here in this \nRecord. Keep up the good work, and may you continue to represent Hatch \nand the State of New Mexico with distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8677-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING GENE N.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to the State Waste \n     Empowerment and Enforcement Provision Act of 2003; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 247\n\n       WHEREAS, recent reports issued by he Department of \n     Environmental Quality reveal that Virginia is currently the \n     second largest importer of municipal solid waste from other \n     states, second only to Pennsylvania, and is currently \n     importing approximately 5.5 million tons annually of \n     municipal solid waste from other states; and\n       WHEREAS, the amount of municipal solid waste being imported \n     into Virginia is expected to increase in the coming years due \n     to the closure of the Fresh Kills Landfill in New York and \n     increased volumes from other states; and\n       WHEREAS, the importation of significant amounts of \n     municipal solid waste from other states is prematurely \n     exhausting Virginia's limited landfill capacity; and\n       WHEREAS, the negative impact of truck, rail, and barge \n     traffic and litter, odors, and noise associated with waste \n     imports occurs at the location of final disposal and along \n     waste transportation routes, and current landfill technology \n     has the potential to fail, leading to long-term cleanup and \n     other associated costs; and\n       WHEREAS, under current federal law, Virginia cannot \n     regulate the amount of solid waste brought into the \n     Commonwealth each year; and\n       WHEREAS, the importation of significant amounts of \n     municipal solid waste from other states is inconsistent with \n     Virginia's efforts to promote the Commonwealth as a national \n     and international destination for tourism and high-tech \n     economic development; and\n       WHEREAS, the Commerce Clause of the United States \n     Constitution and its interpretation and application by the \n     United States Supreme Court and other federal courts \n     regarding interstate solid waste transportation has left \n     Virginia and other states with limited alternatives to \n     regulate, limit, or prohibit the importation of municipal \n     solid waste; and\n       WHEREAS, the General Assembly of Virginia believes that \n     state and local governments should be given more authority to \n     control the importation of municipal solid waste into their \n     jurisdictions; and\n       WHEREAS, although state laws governing the importation of \n     municipal solid waste have been ruled to violate the Commerce \n     Clause of the United States Constitution, the enactment of \n     the State Waste Empowerment and Enforcement Provision Act of \n     2003 would protect states from constitutional challenges to \n     common sense regulation of trash haulers, and empower states \n     to require inspectors at landfills, incinerators, and \n     transfer stations that accept out-of-state municipal solid \n     waste; and\n       WHEREAS, it is the consensus of the General Assembly of \n     Virginia that state and local governments should be given \n     more authority to limit, reduce, and control the importation \n     of solid waste into their jurisdictions through several \n     provisions, including percentage caps, calendar year freezes, \n     the regulation and restriction of certain modes of \n     transportation, the requirement of state inspectors at \n     facilities handling out-of-state waste, and the assessment of \n     fees for the receipt or disposal of out-of-state municipal \n     solid waste that are different than fees assessed for the \n     receipt or disposal of municipal solid waste generated within \n     the Commonwealth: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to enact the \n     State Waste Empowerment and Enforcement Provision Act of 2003 \n     (HR 1123). The Congress is\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\n     urged to authorize local and state governments to regulate \n     the importation of municipal solid waste into their \n     respective jurisdictions; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, and the members of the Virginia \n     Congressional Delegation so that they may be apprised of the \n     sense of the General Assembly of Virginia in this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-493. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to gasoline; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 28\n\n       Whereas, the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (P.L. \n     101-549) mandate the use of reformulated gasoline containing \n     2 percent, by weight, oxygen in areas designated as \n     nonattainment areas due to high ambient ozone levels in \n     summer months and high ambient carbon monoxide levels in \n     winter months; and\n       Whereas, the federal oxygenate mandate requires the use of \n     oxygenate in gasoline in approximately 70 percent of the \n     California retail gasoline market; and\n       Whereas, California has historically led the nation in \n     enacting air quality improvement measures that provide \n     substantial health, economic, and social benefits for the \n     state's citizens; and\n       Whereas, the State Air Resources Board's Cleaner Burning \n     Gasoline Program has resulted in reducing emissions \n     equivalent to removing 3.5 million cars from California's \n     roads; and\n       Whereas, the California Cleaner Burning Gasoline Program \n     provides greater flexibility than the federal program to \n     produce gasoline that meets stringent emission reduction \n     mandates; and\n       Whereas, methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) has been used \n     in California as the primary oxygenate additive to gasoline \n     because its relatively low vapor pressure (RVP) simplifies \n     the production of low-RVP summer gasolines, and because of \n     its compatibility with the blending and distribution system \n     for gasoline, its ability to be transported by pipeline, and \n     its high octane rating; and\n       Whereas, the Environmental Protection Agency's Blue Ribbon \n     Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline recommended that the 2-\n     percent oxygenate requirement be removed and that MTBE be \n     reduced substantially; and\n       Whereas, pursuant to Chapter 816 of the Statutes of 1997, \n     the University of California prepared a report that assessed \n     the health and environmental effects of MTBE and submitted \n     that report to the Legislature and the Governor in November \n     1998; and\n       Whereas, the University of California report found that \n     there are significant risks and costs associated with water \n     contamination due to the use of MTBE because it is highly \n     soluble in water and will transfer readily to groundwater \n     from leaking underground storage tank systems and other \n     components of the gasoline distribution system; and\n       Whereas, the County of Santa Clara, the City of Santa \n     Monica, the Lake Tahoe region, and the Sacramento area, as \n     well as other municipalities in other areas of the state, \n     have all been forced to shut down public drinking water wells \n     due to MTBE contamination; and\n       Whereas, the University of California report found that \n     over 60 percent of the reservoirs tested in California have \n     detectable levels of MTBE; and\n       Whereas, the University of California report found that \n     there is no significant additional air quality benefit to the \n     use of oxygenates such as MTBE in reformulated gasoline, \n     relative to the alternative nonoxygenated formulations \n     identified by the California Cleaner Burning Gasoline \n     Program; and\n       Whereas, United States Senators Diane Feinstein and James \n     Inhofe previously introduced legislation, S. 947, to grant \n     the governor of a state the power to waive the 2-percent \n     oxygenate content requirement for reformulated or clean \n     burning gasoline as long as the fuel meets all other \n     requirements for reformulated gasoline other than those \n     regarding oxygen content; and\n       Whereas, California has previously sought a waiver from the \n     United States Environmental Protection Agency of the oxygen \n     content requirement; and\n       Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     denied California's request for a waiver on the grounds that \n     there was not sufficient evidence that the waiver would help \n     California to reduce harmful levels of air pollutants; and\n       Whereas, California has sought and received waivers from \n     other provisions of the federal Clean Air Act, including \n     Section 209(b)(1) of that act, and has demonstrated no loss \n     of air quality benefits after those waivers have been issued: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider granting an \n     administrative waiver of the federal Clean Air Act's \n     oxygenated gasoline requirement to the State of California, \n     to the extent permitted by the federal Clean Air Act, given \n     the state's independent requirements for clean gasoline that \n     meet both state and national ambient air quality standards; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California \n     respectfully memorializes the Congress of the United States \n     to enact legislation, if an administrative waiver of the \n     federal Clean Air Act is not granted by the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency, similar to, or including, \n     the Feinste-Inhofe legislation, that would authorize \n     California to waive the oxygen content requirement for \n     reformulated gasoline only if the fuel meets other \n     requirements in the federal Clean Air Act for reformulated \n     gasoline; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California \n     respectfully memorializes the President of the United States \n     to sign that legislation if it is enacted by the Congress of \n     the United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-494. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to rip currents in the Great Lakes; to the Committee \n     on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 271\n\n       Whereas, the Great Lakes are known for their beauty, power, \n     and importance to life in this region. Less well known and \n     understood are the dangers of rip currents, which threaten \n     public safety and can cause deaths of swimmers at beaches \n     along the Great Lakes. While rip currents seem to be better \n     known at the ocean, they are no less serious to bathers along \n     Michigan's shores; and\n       Whereas, rip currents, which are sometimes mistakenly, \n     referred to as rip tides or undertows, are caused by sandbars \n     offshore that break apart. The current that results can be \n     very strong, taking even an Olympic-caliber swimmer swiftly \n     away from the shore. The ``rip'' in the sandbar can be the \n     result of high winds or large waves, and it can occur with \n     absolutely no warning. Rip currents can last a few minutes, \n     several hours, or even days. While there often is \n     discoloration to the water that is swept away from the shore \n     by the rip current, this is not always easy to see. Although \n     there is an effective strategy a swimmer can use to return to \n     shore safely, this knowledge must be in place before such an \n     incident occurs to prevent a tragedy; and\n       Whereas, there is clearly a need for greater public \n     awareness among beach visitors to the Great Lakes and more \n     comprehensive research into rip currents. Research could help \n     determine better responses and quicker notification for \n     swimmers as a rip current situation develops. With the number \n     of people swimming in the Great Lakes each summer, this \n     research could save many lives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to provide \n     increased funding to support research and education on rip \n     currents in the Great Lakes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-495. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to \n     prescription drugs to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 56\n\n       Whereas, the Medicare Drug Benefit law recently enacted by \n     Congress and signed into law by the President prohibits the \n     government from negotiating prescription drug prices with the \n     manufacturers; and\n       Whereas, the pharmaceutical companies have been negotiating \n     with other governments such as Canada and Mexico, offering \n     citizens of those countries substantial discounts on \n     prescription drugs, while still generating profits from the \n     discounted prices; and\n       Whereas, news articles have documented that many Americans \n     travel to Canada to purchase their prescription drugs; and\n       Whereas, there is a growing momentum to allow individuals, \n     as well as state and local governments, to lower health care \n     costs by purchasing prescription drugs from Canada; and\n       Whereas, allowing the American government to negotiate \n     prescription drug prices would reduce their costs, as since \n     our purchasing power covers approximately 270 million \n     Americans, which is the largest economy in the world, our \n     government can negotiate lower prices than Canada and other \n     countries and pass on the savings to our citizens; and\n       Whereas, all Americans will be the beneficiaries of \n     discounted prescription drugs, especially those who need \n     prescription drugs for serious health conditions, all group \n     prescription drug programs provided by employers and union \n     agreements, and the state and federal programs that provide \n     prescription drugs to veterans, Medicaid recipients, and \n     others who qualify for government supported programs; and\n\n[[Page S8680]]\n\n       Whereas, substantial savings can be used for other \n     healthcare needs or expenses and reducing co-payments; and\n       Whereas, every other developed country has the power to \n     negotiate the costs of prescription drugs: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-Second Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2004, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the President and Congress \n     are urged to repeal the restriction on government to \n     negotiate reductions in prescription drug prices with \n     manufacturers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the \n     United States, the President of the Senate of the United \n     States, and the members of Hawaii's Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-496. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the Central \n     American Free Trade Agreement; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution no. 115\n\n       Whereas, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick signed a \n     Free Trade Agreement on May 28, 2004, with the Central \n     American countries of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, \n     Honduras and Costa Rica; and\n       Whereas, the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) \n     must now be approved by the national assemblies in each of \n     the participating countries, with the approved legislation \n     expected to come before the U.S. Congress in late June or \n     early July for a vote; and\n       Whereas, approval of such an agreement will be an economic \n     disaster for farmers and workers in Louisiana in particular \n     and throughout the rest of the nation in general; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana sugar industry will suffer immediate \n     and irreversible damage as jobs are lost and Louisiana sugar \n     farmers go out of business; and\n       Whereas, it is now estimated that twenty-seven thousand \n     jobs will be lost across Southern Louisiana, throwing the \n     state's economy into chaos, if the CAFTA legislation is \n     approved by the U.S. Congress; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's economy will lose approximately nine \n     hundred eighty-seven million dollars annually and over four \n     billion, five hundred thousand dollars over the next five \n     years if CAFTA becomes law; and\n       Whereas, CAFTA is modeled after NAFTA, the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement, which has caused many U.S. textile \n     manufacturers such as Fruit of the Loom to desert American \n     workers and relocate in foreign countries where labor and \n     life is extremely cheap; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana communities are reeling from the effects \n     of NAFTA with Crowley losing more than one hundred jobs at \n     Garment Manufacturing, and St. Martinville, Abbeville, Port \n     Barre, and Vidalia, losing nearly eight thousand Fruit of the \n     Loom jobs; and\n       Whereas, negotiations between Southwest Louisiana rice \n     farmers and Cuba to buy Louisiana rice will be impeded or \n     made impossible if the U.S. Congress passes the CAFTA \n     legislation: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     does hereby memorialize the U.S. Congress to reject the \n     legislation before it to create the Central American Free \n     Trade Agreement which would have devastating consequences on \n     the economy and the workers of Louisiana; be it further\n        Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the president of the United States, the secretary of the \n     United States Senate, the clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, each member of the Louisiana delegation to \n     the United States Congress, and the presiding officer of each \n     house of each state legislature in the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-497. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to oral \n     anti-cancer drugs; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and \n     mortality in the Commonwealth and throughout the nation; and\n       Whereas, cancer is disproportionately a disease of the \n     elderly, with more than half of all cancer diagnoses \n     occurring in persons age 65 or older, persons who are often \n     dependent on the federal Medicare program for provision of \n     cancer care; and\n       Whereas, treatment with anti-cancer drugs is the \n     cornerstone of modem cancer care, and elderly cancer patients \n     must have access to potentially life-extending drug therapy; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Medicare program's coverage of anti-cancer \n     drugs is limited to injectable drugs or oral drugs that have \n     an injectable version; and\n       Whereas, the nation's investment in biomedical research has \n     begun to bear fruit with a compelling array of new oral anti-\n     cancer drugs that are less toxic, more effective, and more \n     cost-effective than existing therapies, but, because these \n     drugs do not have an injectable equivalent, they are not \n     covered by Medicare; and\n       Whereas, the lack of coverage for these important new \n     products leaves many Medicare beneficiaries confronting the \n     choice of either substantial out-of-pocket personal cost or \n     selection of more toxic and less effective treatments that \n     are covered by Medicare; and\n       Whereas, Medicare's failure to cover oral anti-cancer drugs \n     leaves at risk many beneficiaries suffering from blood-\n     related cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, as \n     well as cancers of the breast, lung, and prostate; and\n       Whereas, certain members of the Congress of the United \n     States have recognized the necessity of Medicare coverage for \n     all oral anti-cancer drugs and have introduced legislation in \n     the 107th Congress to achieve that result (H.R. 1624 and S. \n     913); Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the Congress of the United \n     States be hereby urged to adopt, legislation that requires \n     the Medicare program to cover all oral anti-cancer drugs; \n     and, be it\n       Resolved Further, That the, Clerk of the Senate transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Administrator \n     of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the \n     members of the Congressional delegation of Virginia so that \n     they may be apprised of the sense of the Senate of Virginia.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-498.

Bush, each member of the \n     Illinois congressional delegation, the embassies of Lithuania \n     and the Russian Federation, and to the national office of the \n     Lithuanian-American Community, Inc.\n                                  ____\n\n        POM-499. A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio relative to Taiwan's \n     participation in the World Health Organization; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n             Substitute Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 24\n\n       Whereas, Taiwan and the United States enjoy one of the most \n     important economic\n\n[[Page S8681]]\n\n     and strategic international relationships where together, \n     Taiwan and the United States promote a shared faith in and \n     respect for freedom, democracy, and market principles; and\n       Whereas, for the past half-century, Taiwan and the United \n     States have worked hand-in-hand to preserve peace and \n     stability within the Pacific Rim and to help improve the \n     lives of their citizens and people around the world; and .\n       Whereas, trade between Taiwan and the United States has \n     increased steadily in the past 40 years, with the United \n     States being Taiwan's second-largest source of imports and \n     Taiwan being the eighth-largest exporter to the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan is the tenth-largest United States export \n     market, buying more United States merchandise than Brazil, \n     Belgium, Australia, or Italy and ranks as one of the top \n     three destinations for United States peaches, plums, celery, \n     apples, cherries, broccoli, corn, feed grains, and bovine \n     hides; and\n       Whereas, the economic and trade partnership between Taiwan \n     and the United States is reflected not only in a large volume \n     of two-way trade, but also in the high level of United States \n     investment in Taiwan and increasingly in Taiwan's investment \n     in the United States; and\n       Whereas, the United States Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention and its Taiwan counterpart have enjoyed close \n     collaboration on a wide range of public health issues; and\n       Whereas, in recent years, the Republic of China has \n     expressed a willingness to assist, financially and \n     technically, international aid and health activities \n     supported by the World Health Organization; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's participation in the World Health \n     Organization could bring many benefits to the state of health \n     in Taiwan and also regionally and globally; and\n       Whereas, the World Health Organization Constitution states \n     that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of \n     health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being \n     without distinction of race, religion, political belief, and \n     economic or social condition; and\n       Whereas, Falun Gong is an ancient Chinese mind and body \n     practice followed by as many as 100 million people in the \n     People's Republic of China and is a peaceful, spiritual \n     discipline that people use to improve their health and to \n     bring about positive changes in their lives; and\n       Whereas, in July, 1999, then-President of the People's \n     Republic of China Jiang Zemin, who was fearful of anything \n     other than the Communist Party of China touching the hearts \n     and minds of the Chinese people, banned the practice of Falun \n     Gong. Since then, the Chinese government has conducted a \n     propaganda campaign against Falun Gong and has persecuted, \n     imprisoned, and tortured its practitioners; and\n       Whereas, Dr. Charles Lee, a Falun Gong practitioner and \n     United States citizen, was arrested on his arrival in the \n     People's Republic of China on January 22, 2003, while \n     attempting to visit his family and has been imprisoned ever \n     since; and\n       Whereas, Christians and members of other religious groups \n     have also been persecuted in the People's Republic of China: \n     Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly of the State of Ohio \n     supports Taiwan's participation in the World Health \n     Organization; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 125th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, strongly deplore the \n     persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, Christians, and \n     members of other religious groups in the People's Republic of \n     China and the imprisonment of Dr. Charles Lee, implore the \n     government of the People's Republic of China to immediately \n     release Dr. Lee and restore to Falun Gong practitioners, \n     Christians, and members of other religious groups full \n     freedom of religious and spiritual expression, and \n     memorialize the President of the United States and the \n     Secretary of the United States Department of State to take \n     all necessary diplomatic actions to secure the release of Dr. \n     Lee and encourage the restoration of religious freedom for \n     Falun Gong practitioners, Christians, and members of other \n     religious groups in the People's Republic of China; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the President of \n     the United States, to the members of the Ohio Congressional \n     delegation, to the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States \n     House of Representatives for distribution to the members of \n     the United States House of Representatives, to the President \n     Pro Tempore and the Secretary of the United States Senate for \n     distribution to the members of the United States Senate, to \n     the United States Secretary of State, to the Ambassador of \n     the United States to the People's Republic of China, to the \n     Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the United \n     States, to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in \n     Chicago, Illinois, to the World Health Organization, and to \n     the news media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-500.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the State of \n     Delaware relative to trade relations with Taiwan; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 46\n\n       Whereas, the United States and the Republic of China on \n     Taiwan, commonly known as Taiwan, maintain an important trade \n     relationship; and\n       Whereas, despite the fact that Taiwan only recently became \n     a member of the World Trade Organization and that it has no \n     formal trade agreement with the United States, Taiwan is the \n     fourteenth largest trading nation in the world, the United \n     States' eighth largest trading partner, and as a center for \n     international trade it is vital to the economic prosperity of \n     this State and of the United States; and\n       Whereas, American businesses and workers have benefited \n     greatly from this dynamic trade relationship, most recently \n     in the computer and electronics sector; and\n       Whereas, as a center for international trade Taiwan is a \n     gateway to other Pacific Rim markets for United States \n     exports, helping to preserve peace and stability within the \n     entire region; and\n       Whereas, United States agricultural producers have been \n     particularly under represented in the list of United States \n     exports to the region, despite the importance of the market \n     for growers of corn, wheat, and soybeans; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan has clearly emerged as one of the United \n     States' most important allies in Asia and throughout the \n     world; and\n       Whereas, the State of Delaware and Taiwan have established \n     a sister-state relationship symbolizing the close friendship \n     between the people of Delaware and the people of Taiwan; and\n       Whereas, this State seeks to encourage and expand mutually \n     beneficial commercial relationships with Taiwan; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's 23,000,000 people are not represented in \n     the United Nations; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan has in recent years repeatedly expressed \n     its strong desire to participate in the United Nations and \n     has much to contribute to the work and funding of the United \n     Nations; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's participation in the United Nations will \n     help maintain peace and stability in Asia and the Pacific; \n     and\n       Whereas, the United States should promote the values of \n     freedom, democracy, and a commitment to open markets and the \n     free exchange of both goods and ideas at home and abroad; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan shares these values with the United States \n     and has struggled throughout the past 50 years to create what \n     is today an open, thriving, and modern democracy that \n     routinely holds free and fair elections and has dramatically \n     improved its record on human rights; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan has forged an open, market-based economy \n     and a thriving democracy based on free elections and the \n     freedom of dissent; and\n       Whereas, it is in the interest of the United States to \n     encourage the development of both these institutions; and\n       Whereas, the United States must continue to support the \n     growth of democracy and ongoing market opening in Taiwan if \n     this relationship is to evolve and reflect the changing \n     nature of the global system in the 21st Century; and\n       Whereas, the United States needs to support partner \n     countries that are lowering trade barriers; and\n       Whereas, a free trade agreement would not only help \n     Taiwan's economy dramatically expand its already growing \n     entrepreneurial class, but it would also serve an important \n     political function; and\n       Whereas, in the interest of supporting, preserving, and \n     protecting the democratic fabric of the government of Taiwan, \n     it has been made clear that the United States supports the \n     withdrawal of missiles deployed as a threat against Taiwan by \n     the People's Republic of China; and\n       Whereas, the United States has an obligation to its allies \n     and to its own citizens to encourage economic growth, market \n     opening, and the destruction of trade barriers as a means of \n     raising living standards across the board; and\n       Whereas, a free trade agreement with Taiwan would be a \n     positive step toward accomplishing all of these goals;\n       Whereas, direct and unobstructed participation in \n     international health cooperation forums and programs is \n     crucial for all parts of the world, especially with today's \n     greater potential for cross-border spread of various \n     infectious diseases; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's achievements in the field of health are \n     substantial, including one of the highest life expectancy \n     levels in Asia, maternal and infant mortality rates \n     comparable to those of western countries, the eradication of \n     the infectious diseases of cholera, smallpox, and the plague, \n     and being the first Asian nation to eradicate polio and the \n     first country in the world to provide children with free \n     hepatitis B vaccinations; and\n       Whereas, the United States Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention and its Taiwanese counterpart have enjoyed close \n     collaboration on a wide range of public health issues; and\n       Whereas, in recent years Taiwan has expressed a willingness \n     to financially and technically assist the international aid \n     and health activities supported by the World Health \n     Organization; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's population of 23 million people is larger \n     than that of 75% of the World Health Organization member \n     states; and\n\n[[Page S8682]]\n\n       Whereas, the United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy \n     Review, declared its intention to support Taiwan's \n     participation in appropriate international organizations; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's participation in the activities of the \n     World Health Organization could bring many benefits to the \n     state of health not only in Taiwan but also regionally and \n     globally: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the 142nd \n     General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the Senate thereof \n     concurring therein, That the Congress and the President of \n     the United States are respectfully requested and urged to \n     strengthen trade relations with the Republic of China on \n     Taiwan (Taiwan) and to support the participation of Taiwan in \n     the United Nations; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly strongly urges the \n     pursuit of a policy that includes an initiative directed at \n     the World Trade Organization to give Taiwan appropriate and \n     meaningful participation in the activities of the World Trade \n     Organization in a manner that is consistent with the \n     organization's requirements; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Congress and the President of the United \n     States are respectfully requested and urged to support a free \n     trade agreement between the United States and Taiwan;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to the approval process necessary for foreign \n     teachers to teach in the state's French immersion program; to \n     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 23\n\n       Whereas, the French immersion program is the state's best \n     hope for preserving the historic linguistic and cultural \n     origins represented by the French language in Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, the French immersion program can improve critical \n     and creative thinking skills, encourage independent and self-\n     disciplined learning, enhance skills in listening and \n     concentration, boost self-esteem, create a lifelong ability \n     to communicate with French speakers around the globe, and \n     increase opportunity for future employment, and beyond the \n     acquisition of a second language, French immersion achieves \n     the goals of cultural appreciation, respect, and mutual \n     understanding; and\n       Whereas, the recruitment of teachers in the French \n     immersion program is becoming increasingly challenging, and \n     the number of existing teachers is dwindling at an alarming \n     rate as well; and\n       Whereas, the looming teacher shortage is a constant concern \n     for the French immersion program, and the recruitment and \n     retainment of an adequate number of qualified French teachers \n     is the key to the continuation of the French immersion \n     program in Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, the number of foreign teachers available to teach \n     in the French immersion program in Louisiana is being \n     diminished by immigration regulations and complications; and\n       Whereas, it is urgent that congress devote immediate \n     attention to expediting the approval process required for \n     foreign teachers to gain whatever eligibility is necessary so \n     that the French immersion program will be suitably staffed to \n     meet the needs of the student population and ultimately \n     because the program must have such teachers if it is to \n     survive; and\n       Whereas, French immersion reflects Louisiana's heritage and \n     benefits every student who takes part in the program, and no \n     child who desires participation should be denied the \n     satisfaction and pride derived from becoming bilingual in the \n     French language due to the emerging shortage of foreign \n     French teachers: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take appropriate \n     action to expedite the approval process necessary for foreign \n     teachers to teach in the state's French immersion program; be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a suitable copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the president of the United States Senate, \n     and to each member of Louisiana's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-504.

Jenkins (495 U.S. 33), chose to ignore Article I, \n     Section 8, of the Constitution of the United States, which \n     reserves exclusively to the legislative branch of government \n     the authority to tax the citizenry; and\n       Whereas, this ruling has set a disastrous example of \n     allowing federal judges to order or instruct a state, or a \n     political subdivision thereof, or an official of a state or \n     political subdivision, to levy or increase taxes--overturning \n     more than 200 years of judicial non-intrusion into the \n     political thicket of prescribing the level of taxation to be \n     foisted upon Americans; and\n       Whereas, in blistering dissenting remarks, Associate \n     Justice Anthony Kennedy joined by Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist and Associate Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and \n     Antonin Scalia pointed out that the Missouri v. Jenkins \n     decision transgresses the basic principles which define the \n     role of judges by endorsing ``. . . an expansion of power in \n     the Federal Judiciary beyond all precedent. Today's casual \n     embrace of taxation imposed by the unelected, life-tenured \n     Federal Judiciary disregards fundamental precepts for the \n     democratic control of public institutions''; and\n       Whereas, Thomas Jefferson, that great native son of \n     Virginia, forewarned of the threat that out-of-control \n     federal courts would pose when he proclaimed, in an 1820 \n     letter to Thomas Ritchie, that ``A judiciary independent . . \n     . of the will of the nation is a solecism . . .,'' and in \n     colorful language he went on to describe the judicial branch \n     as ``. . . a subtle corps of sappers and miners constantly \n     working underground to undermine the foundations of our \n     confederated fabric. They are construing our constitution \n     from a co-ordination of a general and special government to a \n     general and supreme one alone. This will lay all things at \n     their feet . . .,'' and in an 1821 letter to Judge Spencer \n     Roane, Jefferson pointedly asserted that ``The great object \n     of my fear is the Federal Judiciary. That body, like gravity, \n     ever acting with noiseless foot and unalarming advance, \n     gaining ground step by step and holding what it gains, is \n     engulfing insidiously the special governments into the jaws \n     of that which feeds them''; and\n       Whereas, in The Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton \n     cautioned that ``The courts must declare the sense of the \n     law; and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead \n     of judgment, the consequence would equally be the \n     substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative \n     body''; and\n       Whereas, the prevailing line of reasoning among those of us \n     in the ``Old Dominion'' on the subject of taxation--without \n     representation--finds situs as early as December 18, 1764, \n     when what was then called Virginia's House of Burgesses \n     remonstrated to the British House of Commons that ``. . . it \n     is essential to . . . liberty that . . . imposing taxes on \n     the people ought not to be made without the consent of \n     representatives chosen by themselves; who, at the same time \n     that they are acquainted with the circumstances of their \n     constituents, sustain a proportion of the burden laid on \n     them''; and\n       Whereas, in his 1748 epic work, The Spirit of the Laws, the \n     renowned political analyst Charles de Secondat Baron de \n     Montesquieu prophesied that ``. . . there is no liberty, if \n     the power of judging be not separated from the legislative \n     and executive powers. Were it joined with the legislative, \n     the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to \n     arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the \n     legislator''; and\n       Whereas, James Madison, that noble Virginian--and later \n     fourth President of the United States--opined in The \n     Federalist No. 47 that ``. . . the preservation of liberty \n     requires that the three great departments of powers \n     [executive, judicial and legislative] should be separate and \n     distinct''; and\n       Whereas, lawmakers in the 24 states of Alabama, Alaska, \n     Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, \n     Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New \n     York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, \n     South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and \n     Wyoming, as well as in the two United States territories. of \n     Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, \n     have petitioned the Congress of the United States to propose \n     for ratification an amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States to reverse the calamitous and ill-conceived \n     1990 holding in Missouri v. Jenkins; and\n       Whereas, Alexander Hamilton, in The Federalist No. 85, \n     predicted that there indeed would be times when Americans \n     would come to ``. . . rely on the disposition of the state \n     legislatures to erect barriers against the encroachments of \n     the national authority'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, That the Congress of \n     the United States be urged to propose for ratification an \n     amendment to, the Constitution of the United States to \n     prohibit federal courts from ordering or instructing any \n     state or local unit of government to levy or increase taxes, \n     the amendment to read as follows:\n       ``Amendment XXVIII\n       ``Section 1.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to a constitutional \n     amendment regarding marriage; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n       Whereas, marriage is a unique cornerstone of the family, \n     which is the foundation of human society; and\n       Whereas, only marriage between one man and one woman has \n     been permitted or recognized historically throughout the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, history has shown marriage between a man and a \n     woman to be the best context for the reproduction of the \n     human race and for raising children to be responsible adults; \n     and\n       Whereas, marriage provides lower risk of infant mortality, \n     better physical health for the children and has numerous \n     health benefits for the father and mother; and\n       Whereas, religious and civil laws have granted marriage \n     special recognition, benefits, responsibilities and legal \n     protections since at least the beginning of recorded history; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth accords marriage more \n     responsibilities and legal protections than other \n     partnerships of unrelated individuals; and\n       Whereas, the Full Faith and Credit Clause in the United \n     States Constitution provides that states must recognize the \n     laws and judicial acts of every other state in the Union; and\n       Whereas, in 1996 Congress enacted the Defense of Marriage \n     Act to exempt states from being required to afford full faith \n     and credit to laws recognizing marriages between persons of \n     the same sex; and\n       Whereas, in light of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of \n     the United States Constitution, there is significant risk \n     that the federal courts may hold the 1996 federal Defense of \n     Marriage Act unconstitutional; and\n       Whereas, 37 states, including the Commonwealth, have \n     enacted laws, commonly known as Defense of Marriage Acts, \n     that ban same-sex marriages; and\n       Whereas, the unique legal status of marriage in the \n     Commonwealth is in danger from constitutional challenges to \n     these state marriage laws and the federal Defense of Marriage \n     Act, which may succeed in light of the recent decisions on \n     equal protection from the United States Supreme Court; and\n       Whereas, challenges to state laws have been successfully \n     brought in Hawaii, Alaska, Vermont, and most recently in \n     Massachusetts on the grounds.that the legislature does not \n     have the right to deny the benefits of marriage to same-sex \n     couples and the state must guarantee the same protections and \n     benefits to same-sex couples as it does to opposite-sex \n     couples absent a constitutional amendment; and\n       Whereas, the Vermont legislature chose to preserve marriage \n     as the ``legally recognized union of one man and one woman,'' \n     but at the same time enacted a dual system of ``civil \n     unions'' for same-sex couples that goes beyond existing \n     ``domestic partnership'' and ``reciprocal beneficiaries'' \n     laws that exist in California and Hawaii and in many \n     localities in the United States today; and\n       Whereas, the Massachusetts ruling, by declaring that civil \n     marriage means ``the voluntary union of two persons as \n     spouses to the exclusions of all others,'' represents the \n     most far-reaching decision in its erosion of the states' \n     right to define marriage; and\n       Whereas, the Massachusetts court has given the \n     Massachusetts legislature 180 days to comply with the court's \n     ruling, which is not sufficient time for the state to adopt a \n     constitutional amendment to overturn the decision; and\n       Whereas, in light of the Massachusetts decision, many \n     states are scrambling to determine what actions are needed to \n     protect their state's Defense of Marriage Act from future \n     court challenges; and\n       Whereas, H. J. Res. 56, 108th Cong. and S.J. Res. 26, 108th \n     Cong. proposed an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States to declare that ``marriage in the United States shall \n     consist only of the union of a man and a woman''; and\n       Whereas, a federal constitutional amendment is the only way \n     to protect the institution of marriage and resolve the \n     controversy created by these recent decisions by returning \n     the issue to its proper forum in the state legislatures: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to propose a \n     constitutional amendment to protect the fundamental \n     institution of marriage as a union between a man and a woman; \n     and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Congress of the United States be \n     urged to initiate an amendment . . .\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-511.

That the Congress of the United States propose to the \n     people an amendment to the Constitution of the United States \n     that provides rights to crime victims and that embodies the \n     following principles:\n       (a) The right to be informed of and not excluded from any \n     public proceedings relating to the crime.\n       (b) The right to be heard regarding any release from \n     custody.\n       (c) The right to consideration for the safety of the \n     victim, the victim's interest in avoiding unreasonable delay \n     and the victim's interest in restitution.\n       (d) The right to be heard regarding any negotiated plea or \n     sentence.\n       (e) The right to receive notice of release or escape.\n       2. That any amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States to establish rights for crime victims grant standing \n     to victims of crime to assert all rights established by the \n     Constitution.\n       3. That any amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States to establish rights for crime victims should clearly \n     state that the powers of the states to provide victims' \n     rights in criminal proceedings, including the right to define \n     and enforce such rights, shall not be restricted or \n     diminished by the Congress or the federal courts of the \n     United States.\n\n[[Page S8685]]\n\n       4.

Clinton proclaimed October \n     20, 1996, as a day honoring the Filipino Veterans of World \n     War II, recalling the courage, sacrifice, and loyalty of \n     Filipino veterans of World War II in defense of democracy and \n     liberty; and\n       Whereas, for decades after their heroic service under the \n     command of their leaders and General Douglas MacArthur, these \n     men and women of Filipino-American national heritage were \n     denied the benefits and privileges provided to their American \n     compatriots who fought side-by-side with them; and\n       Whereas, the Rescission Act of 1946 withdrew the U.S. \n     veteran's status of Filipino World War II soldiers, thereby \n     denying them the benefits and compensation received by their \n     American counterparts and soldiers of more than sixty-six \n     other U.S. allied countries, who were similarly inducted into \n     the U.S. military; and\n       Whereas, the Rescission Act discriminated against \n     Filipinos, making them the only national group singled out \n     for denial of full U.S. veterans status and benefits; and\n       Whereas, the passage of S. 68, now pending in the United \n     States Senate, would extend full and equitable benefits, \n     particularly health benefits, to Filipino veterans, \n     considering their advanced age and poor health; and\n       Whereas, S. 68 proposes to amend Title 38 of the United \n     States Code, to improve benefits for Filipino veterans of \n     World War II and for the surviving spouses of those veterans; \n     and\n       Whereas, S. 68 would increase the rate of payment of \n     compensation benefits to certain Filipino veterans, \n     designated in Title 38 United States Code section 107(b) and \n     referred to as New Philippine Scouts, who reside in the \n     United States and are United States citizens or lawful \n     permanent resident aliens; and\n       Whereas, S. 68 would further increase the rate of payment \n     of dependency and indemnity compensation of surviving spouses \n     of certain Filipino veterans; and\n       Whereas, S. 68 would further make eligible for full \n     disability pensions certain Filipino veterans who reside in \n     the United States and are United States citizens or lawful \n     permanent resident aliens; and\n       Whereas, S. 68 would further mandate the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs to provide hospital and nursing home care \n     and medical services for service-connected disabilities for \n     any Filipino World War II veteran who resides in the United \n     States and is a United States citizen or lawful permanent \n     resident alien; and\n       Whereas, S. 68 would further require the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs to furnish care and services to all Filipino \n     World War II veterans for service-connected disabilities and \n     nonservice-connected disabilities residing in the Republic of \n     the Philippines on an outpatient basis at the Manila VA \n     Outpatient Clinic: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-Second Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2004, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the United States Congress \n     is respectfully urged to support the passage of S. 68 to \n     improve benefits for certain Filipino veterans of World War \n     II; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the members of the Hawaii Congressional \n     delegation, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-514. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to President George W. Bush's \n     plans to reduce veterans' benefits; to the Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 126\n\n       Whereas, members of the armed forces faithfully and \n     diligently serve the people of the United States and have \n     fought and died in numerous wars and conflicts around the \n     globe to protect the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and \n     the pursuit of happiness for all Americans; and\n       Whereas, numerous individuals devoted the prime of their \n     lives to defend the United States, often putting careers on \n     hold, delaying their college education, and leaving families \n     behind, without hesitation, asking for nothing but respect in \n     return; and\n       Whereas, these heroic individuals faced adversity which \n     most citizens will never be able to comprehend, often giving \n     their lives for their fellow citizens; and\n       Whereas, a large number of veterans have been severely \n     injured and disabled in the performance of their duties, \n     often resulting in financial hardship; and\n       Whereas, citing a tight budget and overwhelming demand for \n     services after opening their medical facilities to all \n     veterans in 1998, the Veterans Affairs Department (VA) began \n     efforts to halt enrolling new veterans into its health care \n     system; and\n       Whereas, a memo from the VA in July 2002, stated that \n     marketing veterans health care services at health fairs, open \n     houses, and veterans meetings was inappropriate and banned \n     newspaper ads and mailings encouraging veterans to enroll in \n     the veterans health plan; and\n       Whereas, this memo was sent out at a time when \n     approximately 300,000 veterans had been waiting for more than \n     six months for an appointment at a VA medical facility, some \n     waiting as long as two years for services; and\n       Whereas, Rep. Ted Strickland (D-OH) filed a lawsuit against \n     the VA stating that the VA has a congressional mandate that \n     requires the VA to perform outreach services and that the \n     VA's failure to publicize information about health care \n     benefits and veterans' services for veterans and their \n     families is a violation of this mandate; and\n       Whereas, although Congress is currently considering a bill \n     to allocate funding to the VA in the sum of $28.6 billion for \n     the current fiscal year, this funding level is still not \n     enough to help alleviate many of the medical plights facing \n     our brave American service men and women; and\n       Whereas, a number of veterans groups have criticized the \n     President's budget submission for fiscal year 2005 as \n     containing, ``few legislative recommendations to improve, \n     expand, or add new benefits for veterans,'' and that ``along \n     with gross funding deficiencies in practically every VA \n     account, VA construction is to be dramatically and most \n     detrimentally shortchanged as well''; and\n       Whereas, these groups have also criticized the Bush \n     administration's shortcomings in proposals with respect to \n     the provision of benefits to veterans such as:\n       (1) Developing a mechanism that greatly reduces government \n     obligations to compensate disabled veterans for service-\n     incurred disabilities such as alcoholism and drug abuse;\n       (2) Asking Congress to enact legislation to deny \n     compensation to a group of disabled veterans who suffer \n     greatly from their service-connected disabilities because \n     these disabilities were obtained during periods of non-combat \n     such as during meal periods;\n       (3) Proposing legislation to limit veterans to a one-time \n     home loan guaranty;\n       (4) Recommending a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for \n     compensation based on a projected 1.3 percent increase in \n     COLA and\n\n[[Page S8686]]\n\n     continuing the practice of rounding down COLA to the nearest \n     whole dollar which, when done for many years in succession, \n     will have a compounding effect in substantially eroding the \n     value of the already modest rates of compensation; and\n       (5) Continuing to place restrictions on receiving both \n     military retirement and veterans affairs disability benefits \n     for certain veterans; and\n       Whereas, this lack of support for those individuals who \n     sacrificed so much for the freedoms the citizens of the \n     United States all enjoy today is shameful and should be \n     looked at as a disgrace by all citizens: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-second Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2004, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That this body expresses its \n     utmost disappointment in the lack of support the current \n     administration has shown toward veterans of our armed forces; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is urged to increase funding for \n     the continuation and expansion of veterans benefits and \n     services; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     and Hawaii's Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-515.

A bill to provide for the acquisition of land for \nadministrative and visitor facilities for Death Valley National Park, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Death Valley \nNational Park Administrative and Visitor Facilities Act of 2004.\n  This is a simple common sense bill. It allows the Death Valley \nNational Park to accept a donation of about 15 acres of land and \nbuildings near Beatty, NV.\n  This small parcel of land and the buildings on it will be used by the \npark as a maintenance and administrative station. These facilities are \nneeded to consolidate and improve maintenance operations and other \nadministrative functions of the park.\n  The station would be donated by the Barrick Gold Corporation to the \nPark Service at no cost and is superior to the Park Service's current \nfacilities in the area. This is an easy way for us to improve \nmaintenance and administrative functions at Death Valley National park \nat absolutely no cost to the government. This legislation has long been \nadvocated by Nye County and would benefit the nearby community of \nBeatty, NV.\n  The current owners have already completed a Phase One Environmental \nAssessment that concluded there were no ``hazardous substances'' or \n``pollutant or contaminants'' associated with the land parcels or the \nstructures. We should take advantage of this opportunity to improve \npark operations while we can.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation as an easy, \nefficient way to improve one of America's great national parks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2716\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Death Valley National Park \n     Administrative and Visitor Facilities Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Park.--The term ``Park'' means the Death Valley \n     National Park.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for programs and activities with respect \nto the prevention of underage drinking; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my good friend \nand colleague Senator Dodd, to introduce the Sober Truth on Preventing \nUnderage Drinking Act--also known as the STOP Underage Drinking Act. I \nthank Senator Dodd for his commitment to this issue, as well as our \ncolleagues on the House side--Representatives Roybal-Allard, Wolf, \nOsborne, DeLauro, and Wamp for working so diligently with us over the \npast few months on this bill. It is a good bill--a carefully crafted, \nbipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation.\n  As we discussed at the HELP Subcommittee hearing I chaired in \nSeptember on underage drinking, it is well known that underage drinking \nis a significant problem for youth in this country. We've known that \nfor a very long time.\n  We know that underage drinking often contributes to the four leading \ncauses of deaths among 15 to 20 year olds--that 69 percent of youths \nwho died in alcohol-related traffic fatalities in the year 2000 \ninvolved young drinking drivers--that in 1999, nearly 40 percent of \npeople under the age of 21 who were victims of drownings, burns, and \nfalls tested positive for alcohol.\n  We've known that alcohol has been reported to be involved in 36 \npercent of homicides, 12 percent of male suicides, and 8 percent of \nfemale suicides involving people under 21.\n  How did we get here, how did our Nation reach this point--a point \nwhere today, 12 percent of eighth graders--13 and 14 year olds--binge \ndrink? Add to that, the 22 percent of tenth graders--15 and 16 year \nolds--who binge drink. The National Institute of Drug Abuse also \nreported that 95 percent of 12th graders perceive alcohol as readily \navailable to them. Tragically, most children and young adults that \ndrink underage obtain the alcohol from their parents or another adult.\n  These statistics are frightening. Too many American kids are drinking \nregularly, and they are drinking in quantities that can be of great, \nlong-term harm to themselves. Again I ask--how did we get here? As a \nNation, we clearly haven't done enough to address this problem. We \nhaven't done  enough to acknowledge how prevalent and widespread \nteenage drinking is in this country. We haven't done enough to let \nparents know that they, too, are a part of this problem and can be a \npart of the solution.\n\n   We talk about drugs and the dangers of drug use, as we should, but \nthe reality is that we, as a society, have become complacent about the \nproblem of underage drinking. This has to change. The culture has to \nchange.\n   The Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act, or STOP \nUnderage Drinking Act, has four major areas of Policy development: \nFirst, there is a Federal coordination and reporting provision. This \ntitle would create an Interagency Coordinating Committee to coordinate \nthe efforts and expertise of various Federal agencies to combat \nunderage drinking. It would be chaired by the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services and would include other agencies and departments, such \nas the Department of Education, the Office of Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention, and the Federal Trade Commission. This title \nalso would mandate an annual report to Congress from the Interagency \nCommittee on their efforts to combat underage drinking, as well as an \nannual report card on State efforts to combat the problem. Two million \ndollars, annually, would be appropriated under this section.\n   Second, the bill contains an authorization for the a national media \ncampaign against underage drinking. This title would provide $1 million \nannually to authorize a national media campaign for which the Ad \nCouncil received $800,000 last year to begin implementation. It would \ncontinue funding for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.\n   Third, the bill would support new intervention programs to prevent \nunderage drinking. This section of the bill would provide $5 million \nfor enhancement grants to the Drug Free Communities program to be \ndirected at the problem of underage drinking. This title also would \ncreate a new program which would provide competitive grants to States, \nnon-profit entities, and institutions of higher education to create \nState-wide coalitions to prevent underage drinking. This program would \nbe funded at $5 million.\n   Finally, our bill contains a section devoted to research. This title \nwould provide $6 million for increased Federal research and data \ncollection on underage drinking, including reporting on the types and \nbrands of alcohol that kids use and the short-term and long-term \nimpacts of underage drinking upon adolescent brain development.\n\n  Again, I thank Senator Dodd for working with me on this issue here in \nthe Senate, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues \nin the House and Senate to pass this very important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2718\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Sober \n     Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act'', or the ``STOP \n     Underage Drinking Act''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1.

Authorization of appropriations\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Drinking alcohol under the age of 21 is illegal in each \n     of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Enforcement of \n     current laws and regulations in States and communities, such \n     as minimum age drinking laws, zero tolerance laws, and laws \n     and regulations which restrict availability of alcohol, must \n     supplement other efforts to reduce underage drinking.\n       (2) Data collected annually by the Department of Health and \n     Human Services shows that alcohol is the most heavily used \n     drug by children in the United States, and that--\n       (A) more youths consume alcoholic beverages than use \n     tobacco products or illegal drugs;\n       (B) by the end of the eighth grade, 45.6 percent of \n     children have engaged in alcohol use, and by the end of high \n     school, 76.6 percent have done so; and\n       (C) the annual societal cost of underage drinking is \n     estimated at $53 to $58 billion.\n       (3) Data collected by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services and the Department of Transportation indicate that \n     alcohol use by youth has many negative consequences, such as \n     immediate risk from acute impairment; traffic fatalities; \n     violence; suicide; and unprotected sex.\n\n[[Page S8693]]\n\n       (4) Research confirms that the harm caused by underage \n     drinking lasts beyond the underage years. Compared to persons \n     who wait until age 21 or older to start drinking, those who \n     start to drink before age 14 are, as adults, four times more \n     likely to become alcohol dependent; seven times more likely \n     to be in a motor vehicle crash because of drinking; and more \n     likely to suffer mental and physical damage from alcohol \n     abuse.\n       (5) Alcohol abuse creates long-term risk developmentally \n     and is associated with negative physical impacts on the \n     brain.\n       (6) Research indicates that adults greatly underestimate \n     the extent of alcohol use by youths, its negative \n     consequences, and its use by their own children. The IOM \n     report concluded that underage drinking cannot be \n     successfully addressed by focusing on youth alone. \n     Ultimately, adults are responsible for young people obtaining \n     alcohol by selling, providing, or otherwise making it \n     available to them. Parents are the most important channel of \n     influence on their children's underage drinking, according to \n     the IOM report, which also recommends a national adult-\n     oriented media campaign.\n       (7) Research shows that public service health messages, in \n     combination with community-based efforts, can reduce health-\n     damaging behavior. The Department of Health and Human \n     Services and the Ad Council have undertaken a public health \n     campaign targeted at parents to combat underage alcohol \n     consumption. The Ad Council estimates that, for a typical \n     public health campaign, it receives an average of $28 million \n     per year in free media through its 28,000 media outlets \n     nationwide.\n       (8) A significant percentage of the total alcohol \n     consumption in the United States each year is by underage \n     youth. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration reports that the percentage is over 11 \n     percent.\n       (9) Youth are exposed to a significant amount of alcohol \n     advertising through a variety of media. Some studies indicate \n     that youth awareness of alcohol advertising correlates to \n     their drinking behavior and beliefs.\n       (10) According to the Center on Alcohol Marketing and \n     Youth, in 2002, the alcoholic beverage industry spent $990.2 \n     million on product advertising on television, and $10 million \n     on television advertising designed to promote the responsible \n     use of alcohol. For every one television ad discouraging \n     underage alcohol use, there were 609 product ads.\n       (11) Alcohol use occurs in 76 percent of movies rated G or \n     PG and 97 percent of movies rated PG-13. The Federal Trade \n     Commission has recommended restricting paid alcohol beverage \n     promotional placements to films rated R or NC-17.\n       (12) Youth spend 9 to 11 hours per week listening to music, \n     and 17 percent of all lyrics contain alcohol references; 30 \n     percent of those songs include brand-name mentions.\n       (13) Studies show that adolescents watch 20 to 27 hours of \n     television each week, and 71 percent of prime-time television \n     episodes depict alcohol use and 77 percent contain some \n     reference to alcohol.\n       (14) College and university presidents have cited alcohol \n     abuse as the number one health problem on college and \n     university campuses.\n       (15) According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse \n     and Alcoholism, two of five college students are binge \n     drinkers; 1,400 college students die each year from alcohol-\n     related injuries, a majority of which involve motor vehicle \n     crashes; more than 70,000 students are victims of alcohol-\n     related sexual assault; and 500,000 students are injured \n     under the influence of alcohol each year.\n       (16) According to the Center on Alcohol Marketing and \n     Youth, in 2002, alcohol producers spent a total of $58 \n     million to place 6,251 commercials in college sports \n     programs, and spent $27.7 million advertising during the NCAA \n     men's basketball tournament, which had as many alcohol ads \n     (939) as the Super Bowl, World Series, College Bowl Games and \n     the National Football League's Monday Night Football \n     broadcasts combined (925).\n       (17) The IOM report recommended that colleges and \n     universities ban alcohol advertising and promotion on campus \n     in order to demonstrate their commitment to discouraging \n     alcohol use among underage students.\n       (18) According to the Government Accountability Office \n     (``GAO''), the Federal Government spends $1.8 billion \n     annually to combat youth drug use and $71 million to prevent \n     underage alcohol use.\n       (19) The GAO concluded that there is a lack of reporting \n     about how these funds are specifically expended, inadequate \n     collaboration among the agencies, and no central coordinating \n     group or office to oversee how the funds are expended or to \n     determine the effectiveness of these efforts.\n       (20) There are at least three major, annual, government \n     funded national surveys in the United States that include \n     underage drinking data: the National Household Survey on Drug \n     Use and Health, Monitoring the Future, and the Youth Risk \n     Behavior Survey. These surveys do not use common indicators \n     to allow for direct comparison of youth alcohol consumption \n     patterns. Analyses of recent years' data do, however, show \n     similar results.\n       (21) Research shows that school-based and community-based \n     interventions can reduce underage drinking and associated \n     problems, and that positive outcomes can be achieved by \n     combining environmental and institutional change with theory-\n     based health education--a comprehensive, community-based \n     approach.\n       (22) Studies show that a minority of youth who need \n     treatment for their alcohol problems receive such services. \n     Further, insufficient information exists to properly assist \n     clinicians and other providers in their youth treatment \n     efforts.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) The term ``binge drinking'' means a pattern of drinking \n     alcohol that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 \n     gm percent or above. For the typical adult, this pattern \n     corresponds to consuming 5 or more drinks (male), or 4 or \n     more drinks (female), in about 2 hours.\n       (2) The term ``heavy drinking'' means five or more drinks \n     on the same occasion in the past 30 days.\n       (3) The term ``frequent heavy drinking'' means five or more \n     drinks on at least five occasions in the last 30 days.\n       (4) The term ``alcoholic beverage industry'' means the \n     brewers, vintners, distillers, importers, distributors, and \n     retail outlets that sell and serve beer, wine, and distilled \n     spirits.\n       (5) The term ``school-based prevention'' means programs, \n     which are institutionalized, and run by staff members or \n     school-designated persons or organizations in every grade of \n     school, kindergarten through 12th grade.\n       (6) The term ``youth'' means persons under the age of 21.\n       (7) The term ``IOM report'' means the report released in \n     September 2003 by the National Research Council, Institute of \n     Medicine, and entitled ``Reducing Underage Drinking: A \n     Collective Responsibility''.\n\n                       TITLE I--SENSE OF CONGRESS\n\n     SEC. 101. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that:\n       (1) A multi-faceted effort is needed to more successfully \n     address the problem of underage drinking in the United \n     States. A coordinated approach to prevention, intervention, \n     treatment, and research is key to making progress. This Act \n     recognizes the need for a focused national effort, and \n     addresses particulars of the Federal portion of that effort.\n       (2) States and communities, including colleges and \n     universities, are encouraged to adopt comprehensive \n     prevention approaches, including--\n       (A) evidence-based screening, programs and curricula;\n       (B) brief intervention strategies;\n       (C) consistent policy enforcement; and\n       (D) environmental changes that limit underage access to \n     alcohol.\n       (3) Public health and consumer groups have played an \n     important role in drawing the Nation's attention to the \n     health crisis of underage drinking. Working at the Federal, \n     State, and community levels, and motivated by grass-roots \n     support, they have initiated effective prevention programs \n     that have made significant progress in the battle against \n     underage drinking.\n       (4) The alcohol beverage industry has developed and paid \n     for national education and awareness messages on illegal \n     underage drinking directed to parents as well as consumers \n     generally. According to the industry, it has also supported \n     the training of more than 1.6 million retail employees, \n     community-based prevention programs, point of sale education, \n     and enforcement programs. All of these efforts are aimed at \n     further reducing illegal underage drinking and preventing \n     sales of alcohol to persons under the age of 21. All sectors \n     of the alcohol beverage industry have also voluntarily \n     committed to placing advertisements in broadcast and \n     magazines where at least 70 percent of the audiences are \n     expected to be 21 years of age or older. The industry should \n     continue to monitor and tailor its advertising practices to \n     further limit underage exposure, including the use of \n     independent third party review. The industry should continue \n     and expand evidence-based efforts to prevent underage \n     drinking.\n       (5) Public health and consumer groups, in collaboration \n     with the alcohol beverage industry, should explore \n     opportunities to reduce underage drinking.\n       (6) The entertainment industries have a powerful impact on \n     youth, and they should use rating systems and marketing codes \n     to reduce the likelihood that underage audiences will be \n     exposed to movies, recordings, or television programs with \n     unsuitable alcohol content, even if adults are expected to \n     predominate in the viewing or listening audiences.\n       (7) Objective scientific evidence and data should be \n     generated and made available to the general public and policy \n     makers at the local, state, and national levels to help them \n     make informed decisions, implement judicious policies, and \n     monitor progress in preventing childhood/adolescent alcohol \n     use.\n       (8) The National Collegiate Athletic Association, its \n     member colleges and universities, and athletic conferences \n     should affirm a commitment to a policy of discouraging \n     alcohol use among underage students and other young fans by \n     ending all alcohol advertising during radio and television \n     broadcasts of collegiate sporting events.\n\n    TITLE II--INTERAGENCY COORDINATING COMMITTEE; ANNUAL REPORT CARD\n\n     SEC. 201.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out \n     section 501 $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and such sums as \n     may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2006 through \n     2009.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Mike \nDeWine, to introduce legislation designed to prevent our nation's \nchildren and youth from succumbing to the dangers associated with \nunderage alcohol use. The legislation that we introduce today, the STOP \n(Sober Truth On Preventing) Underage Drinking Act, will greatly \nstrengthen our Nation's ability to combat the too often deadly \nconsequences associated with underage drinking.\n  An initial examination of the problems presented by underage drinking \nis truly alarming. Alcohol is the most commonly used drug among \nAmerica's youth. More young people drink alcohol than smoke tobacco or \nuse marijuana combined. In 2002, 20 percent of eighth graders had drunk \nalcohol in the previous 30 days. Forty-nine percent of high school \nseniors are drinkers, and 29 percent report having had five or more \ndrinks in a row, or binged in the past 2 weeks.\n  Tragically, we know that this year underage drinking will directly \nlead to more than 3,500 deaths, more than two million injuries, 1,200 \nbabies born with fetal alcohol syndrome and more than 50,000 youths \ntreated for alcohol dependence. We also know that the social costs \nassociated with underage drinking total close to $53 billion annually, \nincluding $19 billion from automobile accidents and $29 billion from \nassociated violent crime.\n  And while no one can argue with the tragic loss of life and \nsignificant financial costs associated with underage drinking, too few \nof us think of the equally devastating loss of potential that occurs \nwhen our children begin to drink. Research indicates that children who \nbegin drinking do so at only 12 years of age. We also know that \nchildren that begin drinking at such an early age develop a \npredisposition for alcohol dependence later in life. Such early \nexperimentation can have devastating consequences and derail a child's \npotential just as she or he is starting out on the path to adulthood. \nThe consumption of alcohol by our children can literally rob them of \ntheir future.\n  The truly alarming and devastating effects of underage alcohol use \nare what initially led Senator DeWine and I to begin work to address \nthis important issue. Over the last few months we have worked \nextensively with Representatives Roybal-Allard, Wolf, DeLauro, Osbourne \nand Wamp to craft the broad legislative initiative that we introduce \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S8696]]\n\n  The STOP Underage Drinking Act creates the framework for a \nmultifaceted, comprehensive national campaign to prevent underage \ndrinking. Specifically, the legislation includes four major areas of \npolicy development. First, the STOP Underage Drinking Act authorizes $2 \nmillion to establish an Interagency Coordinating Committee to \ncoordinate all Federal agency efforts and expertise designed to prevent \nunderage drinking. Chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, this committee will be required to report to the Congress on \nan annual basis the extent to which Federal efforts are addressing the \nurgent need to curb underage drinking.\n  I am particularly pleased that one of the many items in this annual \nreport to Congress will provide for the public health monitoring of the \namount of alcohol advertising reaching our children. I have become \nincreasingly concerned about the degree to which alcohol advertisements \nappear to target our Nation's children. It is my hope that the \nmonitoring called for by this legislation will expose any unethical \nadvertising practices that reach children. We must do all that we can \nto ensure that our children are not exposed to harmful and deceptive \nalcohol promotions.\n  In addition to the Federal coordination of Federal underage drinking \nprevention efforts, the STOP Underage Drinking Act additionally \nauthorizes $1 million to fund an adult-oriented National Media Campaign \nagainst Underage Drinking. Research indicates that most children who \ndrink obtain the alcohol from their parents or from other adults. The \nNational Media Campaign against underage drinking will specifically \nseek to educate those who provide our children with alcohol about the \ndangers inherent in underage alcohol use. This media campaign will \nbuild upon the valuable underage drinking prevention efforts begun last \nyear by the Ad Council, whose campaigns average an estimated $28 \nmillion in donated media from media outlets nationwide.\n  The legislation additionally authorizes $10 million to provide \nStates, not-for-profit groups and institutions of higher education the \nability to create statewide coalitions to prevent underage drinking and \nalcohol abuse by college and university students. This section will \nalso provide alcohol-specific enhancement grants through the Drug Free \nCommunities Program.\n  Lastly, the STOP Underage Drinking Act authorizes $6 million to \nexpand research to assess the health effects of underage drinking on \nadolescent development, including its effect on the brain. This effort \nwill additionally increase Federal data collection on underage \ndrinking, including reporting on the types and brands of alcohol that \nkids consume.\n  I want to convey my belief that this legislation truly offers a \nhistorical, first step toward addressing the national tragedy \nrepresented by underage drinking. I pledge to work strenuously toward \npassing the STOP Underage Drinking Act and building on its strong \nfoundation and I ask for the support of my colleagues for this \ncritically important initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 2719. A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to further improve the safety and health of working environments, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Safety Advancement \nfor Employees (SAFE) Act of 2004. Every worker in America deserves to \nreturn home safely at the end of the day. However, more than 5,500 \nworkers die while at work annually. This means that, on any given day, \n15 workers will not return home to their families. The fact that these \naccidents are occurring is not because employers don't care about \nworkplace safety. On the contrary, the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, or OSHA, estimated that 95 percent of employers are \nstriving to create a safer workplace. The vast majority of employers \nwant to comply with safety laws. Therefore, any effort to significantly \nimprove workplace safety by focusing solely on the small percentage of \nbad actors who willfully break the law is doomed to failure.\n  We don't need political rhetoric, we need workable solutions. As \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training, I felt \nresponsible for finding a solution that will succeed in protecting more \nworkers from harm. I feel a responsibility to every worker and every \nworker's family to do all I can to prevent workplace accidents and \ndeaths. The SAFE Act will provide the systematic safety improvements \nthat American workers and their families deserve. This legislation \nhelps the vast majority of good faith employers who want to achieve \ncompliance with safety laws. They just need help doing so--more help \nthan OSHA can currently give them. The SAFE Act also allows OSHA to \neffectively target the few bad actors who willfully place their \nemployees at risk. It also includes provisions to improve hazard \ncommunication and reduce injuries and illnesses caused by the presence \nof hazardous chemicals in the workplace.\n  The SAFE Act of 2004 will increase the maximum jail sentence for a \nwillful safety violation that results in a worker's death from 6 \nmonths, which is a misdemeanor, to 18 months, which is a felony. It \nwould be naive to believe that increasing the criminal penalty by \nitself will significantly improve workplace safety. Increasing the \nmaximum jail sentence for bad actors will do nothing to help improve \nthe workplace safety records of the 95 percent of employers who want to \ndo the right thing.\n  I want to prevent the accident in the first place, not just penalize \nthe employer for an injury or death that could have been avoided. By \nthen, it's too late for the victim and their family. We need a system \nthat encourages the good faith employers to find out how to achieve \nsafety voluntarily and without fear of retribution. We need a system \nthat harnesses the resources of safety experts so employers can achieve \ncompliance with safety laws. And, we need a system that can target and \npunish the few bad employers. This is the system promoted by the Safety \nAdvancement for Employees, or SAFE, Act. The SAFE Act will save \nworkers' lives.\n\n  The SAFE Act is a workable solution that will effectively add \nthousands of highly-trained safety and health professionals to the job \nof inspecting workplaces around the country. Why is enlisting third \nparty safety experts so critical to the effort of getting employers to \ncomply with safety laws? Because OSHA, the government agency \nresponsible for regulating safety laws, can't do it alone. OSHA should \nbe providing helpful assistance to the overwhelming number of employers \nwho are pursuing safer workplaces. Simultaneously, OSHA should be \ntargeting those employers who are willfully disregarding safety laws, \ninspecting them, penalizing them, and following up to make sure that \nbad practices are stopped before accidents occur.\n  It has been estimated that it would take OSHA over 167 years to \ninspect every work site in the country. Therefore, OSHA cannot \neffectively help those good faith employers or deter bad employers from \nbreaking the law. This is why the SAFE Act is so important. It will \nallow highly-trained safety and health professionals to reach work \nsites all over the country, where OSHA hasn't even been able to make a \ndent, encouraging employers to get into compliance voluntarily.\n  These highly-trained consultants will work with employers to get them \ninto compliance with safety laws. If the employer gets into compliance, \nthe employer can receive a certificate of compliance which will exempt \nhim from civil penalties only for one year. However, at all times and \nunder all circumstances, OSHA remains free to inspect these work sites.\n  The third-party consultation program is particularly important for \nsmall businesses. Employers have to read through and implement over a \nthousand pages of highly technical safety regulations. Too often, \nemployers are left on their own to try to understand and comply with \nall these regulations. It is hard enough for large employers who have \nan in-house staff of safety experts. For the small employer--whose \nsafety ``expert'' is also the human resources manager, accountant, and \nsystems administrator--the task is nearly impossible. We're talking \nabout employers who want to do the right thing, who want to comply with \nthe law and protect their workers. They just need help doing so--help \nthat OSHA is not currently equipped to provide.\n\n[[Page S8697]]\n\n  In a report published in March, 2004, the General Accounting Office \ncited the use of third party consultants among a list of \nrecommendations by researchers, safety and health practitioners, and \nspecialists, to achieve voluntary OSHA compliance. According to the GAO \nreport: ``Using Consultants could leverage existing OSHA resources by \nhelping workplaces that might never otherwise see an OSHA inspector, \nespecially small employers, and possibly also by enabling employers to \naddress additional safety and health issues that might not be covered \nunder an OSHA inspection for compliance standards.''\n  We need to leverage the resources of OSHA and the private sector to \nimprove occupational safety around the country--in large and small \nworkplaces alike.\n  Nowhere is the safety and health challenge more daunting for small \nbusinesses than it is in the area of hazard communication. Hazardous \nchemicals pervade the 21st Century workplace. An estimated 650,000 \nhazardous chemical products are used in over 3 million workplaces \nacross the country. Everyday, more than 30 million American workers \nwill be exposed to hazardous chemicals on the job. Whether or not they \nreturn home safely at the end of the day depends on their awareness of \nthese hazards and appropriate precautionary measures. Communication is \nthe key to protecting the safety and health of these 30 million \nworkers. However, the protection is only as effective as the \ncommunication.\n\n  Twenty years ago, OSHA adopted the Hazard Communication Standard. \nMaterial Safety Data Sheets are the cornerstone of hazard \ncommunication. The chemical manufacturer or importer evaluates the \nchemical and provides employers with information about its hazards and \nprotective measures on the Material Safety Data Sheet, which employers \nmust then provide to workers.\n  OSHA's rule provides a generic framework for hazard communication. \nWith over 650,000 chemicals in use, and tens of thousands of chemical \nmanufacturers, the clarity, format, and accuracy of Material Safety \nData Sheets varies widely. If the Material Safety Data Sheet is stuffed \nin some thick binder gathering dust, the worker doesn't have time to \nshuffle through the pages of complex, technical jargon it includes. \nWorkers shouldn't need a Ph.D. in biochemistry to know how to protect \nthemselves against hazardous chemicals.\n  Twenty years after the Hazard Communication standard was published, \nit's time for review. It's time to heed the call of workers and \nemployers alike for more clarity, consistency, accuracy, and guidance. \nOver the years, I've had the great fortune to work with Ron Hayes on \nimproving the safety and health of American workers. Ron wrote me a \nletter. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the \nRecord. He writes that: ``Other standards cover many issues for the \nworkers, but the Material Safety Data Sheet, paperwork is used millions \nof times each workday, and the accuracy of these sheets [is] of \nparamount importance for the complete protection of our most important \nresource, our great American workers.''\n  To improve the protection of our great American workers from \nhazardous chemicals, the new SAFE Act requires OSHA to develop and post \non its website model material safety data sheets for those highly \nhazardous chemicals listed on the Process Safety Management Standard. \nThese models will be particularly helpful to small businesses that \ndon't have the expertise to develop or decipher their own.\n  In the twenty years since the Hazard Communication Standard was \nadopted, the American workplace has changed dramatically. Electronic or \ninternet-based systems not envisioned twenty years ago can \nsignificantly improve hazard communication. The new SAFE Act recognizes \nthe promise of technology to improve hazard communication. The \nlegislation creates grants to develop, implement, or evaluate \nstrategies to improve hazard communication through the use of better \ntechnology.\n  In the past twenty years, our workforce has become increasingly \ndiverse. Effective hazard communication should reflect the fact that \nnumerous languages may be spoken at a single worksite. Our economy has \nalso become increasingly global. The chemical industry is one of the \nUnited States' largest exporting sectors. The manner in which other \ncountries regulate hazardous chemicals impacts an American \nmanufacturer's ability to compete in the global marketplace.\n  In 2002, the United Nations adopted the Globally Harmonized System \nfor Classification and Labeling of Chemicals. The Globally Harmonized \nSystem is designed to improve the quality of hazard communication by \nestablishing standardized requirements for hazard evaluation, safety \ndata sheets, and labels. The Globally Harmonized System has the \npotential to address significant concerns with current hazard \ncommunication. Whether the United States adopts it cannot be decided by \nOSHA alone. Other agencies involved in regulating hazardous chemicals \nmust be involved. Key stakeholders in hazard communication--chemical \nmanufacturers, employers, workers, and safety and health experts--must \nalso be involved. For this reason, the new SAFE Act establishes a \ncommission of relevant Federal agencies and stakeholders to study and \nmake recommendations to Congress about the adoption of the Globally \nHarmonized System.\n  The SAFE Act sets us firmly on the path towards achieving the goal of \nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act to ``assure so far as possible \nevery working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working \nconditions.'' Enforcement alone cannot ensure the safety and health of \nAmerica's workforce. Government and the private sector can--and must--\nwork together to create a culture where safety and health is the number \none priority.\n  I first introduced the SAFE Act in 1997. Today, the call for \nmeaningful OSHA reform through cooperative and proactive efforts is \neven louder. The more time that passes without taking such action, the \nmore injuries and deaths will occur that could otherwise be avoided. As \nI introduce the new SAFE Act today, I hope that we can again begin \nmeaningful discussions about what is involved in achieving safer \nworkplaces. I also hope that we can actually pass the SAFE Act and \nachieve greater safety and health for our most important resource--our \ngreat American worker.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill and letter were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2719\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Michael B. Enzi,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: Honorable Senators, staff and witnesses, \n     it is an honor for me to have a small part in this most \n     important hearing. I am very proud to have worked with you \n     great statesmen over the years to better safety and health \n     for our great American workers. Your work today in this \n     hearing could be the most important advancement of OSHA's \n     mission ever undertaken and more importantly provide \n     guidance, leadership and much needed closer oversight to a \n     slow moving, backward agency.\n       No other standard or regulation in OSHA's responsibility \n     covers or protects workers as much as the Hazard \n     Communication standard does and especially the MSDS section \n     of this standard. MSDS effects every worker everyday on every \n     job. Other standards cover many issues for the workers but \n     the MSDS paperwork is used millions of times each workday, \n     and the accuracy of these sheets or of paramount importance \n     for the complete protection of our most important resource \n     our great American workers.\n       These men and women work and toil everyday to bring a \n     better way of life for us all, they deserve to go home safe \n     and sound everyday, to have the opportunity to live a long \n     and happy life, free of injury and sickness. No one should \n     die, be hurt or made sick at work.\n       I can only pray that you will be so moved by God today, to \n     make the much needed changes to this problem and find new \n     ways to make sure all MSDS sheets are readable, \n     understandable and correct. Education and information is the \n     key, please help make the changes that will protect all of \n     our workers all the time.\n       Please forgive me for being absent today but I look forward \n     to working with you and this great committee in the future. I \n     know in my heart you will do the right thing today and am \n     confident new changes and new protection will come from this \n     hearing. God Bless and thank you for your courageous stand \n     for all American workers.\n           Yours,\n                                                        Ron Hayes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Hagel, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2720. A bill to provide assistance for the crisis in Sudan, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Comprehensive \nPeace in Sudan Act. This bill is intended to address both the immediate \ncrisis in the Darfur region of Sudan and to support a comprehensive \npeace in all of that country. It would authorize $300 million to \nrespond to the unfolding catastrophe in Darfur for the next fiscal year \nand to provide additional funds to begin reconstruction in Sudan upon \nthe conclusion of a viable, comprehensive peace.\n  Events in Darfur constitute a moral and humanitarian tragedy of \nincredible proportions. The people of the Darfur region of Sudan are \nexperiencing the full force of an ethnic cleansing campaign by the \nGovernment of Sudan. Numerous credible reports by U.S. and U.N. \nofficials indicate that the Sudanese Government has armed and employed \na militia of Arab Sudanese, called Janjaweed, to join it in a \ncoordinated effort to kill and rape Darfur inhabitants and \nsystematically destroy homes, villages, and all means of subsistence. \nThis campaign has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced 1.2 \nmillion African Sudanese of which 200,000 are now refugees in Chad. A \nsecond phase of this campaign may prove to have the most devastating \neffect through the onset of famine and disease--unless, the \ninternational community responds quickly.\n  The United Nations is meeting significant obstacles to providing \nlife-saving food, medicine, and shelter to the displaced Sudanese. The \nSudanese Government has established bureaucratic and administrative \nobstacles to the provision of assistance. In addition, the \ninternational community has not provided adequate resources given the \nmagnitude of the human suffering in Darfur. The United States has been \npressing for a more vigorous response to this humanitarian crisis. This \nbill would support diplomatic efforts already underway and ensure a \nsignificant flow of funding.\n  I am hopeful that Senators will join me in passing this bill quickly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2720\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Peace in Sudan \n     Act''.\n\n[[Page S8702]]\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) JEM.--The term ``JEM'' means the Justice and Equality \n     Movement.\n       (3) SPLM.--The term ``SPLM'' means the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement.\n       (4) SLA.--The term ``SLA'' means the Sudanese Liberation \n     Army.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan, as \n     envisioned in the Sudan Peace Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 note), and \n     in the Machakos Protocol of 2002, is in grave jeopardy.\n       (2) Since 1989, the Government of Sudan has repeatedly \n     engaged in and sponsored orchestrated campaigns of attacking \n     and dislocating targeted civilian populations, disrupting \n     their ability to sustain themselves, and subsequently \n     restricting assistance to those displaced in a coordinated \n     policy of ethnic cleansing and Arabization that is most \n     recently evident in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n       (3) In response to 2 decades of civil conflict in Sudan, \n     the United States has helped to establish an internationally \n     supported peace process to promote a negotiated settlement to \n     the war that has resulted in a framework peace agreement, the \n     Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan \n     signed June 5, 2004.\n       (4) At the same time that the Government of Sudan was \n     negotiating for a final countrywide peace, enumerated in the \n     Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan, \n     it refused to engage in any discussion with regard to its \n     ongoing campaign of ethnic cleansing in the region of Darfur.\n       (5) According to United States and United Nations \n     officials, the Government of Sudan has engaged in an \n     orchestrated campaign, with the assistance of its Arab \n     Sudanese proxy militia, the Janjaweed, to cleanse a \n     significant part of the ethnically African population from \n     North Darfur, West Darfur, and South Darfur, Sudan.\n       (6) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n     identified ``massive human rights violations in Darfur \n     perpetrated by the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed, \n     which may constitute war crimes and/or crimes against \n     humanity''.\n       (7) Evidence collected by international observers in the \n     Darfur region between January 2003 and July 2004 indicate a \n     coordinated effort to target African Sudanese civilians in a \n     scorched earth policy, from both air and ground, that has \n     destroyed African Sudanese villages, killing and driving away \n     its people, while Arab Sudanese villages have been left \n     unscathed.\n       (8) As a result of this coordinated campaign that may well \n     constitute genocide, reports indicate tens of thousands of \n     African Sudanese civilians killed, the systematic rape of \n     hundreds of women and girls, the destruction of hundreds of \n     Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa villages and other ethnically \n     African populations, including the poisoning of their wells \n     and the plunder of crops and cattle upon which they sustain \n     themselves.\n       (9) According to the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees, 1,200,000 people have been displaced in the Darfur \n     region of Sudan of whom nearly 200,000 have been forced to \n     flee to Chad as refugees.\n       (10) Even as refugees were fleeing Sudan, the Government of \n     Sudan conducted aerial attack missions and deadly raids \n     across the international border between Sudan and Chad in an \n     illegal effort to pursue Sudanese civilians seeking refuge in \n     Chad.\n       (11) In addition to the thousands of violent deaths \n     directly caused by ongoing Sudanese military and government \n     sponsored Janjaweed attacks in the Darfur region, the \n     Government of Sudan has restricted humanitarian and human \n     rights workers' access to the Darfur area, primarily through \n     bureaucratic and administrative obstruction and delays in an \n     attempt to inflict the most devastating harm on those \n     displaced from their villages and homes without any means of \n     sustenance or shelter.\n       (12) The Government of Sudan's continued support for the \n     Janjaweed and their obstruction of the delivery of food, \n     shelter, and medical care to the Darfur region--\n       (A) is estimated to be causing 500 deaths each day; and\n       (B) is projected to escalate to 1,200 deaths each day by \n     August 2004, and 2,400 deaths each day by December 2004, so \n     that even a best-case scenario will likely result in the \n     death of more than 320,000 people between April 1, 2004 and \n     December 31, 2004.\n       (13) The Government of Chad in N'Djamena served an \n     important role in facilitating the Darfur Humanitarian Cease-\n     fire dated April 8, 2004 for the Darfur region between the \n     Government of Sudan and the 2 opposition rebel groups in \n     Darfur (the JEM and the SLA) although both sides have \n     violated it repeatedly.\n       (14) The Government and people of Chad have allowed the \n     entry of 200,000 refugees from the Darfur region of Sudan and \n     have generally facilitated the delivery of international \n     humanitarian assistance, although logistical obstacles remain \n     a challenge in a crisis that is taxing the people of eastern \n     Chad and the refugees.\n       (15) The cooperation and mediation of the SPLM is critical \n     to bringing about a political settlement between the \n     Government of Sudan, the SLA, and the JEM.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE CONFLICT IN DARFUR, \n                   SUDAN.\n\n       (a) Sudan Peace Act.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     Sudan Peace Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) remains relevant and \n     should be extended to include the Darfur region of Sudan.\n       (b) Actions To Address the Conflict.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) a legitimate countrywide peace in Sudan will only be \n     possible if the principles and purpose of the Machakos \n     Protocol of 2002 and the Nairobi Declaration on the Final \n     Phase of Peace in the Sudan signed June 5, 2004, negotiated \n     with the SPLM, should apply to all of Sudan and to all of the \n     people of Sudan, including the Darfur region;\n       (2) the parties to the Darfur Humanitarian Cease-fire dated \n     April 8, 2004 (the Government of Sudan, the SLA, and the JEM) \n     must meet their obligations under that agreement to allow \n     safe and immediate access of all humanitarian assistance \n     throughout the Darfur region and must expedite the conclusion \n     of a political agreement to end the conflict in Darfur;\n       (3) the United States should continue to provide \n     humanitarian assistance to the areas of Sudan to which the \n     United States has access and, at the same time, develop a \n     plan similar to that described in section 10 of the Sudan \n     Peace Act to provide assistance to the areas of Sudan to \n     which United States access has been obstructed or denied;\n       (4) the international community, including African, Arab, \n     and Muslim nations, should immediately provide logistical, \n     financial, in-kind, and personnel resources necessary to save \n     the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals in the \n     Darfur crisis;\n       (5) the United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes \n     should travel to Chad and the Darfur region immediately to \n     investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity, to \n     develop a more accurate portrayal of the situation on the \n     ground and best inform the report required in section 11(b) \n     of the Sudan Peace Act;\n       (6) the United States and the international community \n     should use all necessary means to assist in the immediate \n     deployment of the full mandated African Union contingent of \n     100 monitors and a security force of 300, and work to \n     increase the authorized level to that which properly \n     addresses the gravity and scope of the problem in a region \n     the size of France;\n       (7) the President should immediately name a new Special \n     Envoy to Sudan to further efforts begun by John Danforth and \n     to allow the United States to continue to lead the peace \n     effort toward a comprehensive and sustainable peace in Sudan;\n       (8) the President should use all means to facilitate a \n     comprehensive solution to the conflict in Sudan, including by \n     directing the United States Permanent Representative to the \n     United Nations to pursue a resolution of the United Nations \n     Security Council that--\n       (A) condemns the actions of the Government of Sudan in \n     engaging in an orchestrated campaign of ethnic cleansing in \n     Darfur;\n       (B) calls on the Government of Sudan to cease support of \n     ethnic cleansing and the killing of innocent civilians, \n     disarm the Janjaweed militias, prevent such militias from \n     harassing and killing civilians, and ensure immediate access \n     for all humanitarian assistance to all areas of Darfur;\n       (C) calls on all parties to the conflict in the Darfur \n     region to permit unimpeded delivery of humanitarian \n     assistance directly to Darfur and to allow such assistance to \n     cross directly from countries that border Sudan, and abide by \n     the Darfur Humanitarian Cease-fire dated April 8, 2004;\n       (D) calls on the Government of Sudan to provide all \n     assistance possible, including release of its strategic food \n     reserves to respond to the Darfur crisis;\n       (E) calls on the international community, particularly \n     those countries with strong economic ties to Sudan, to \n     expedite the provision of humanitarian assistance to Darfur;\n       (F) endorses the African Union Observer and Protection \n     Force now deploying to the Darfur region of Sudan;\n       (G) establishes an international commission of inquiry to \n     examine the actions and accountability of those responsible \n     for war crimes and crimes against humanity that have \n     precipitated and perpetuated the humanitarian crisis in the \n     Darfur region; and\n       (H) confirms the right of all displaced Sudanese to return \n     to their land under safe and secure conditions;\n       (9) the United Nations should immediately deploy a United \n     Nations force to Sudan to ensure an appropriate international \n     humanitarian response to the catastrophe in the Darfur \n     region;\n       (10) sanctions should be imposed on the assets and \n     activities of those Sudanese government officials and other \n     individuals that are involved in carrying out the policy of \n     ethnic cleansing in the Darfur region; and\n       (11) the Government of the United States should not \n     normalize relations with Sudan, including through the lifting \n     of any sanctions, until the Government of Sudan agrees to and \n     implements a comprehensive peace agreement for all areas of \n     Sudan, including Darfur.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to amend the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress Authorization Act to require State academic assessments of \nstudent achievement in United States history, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American \nHistory Achievement Act. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. This is part of my effort \nto put the teaching of American history and civics back in its rightful \nplace in our school curriculum so our children can grow up learning \nwhat it means to be an American.\n  This is especially appropriate on a day when the September 11 report \nis being released. We tend to think of ourselves as Americans and \nwonder who we are and what we value and what we have to defend at times \nwhen we are threatened or even frightened. This should be a day when we \nshould feel threatened. We are reminded of the challenges we face.\n  I am especially glad that Senator Kennedy has joined me in this. \nSenator Kennedy is especially appropriate to be a leading sponsor of \nthis legislation. He and his family are, in fact, part of American \nhistory in a unique way. He, as well as Senator Reid, Senator Byrd, and \na number of Senators on this side of the aisle have been working hard \nin a variety of ways to support efforts that are appropriate in the \nFederal Government to celebrate our own history.\n  This modest bill provides for improved testing of American history so \nwe can determine where history is being taught well and where it is \nbeing taught poorly so that improvements can be made. We also know when \ntesting is focused on a specific subject, States and school districts \nare more likely to step up to the challenge and improve performance.\n  For example, a number of professors and teachers of history have \nworried that because of the emphasis in No Child Left Behind on reading \nand mathematics, that history would be left behind. There are two \nanswers to that. One is, if our citizens cannot read, they are not \ngoing to know much history, except from watching the History Channel, \nwhich is a pretty good way, and another answer is there is a specific \nprovision in the No Child Left Behind Act, which we call the Byrd \ngrants, after Senator Byrd, providing $100 million a year to school \ndistricts across the country for the teaching of traditional American \nhistory. Those programs are in full flourish in Tennessee, North \nCarolina, and many parts of this country. They are excellent programs.\n  When you combine those with the We the People Project of the National \nEndowment of the Humanities--I attended one of their workshops in \nNashville on Friday. Forty teachers across the country met at Andrew \nJackson's home, the Hermitage.\n  We are doing more to put this in the rightful place. The bill Senator \nKennedy and I offer today is one more effort of putting the teaching of \nAmerican history and civics back where it belongs.\n  We could certainly use improvement in the teaching of American \nhistory. According to the National Assessment of Education Progress, \ncommonly referred to as the Nation's report card, fewer students have a \nbasic understanding of American history than have a basic understanding \nof any other subject which we test, including math, science, and \nreading.\n  When we look at our national report card, American history is our \nchildren's worst subject. Yet, according to recent poll results, the \nexact opposite outcome is desired by the American people.\n  Hart-Teeter recently polled 1,300 adults for the educational testing \nservice and asked what the principal goal of education should be. The \ntop response: Producing literate, educated students who can participate \nin our democracy. Twenty-six percent of respondents believed that \nshould be our principal goal. ``Teach basics: math, reading'' was \nselected by only 15 percent as the principal goal of education.\n  The late Albert Shanker of the American Federation of Teachers used \nto say our common schools were created for the purpose of teaching \nimmigrant children reading, writing, and arithmetic, the three R's, and \nwhat it means to be an American, so they could go home and teach their \nparents.\n  They have forgotten that latter role, more and more. Our children \ndon't know American history because they are not being taught. For \nexample, the State of Florida just passed a bill permitting high school \nstudents to graduate without taking a course in U.S.\n\n[[Page S8704]]\n\nhistory. When our children are not being taught our history, they are \nnot learning what is most important.\n  According to Harvard scholar Samuel Huntington, a 1987 study of high \nschool students found more who knew who Harriet Tubman was than knew \nWashington commanded the American Army in the Revolution, or that \nAbraham Lincoln wrote the Emancipation Proclamation. I am all for \nteaching about Harriet Tubman and teaching about the history of the \nUnderground Railroad. My ancestor, the Rev. John Rankin, like Harriet \nTubman, was a conductor on the Underground Railroad. I would like for \nmore children to know about them both. But surely children ought to \nlearn first about the most critical leaders and events in the \nRevolution and in the Civil War.\n\n  Let me give a couple of examples of how bad things have gotten. The \nfourth grade NAEP test asked students to identify the following \npassage:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are \n     created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights; among these are life, liberty, \n     and the pursuit of happiness . . .\n\n  Students were given four choices for the source of that passage: the \nConstitution, the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, \nthe Articles of Confederation. Only 46 percent of students answered \ncorrectly, that it came from the Declaration of Independence.\n  The eighth grade test asked, Imagine you could use a time machine to \nvisit the past. You have landed in Philadelphia in the summer of 1776. \nDescribe an important event that is happening.\n  Nearly half the students, 46 percent, were not able to answer the \nquestion correctly, that the Declaration of Independence was being \nsigned.\n  This legislation aims to help in the effort to do something about \nthat. The American History Achievement Act gives the national \nassessment governing board the authority to administer a 10-State pilot \nstudy for the NAEP test in U.S. history in 2006. The board already has \nthe authority for reading, math, science, and writing. The pilot \nprogram should collect enough data to attain a State-by-State \ncomparison of 8th and 12th grade student knowledge and understanding of \nhistory. That will allow us to know which States are doing a better job \nof teaching American history and allow other States to model their \nprograms on those that are working well. This legislation is part of a \nbroader effort in the Senate.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Reid of Nevada, Senator Kennedy, and I and \nothers joined with Senators to pass the American History and Civics \nEducation Act, by unanimous vote, to create summer academies for \nteachers and students of American history. Senator Schumer and I have \nintroduced a bill to codify the oath of allegiance which immigrants \ntake when sworn in as new citizens of the United States. The oath \nshould be protected in law just as the national anthem and Pledge of \nAllegiance are.\n  Today we are putting a new focus on the teaching of American history. \nOur children are growing up ignorant of our Nation's history. Yet a \nrecent poll tells us that Americans believe the principal goal of \neducation is ``producing literate, educated citizens who can \nparticipate in our democracy.'' It is time to put the teaching of \nAmerican history and civics back in its rightful place in our schools \nso our children can grow up learning what it means to be an American.\n  Our diversity is a prized value in the United States. But more prized \nis that we have been able to turn all that diversity into one nation. \nOur motto is: ``e pluribus unum,'' not the other way around. It is: \n``one from many.''\n  One thing we have in common is our history, and we should teach it. \nThis bill takes us one step closer to achieving that noble goal. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2721\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator \nAlexander in introducing the American History Achievement Act. This \nbill is part of a continuing effort to renew the national commitment to \nteaching in the Nation's public schools. It lays the foundation for \nmore effective ways of teaching children about the Nation's past. The \nbill contains no new requirements for schools, but it does offer a more \nfrequent and effective analysis of how America's schoolchildren are \nlearning American history.\n  Our economy and our future security rely on good schools that help \nstudents develop specific skills, such as reading and math. But the \nstrength of our democracy and our standing in the world also depend on \nensuring that children have a basic understanding of the Nation's past.\n  Helping to instill appreciation of America's past should be an \nimportant mission of public schools. Thanks to the hard work of large \nnumbers of history teachers in classrooms throughout\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\nAmerica, we're making progress. Results from the most recent assessment \nunder the NAEP show that fourth and eighth graders are improving their \nknowledge of U.S. history. Research conducted in history classrooms \nshows that children are using primary sources and documents more often \nto explore history, and are being assigned historical and biographical \nreadings by their teachers more frequently.\n  But much more remains to be done to advance the understanding of \nAmerican history, and to see that the teaching of history is not left \nbehind in classrooms.\n  A recent study by Dr. Sheldon Stern--the Chief Historian Emeritus at \nmy brother's Presidential Library--suggests that state standards for \nteaching American history need improvement. His research reveals that \n22 States have American history standards that are either weak or lack \nclear chronology, appropriate political and historical context, or \nsufficient information about real events and people. As many as 9 \nStates still have no standards at all for American history.\n  Good standards matter. They're the foundation for teaching and \nlearning in every school. With the right resources, time, and \nattention, it's possible to develop creative and effective history \nstandards in every State. Massachusetts began to work on this effort in \n2000, through a joint review of history standards that involved \nteachers, administrators, curriculum coordinators, and university \nprofessors. After monthly meetings and 3 years of development and \nrevision, the State released a new framework for teaching history in \n2003. Today, our standards in American history and World history \nreceive the highest marks.\n  School budget problems at the local level are obviously a serious \nthreat to these goals. Last week, 7,500 school districts received \nnotice of an impending $237 million overall cut to their budgets, to \ntake effect this fall. These cuts further exacerbate the current \nfunding crisis under the No Child Left Behind Act. Unfortunately, \ncourses in history or the humanities are often the first to go.\n  Other accounts report that schools are narrowing their curriculums \naway from the social sciences, arts, and humanities, in favor of a more \nconcentrated approach to the teaching of reading and math in order to \nmeet the strict standards of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Meeting high standards in reading and math is important, but it \nshould not come at the expense of scaling back teaching in other core \nsubjects such as history. Integrating reading and math with other \nsubjects often gives children a better way to master literacy and \nnumber skills, even while learning in a history or geography lesson. \nThat type of innovation deserves special attention in our schools. \nMaking it happen requires added investments in teacher preparation and \nteacher mentoring, so that teachers are well prepared to use \ninterdisciplinary methods in their lesson plans.\n  Our bill today takes several important steps to strengthen the \nteaching of American history, and raise the standing of history in \nschool curriculums. Through changes to the National Assessment for \nEducational Progress, schools will be better able to achieve success on \nthis important issue.\n  First, we propose a more frequent national assessment of children in \nAmerican history under the NAEP. For years, NAEP has served as the gold \nstandard for measuring the progress of students and reporting on that \nprogress. Students last participated in the U.S. history NAEP in 2001, \nand that assessment generated encouraging results. But the preceding \nassessment--with which we can compare data--was administered in 1994--\ntoo long before to be of real assistance.\n  It makes sense to measure the knowledge and skills of children more \nfrequently. This bill would place priority on administering the \nnational U.S. history NAEP assessment, to generate a more timely \npicture of student progress. We should have an idea of children's \nknowledge and skills in American history more often than every 6 or 7 \nyears, in order to address gaps in learning.\n  The bill also proposes a leap forward to strengthen state standards \nin American history, through a new State-level assessment of U.S. \nhistory under NAEP. The assessment would be conducted on an \nexperimental and pilot basis in 10 States, in grades 8 and 12. The \nNational Assessment Governing Board would ensure that States with model \nhistory standards, as well as those that are still under development, \nparticipate in this assessment.\n  Moving NAEP to the state level does not carry any high stakes for \nschools. But it will provide an additional benchmark for States to \ndevelop and improve American history standards. It's our hope that \nStates will also be encouraged to undertake improvements in their \nhistory curricula and ensure that American history is a beneficiary and \nnot a victim of school reform.\n  America's past encompasses great leaders and great ideas that \ncontributed to our heritage and to the principles of freedom, equality, \njustice, and opportunity for all. Today's students will be better \ncitizens in the future if they learn more about that history. The \nAmerican History Achievement Act is an important effort toward that \ngoal, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2723. A bill to designate certain land in the State of Oregon as \nwilderness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 2004 is a momentous year for wilderness in \nOregon. It marks the 40th anniversary of the 1964 Wilderness Act and \nthe 20th anniversary of the Oregon Wilderness bill from 1984.\n  But perhaps most importantly, 2004 marks the bicentennial of the \nsingle most important exploratory committee ever to be launched by this \nFederal government: the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\n  I can see no better way to mark this auspicious year than by enacting \na new Oregon Wilderness bill, the ``Lewis and Clark Mount Hood \nWilderness Act of 2004,'' which includes, in tribute to the great \nriver-dependent journey of Lewis and Clark, the addition of five free-\nflowing stretches of rivers to the National Wild and Scenic River \nSystem.\n  In the last few years, some of Oregon's most important treasures have \nbeen Congressionally protected: Steens Mountain is now home to 170,000 \nacres of Wilderness; the Little Sandy watershed is now part of the Bull \nRun Management Unit and will help provide drinking water for over \n700,000 Oregonians; Soda Mountain has been designated a National \nMonument; and the Ft. Clatsop National Memorial has been expanded and \nis the subject of legislation under consideration by this august body, \nas I speak, to make it Oregon's second National Park.\n  The wilderness bill I introduce today continues to encapsulate, as \ndid the draft wilderness proposal that I floated on this subject in \nMarch of this year, the wish of the people in my State to protect but \nalso actively relate to her treasures. Thousands of Oregonians \nresponded to my draft proposal--far more than I ever could have \nexpected. As a result, this is their bill more than it is my bill.\n  Mount Hood and the Columbia Gorge must be protected because the \npeople of Oregon love these areas, they are proud of these areas, and \nthey are demanding that we come together to protect Oregon's treasures \nfor this and future generations. The people of Oregon helped write this \nbill, and I believe the people of Oregon on a bipartisan basis will be \nthe ones who help get it passed and signed by the President.\n  This bill I introduce today protects the lower elevation forests \nsurrounding Mount Hood and the Columbia River Gorge as Lewis and Clark \nsaw them. These forests symbolize the natural beauty of Oregon. They \nprovide the clean water necessary for the survival of threatened \nsteelhead, Coho and Chinook salmon. These forests provide critical \nhabitat and diverse ecosystems for elk, deer, lynx and the majestic \nbald eagle. And these are the forests that provide unparalleled \nrecreational opportunities for Oregonians and our visitors.\n  But the bill I introduce today differs in many ways from the draft \nproposal because it responds to the many comments I heard in the \nensuing 4 months. I received thousands of comments on the proposed \nlegislation. Some comments came as a result of the general public \nmeetings I held in Oregon, on\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\nApril 11 and 14 of this year in Southwest Portland and in Hood River. \nEach meeting lasted over 3 hours, and everyone who wanted to speak was \ngiven an opportunity to do so. Other comments came from the second \nMount Hood Summit held at Timberline Lodge in June hosted by \nRepresentatives Walden and Blumenauer. I and my staff met with over 100 \ncommunity groups and local governments, the members of the Oregon \ncongressional delegation, the Governor, and the Bush administration. \nAnd still more comments came from letters and phone calls from \nOregonians.\n  What I overwhelmingly heard was the need to protect and build on \nOregon's Wilderness system is as important today as it was in 1804, \n1964 or 1984--and is arguably more so--but it must be accompanied by \ntools that help us create a planned future on Mount Hood. Mount Hood is \nclearly going to be at risk otherwise.\n  The Mount Hood National Forest is the eighth most visited National \nForest in the United States. It is one of fourteen Forest Service-\ndesignated ``urban'' national forests in the entire Nation. In the 20 \nyears that has elapsed since any new wilderness has been designated in \nthe Mount Hood area--wild and scenic rivers were last set aside 16 \nyears ago, the population in local counties has increased \nsignificantly--20 percent in Multnomah County, 24 percent in Hood River \nCounty, and 41 percent in Clackamas County.\n  The predominant public use of this urban forest is non-mechanized \nactivity like hiking, camping, and fishing. With increasing emphasis on \nwild scenery, unspoiled wildlife habitats, free flowing rivers, \nwilderness and the need for opportunities for diverse outdoor \nrecreation sometimes it seems--I heard this repeatedly--we are in \njeopardy of ``loving our wild places to death.''\n  A few years ago, the Forest Service made a proposal to limit the \nnumber of people that could hike the south side of Mount Hood and the \npublic outcry was enormous. Seems to me, rather than tell people that \nthey are going to be restricted from using our public lands, part of \nthe solution for the future of the Mountain lies in providing more \nopportunities for them to enjoy the Mountain's great places.\n  As the Forest Service is well-aware, Mt. Hood's non-mechanized use \nwill increase dramatically over time, but the Forest Service's own \ndocuments acknowledge that we are not today even close to ready for \nthat eventuality.\n  The Forest Service's current Land and Resource Management Plan for \nMount Hood, page III-36, which notes the following:\n\n     the present capability to supply recreational opportunities \n     such as hiking on trails in primitive and semi-primitive non-\n     motorized areas is predicted to fall short of satisfying \n     demand.\n\n  According to that Forest Service management plan, the Mount Hood \nNational Forest already provides resources for nearly twice the current \ndemand for developed recreation like skiing, power boating and \nsightseeing by car, but meets less than two-thirds of the demand for \nbackcountry recreation. The future is even grimmer. The Management Plan \ngoes on to project that by 2040, the Mount Hood National Forest will \nonly meet 16 percent of the demand for wilderness recreation, while \nstill meeting over 100 percent of the demand for mechanized recreation.\n  This Forest Service-projected shortfall means an ever-increasing \nnumber of Oregonians will be forced onto inadequate, existing \nwilderness, drastically impacting the mountain, its visitors, and its \nwell-deserved reputation as one of this country's greatest natural \nwonders.\n  Of the more than 600 people who attended the two meetings I held in \nApril in Oregon, 128 spoke--110 in favor of more wilderness and 18 \nspoke in opposition.\n  Additionally, I received more than 1,100 written comments about the \nproposal and over 1,000 of those expressed support for additional \nwilderness.\n  I know my colleague wishes to speak. I want to wrap up by \nhighlighting the key areas I had Oregonians focus on in these meetings \nand how we responded.\n  First, we heard that Oregonians felt there was not enough wilderness. \nSecond, we heard concern from some who enjoy mountain biking that their \nrecreational opportunity would be unfairly curtailed. Third, we heard \nfrom people in the towns, mountains, and gorges about fire protection \nfor their communities. Fourth, we heard about forest health and \ntimber--again, a very important set of concerns for our region. \nFinally, we were told about developed recreation with many being \nworried about maintaining a role for skiing and other recreational \npleasures on Mount Hood.\n  In each of these five areas we took steps to address these concerns.\n  First, the legislation I introduce today to respond to the call of \nthe people of my State for more wilderness would increase the amount we \nhad originally proposed by designating approximately 177,000 new acres \nof wilderness.\n  These include very important areas surrounding the oldest Mount Hood \nwilderness areas--spectacular ridges that frame the Columbia River \nGorge that all will marvel at and essential other areas of beautiful \nfall colors and the best deer and elk hunting existing in the entire \nforest.\n  Second, and especially important, I thought the mountain bikers \nraised valid concerns. So we took two steps. I proposed and I am very \ninterested in talking to my friend from Tennessee who has such an \ninterest in the environment and recreation, generally, about an idea we \nproposed in this legislation to create a Mount Hood Pedaler's \nDemonstration Experiment. We call it Hood-PDX, which would in effect be \nthe Nation's first mountain bike area that would join such a treasure \nas Mount Hood. In this demonstration project, Hood-PDX would be managed \nas wilderness though it wouldn't be wilderness. It would be a pilot \nproject encompassing over 13,000 acres and over 50 miles of trail. The \nmountain bikers would have 10 years to establish that bikers can \ncoexist peacefully with wild natural areas.\n  We also made boundary adjustments to keep them on over 120 miles of \ntrail which they were concerned about losing.\n  Third, we took steps to protect our communities--particularly Cascade \nLocks, Government Camp, and Rowena--and so this bill creates fire \nsafety zones for communities in this area.\n  This legislation also reiterates the Forest Service's mandate for \nthinning for forest health on the Mount Hood National Resources, and \nespecially the resources to get the job done in the area.\n  Finally, we add a proposal for developed recreation that would \nreestablish a southside winter recreation area that encompasses those \nareas on the southside of Mount Hood that have exceptional potential \nfor commercial recreation.\n  The protection of these important areas will depend on the hard work \nand dedication of all Oregonians. I want to particularly thank my \nfriend and colleague Senator Smith who meets with me every Thursday \nover lunch. We talk repeatedly about this issue and he has been very \ngracious. We are going to work together to address the various issues \nraised by our constituents and raised by our colleagues in the other \nbody, particularly Congressmen Walden, Blumenauer, and Hooley.\n  This is a special day for Oregon. This is the formal beginning of an \nimportant debate about how to protect special Oregon treasure.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I would like to salute the Senator \nfrom Oregon. I am glad I was here to hear his discussion, especially \nabout mountain bikers' great conservation majority in this country. We \nought to do a better job of creating a bigger conservation majority in \nthe Senate. We sometimes split up on the issues, it would appear. But I \ndon't think that is necessary.\n  For example, I was in Idaho a couple of weeks ago and took a mountain \nbike ride on the Hiawatha Trail which is between Idaho and Montana \nwhere the Milwaukee Railroad used to run from Chicago to Takoma. At one \npoint, they were going to dig up the tracks. But this is a place where \nthey have long tunnels and the speculator high trestles where people \nused to go in the 1950s and 1960s. But now, because of the work by \nMembers of this body, some on this side of the aisle, some on that \nside, that is a rails-to-trails project. On that Sunday morning, there \nwere maybe 500 or 600 mountain bikers who had that experience.\n  It made me think of something I failed to do when I was Governor of \nour\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\nhome State. I still deeply regret it. I thought toward the end of my \nterm about but couldn't quite get done the notion of whenever we build \na new highway we should provide for a pedestrian or bike trail along \nthe side of it--it is too expensive to do a lot of times on existing \nroads--that every time you build a new road or widen a road, acquire a \nlittle bit more right of way. If we had done that 20 years ago in \nTennessee, we would all be grateful for that today.\n  Senator Landrieu, Democratic Senator from Louisiana, and I are \nworking on legislation called the American Outdoors legislation, to try \nto assure a steady stream of revenue for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund for urban parks, for the Game and Fish Commission, \nand other conservation purposes.\n  Senator Wyden, Senator Landrieu, and I are all in the same committee. \nI look forward to working with them on this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. \n        Corzine):\n  S. 2725. A bill to amend the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, \nand Modernization Act of 2003 to eliminate the coverage gap, to \neliminate HMO subsidies, to repeal health savings accounts, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in 2003 the Medicare Modernization Act \nbecame law. A part of that legislation continued a very modest--and \nfatally flawed--prescription drug benefit for seniors.\n   One of those flaws--and it was something I pointed out during the \nSenate debate and offered an amendment to fix--is known as the coverage \ngap.\n   Here's how it works: Seniors will have a monthly premium and a $250 \ndeductible and then they pay 25 percent of their prescription drug \ncosts. So far so good. But then once they have drug costs of over \n$2,250, the benefit stops; it shuts down. And seniors have to pay the \nnext $2,850 of drug costs on their own--100 percent of their costs--\nbefore their coverage starts again.\n   Does this sound like prescription drug coverage to you? I know that \nmy insurance has no such thing, and I know of no other insurance that \nhas such a policy.\n   So today, Senator Mikulski and I are introducing a bill that closes \nthis coverage gap and will better fulfill our promise to seniors to \nprovide a real Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n   Under our bill--the Closing the Coverage Gap Act of 2004--seniors \nwill pay the premium and the $250 deductible and then pay for 25 \npercent of their coverage until they reach their catastrophic limit of \n$5,100. After that, Medicare will pay 95 percent.\n   Let me give you an example of how this works. A constituent from San \nMarcos, California wrote me about her prescription drug costs. They \nexceed $10,000 a year. In 2006, she will be helped by the new law, but \nwill still end up paying nearly $4,000 for her prescriptions. Under my, \nthis woman will be responsible for only $1,500 of her costs. It will \nease her burden and give her greater peace of mind.\n   This bill is simple; it is fair, and it will help millions of \nseniors across the country.\n   I thank Senator Mikulski for joining me in this effort, and I urge \nmy colleague to cosponsor this bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Boxer, to introduce the Closing the Coverage Gap of 2004 Act. \nThis bill would fix one of the major flaws of the recently passed \nMedicare Modernization Act--the $2,850 gap in prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  The Medicare bill is a hollow promise for a prescription drug benefit \nfor seniors which talks big but delivers small. It promises \nprescription drugs for seniors, yet it will cause over 2 million \nseniors to lose their drug coverage, coerce seniors into HMOs, and do \nnothing to stop the soaring cost of prescription drugs.\n  During the debate on the bill, Senator Boxer and I worked on an \namendment to fix one of the worst flaws in the drug benefit--the \ncoverage gap. When I reviewed the bill, I was appalled to discover that \nthe promised benefit actually provides no drug benefit to seniors for \ndrug costs between $2,250 and $5,100 per year.\n  The new Medicare benefit affects seniors' drug costs in two ways. \nFirst of all it, it prohibits Medicare from negotiating better prices \nfor seniors. I am fighting for legislation that would allow Medicare to \nnegotiate drug prices--lowering drug costs to both seniors and \ntaxpayers.\n  Next, the benefits are skimpy and spartan. The new Medicare benefit \nleaves too many seniors in a coverage gap. Some people are calling this \na ``donut,'' as if it's a ``Krispy Kream,'' but there is nothing sweet \nabout it. Seniors will have to pay out of pocket all of their drugs \nbetween $2,250 and $5,100 while still paying monthly premiums. This \nisn't a donut; it's a hidden deductible. The real deductible in this \nplan isn't $250. Once a senior's drug costs put them into the coverage \ngap, their deductible could be as high as $3,100. Seniors would have to \npay all of the drug costs between $2,250 and $5,100, a total of $2,850, \nout of their own pockets on top of the $250 deductible.\n  I think this is outrageous. No other insurance plan simply stops \ncoverage for a while.\n  Our bill would fix this fatal flaw in the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit by providing real prescription drug coverage. Under our bill, \nthere is no coverage gap. Seniors would pay their premium and the $250 \ndeductible. Once they have paid their deductible, they would pay 25 \npercent their drug costs until they reach the catastrophic limit of \n$5,100. And just like the current benefit, once a senior reaches \n$5,100, Medicare would pay 95 percent of all drug costs.\n  I thank Senator Boxer for all her work on this important bill and \nlook forward to working together to close the coverage gap.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2726. A bill to amend title 49 of the United States Code to \nprovide flight attendant security training, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that \nis important to the security of our air travel: ensuring that our \nNation's flight attendants receive anti-terrorist security training.\n  On September 11th, as we all know, the terrorists hijacked four \ncommercial jets--all of which were heading to California. And while I \ncan say that air travel today is more secure than it was before the \nterrorist attacks, I still believe that we have more to do--which was \nproven with the information recently that a flight between LAX and \nDulles is a ``flight of interest.'' There are still threats out there.\n  It is unacceptable to have loopholes in our aviation security--nearly \n3 years since the attack.\n  In addition to air marshals and armed pilots, flight attendants are \npart of the last line of defense. The most obvious case is Richard \nReid--the shoe bomber who was stopped with the help of a flight \nattendant. That was a courageous--and life saving--act. All flight \nattendants should be trained and ready to respond to these types of \nincidents.\n  As part of the Department of Homeland Security legislation in 2002, \nwe passed strong flight attendant security training, which I helped \nwrite with former Senator Bob Smith. Unfortunately, last year, much of \nthat was repealed--at the insistence of a single member of the House--\nin the FAA Reauthorization bill.\n  Therefore, I am introducing legislation today that would reinstate \nthe flight attendant security training included in the Homeland \nSecurity bill. The bill would restore the law requiring uniform anti-\nterrorist training for all flight attendants.\n  We took a great step forward in 2002. We should not have gone \nbackwards to create a loophole in our aviation security.\n  We cannot stop fighting terrorism. Well-trained flight attendants are \nkey. We do not have enough air marshals on planes, and the \nAdministration is slow-walking the guns in the cockpit program. We need \nto rely on our flight attendants now more than ever. We must ensure \nthey get the training they need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n\n[[Page S8708]]\n\n  S. 2727. A bill to amend part A of title VI of the Higher Education \nAct of 1965 regarding international and foreign language studies; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Cochran, Durbin \nand Feingold to introduce The International and Foreign Language \nStudies Act of 2004.\n  In recent years, foreign language needs have significantly increased \nthroughout the Federal Government due to the presence of a wider range \nof security threats, the emergence of new nation states, and the \nglobalization of the U.S. economy. Likewise, American business \nincreasingly needs internationally experienced employees to compete in \nthe global economy and to manage a culturally diverse workforce.\n  Currently, the U.S. government requires 34,000 employees with foreign \nlanguage skills across 70 federal agencies. These agencies have stated \nover the last few years, that translator and interpreter shortfalls \nhave adversely affected agency operations and hindered U.S. military, \nlaw enforcement, intelligence, counter-terrorism and diplomatic \nefforts.\n  Despite our growing needs, in the 2000-01 school year, the number of \nundergraduate foreign language degrees conferred was only one percent \nof all degrees. In 2003, only 41 percent of undergraduates reported \ntaking foreign language courses while only 18 percent reported having \nstudied abroad. And yet, 79 percent of Americans believe that students \nshould study abroad sometime during college.\n  At a time when our security needs are more important than ever, at a \ntime when our economy demands that we enter new markets, and at a time \nwhen the world requires us to engage in diplomacy in more thoughtful \nand considered ways, it is extremely important that we have at our \ndisposal a multilingual, multi cultural, internationally experienced \nworkforce. The Dodd-Cochran International and Foreign Language Studies \nAct attempts to provide us with this.\n  The Dodd-Cochran International and Foreign Language Studies Act will \nincrease undergraduate study abroad opportunities as they relate to \nprograms designed to enhance foreign language proficiency and deepen \ncultural knowledge. The Dodd-Cochran bill will reinstate undergraduate \neligibility for Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowships. The \nDodd-Cochran bill will encourage the Department of Education to engage \nin the collection, analysis and dissemination of data on international \neducation and foreign language needs so that we know and understand \nexactly what our needs in this area are. And, most importantly, the \nDodd-Cochran bill will demonstrate our nation's commitment to \nincreasing the foreign language proficiency and international \nexperience of our electorate by increasing the amount appropriated to \ninternational education within the Higher Education Act to $120 million \neach year.\n  The Higher Education Act authorizes the Federal Government's major \nactivities as they relate to financial assistance for students \nattending colleges and universities. It provides aid to institutions of \nhigher education, services to help students complete high school and \nenter and succeed in postsecondary education, and mechanisms to improve \nthe training of our emerging workforce. This bill will help fulfill \nthat mission.\n  Foreign language skills and international study are vital to secure \nthe future economic welfare of the United States in an increasingly \ninternational economy. Foreign language skills and international study \nare also vital for the nation to meet 21st century security challenges \nproperly and effectively, especially in light of the terrorist attacks \non September 11, 2001.\n  I hope our colleagues who are not cosponsoring this bill will give it \nserious consideration. By working together, I believe that the Senate \nas a body can act to ensure that we strengthen our Nation's security \nand economy by capitalizing on the talents and dreams of those who wish \nto enter the international arena.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER:\n  S. 2728. A bill to create a penalty for automobile insurance fraud; \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Stabenow and \nLautenberg to introduce the Getting Results for Advanced Degrees (GRAD) \nAct.\n  The percentage of individuals pursuing graduate education has \nincreased dramatically in recent decades as individuals seek the \neducation and skills needed to participate in a technologically complex \nand global economy. In the last 25 years alone, graduate enrollment in \nthe United States has increased by 39 percent. In the fall of 2000, \nthere were 1.85 million graduate students enrolled in American schools.\n  The economic benefits of graduate education are significant. The \nmedian earnings of workers who possess a graduate or professional \ndegree are more than 3\\1/2\\ times those of high school dropouts.\n  Despite the impact of graduate education on individuals' economic \nwell being, and on the economic strength of our national economy as a \nwhole, graduate education is, for many, financially out of reach. In \n2001-02 the average graduate school tuition at public institutions was \n$4,491 and $15,233 at private institutions. In a 2002 borrower's \nsurvey, the average debt reported by graduate students was $45,900. \nThis is an astounding figure.\n  To respond to the need for a highly educated workforce, I have put \ntogether a series of proposals that will make graduate education more \naccessible and affordable to qualified applicants regardless of income \nlevel, the Getting Results for Advanced Degrees Act (GRAD). The purpose \nof the GRAD Act is to encourage students to pursue graduate education \nand to assist them in affording it.\n  Specifically, the GRAD Act increases the authorization level of the \nGraduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) program to $50 \nmillion and the Jacob Javits Fellowship Program to $35 million. The \nGAANN fellowship program helps to support graduate study in areas of \nnational need such as chemistry, computer and information science, \nengineering, mathematics and physics. The Jacob Javits Fellowship \nProgram helps support graduate study in the arts, humanities and social \nsciences.\n  To encourage greater participation by minority students in graduate \nstudies, the Act creates the Patsy T. Mink Fellowship Program to offer \nassistance to underrepresented minority students pursuing a doctoral \ndegree. The Patsy T. Mink Fellowship Program will help address the \nimportant problem of underrepresentation of students from certain \nminority groups in graduate education.\n  To help students afford the costs of graduation education, the GRAD \nAct expands the tax-exempt status of scholarships to treat reasonable \nroom and board allowances as part of permitted higher education \nexpenses. The Act revises the cost of attendance calculations for \nfinancial aid for students with dependents to reflect the true cost of \nliving expenses for themselves and their children. The Act increases \nthe amount of earnings students can set aside without having to apply \nthose earnings to the cost of attendance. The GRAD Act also increases \nthe unsubsidized Stafford loan limit for graduate and professional \nstudents from $10,000 to $12,500 so they are less likely to have to \nturn to more expensive private loans.\n  The Getting Results for Advanced Degrees Act will help students meet \nthe financial challenges faced in pursuing graduate studies. The Act \nstrengthens programs that support graduate students in areas of vital \nimportance to our Nation and makes assistance available to \nunderrepresented minority students pursuing a doctoral degree. By \nhelping students to pursue and afford graduate education, the GRAD Act \nwill help individuals, families and the nation as a whole, realize the \nimportant benefits of graduate education.\n  I hope more of my colleagues will join me in support of graduate \neducation by signing on this bill. By working together, I believe that \nthe Senate as a body can act to ensure that more individuals are able \nto pursue graduate education and assist our Nation in meeting the \nchallenges faced in a global economy.\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2730. A bill to amend title V, XVIII, and XIX of the Social \nSecurity Act to promote cessation of tobacco use under the medicare \nprogram, the medicaid program, and the maternal and child health \nservices block grant program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nexpands treatment to millions of Americans suffering from a deadly \naddiction: tobacco. The Medicare, Medicaid and MCH Smoking Cessation \nPromotion Act of 2004 will help make smoking cessation therapy \naccessible to recipients of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Maternal and \nChild Health (MCH) Program.\n  We have long known that cigarette smoking is the largest preventable \ncause of death, accounting for 20 percent of all deaths in this \ncountry. It is well documented that smoking causes virtually all cases \nof lung cancer and contributes to coronary heart disease, peripheral \nvascular disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and other deadly \nhealth ailments.\n  The harmful effects of smoking do not end with the smoker. A recent \nreport issued by the American Legacy Foundation cites the effects of \nsecond-hand smoke on children of smokers. In addition to the cost of \nhealth complications of asthma and chronic ear infections in children, \nthe report indicates that 43,000 children are orphaned every year \nbecause of tobacco-related deaths.\n  Still, despite enormous health risks, 45 million adults in the United \nStates smoke cigarettes. Of those, low income and racial minorities \nmake up a disproportionate share. While 22.5 percent of the general \nadult population in the U.S. are current smokers, the percentage is \nabout 50 percent higher among Medicaid recipients. Thirty-six percent \nof adults covered by Medicaid smoke.\n  We are not only paying a heavy health toll, but an economic price as \nwell. According to the Center for Tobacco Cessation, about 14 percent \nof all Medicaid expenditures on average are related to smoking. That's \nnot surprising, given that smokers incur an average of $1,041 more in \nannual medical costs than non-smokers.\n  Today, however, we have identified clinically proven, effective \nstrategies to help smokers quit. Advancements in treating tobacco use \nand nicotine addiction using pharmacotherapy and counseling have helped \nmillions kick the habit. The Surgeon General's 2000 Report, Reducing \nTobacco Use, concluded that ``pharmacologic treatment of nicotine \naddiction, combined with behavioral support, will enable 10 to 25 \npercent of users to remain abstinent at one year of post-treatment.\n  Studies have shown that reducing adult smoking through tobacco use \ntreatment pays immediate dividends, both in terms of health \nimprovements and cost savings. Creating a new nonsmoker reduces \nanticipated medical costs associated with acute myocardial infarction \nand stroke by $47 in the first year and by $853 during the next seven \nyears in 1995 dollars. Within four to five years after tobacco \ncessation, quitters use fewer health care services than continued \nsmokers.\n  New Jersey and Oregon have provided Medicaid coverage for counseling \nand drugs as recommended by the Public Health Service, and both states \nnow have among the lowest smoking-related Medicaid costs.\n  The health benefits tobacco quitters enjoy are also undisputed. They \nlive longer, and after 15 years, the risk of premature death for ex-\nsmokers returns to nearly the level of persons who have never smoked. \nMale smokers who quit between just the ages of 35 and 39 add an average \nof five years to their lives; women can add three years. Even older \nAmericans over age 65 can extend their life expectancy by giving up \ncigarettes.\n  Former smokers are also healthier. They are less likely to die of \nchronic lung diseases, and after ten smoke-free years, their risk of \nlung cancer drops to as much as one-half that of those who continue to \nsmoke. After five to fifteen years the risk of stroke and heart disease \nfor ex-smokers returns to the level of those who have never smoked. \nThey have fewer days of illness, reduced rates of bronchitis and \npneumonia, and fewer health complaints.\n  Public Health Service Guidelines released a few years ago conclude \nthat tobacco dependence treatments are both clinically effective and \ncost-effective relative to other medical and disease prevention \ninterventions. The guidelines urge health care insurers and purchasers \nto include counseling and FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments as a \ncovered benefit.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government, a major purchaser of health \ncare through Medicare and Medicaid, does not currently adhere to its \nown published guidelines. It is high time that government-sponsored \nhealth programs catch up with science. That is why I am introducing \nlegislation to improve smoking cessation benefits in government-\nsponsored health programs.\n  The Medicare, Medicaid, and MCH Smoking Cessation Promotion Act of \n2004 improves access to and coverage of smoking cessation treatment \ntherapies in three meaningful ways.\n  First, this bill adds a smoking cessation counseling benefit and \ncoverage of FDA-approved tobacco cessation drugs to Medicare. The bill \nrequires all prescription drug sponsors to provide coverage for tobacco \ncessation drugs under Medicare's prescription drug coverage. It also \ndefines over-the-counter agents as covered drugs, as long as those \ndrugs are prescribed by a doctor or other authorized medical \nprofessional. By 2020, 17 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 \nyears of age or older. It is estimated that Medicare will pay $800 \nbillion to treat tobacco-related diseases over the next twenty years. \nIn a study of adults 65 years of age or older who received advice to \nquit, behavioral counseling and pharmacologic therapy, 24.8 percent \nreported having stopped smoking six months following the intervention. \nThe total economic benefits of quitting after age 65 are notable. Due \nto a reduction in the risk of lung cancer, coronary heart disease and \nemphysema, studies have found that heavy smokers over age 65 who quit \ncan avoid up to $4,592 in lifelong illness-related costs.\n  Second, this bill provides coverage for counseling, prescription and \nnon-prescription smoking cessation drugs in the Medicaid program. The \nbill eliminates the provision in current federal law that allows states \nto exclude FDA-approved smoking cessation therapies from coverage under \nMedicaid. Despite the fact that the states have received payments from \ntheir successful federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry, less \nthan half the states provide coverage for smoking cessation in their \nMedicaid program.\n  Even if Medicaid covered cessation products and services exclusively \nto pregnant women, we would see significant cost savings and health \nimprovements. Children whose mothers smoke during pregnancy are almost \ntwice as likely to develop asthma as those whose mothers did not. Over \nseven years, reducing smoking prevalence by just one percentage point \namong pregnant women would prevent 57,200 low birth weight births and \nsave $572 million in direct medical costs.\n  Third, this bill ensures that the Maternal and Child Health Program \nrecognizes that medications used to promote smoking cessation and the \ninclusion of anti-tobacco messages in health promotion are considered \npart of quality maternal and child health services\n  I hope my colleagues will join me not only in cosponsoring this \nlegislation but also in working with me to see that its provisions are \nadopted. As the Surgeon General has said, ``Although our knowledge \nabout tobacco control remains imperfect, we know more than enough to \nact now.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n        Durbin, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2731. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ncertain interstate conduct relating to exotic animals; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Captive Exotic \nAnimal Protection Act of 2004. This Act would prohibit the barbaric and \nunsporting practice of ``canned hunts.'' I am pleased to be joined by \nmy cosponsors, Senators Biden, Kennedy, Levin, Corzine, Feinstein, \nFeingold, Kohl, Durbin and Schumer.\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\n  Canned hunts take place on private land under circumstances that \nvirtually assure hunters of a kill. Although they advertise under a \nvariety of names, such as hunting preserves or game ranches, canned \nhunts have two things in common: they charge a fee for killing an \nanimal; and they violate the generally accepted practices of the \nhunting community, which are based on the concept of ``fair chase.'' \nSome canned hunts specialize in native species, such as white-tailed \ndeer or elk, while others deal in exotic, non-native, animals that are \neither bred on-site or bought from dealers or breeders. Exotic animals \nmay include surplus animals bought from wild animal parks, circuses, \nand petting zoos. Many canned hunts offer both native and exotic \nspecies to their customers. The Humane Society of the United States \nestimates that there are more than 1000 canned hunt operations in at \nleast 25 different States.\n  Canned hunts cater to persons who lack the time, and sometimes the \nskill, for normal sports hunting, but who have the money to pay the \nhefty fees charged for trophy kills. They do not require skill in \ntracking or shooting. For a price, many canned hunts guarantee a \n``hunter'' a kill of the animal of their choice. A wild boar ``kill'' \nmay sell for up to $1000, a water buffalo for $3500, and a red deer for \nup to $6000.\n  The ``hunt'' of these tame animals occurs within a fenced enclosure, \nleaving the animal virtually no chance for escape. Fed and cared for by \nhumans, these animals have often lost their instinctive impulse to flee \nfrom hunters who ``stalk'' them. In addition to fencing, canned hunts \nuse other practices to assure their customers a kill. They employ \nguides who are intimately familiar with their preserve or ranch, \nincluding locations where animals like to eat, bed down, and hide, and \nmay use food plots and feeding stations to attract animals and make \nthem easy targets from nearby shooting blinds or stands--all practices \nwhich are prohibited by many State game commissions.\n  Canned hunts are strongly condemned by animal protection groups. The \nFund for Animals has launched a national campaign against what it calls \na ``cruel, unsporting, and egregious type of hunting.'' The Humane \nSociety says that ``There is no more repugnant hunting practice than \nshooting tame, exotic mammals in fenced enclosures for a fee in order \nto obtain a trophy.'' The group believes that federal legislation is \nneeded ``to halt the cruel and unsportsmanlike business of canned \nhunts.''\n  Canned hunts violate the principles of the sport of hunting. The \nBoone and Crockett Club, a hunting organization founded by Teddy \nRoosevelt, defines ``fair chase'' as the ``ethical, sportsmanlike, and \nlawful pursuit and taking of any free-ranging wild, native North \nAmerican big game animal in a manner that does not give the hunter an \nimproper advantage over such animals.'' Surely exotic animals held in \ncanned hunt facilities can in no way be considered ``free-ranging,'' \nand the hunters at such facilities clearly have an enormous ``improper \nadvantage'' over the animals.\n  In addition to being unethical, canned hunts may pose a serious \nhealth and safety threat to domestic livestock and native wildlife. \nAccidental escapes of exotic animals from game ranches are not \nuncommon, posing a danger to nearby livestock and indigenous wildlife. \nA dire threat to native deer and elk populations in this country is \nchronic wasting disease, the deer equivalent of mad cow disease. In \nsome States, experts believe that canned hunts, with their fences and \nhigh concentrations of animals, are encouraging transmission of this \ndisease.\n  In recognition of these threats, several states have banned canned \nhunting of mammals. Unfortunately, most states lack laws to outlaw this \npractice. Because interstate commerce in exotic animals is common, \nFederal legislation is essential to control these cruel practices.\n  My bill is essentially the same as legislation S. 1655, that was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee late in the 107th Congress and \nsponsored by Senator Biden. It is similar to legislation that I \nintroduced in the 106th, S. 1345, 105th, S. 995, and 104th, S. 1493, \nCongresses. The legislation that I am introducing today will target \nonly canned hunt facilities that allow the hunting of exotic, non-\nnative, mammals. It is important to note what the bill does and does \nnot do: (1) The bill does not regulate the hunting of native mammals, \nsuch as white-tail deer; (2) the bill does not regulate the hunting of \nbirds, native or exotic, such as doves, pheasants, and mallard ducks; \n(3) the bill protects only exotic, non-native, mammals that have been \nconfined for the greater part of the animal's life or a year, whichever \nis shorter; (4) the bill does not cover exotic mammals living as they \nwould in the wild on large preserves where they have an opportunity to \navoid hunters, 1000 acres or larger; and (5) the bill regulates the \nconduct of persons who operate canned hunts or traffic in exotic \nmammals used in such hunts, not the hunters who patronize canned hunt \nfacilities. In summary, my bill would merely ban the transport and \ntrade of non-native, exotic mammals for the purpose of staged trophy \nhunts.\n  The idea of a defenseless animal meeting a violent end as the target \nof a canned hunt is, at the very least, distasteful to many Americans. \nIn an era when we are seeking to curb violence in our culture, canned \nhunts are certainly one form of gratuitous brutality that does not \nbelong in our society. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis legislation, which will help end this needless practice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2731\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Captive Exotic Animal \n     Protection Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The ethic of hunting involves the consideration of fair \n     chase, which allows the animal the opportunity to avoid the \n     hunter.\n       (2) At more than 1,000 commercial canned hunt operations \n     across the country, trophy hunters pay a fee to shoot captive \n     exotic animals, from African lions to giraffes and blackbuck \n     antelope, in fenced-in enclosures.\n       (3) Clustered in a captive setting at unusually high \n     densities, confined exotic animals attract disease more \n     readily than more widely dispersed native species who roam \n     freely.\n       (4) The transportation of captive exotic animals to \n     commercial canned hunt operations can facilitate the spread \n     of disease across great distances.\n       (5) The regulation of the transport and treatment of exotic \n     animals on shooting preserves falls outside the traditional \n     domains of State agriculture departments and State fish and \n     game agencies.\n       (6) This Act is limited in its purpose and will not limit \n     the licensed hunting of any native mammals or any native or \n     exotic birds.\n       (7) This Act does not aim to criticize those hunters who \n     pursue animals that are not enclosed within a fence.\n       (8) This Act does not attempt to prohibit slaughterhouse \n     activities, nor does it aim to prohibit the routine \n     euthanasia of domesticated farm animals.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide grants for use by rural local educational \nagencies in purchasing new school buses; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are still small towns in America where \nthe citizens wait for a doctor to make rounds, a mail truck to drop off \nthe mail. These families have elected to stay in their communities \ndespite all the obstacles, and they deserve an opportunity to enjoy a \ngood quality of life.\n  But sometimes, the challenges of living in rural America can be \noverwhelming--especially as they relate to identifying and securing \nFederal education funding.\n  There are hundreds of Federal education grants that currently provide \nan array of support for local education agencies: literacy programs, \nEnglish learner's programs, after school programs--just to name a few.\n  Most of the time these Federal dollars and grants end up going to \nlarger urban school districts, not to the little rural ones. One reason \nis because rural school districts simply don't have the resources \nneeded to write the grant applications or oversee the program.\n  Or perhaps rural educators don't even realize they are qualified to \napply for a particular grant, or they don't have the infrastructure \nneeded to support the initiative.\n  Many years ago when I attended school in Searchlight, we had one \nteacher who taught grades 1 through 8. There are still schools in \nNevada where this is the case.\n  I walked to school, and when it was time for high school I hitched a \nride into a town 40 miles away and had to stay with a family during the \nweek. That was the transportation system in rural America back then: \nwalk or hitchhike.\n  Now we have school buses. But many rural areas are operating \noutdated, unsafe school buses that are driven until they finally can't \npass inspection any longer. The skyrocketing gas prices of the past \nseven months have only made the problem worse.\n  These local education agencies are strapped. They can't afford to buy \nnewer, safer buses. I was astonished to learn that the school buses in \nsome rural Nevada counties travel a combined 1 million miles in a \nschool year.\n  The superintendents in my State asked me for help. They identified \ntheir need for school buses, and I want to help.\n  I am introducing legislation today that will help rural school \ndistricts transport children to school in a way that is safe, \naffordable and environmentally sound.\n  The ``Bus Utility and Safety in School Transportation Opportunity and \nPurchasing Act of 2004''--or BUS STOP--authorizes the Federal \nGovernment to provide $50,000,000 in grants on a competitive basis to \nrural local educational agencies seeking Federal share assistance to \npurchase school buses. The Federal share will be 75 percent.\n  Each applicant must provide documentation that at least 50 percent of \ntheir school buses are in need of repair or replacement; the total \nmileage each bus traveled in the most recent school year; documentation \nthat the applicant is operating with a depleted fleet; and assurance \nthat the school system will pay the local share for the purchase of new \nschool buses.\n  In an effort to promote clean air, the Environmental Protection \nAgency has already established a cost-share grant program that will \nhelp local school systems replace old school buses, install pollution \ncontrol devices, and eliminate unnecessary idling.\n  The EPA is seeking to improve air quality by encouraging large school \ndistricts to voluntarily cut emissions. The EPA awarded $5 million in \ngrants to 20 school districts last month and $5 million to 17 school \ndistricts last year.\n  Unfortunately this is an example of a program that my rural counties \ndidn't apply for because they don't have the infrastructure in place to \nsupport clean buses. However, working in the spirit of clean air and \nhealthy children, rural school districts can buy newer buses that are \nbetter for our air, and safer for our children.\n  My office has already received phone calls from the education \ndepartments from other states. They want to know if the rumor is true: \nis there finally going to be legislation to help us purchase school \nbuses?\n  The answer is yes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 2732\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bus Utility and Safety in \n     School Transportation Opportunity and Purchasing Act of \n     2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) school transportation issues have concerned parents, \n     local educational agencies, lawmakers, the National Highway \n     Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation \n     Safety Board, and the Environmental Protection Agency for \n     years;\n       (2) millions of children face potential future health \n     problems because of exposure to noxious fumes emitted from \n     older school buses;\n       (3) the Environmental Protection Agency established the \n     Clean School Bus USA program to replace 129,000 of the oldest \n     diesel buses that cannot be retrofitted in an effort to help \n     children and the environment by improving air quality;\n       (4) unfortunately, many rural local educational agencies \n     are unable to participate in that program because of the \n     specialized fuels needed to sustain a clean bus fleet;\n       (5) many rural local educational agencies are operating \n     outdated, unsafe school buses that are failing inspection \n     because of automotive flaws, resulting in a depletion of \n     school bus fleets of the local educational agencies; and\n       (6) many rural local educational agencies are unable to \n     afford to buy newer, safer buses.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish \n     within the Environmental Protection Agency a Federal cost-\n     sharing program to assist rural local educational agencies \n     with older, unsafe school bus fleets in purchasing newer, \n     safer school buses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to implement the recommendations of the Inspector \nGeneral of the Department of the Interior regarding Indian Tribal \ndetention facilities; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce The Indian \nTribal Detention Facility Reform Act of 2004 which proposes sweeping \nreforms to operation of tribal detention systems in American Indian \ncommunities.\n  The bill will launch significant efforts to address the third world \nconditions plaguing this system, problems which were the subject of a \nseries of articles in the USA Today and other national newspapers.\n  On June 23, 2004, the Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing on \nthe operation and condition of these detention facilities and the \ntestimony we received was very disturbing.\n  At the hearing, the Inspector General of the Department of Interior \nreported that after reports from a variety of sources, including the \nU.S. Department of Justice, his office began an assessment of the \nphysical condition of these facilities and how they are operated.\n  The Inspector General also testified about numerous examples of \ninmate suicides, escapes, neglect, overcrowding and other inhumane \nconditions, staffing shortages, inmate access to weapons and poor \nprisoner supervision, all occurring in facilities operated by the \nBureau of Indian Affairs or by Indian tribes, pursuant to contract.\n  The Inspector General reported that the lack of prison monitoring \nsadly resulted in the death of a 16 year old Indian girl who was placed \nin a cell for underage drinking. She later died of alcohol poisoning \nand her family is now considering legal action charging negligence by \nthe jail's managers.\n  The tragic part of the story is that the death might have been \nprevented. But what is even more frightening is that deaths and \nattempted suicides are not isolated events at these facilities.\n  This is but one example brought to the Committee's attention and in \nmy mind these events and conditions are deplorable, inexcusable and \nhave to end.\n  The bill I am introducing today establishes clear lines of authority \nfor detention services by directing the Secretary of Interior to create \na separate branch of detention services. This separate branch will give \nthe proper attention to issues surrounding detention facilities.\n  In addition, the bill will require the creation of reporting \nprotocols on serious incidents, particularly escapes, to proper law \nenforcement authorities. Because in some cases reporting may not be \nsufficient, the bill will also establish criteria for conducting \npreliminary inquiries into serious incidents to determine if there is a \nneed for a full investigation.\n  Finally, the bill requires that the Department of Interior conduct a \nfull report on the conditions and needs of the detention facilities in \nIndian communities, including staffing shortages and training, and a \nplan for addressing the needs.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2734\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Commission to commemorate the 400th \nanniversary of the arrival of Samuel de Champlain in the Champlain \nValley, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I submit today a bill that will assist the \nStates of Vermont and New York in commemorating the extraordinary \ncultural; historical, and recreational heritage of one of Vermont's \ngreatest natural treasures, Lake Champlain.\n  Nearly 400 years ago, in 1609, Samuel de Champlain entered a green \nvalley where he arrived at the lake that today carries his name. Lake \nChamplain stretches nearly 120 miles from Whitehall, NY, to the \nRichelieu River in Quebec and is nestled between the dramatic peaks of \nthe New York's Adirondacks and Vermont's picturesque Green Mountains.\n  The Samuel de Champlain 400th Commemoration Commission Act of 2004 \nwill authorize the National Park Service to fund a Commemoration \nCommittee established with the Governors of Vermont and New York in \norder to plan national events for 2009 that celebrate the arrival of \nSamuel de Champlain and the rich heritage of the lake--which includes \nall people present when Champlain arrived in the valley and the \ncommunities that exist today.\n  We Vermonters sometimes affectionately refer to Lake Champlain as the \n``Sixth Great Lake,'' and I have many fond memories of this wonderful \nlake. As a boy I spent time fishing and boating in its waters and over \nthe years have taken my family on many enjoyable ferry rides across the \nlake. More recently I have become an avid scuba diver, and my own \nexplorations of shipwreck sites in the lake have inspired me to educate \nothers about its history and work to help preserve its unique heritage.\n  Just as in my own family's history, Lake Champlain's history links \ntogether Vermont and our Nation's storied histories.\n  Shortly after Champlain entered the region, what is now known as Lake \nChamplain was quickly recognized as the vital transportation route for \nthe Northeast which had been used by Native peoples for centuries. \nEarly settlers used the lake to explore unknown lands and create new \nsettlements in the wilderness of Colonial North America.\n\n  Lake Champlain is awash in a rich maritime history. The chain of \nlakes that includes Lake Champlain has been called the ``The Great \nWarpath'' because of its use by early Colonial armies and flotillas. It \nplayed a critical role in the birth of the United States Navy through \nearly military and naval struggles played out along its shores and in \nits bays.\n  The most famous naval battle on Lake Champlain occurred in 1776, \nduring the American Revolutionary War, when Benedict Arnold managed to \nsuccessfully delay a British invasion of the rebelling colonies at the \nBattle of Valcour Island.\n  Lake Champlain holds one of the largest and best preserved \ncollections of historic naval and other shipwrecks. As an avid scuba \ndiver, I have viewed many of the shipwrecks first hand and am always \nawed by how well they have been preserved.\n  The Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, Lake Champlain Basin Program, and \nmany other Vermonters and New Yorkers have worked hard to preserve our \nfabulous maritime archaeological heritage so that other intrepid \nadventurers can dive in and explore a part of Vermont's past that \nhelped shape the direction of our developing Nation.\n  Over the years as my family and I explored the lake's maritime \nhistory we also learned about its role in the growing economy of our \nyoung Nation. As the United States became more settled and stable, Lake \nChamplain became a center of flourishing commerce in the Northeast and \na critical conduit for getting goods up and down the eastern seaboard.\n  In fact, historians call the 19th nineteenth century Lake Champlain's \n``Golden Era'' of waterborne commerce. During that time the lake's \npeaceful waters were churning with the wakes of hundreds of steamboats, \ncanal boats, ferries, merchant sloops and schooners--all plying their \ntrade to markets in the Northeast and abroad.\n  Today, the storied waters of Lake Champlain are treasured by \nVermonters and New Yorkers and millions more as an outstanding natural, \ncultural, and recreational resource. Activities such as boating, \nfishing, and tourism help Lake Champlain support a regional economy of \nmore than $9 billion dollars. No other inland body of water has played \nsuch a decisive role in the history of the United States as has Lake \nChamplain.\n  The arrival of Samuel de Champlain had profound influence on our \nNation's history that goes far beyond the simple naming of a lake--this \nevent lead to a multitude of great historic, cultural, and economic \nachievements that to this day continue to influence life throughout the \nUnited States.\n  This legislation will help our country and the many small towns and \ngroups around Lake Champlain properly celebrate our common heritage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2739. A bill to improve the training and retention of health \nprofessionals under titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Health care continues to be among the fastest growing \nsectors of the U.S. economy. From 1970 to 2002, the health care \nconsumption doubled from 7 to 14 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic \nProduct (GDP). Employment in health occupations is projected to \nincrease from 11 million in 2000 to 14 million by 2010. In that same \nperiod, the growth rate for new job creation in health care occupations \nis expected to be 29 percent more than double the growth projected for \nnon-health occupations. Over 5.3 million people will be needed to fill \nthese health-related positions. However, as a nation, we are not \neducating and training sufficient numbers of healthcare workers and \nproviders, and therefore failing the American people.\n  There are two ways in which we are failing our citizens. The first is \nan over-reliance on foreign healthcare workers. Instead of committing \nourselves to training and educating Americans, we are importing large \nnumbers of foreigners to meet our public health needs. For example, 25 \npercent of all physicians in the U.S. are immigrants, as are 16 percent \nof all laboratory technicians. Although these foreign workers are \nfilling an important void, and are both qualified and competent, \nthousands of qualified Americans wishing to pursue an education in \nhealthcare fields are turned down every year. It's time we stop \nimporting our skilled workers and start investing in the expansion of a \nskilled workforce in our own country. In fact, given the recent \neconomic downturn, and the high level of unemployment in our country, \npreparing Americans to work in an expanding job market such as \nhealthcare is the right thing to do.\n  The second way in which we are failing the American people is by not \neducating and training sufficient numbers of racial and ethnic \nminorities to work in the healthcare system. The racial/ethnic \ncomposition of the U.S. healthcare workforce does not reflect that of \nthe general population. For example, while Blacks, Hispanics, and \nNative Americans represented 26 percent of the general population in \n2002, they only represented 6 percent of physicians.\n  A recent study of New Mexico healthcare professionals concluded that \n88 percent of physicians are non-Hispanic Whites, while only 6.5 \npercent are Hispanic. Overall, ethnic/racial minorities are \ninadequately represented in all healthcare professions in New Mexico. \nAdditionally, in my State, 21 percent of Internal Medicine Specialists \nare international medical school graduates, and so are 15 percent of \nprimary care physicians.\n  A recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) study described compelling \nevidence for the need to increase diversity within the health \nworkforce. Diversity ensures access to healthcare for underserved \npopulations and greater patient satisfaction. Many segments of the U.S. \npopulation, particularly minority groups, reside in medically \nunderserved areas. Black and Hispanic health workers are more likely to \nprovide healthcare to Black and Hispanic patients, to serve poor, \nuninsured, or Medicaid-insured patients, and to locate their practices \nin underserved\n\n[[Page S8715]]\n\nareas. Furthermore, racial/ethnic minority patients are more satisfied \nwith their providers when they are of the same racial/ethnic group.\n  It is time we invest in our healthcare workforce; in our people; in \nour future. That is why I am introducing the ``Investing in America's \nFuture Act of 2004'' today. This bill has several components aimed at \nimproving and expanding education and training for healthcare workers.\n  This bill will provide incentives for Americans to seek and complete \nhigh-quality allied health education and training. It will also expand \nthe Health Career Opportunities Program, which is aimed at enhancing \nthe academic skills of students from disadvantaged backgrounds and \nsupporting them in successfully entering and graduating from health \nprofessions training programs. It creates programs of excellence in \nhealth professions education for underrepresented minorities, and a \nhealth professions student loan fund for low-income and racial/ethnic \nminority students. Finally, this bill also establishes a Health Work \nAdvisory Commission, charged with creating a national vision to serve \nas a map for investing in the health workforce.\n  We must ensure that qualified Americans who wish to enter the health \nworkforce are able to do so, and we must support the training and \neducation of the generations of Americans to come. In doing so, not \nonly will we help more Americans hold good jobs, but we will also \nprovide better healthcare to underserved and disadvantaged groups.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nin the Record.\n  There being two objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2739\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSES.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to ensure that the United \n     States health care industry will have a supply of allied \n     health professionals needed to support the Nation's health \n     care system in this decade and beyond by--\n       (1) providing incentives for members of the United States \n     population to seek and complete high-quality allied health \n     education and training; and\n       (2) providing additional funding to ensure that such \n     education and training can be provided to allied health \n     students.\n\n     SEC. 103.

A bill to improve dental services in underserved areas by \namending the Public Health Service Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, every year, I spend time driving across \nthe State of South Dakota, and every year, I hear unbelievable stories \nfrom my constituents about the growing health care crisis in South \nDakota and across America. One issue that comes up repeatedly in my \ntravels is South Dakota's dental shortage.\n  The statistics speak for themselves. Almost one-third of my State's \n66 counties have been designated Dental Health Professional Shortage \nAreas. In total, over 97,000 South Dakotans live in a county that does \nnot have enough dentists to meet the needs of the population. \nNationally, 25 million Americans reside in such shortage areas.\n  South Dakota has only one dentist for every 250 square miles, which \nmeans that many South Dakotans must travel more than 100 miles to visit \na dentist. To see a pediatric dentist, parents often have to travel up \nto 400 miles. I've heard stories of families driving clear across the \nState so that their children can receive urgent dental care. \nComparatively, Minnesota's rate is 28 square miles per dentist. \nMassachusetts's rate is less than 2 square miles per dentist, and here \nin Washington, DC, the rate is 0.1 square miles per dentist.\n  In addition, the dentists my State does have are getting older. A \nstudy conducted in South Dakota found that roughly half of the dentists \ncurrently practicing there are over 50 years old, and that 30 percent \nplan to retire within 10 years. Nationally, more than 20 percent of \ndentists will retire in the next 10 years, and the number of dental \ngraduates by 2015 may not be enough to replace them.\n  The problem in Indian country is even worse. Indian pre-school \nchildren have 5 times the rate of dental decay experienced by other \nchildren in their age group. Despite this great need, the Indian Health \nServices estimates that one-third of its dental positions are vacant.\n  A report by the Government Accounting Office in 2000 found that, \nwhile several factors contribute to the low use of dental services \namong low-income individuals, the most important factor was the \ninability to find a\n\n[[Page S8721]]\n\ndentist to treat them. That is simply unacceptable.\n  Another report by Oral Health America in 2003 found that the United \nStates does poorly in several areas that measure access to dental care. \nIn fact, in the report's assessment of dentist availability, the \nmajority of States received a grade of C or lower. The report card also \nfound that those with the greatest need have the hardest time finding \ncare; 18 states received a failing grade for the availability of \ndentists who provide significant services under Medicaid, contributing \nto an alarming D grade for the entire nation.\n  In an effort to address this urgent problem, I have been working with \nrepresentatives from the South Dakota Oral Health Coalition to develop \na legislative remedy at the Federal level. The culmination of that \neffort is the bill I am introducing today, the Dental Health Provider \nShortage Act. Together with Senator Collins--herself a longtime \nsupporter of expanding access to dental care--I am proud to introduce \nthis bill, which would help to expand the number of dentists and dental \nhygienists, both nationwide and in rural and underserved areas.\n  Specifically, the Dental Heath Provider Shortage Act would work to \nincrease the overall number of dentists and dental hygienists by \nproviding faculty loan repayment programs for dentists who agree to \nteach, especially in general and pediatric training programs. It would \nalso provide incentives for dentists and dental hygienists to work in \nrural and underserved areas by expanding both the National Health \nService Corps and the Indian Health Service; providing support to \nCommunity Health Centers, which play a critical role in the delivery of \ndental care; and helping these centers and other providers that work in \nunderserved areas to expand their practices. Finally, to encourage \nparticipation in State Medicaid programs, the bill would provide \nfunding for states to simplify the Medicaid enrollment and payment \nprocess.\n  In this day and age, people should not be forced to travel great \ndistances--let alone more than 100 miles--just to see a dentist. We can \nand must do better. The Surgeon General's report, ``Oral Health in \nAmerica,'' reinforced that oral health is essential to the general \nhealth and well-being of all Americans. In its ``Call to Action,'' the \nreport challenged the Nation to build a health infrastructure that can \neffectively meet the oral health needs of all Americans. By passing the \nbipartisan Dental Health Provider Shortage Act, we can begin to do just \nthat.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2740\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nand extend the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome prevention and services program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nAdvancing FASD Research, Prevention, and Services Act. For many years \nnow, I have met and worked with people whose lives have been profoundly \naffected by the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Prenatal \nexposure to alcohol can cause a wide range of serious, life-long \nproblems known as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorders. Individuals with \nFASD can have a low IQ, behavioral impairments, growth retardation, \nfacial abnormalities, and birth defects. About 40,000 children are born \nwith FASD each year.\n  A great deal of progress has been made in raising awareness of the \ndangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, but much more needs to \nbe done. The bill I am introducing today addresses the need for more \nresearch, better screening systems to identify children with FASD, \neffective prevention programs, and enhanced access to treatment and \nsupport services. It is my sincere hope that this bill--when combined \nwith the tireless efforts of parents, health professionals, teachers, \nand countless others--will help prevent FASD and support the children \nand families who are living with its consequences. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a fact sheet containing a description of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 2741\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing FASD Research, \n     Prevention, and Services Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders are the spectrum of \n     serious, life-long disorders caused by prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol, which include Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Alcohol-\n     Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder, and Alcohol-Related \n     Birth Defects.\n       (2) In the decades that have passed since Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome was first recognized in the United States, this \n     fully preventable condition has continued to affect American \n     children and families.\n       (3) Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause brain damage that \n     produces cognitive and behavioral impairments. Prenatal \n     alcohol exposure can cause mental retardation or low IQ and \n     difficulties with learning, memory, attention, and problem-\n     solving. It can also create problems with mental health and \n     social interactions.\n       (4) Prenatal alcohol exposure also can cause growth \n     retardation, birth defects involving the heart, kidney, \n     vision and hearing, and a characteristic pattern of facial \n     abnormalities.\n       (5) About 13 percent of women report using alcohol during \n     pregnancy even though there is no known safe level of alcohol \n     consumption during pregnancy.\n       (6) Estimates of individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     vary but are estimated to be between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 \n     births. The prevalence rate is considerably higher for all \n     Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: about 10 out of 1,000 \n     births (1 percent of births).\n       (7) Prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders can be \n     even higher in certain populations, such as Native Americans, \n     and in certain areas, such as those characterized by low \n     socioeconomic status.\n       (8) Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders pose extraordinary \n     financial costs to the Nation, including the cost of \n     specialized health care, education, foster care, \n     incarceration, job training, and general support services for \n     individuals affected by Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.\n       (9) Lifetime health costs for an individual with Fetal \n     Alcohol Syndrome average $860,000, and can run as high as \n     $4,200,000. The direct and indirect economic costs of Fetal \n     Alcohol Syndrome in the United States were $5,400,000,000 in \n     2003. Total economic costs would be even higher for all Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.\n       (10) There is a great need for research, surveillance, \n     prevention, treatment, and support services for individuals \n     with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and their families.\n\n     SEC. 3.

But more research is needed. The bill would require \n     the National Institutes of Health to develop a research \n     agenda for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) that would \n     include research related to:\n       Identifying the mechanisms that produce the cognitive and \n     behavioral problems associated with fetal alcohol exposure; \n     development of a neurocognitive phenotype for FAS and \n     Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND); \n     identifying biological markers that indicate fetal alcohol \n     exposure; identifying risk factors that increase \n     susceptibility to FASD; investigating new approaches for \n     sustaining recovery from alcohol dependence; developing \n     therapeutic\n\n[[Page S8727]]\n\n     interventions for individuals with FASD; developing screening \n     instruments to identify women who consume alcohol during \n     pregnancy; and understanding the behavioral disorders \n     associated with FASD.\n\n\n              surveillance, identification, and prevention\n\n       FASD is often difficult to identify, which complicates \n     efforts to accurately estimate its prevalence. Improved \n     surveillance of FASD is needed to better understand the scope \n     of the problem and to effectively deploy public health \n     resources. The bill would improve surveillance and prevention \n     by:\n       Developing a comprehensive screening process for FASD; \n     monitoring risk factors for FASD such as alcohol consumption \n     among pregnant women and women of child-bearing age; and \n     conducting research on prevention and implementing strategies \n     for reducing alcohol-exposed pregnancies.\n\n\n                           state fasd systems\n\n       To improve surveillance, prevention, and treatment of \n     individuals with FASD, the bill would facilitate the \n     development of statewide FASD systems. To be eligible for \n     federal grants, a state would have to develop a strategic \n     plan for preventing and treating FASD, consult with public \n     and non-profit private organizations with relevant expertise, \n     including family organizations, and designate an individual \n     as the state's FASD program coordinator.\n       States would be required to identify existing state \n     programs that could be used for identification, prevention, \n     and treatment of FASD and to identify barriers that \n     individuals with FASD may now experience when trying to \n     access those programs. States could use the federal funds for \n     a number of activities, including:\n       Establishing statewide surveillance systems and diagnostic \n     centers; developing and implementing prevention programs, \n     including public awareness campaigns; referring individuals \n     with FASD to appropriate support services; developing and \n     sharing best practices; training health care providers; and \n     disseminating information about FASD and the availability of \n     support services.\n\n\n                         community partnerships\n\n       Responding to FASD at the community level is also \n     important. The bill would provide federal grants to \n     partnerships of health professionals, school systems, child \n     welfare offices, incarceration facilities, parent \n     organizations, Indian tribes and others within a community. \n     These community partnerships would collaborate on common \n     objectives and integrate services. Federal funds could be \n     used to:\n       Identify and integrate existing services; identify services \n     not available in a community; develop community-based \n     initiatives to prevent, diagnose, treat and provide support \n     services to individuals with FASD; disseminate information; \n     develop community-wide public awareness and outreach \n     campaigns; and provide mentoring or other support for \n     families of individuals with FASD.\n\n\n                             best practices\n\n       Individuals with FASD can find themselves in a number of \n     settings and under the supervision of individuals not trained \n     to work with them. The bill would provide federal grants for \n     pilot projects to identify and implement best practices for:\n       Educating children with FASD within the school system; \n     educating judges, attorneys, child advocates, law enforcement \n     officers, prison wardens, and others on how to treat and \n     support individuals with FASD within the criminal justice \n     system; and educating adoption or foster care agency \n     officials about available and necessary services for children \n     with FASD.\n\n\n                            support services\n\n       Individuals with FASD often need special support services \n     as they transition from adolescence to adulthood. The bill \n     would provide federal grants that could be used to:\n       Provide housing assistance to adults with FASD; provide \n     vocational training and placement services to adults with \n     FASD; provide medication monitoring services to adults with \n     FASD; and provide training and support to organizations \n     providing family services or mental health programs and other \n     organizations that work with adults with FASD.\n       The bill would also allow federal funds to be used to \n     provide respite care to caregivers of individuals with FASD, \n     recruit and train mentors for adolescents with FASD, and \n     provide education and support services to families of \n     individuals with FASD.\n\n\n                   community health center initiative\n\n       Community health centers provide primary and preventive \n     health care services in rural and urban communities that are \n     medically underserved. The bill would provide federal grants \n     to implement and evaluate a program to increase awareness and \n     identification of FASD in community health centers. \n     Participating health centers would:\n       Provide training to health care providers on identifying \n     and educating women who are at risk for alcohol consumption \n     during pregnancy; provide training to health care providers \n     on screening children for FASD; and educate health care \n     providers and other health center workers on the availability \n     of support services for individuals with FASD and treatment \n     services for women at risk for alcohol consumption during \n     pregnancy.\n\n\n                     public awareness and education\n\n       Even though FASD is completely preventable, many continue \n     to consume alcohol during pregnancy. The bill would authorize \n     the development and broadcast of national public service \n     announcements to raise public awareness of the risks \n     associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\n\n\n                      national task force on fasd\n\n       The bill would require the National Task Force on FASD to \n     identify and report on the ten most important actions that \n     should be taken to reduce prenatal alcohol exposure and its \n     adverse outcomes, current epidemiological information, \n     innovative prevention models, short-term and long-term \n     recommendations for achieving the Healthy 2010 Objectives for \n     the Nation related to FASD, and a recommendation on whether \n     FAS and other prenatal alcohol disorders should be included \n     in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\n\n\n                  coordination among federal entities\n\n       The bill provides statutory authority for the Interagency \n     Coordinating Committee on FAS and instructs the Comptroller \n     General of the United States to evaluate and make \n     recommendations regarding the appropriate roles and \n     responsibilities of federal entities with programs and \n     activities related to FASD.\n\n\n     prevention, intervention, and services in the education system\n\n       The education system must be involved in efforts to address \n     FASD. The bill would have the Department of Education \n     implement screening procedures, introduce curricula on how to \n     effectively educate and support children with FASD, include \n     information on the danger of alcohol consumption during \n     pregnancy in existing sexual and health education curricula, \n     and adopt other strategies to assist students with FASD.\n\n\n      prevention, intervention, and services in the justice system\n\n       Many FASD adolescents and adults are incarcerated or \n     otherwise involved in the justice system. The bill would have \n     the Attorney General implement screening procedures, \n     introduce training curricula on how to effectively identify \n     and interact with individuals with FASD, track individuals \n     entering the juvenile justice system whose background \n     indicates they have a high probability of having FASD, and \n     develop transition programs for individuals with FASD who are \n     released from incarceration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2742. A bill to extend certain authority of the Supreme Court \nPolice, modify the venue of prosecutions relating to the Supreme Court \nbuilding and grounds, and authorize the acceptance of gifts to the \nUnited States Supreme Court; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Federal courts propose legislation to \nimprove their operational efficiency. Today, joined by Senator Leahy, I \nam introducing legislation requested by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. This bill is non-controversial and I hope the Senate can \ncomplete action on it in a timely manner after we return from our \nAugust recess.\n  There are three sections to this bill which I will describe for the \nbenefit of my colleagues.\n  Section 1. Supreme Court Police Authority to Protect Court Officials \nOff of Court Grounds. This section would extend, for an additional four \nyears, a ``sunset'' provision on authority of the Supreme Court Police \nto protect the Justices and other Court officials and official guests \naway from the Court building and grounds.\n  This authority was established by Public Law 97-390 (12/29/82) and \nwas for a three-year period. Since 1985, the authority has been renewed \nregularly, generally with three or four year extensions and now expires \nat the end of 2004. The extension of the sunset provision would permit \nthe Court Police to carry out this function until 2008. The Court \nPolice regularly provide protection for the Justices away from the \nCourt, and in light of the heightened security threats to symbols of \nour government, it is vital that the Police's authority to carry out \nthis function continue without interruption.\n  Section 2. Venue for violations of Chapter 61 of Title 40. This \nsection would add the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia to the existing statute establishing venue for the prosecution \nof violations of statutes or regulations governing the Supreme Court \nbuilding and grounds under 40 USCS Sec. Sec.  6131 et seq.\n  Section 6137(b) currently permits prosecutions only in Superior \nCourt. The amendment would provide an additional alternative, in light \nof the fact that there are prosecutions under these statutes where \ndistinctly Federal interests are at stake.\n  Prosecutions under this chapter include the following: Sale of \narticles, signs, and solicitation in Supreme Court Building and \ngrounds; destruction of property in the Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S8728]]\n\nBuilding and grounds; possession of firearms, fireworks, unauthorized \nspeeches, and objectionable language in the Supreme Court Building and \ngrounds; and unauthorized parades, assemblages, and display of flags in \nthe Supreme Court Building and grounds.\n  Section 3. Gifts to the Supreme Court. This section would authorize \nthe Chief Justice or his designee to accept, hold, administer and use \ngifts of personal property for official Court purposes. Monetary \nbequests would be turned over to the treasury.\n  In 1978, Congress authorized the Director of the Administrative \nOffice for United States Courts to receive gifts on behalf of the \njudiciary, recognizing at the time that the judiciary had already \nreceived gifts under its implied powers. [See 28 U.S.C. \nSec. 604(a)(17)(B).] Generally, the Director does not have authority \nwith respect to the Supreme Court, and this provision is intended to \nrecognize that the Supreme Court has the authority to receive non-\nmonetary gifts on its own behalf. The language of the provision closely \ntracks the 1978 legislation authorizing the Director to receive gifts \nfor the judiciary.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperative effort that Senator Leahy \nand I have been able to undertake to bring this legislation to the \nSenate and am confident we can work together to ensure timely passage \nof this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2742\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR THE UNITED STATES \n                   SUPREME COURT POLICE TO PROTECT COURT OFFICIALS \n                   OFF THE SUPREME COURT GROUNDS.\n\n       Section 6121(b)(2) of title 40, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``2004'' and inserting ``2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. VENUE FOR PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO THE UNITED STATES \n                   SUPREME COURT BUILDING AND GROUNDS.\n\n       Section 6137 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:\n       ``(b) Venue and Procedure.--Prosecution for a violation \n     described in subsection (a) shall be in the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia or in the \n     Superior Court of the District of Columbia, on information by \n     the United States Attorney or an Assistant United States \n     Attorney.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. GIFTS TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.\n\n       The Chief Justice or his designee is authorized to accept, \n     hold, administer, and utilize gifts and bequests of personal \n     property for the purpose of aiding or facilitating the work \n     of the United States Supreme Court, but gifts or bequests of \n     money shall be covered into the Treasury.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Hollings, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 2743. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \nthat only licensed medical doctors, licensed doctors of osteopathy, and \ncertain licensed dentists may perform eye surgery at Department of \nVeterans Affairs facilities or under contract with the Department; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans \nEye Treatment Safety Act of 2004, or VETS Act, which will protect the \neye care of our veterans by providing that only licensed physicians may \nperform eye surgery at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities \nor under contract with the VA.\n  Presently, 49 out of 50 States prohibit optometrists from performing \nsurgery. Oklahoma is the only State that allows optometrists to perform \nlaser surgical procedures. Recently, Oklahoma enacted a law expanding \nexisting law to allow optometrists to perform nonlaser surgical \nprocedures such as cataract surgery.\n  Under the VA credentialing practice, optometrists have been granted \nlaser surgery clinical privileges within the VA Medical Center. The \nVA's credentialing practice allows medical practitioners to be granted \nprivileges to perform procedures within the VA system that they are \nauthorized to perform in the State in which they are licensed. Thus, an \noptometrist licensed in Oklahoma can be granted clinical privileges to \nperform laser surgery at the VA. In 2003, the VA allowed at least three \noptometrists to perform laser eye surgery at multiple VA hospitals \nthroughout the Nation.\n  This practice is inconsistent with the policies of the Army, Navy, \nand Air Force, which do not allow optometrists to perform eye surgery. \nThe VA, which also treats TRICARE beneficiaries, is the outlier. If a \nmilitary retiree, a TRICARE beneficiary, needs laser eye surgery, only \na licensed medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy could perform it, as \nrequired by the Army, Navy, and Air Force. However, if that same \nTRICARE beneficiary seeks treatment at a VA facility--as is his or her \nright--it is possible that an optometrist could perform the surgery. In \nthis case, such person would receive a lower standard of care than the \nDepartment of Defense would allow in a military treatment facility. \nThis VA credentialing practice regarding eye surgery creates two \nstandards of care: a high standard of care for active duty personnel, \ndependents, and TRICARE beneficiaries when seen in a military treatment \nfacility, and a lower standard of care for TRICARE beneficiaries and \nveterans if treated in the VA system.\n  The VA's practice is questionable. Optometrists typically do not have \nthe requisite training and experience to perform eye surgery. Only one \nschool of optometry in the United States offers courses in laser eye \nsurgery. To become certified, optometrists must complete two courses at \nthis school, with less than 40 hours of training, and perform only four \nsupervised surgeries. In contrast, ophthalmologists during medical \nschool, internship, and residency complete between 9,000 to 12,000 \nhours of training and education before practicing without supervision.\n  The Veterans Eye Treatment Safety Act of 2004 provides that only \nlicensed medical doctors, licensed doctors of osteopathy, or licensed \ndentists whose practice is limited to oral or maxillofacial surgery may \nperform eye surgery at Department of Veterans Affairs facilities or \nunder contract with the department. This legislation is narrowly \ntargeted and does not prevent optometrists from performing noninvasive, \nnonsurgical procedures--the procedures that optometrists are trained \nand qualified to perform. The bill simply ensures that only licensed \nphysicians can perform invasive, surgical procedures on our veterans.\n  The VETS Act has been endorsed by the Vietnam Veterans of America, \nthe National Gulf War Resource Center, the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the American \nOsteopathic Association, and the American College of Surgeons. \nAdditionally, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Blinded Veterans \nAssociation have written letters to the Department of Veterans Affairs \nopposing allowing optometrists to perform surgery.\n  This bill is a patient safety measure that protects our veterans. It \nprotects the law of 49 States, preventing the will of one from becoming \nthe law of the land. We must send a clear message to the VA that \nveterans should receive the same quality eye care that ordinary \ncitizens receive.\n  I would like to thank Senator Cantwell, Senator Hollings, Senator \nFeinstein, and Senator Sessions for cosponsoring this important \nlegislation. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbill that will protect the ocular safety of our veterans--ensuring that \nthey receive the same high level of care that almost all Americans and \nmembers of the armed forces receive.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2743\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Eye Treatment \n     Safety (VETS) Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LIMITATION AS TO PERSONS WHO MAY PERFORM EYE SURGERY \n                   FOR DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.\n\n       Section 1707 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(c)(1) Eye surgery at a Department facility or under \n     contract with the Department may be performed only by an \n     individual who is a licensed medical doctor, a licensed \n     doctor of osteopathy, or a licensed dentist whose practice is \n     limited to the specialty of oral or maxillofacial surgery.\n\n[[Page S8729]]\n\n       ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term `eye \n     surgery' means any procedure involving the eye or the adnexa \n     in which human tissue is cut, burned, frozen, vaporized, \n     ablated, probed, or otherwise altered or penetrated by \n     incision, injection, laser, ultrasound, ionizing radiation, \n     or by other means, in order to treat eye disease, alter or \n     correct refractive error, or alter or enhance cosmetic \n     appearance.

A bill to authorize the minting and issuance of a \nPresidential $1 coin series; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today with the Senator from Nevada, \nSenator Reid, to introduce the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2004. This \nlegislation, which is modeled after the successful 50-State quarter \nprogram, would add the image of U.S. Presidents to the circulating \ndollar coin. I believe this bill, when enacted, will prompt more \nwidespread usage of the dollar coin, earn significant funds for the \nU.S. government and spark new interest in the history of the leaders of \nour Nation.\n  The United States Government currently issues a dollar coin. \nUnfortunately, many Americans don't know about the coin and most don't \nuse them. In fact, the dollar coin has never lived up to its promise to \nbecome a primary component of the American economy. I believe as policy \nmakers, it is our job to ask what this costs our economy and our \ngovernment, why the dollar coin is not widely used, and what can be \ndone to remedy it.\n  With a one-dollar coin in general circulation, our economy will be \nmore efficient, and our government will reap the significant benefits \nthat a fully circulating coin will generate. To illustrate, millions of \nlow-dollar transactions occur in our country every day. Bringing even \nthe smallest efficiency to each would result in significant savings to \nthe economy. For example, the vending machine industry estimates that \nthe effect of a widely circulated dollar coin in its sector alone could \nbe as much as $1 billion in savings: $300 million in increased sales \nand $700 million in reduced maintenance costs. Add to that the savings \nthat businesses would realize by experiencing lower handling costs--\nit's simply much more expensive to sort and count bills than coins--and \none begins to get a sense of the economies that could be achieved if \nour dollar coin program were more of a success.\n  In the public sector, the savings are hardly less dramatic. Informed \nestimates put the effect of a fully circulating dollar coin at as much \nas a $500 million annual infusion to the Treasury general fund. These \nfunds are created by the difference between what it costs to make a \ncoin or bill and what it's worth. For a dollar coin, the difference, \nwhich is called seigniorage, is about 80 cents. While there is no \ndirect comparison for a dollar bill, as the accounting methods are \ndifferent, the gain to the general fund is much less. Another savings \ncomes from the fact that a coin can do its work for 30 years, while a \ndollar bill has a lifespan of only about 18 months before it wears out \nand needs to be replaced.\n  With such clear advantages on the side of the dollar coin why doesn't \nthe American public use the coin? The answers are fairly well known and \nwere documented by the GAO in a 2002 report to Congress. Let me address \nsome of the problems outlined by the GAO.\n  First, there is the so-called ``network effect.'' This \ninterdependency of demand is described by the GAO this way--\n``Increasing the use of the coin is especially difficult because \nretailers will not stock the dollar coin until they see the public \nusing it, the public is unlikely to use the coin until they see \nretailers stocking it, and banks and armored carriers are reluctant to \ninvest in new equipment to handle the coin until there is wide demand \nfor it.'' Second, there is a lack of public information about the \nsavings to the government from using the dollar coin. Third, business \nusers found difficulty in getting the newer ``golden'' dollar coins in \na useable form--they are not rolled like other coins and because they \nare generally commingled with the older Susan B. Anthony dollars. \nFourth, design mistakes made with the Susan B. Anthony dollar led many \nto confuse the coin with the quarter and spend it at a 75-cent loss. \nFinally, the most difficult problem of all, Americans prefer the dollar \nbill to the dollar coin because they can get an adequate supply of \nthem, and they are readily accepted everywhere.\n\n  The GAO summed it up with this conclusion in its 2002 report, ``. . . \nuntil individuals can see that the coin is widely used by others and \nthat the government intends to replace the dollar bill with the dollar \ncoin, they will be unlikely to use the coin in everyday transactions.''\n  The bill I am introducing today will address many of these problems. \nIt will do so by getting the dollar coin in people's hands and pockets. \nIt will provide the information that Americans need to make rational \ndecisions and it takes steps to eliminate other barriers to circulation \nof the coin. Although this legislation does not take the dollar bill \nout of circulation, it is well known that continued circulation of the \ndollar bill is expensive to businesses and consumers alike. Therefore, \nI am today writing the GAO asking that it carefully examine this issue \nand update its findings from its last comprehensive review made in \n1990.\n  Now, I turn to the specifics of my legislative proposal. Beginning in \n2006, the bill would cause the images of four U.S. Presidents to appear \non the dollar coin a year, each in the order of their service, until \nall are so honored. The reverse of the coin would feature the Statue of \nLiberty. The edge of the coin would hold important information, such as \nthe date and the so-called mintmark. It is important to note that coins \nbearing the image of Sacagawea, who currently appears on the face of \nthe dollar coin, will continue to be issued during the period of the \nPresidential Coin Program established by this bill. I draw my \ncolleague's attention to the fact that her image will be joined by the \nimages of U.S. Presidents, not displaced by them. This is only \nappropriate, especially as we celebrate the bicentennial of the Lewis \nand Clark Expedition of which she was such an important part.\n  To complement the Presidential Coin Program, my bill would also \ncreate a new puregold bullion coin to honor presidential spouses. At \nthe same time each president's image appears on the circulating dollar \ncoin, the spouse's image would appear on a one-half ounce pure gold \ncoin. It is my hope that together the Presidential coin and the Spouse \ncoin will spark excitement and interest in the dollar coin and get it \ninto circulation. These coins will appeal both to collectors and to \ninvestors.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Presidential Coin Program is modeled \nafter the wildly successful 50-state quarter program. As all my \ncolleagues know, that program has aroused new interest in coins, coin \ncollecting and the history of our nation's states. Before it began, the \nU.S. Mint was producing about $400 million in quarters a year. Demand \nin the first year of the quarter program shot up to $1.2 billion in \nquarters that year. Seigniorage from the quarter halfway through the \n50-state program has surpassed all expectations, amounting to more than \n$4 billion, close to the $5 billion that was predicted for the whole \n10-year program. I believe that the Presidential Coin Program will have \na similar effect on the dollar coin, creating interest and familiarity \nwith the dollar coin and revenues for the U.S. government.\n  The bill I am introducing with Senator Reid would also take other \nimportant steps toward getting Americans used to the dollar coin and \nremoving barriers to its circulation. For example, it would cause the \nFederal Government to use the dollar coin in all its retail operations. \nIncredibly, this is not the case now. Except for the U.S. Postal \nService, few other Federal agencies make use of the coin. Also, the \nbill would take the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin out of circulation, \nending the problem--identified by many business owners--of commingling \nof the new and\n\n[[Page S8730]]\n\nold dollar coins. There would be, however, no problem for the Sacagawea \nand Presidential dollars to circulate at the same time, as they both \nwould be of the attractive ``golden'' color. The bill also would cause \nthe dollar coins to be available in convenient forms, including rolls \nand small bags, so that businesses can use them easily. Now, it's hard \nto get dollar coins except in pillow-sized bags, from which they must \nbe counted before they can go into cash registers.\n  Finally, this legislation will create a new, pure-gold bullion, one-\nounce coin with the image of the so-called ``Indian Head'' or \n``Buffalo'' nickel. Here, I must note that the design is so popular \nthat when our colleague Senator Campbell, authored legislation to re-\ncreate that design as a limited-edition silver dollar to benefit the \nNational Museum of the American Indian now under construction on the \nMall, all half-million copies allowed sold out within two weeks. This \nwill be an opportunity for collectors to get a pure-gold copy of the \ncoin, but it will also be an opportunity for investors to buy an \ninvestment-grade coin. Other countries, including the People's Republic \nof China, make this kind of pure-gold investment vehicle available to \ntheir citizens, but to date the U.S. Mint gold investment-grade coins \nhave only been about 90 percent pure. I'm certain that with the quality \nwork of the Mint and the imprimatur of the United States Government, \nthis coin will be well-accepted into the market.\n  Let me conclude, by saying that I believe the bill I am introducing \ntoday will put the dollar coin on the map and in the pockets of \nAmericans. That's good for commerce and it's good government.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend Senator \nSununu to cosponsor the Presidential One Dollar Coin Act of 2004. When \nenacted, this measure will provide a valuable educational tool to help \nchildren and adults alike learn about our presidents, will lead to \nsubstantial savings for consumers, and earn billions of dollars for the \ngovernment.\n  Let me begin by describing in detail how the program established by \nthis legislation will work. Beginning in 2006, four presidents would be \nhonored each year on dollar coins in the order of service, with their \nname, dates of service, and a number indicating the order in which they \nserved on the front of the coin.\n  The Statute of Liberty will appear on the reverse side of the coin, \nwhile the date and mintmark will appear on the edge of the coin, \nleaving room for dramatic images on the faces.\n  The bill also continues the tradition that no image of a living \npresident appear on coins and also seeks to address the several \nbarriers to circulation that have in the past hindered more widespread \nuse of the dollar coin.\n  The educational benefits of this program are clear. We all know that \nThomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776, but how \nmany know the dates of his presidential service to our country? Those \nwere momentous years for our young nation, and this program will put \nthat kind of information in the pockets of every consumer and in the \nhands of every school child in the nation.\n  This bill also will provide financial benefits to consumers and the \ngovernment. The cost of counting and handling change is much lower than \nthat of counting and handling currency. The widespread availability and \nuse of a dollar coin will help lower costs for consumers in sectors of \nthe economy that rely on regular low-dollar-value transactions, such as \nvending machines and transit systems.\n  The Department of Treasury also estimates that the dollar coin, if in \nfull circulation, would create as much as $500 million each year for \nthe government. This money, which goes directly to the general fund, \narises from the difference between the costs of making the coin and the \namount of worth it carries in commerce. While this amount varies \ndepending on a number of factors, for the Golden Dollar, it averages \nabout $0.80 for each coin.\n  It should be noted that the Department of Treasury estimated that the \n50 State Quarter Program would produce $2.6 billion to $5 billion in \nrevenues for the government; halfway through, the program already has \nearned more than $4 billion.\n  The second part of this bill would establish a program to honor \npresidential First Spouses with a nearly pure gold coin. Each coin \nwould bear the likeness of a presidential spouse on one side and an \nimage symbolic of the spouse's works or interests on the other. In the \nfive cases in which presidents had no spouse during their term of \noffice, the measure provides for an image of ``Liberty'' as was used on \na coin during the president's term, with the reverse having an image \nrelated to the period of the president's term. I believe the \npresidential spouse program will build on the benefits-- both \neducational and financial--of the presidential series.\n  Finally, my bill directs the U.S. Mint to produce a new, one-ounce, \npure gold bullion coin with the famous image of the ``Indian Head'' or \n``Buffalo'' nickel. This fine looking coin is so well known and popular \nthat when it was struck as a silver dollar to help finance the National \nMuseum of the American Indian, all 500,000 were snapped up by consumers \nand collectors in just two weeks.\n  While other countries have made coins like these, the Mint has never \nmade a pure gold coin for investors and collectors, and I believe it is \ntime to do so. Not only will these coins increase investment \nopportunities, they will produce earnings for the government. As my \nhome state of Nevada is a principle gold producing state in the nation, \nit will also create jobs for my constituents.\n  I conclude my statement by addressing an important issue that relates \nto this proposal. I understand that there are those in this body and \nelsewhere who do not wish to see the image of Sacagawea, which is now \non the dollar coin, removed for any reason. It is their view that to do \nso shows disrespect to her and to all Native Americans. I share their \ncommitment to honoring the memory of Sacagawea, which is why my bill \nprovides for the continued release of Sacagawea dollar coins throughout \nthe Presidential coin program and beyond. Furthermore, I believe this \nprogram will actually honor Sacagawea by ensuring that the dollar coin \nwith her image and the images of U.S. Presidents is widely circulated \nand used by all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the rest of my colleagues to \nensure this measure's review and passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2745. A bill to amend the Colorado Canyons National Conservation \nArea and Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness Act of 2000 to rename the \nColorado Canyons National Conservation Area as the McInnis Canyons \nNational Conservation Area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am honored to rise and introduce \nlegislation that would rename the Colorado Canyons National \nConservation Area as the McInnis Canyons National Conservation Area.\n  I do this in recognition of my colleague in the House, Scott McInnis, \nwho will join me this year in returning home to private life after \nyears of dedicated public service to the people of Colorado. For the \npast two decades, Congressman McInnis has been a true champion in the \nfight to protect Colorado's public lands. In fact, no sitting Member of \nCongress has passed more legislation for the designation and protection \nof Wilderness areas.\n  As Congressman McInnis nears the end of his tenure in office, I \nthought it appropriate to create a lasting symbol of Colorado's \nappreciation for his many achievements on behalf of our great State. \nThe Colorado Canyons National Conservation Area is located near \nCongressman McInnis' home in Grand Junction. The site is one of \nAmerica's most beautiful natural treasures. These canyons are preserved \ntoday because of the work of Congressman McInnis, who began his quest \nto protect the Colorado Canyons by seeking the input of local citizens \nand landowners. He then took this input and sought the advice of land \nmanagers and non-profit conservation organizations. Upon completing the \nplan, Congressman McInnis drafted the legislation to create the area \nand shepherded it through Congress.\n  Simply put, the creation of the Colorado Canyons National \nConservation\n\n[[Page S8731]]\n\nArea would not have been possible absent the tireless efforts of Scott \nMcInnis. Recognizing the sizable McInnis legacy on behalf of all \nColoradans, I think it only fitting and appropriate to introduce this \nlasting tribute to recognize Scott's hard work and abiding love of \nColorado's public lands.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 2747. A bill to establish a Commission on the Future of the United \nStates Economy to make recommendations on public policy and the \nreorganization of the Federal Government to promote efficiency and \neconomy of operation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in the mid-1980's President Reagan \njoined with Democrats and Republicans to fashion an effective strategy \nto confront the challenges we then faced from the Japanese. It's time \nto reconsider our competitiveness strategy, this time in response to \nthe Chinese and many other emerging free enterprise economies. The \nReagan approach--appointing a bipartisan commission on industrial \ncompetitiveness, chaired by John A. Young, president of Hewlett Packard \nCo., and supported by the Democratic Congress--remains the most \neffective way to proceed, and today I am introducing legislation to do \njust that.\n  Still known as the Young Commission, this distinguished group of \nleaders from large and small businesses, labor, and academia led the \nnation in a dialog on ways to strengthen the competitiveness of the \nU.S. industry in both domestic and foreign markets. Its recommendations \nand remedies were widely adopted in the late 1980's and 1990's and \naccount for the unprecedented growth we experienced--much coming from \nAmerica's high tech sector. But our competitive circumstances have \nchanged and the Young Commission vision needs to be reconsidered and \nrefreshed.\n  The 2.7 million jobs we've lost since 2000 is a bitter reminder of \nthe economic crisis we faced in the early 1980's. Back then Japan had \nemerged as a major competitor invading our markets with advanced \nproducts at lower prices. Sony, Hitachi, Nikon, Toyota, Honda and other \nrising Japanese industrial giants had cast a shadow of anxiety over the \nAmerican public. Plant closings and layoffs became widespread as our \ntrade deficit with Japan ballooned and production shrank with rising \nimports. And the Paul Volcker interest rates imposed to break the back \nof inflation had crushed the weaker American firms. We had two choices: \nsuccumb or fight.\n  Fortunately, led by the kind of practical vision espoused by the \nYoung Commission, the United States learned how to fight and rose to \nthe challenge with objective analysis of our strengths and weaknesses, \nhard decisions about government's role, and investments in \nentrepreneurs and high technology fostering the longest expansionary \nperiod in our 200 year history. Wise decisions were made in the 1980s \nand we cashed in on them in the 1990's. The strategy that worked then \nis not sufficient now. World markets are now undergoing a momentous \nchange that requires a re-assessment of our competitiveness strategy \nfor this new century.\n  As the Japanese challenge developed in the early 1980s, the response \nof our two political parties became a polarized debate about \n``industrial policy.'' Republicans favored deeper and deeper tax cuts \nto stimulate job growth which--together with massive defense spending--\nsent the deficits through the roof. Some Democrats pushed for an \nIndustrial Development Bank to rescue failing firms and protectionist \npolicies. Neither side thought it could compromise without risking the \nsupport of its political base, and we faced a political deadlock on \neconomic policy. Twenty years later, does all of this sound quite \nfamiliar?\n  The Young Commission brought all sides to the table and enabled each \nto acknowledge the hard facts that shaped the debate. It proposed the \nfirst generation of reforms that became a bipartisan competitiveness \nagenda. Public-private collaborations instead of industrial supports, \nand research and development investments in information technology \nbecame a foundation for the economic boom of the 1990's. Their \nrecommendations provided the roadmap that led to the longest period of \neconomic growth in our history.\n  Today, the challenges we face are exponentially larger and more \ncomplex. We've entered an information age where intangible assets such \nas innovation and knowledge are the new keys to competitive advantage. \nThese intangibles--including worker skills and knowledge, informal \nrelationships that feed creativity, new business methods, and \nintellectual property--are driving worldwide economic prosperity. \nAccording to a 1998 study by the Brookings Institution 85 percent of \ncompany assets are now considered intangible, a significant jump from \n38 percent in 1982.\n  In an age where these knowledge-based assets are difficult to patent \nor copyright, intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce, \nand information crosses borders freely and instantaneously, the first \nYoung Commission doesn't give us all the answers. We need a strategy \nwhere change is both inevitable and necessary, as companies leapfrog \ntheir own technology and continuously reap the rewards that go to \ninnovators. This 21st century rat race--constant insecurity, constant \ncompetition, and constant change--presents an opportunity for all, yet \nit will be a nightmare for the unprepared.\n  This is our fate for a good reason--the United States won the cold \nwar's battle of ideas. The outcome is what we wished for--free \nenterprise is on the march, socialist state planning is discredited, \nand new competitors (principally China and India, but also Canada, \nMexico, Ireland, Malaysia, and Taiwan) can deploy world class talent \nnot fearful of international competition. American economic supremacy--\nour seeming birthright since the Second World War--has come to an end. \nNow we have to fight for every morsel on our economic table.\n  The competitors we now face have world class engineering and science \ntalent as well as low wages. The challenge now extends beyond a concern \nover foreign competition on manufacturing to ominous trends in favor of \nglobal outsourcing of the services sector, including high end \ntechnology jobs. The drive for increased customization, speed, and \nresponsiveness to customer needs has multiplied the pressures for \nproductivity and quality. Our entire innovation ecosystem is under \nstress, including the ties between basic research and \ncommercialization, competition for capital and technology, and adaptive \nbusiness models. As we have done in building fighter aircraft that puts \nunheard of G force stress on pilots, we now need workers who can thrive \non knowledge overload. Because our workforce no longer has the security \nof certainty and stability, we need to give it the confidence and tools \nto adapt continuously to innovation and change--in a global melee of \nshifting upstart competitors.\n  The American economy is the most adaptable in the world--with a well \neducated workforce, efficient capital markets, and the zeal of \ngenerations of entrepreneurial immigrants. But we seem not to have \nnoticed that the rate of global change is accelerating. The warning \nsigns are everywhere. We are not just losing some high wage jobs--we \nmay be losing critical parts of our innovation infrastructure, and with \nthem, our long-term competitive edge in the global marketplace. As long \nas emerging nations such as China and India continue to produce more \nand more science and engineering graduates, invest in their \ninfrastructure, and implement targeted industrial and trade policies to \nstrengthen their research and development and attract foreign \ninvestment, doing nothing will slowly and silently erode our economic \nand national security. As our own giants like GE, TI, Intel, HP, and \nMicrosoft cast a shadow of anxiety over American workers by going \noffshore, we must proceed with a coordinated and sustainable vision to \nstrengthen our innovation infrastructure. America's dependence on \nforeign capital to finance excessive government and consumer debt is an \nominous trend which threatens our future innovation. The much higher \nsavings rate of many of our competitors gives them ready access to \ncapital necessary for investing in productivity-enhancing research and \ntechnologies.\n  To meet these challenges, we first need an injection of bipartisan \npolitical will and that's not easy to find in\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\nWashington these days. It is time to unleash a new, bipartisan and \nupdated Young Commission, charged with analyzing the impact of global \neconomic changes on the American economy, including the offshore \noutsourcing problem, and offering nonpartisan proposals to preserve our \ninnovation infrastructure and create more high-wage American jobs.\n  The legislation I am introducing today creates a 22-member bipartisan \nCommission on the Future of the U.S. Economy to make specific \nrecommendations on a broad range of issues related to the development \nof our Nations' skill-base, innovation capacity and the other factors \nneeded for the knowledge and information economy. The Commission is to \nreport back to Congress within 18 months.\n  Numerous groups concerned about the future of the United States \neconomy have begun to address the rising challenge of sustaining our \ncompetitive advantage in this new global economy. I first would like to \nthank Dr. Kenan Patrick Jarboe from Athena Alliance for helping to \ndevelop key ideas and providing invaluable advice as my office \nconsidered this legislation. I would also like to acknowledge the \nsignificant and thoughtful work the Electronic Industries Alliance has \nprovided in formulating ideas for a new competitiveness agenda. I also \ntrust that the major effort in progress under the National Innovation \nInitiative of the Council on Competitiveness will provide a creative \ngroundwork for this important Commission.\n  I request unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary of the \nbill and the text of the bill itself appear in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          The Commission on the Future of the U.S. Economy Act\n\n\n                           Section-by-section\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This section cites the title of the Act as the ``Commission \n     on the Future of the U.S. Economy Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       This section lays out a number of findings which include:\n       (1) The U.S. economy has entered an information age where \n     innovation and knowledge are the new keys to competitive \n     advantage and are creating new challenges for American \n     workers and companies.\n       (2) In 1984, at the height of concerns over the condition \n     of the manufacturing sector in the U.S., President Reagan \n     appointed the bipartisan President's Commission on Industrial \n     Competitiveness (the Young Commission) that addressed the \n     issue of U.S. competitiveness in a new way and developed a \n     framework that has guided policymaking for the past two \n     decades.\n       (3) There is a need for an independent, bipartisan \n     undertaking comparable to the Young Commission to review the \n     new competitive challenges facing the United States and to \n     recommend a framework to guide the making of responsive \n     public policy.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.\n\n       This section establishes the Commission on the Future of \n     the U.S. Economy with the purpose of undertaking an analysis \n     of the competitive challenges to American companies and \n     workers and making recommendations for public policy, \n     including reorganization of the Federal government, to \n     promote efficiency and economy of operation, to foster the \n     skills and knowledge Americans need to prosper in the 21st \n     century, strengthen the entire innovation system, and \n     stimulate the creation of knowledge, inventions, partnerships \n     and other intangibles so as to maintain economic growth, \n     income generation and job creation.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commission on the Future of \n     the United States Economy Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States economy has entered an information \n     age in which innovation and knowledge, including worker \n     skills and creativity, are the keys to competitive advantage.\n       (2) The need for bold innovation and ever-increasing \n     knowledge imposes increasingly demanding competitive \n     challenges for United States workers and companies.\n       (3) In 1984, in response to concerns over the condition of \n     the manufacturing sector in the United States, President \n     Ronald Reagan appointed the bipartisan President's Commission \n     on Industrial Competitiveness (hereafter in this Act referred \n     to as the ``Young Commission'') that addressed the issue of \n     United States competitiveness in a new way and developed a \n     framework that has guided policymaking for the past 2 \n     decades.\n       (4) The Young Commission proposed a reorganization of the \n     performance of the economic and trade functions of the \n     Federal Government, which was never implemented.\n       (5) The striking changes in world economic circumstances \n     over the 20 years since reorganization was proposed by the \n     Young Commission necessitate reevaluation of the proposal in \n     light of those changes.\n\n[[Page S8733]]\n\n       (6) Because the challenges facing the United States economy \n     are different in many ways from those of 20 years ago, there \n     is a need to renew the Young Commission's mandate to \n     reexamine America's competitiveness.\n       (7) Many studies and reports by governmental and \n     nongovernmental organizations, such as the National \n     Innovation Initiative of the Council on Competitiveness, have \n     laid the groundwork for this reexamination.\n       (8) The changed competitive challenges facing the United \n     States today--\n       (A) extend beyond a concern over global competition in \n     goods and the loss of domestic manufacturing to the \n     challenges presented by the fusion of manufacturing and \n     services into complex networks and the opening of more \n     service sectors earlier to international competition;\n       (B) extend beyond concerns over productivity and quality to \n     the challenges presented by the need for increased \n     customization, speed, and responsiveness to customer needs;\n       (C) extend beyond issues of competitiveness of individual \n     manufacturing firms and industries and to the challenges of \n     ensuring robustness in the networks of manufacturing and \n     service firms and development of new forms of business \n     models;\n       (D) extend beyond a concern over high-technology research \n     and development and to the challenges of nurturing the entire \n     innovation system, including basic research, technological \n     development, venture capital, new product development, design \n     and aesthetics, new business models, and the development of \n     new markets;\n       (E) shift attention from concern over raising awareness of \n     trade to a refocusing on the problems of managing the \n     increasing complexity of globalization;\n       (F) extend beyond the challenges of sustaining a flexible \n     and educated workforce to the challenges of exploring new or \n     better ways to foster the types of skills needed in a \n     knowledge and information economy;\n       (G) extend beyond concern over cost of capital to the \n     challenges of achieving the dual objectives of unlocking the \n     value of underutilized knowledge assets and insuring the \n     efficiency and stability of the global financial system;\n       (H) extend beyond a concern over competition from Japan and \n     the Southeast Asian Newly Industrializing Countries (NICs) to \n     the challenges of integrating many countries, such as India, \n     China, and Eastern European nations, into the global economy; \n     and\n       (I) include the challenges of new demographic dynamics, \n     including the aging of the so-called ``baby boom'' \n     generation, increased life expectancy, below replacement \n     fertility rates in most of the developed world, and \n     increasing populations in the developing world.\n       (9) In this information age, new ideas, business models, \n     and technologies, including computer and telecommunications, \n     the Internet, and the digital revolution, have combined to \n     alter the economy structurally.\n       (10) Information, knowledge, and other intangible assets \n     now power our innovation process, which is based both on \n     science-based research and informal creativity and produces \n     the productivity and improvement gains needed to maintain \n     prosperity.\n       (11) The range of knowledge, information, and intellectual \n     capital-based intangible assets driving economic prosperity \n     include worker skills and know-how, informal relationships \n     that feed creativity and new ideas, high-performance work \n     organizations, new business methods, intellectual property \n     such as patents and copyrights, brand names, and innovation \n     and creativity skills.\n       (12) Economic statistics and accounting principles have not \n     caught up with this new economic environment.\n       (13) All sectors of the economy are affected by this new \n     economic environment.\n       (14) Small and medium-size firms are especially in need of \n     ways to better develop and utilize their information, \n     knowledge, and other intangible assets.\n       (15) It is vital to the future strength of the United \n     States economy that, as new ideas, scientific discoveries, \n     and knowledge pervade the domestic and international \n     economies, United States firms be able to assess, absorb, and \n     deploy these opportunities quickly for competitive advantage.\n       (16) While United States firms and workers lead the world \n     in creating and using information, knowledge, and other \n     intangible assets, increasing global competition means that \n     the United States Government and the private sector must \n     continue to develop the information economy in the United \n     States in order to ensure that the people of the United \n     States prosper in this new economic environment.\n       (17) There is a need for an independent, bipartisan \n     undertaking comparable to the Young Commission to review the \n     new competitive challenges facing the United States and to \n     recommend a framework to guide the making of responsive \n     public policy, including the reorganization of the Federal \n     Government to promote efficiency and economy of operation, to \n     promote private initiatives, and to guide individual \n     decisionmaking about the future of the United States economy \n     as governments, business, labor unions, and the people of the \n     United States struggle with ways to utilize information, \n     foster the development of intangible assets, and promote \n     innovation and competitiveness in the new global information \n     economy.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established the Commission on \n     the Future of the United States Economy (hereafter referred \n     to as the ``Commission'').\n       (b) Purposes.--The purpose of the Commission are as \n     follows:\n       (1) To analyze the worldwide competitive challenges to \n     United States companies and workers.\n       (2) To make recommendations in accordance with this Act, \n     for the making of responsive public policy, including the \n     reorganization of the Federal Government--\n       (A) to promote efficiency and economy of operation;\n       (B) to foster the skills and knowledge the people of the \n     United States need to prosper in the 21st century;\n       (C) to strengthen the entire innovation system undergirding \n     the United States economy; and\n       (D) to stimulate the creation of knowledge, inventions, \n     partnerships, and other intangible assets in order to \n     maintain economic growth, income generation, and job \n     creation.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to prohibit the giving or acceptance of payment for \nthe placement of a child, or obtaining consent to adoption; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will create a national penalty for baby selling and help ensure \nthat all families experience safe and legal adoptions.\n  Although the majority of adoptions are handled by reputable and \nethical agencies, each year around the world, hundreds of thousands of \nchildren are sold illegally. In these tragic instances, birth mothers \nand prospective adoptive families alike are victimized by individuals \nwho treat children as commodities. Baby brokers exploit couples who are \neager, if not desperate, to adopt a child, and vulnerable women who are \nunable or unwilling to raise their children. In too many States baby \nbrokering constitutes only a misdemeanor offense. The Baby Selling \nProhibition Act of 2004 will make this horrific crime a felony.\n  I am pleased to partner with Lifetime Television to help raise \nawareness about this issue and to change public policy. Lifetime's \noriginal movie, ``Baby for Sale,'' which is based on the troubling true \nstory of a couple who\n\n[[Page S8735]]\n\ntried to adopt a child and got caught up in a baby selling ring, will \ngo a long way toward raising the Nation's consciousness of this issue, \nand, I hope, generate support for my legislation.\n  The movie ``Baby for Sale'' highlights the story of a prospective \nadoptive couple, William and Lauren Schneider, who registered with an \nonline agency called ``Adoption Online.'' Through this agency, they met \na lawyer who introduced them to a baby, Nikolett, who they were told \nwas available for adoption. The Schneiders fell in love with Nikolett \nat once and wanted to begin the adoption procedures so that they could \nbegin their life as a family together. However, when the lawyer asked \nthem for $60,000 under-the-table to process the adoption the couple \nalerted the authorities, and ultimately uncovered a bidding war between \nmultiple couples for this little girl. The public outrage surrounding \nthis case led to a change in New York law last year. Under New York's \nnew law, baby selling is considered a felony instead of a misdemeanor.\n  The Baby Selling Prohibition Act of 2004 is modeled after New York's \nlaw. It makes profiting from the sale of a child, defined as charging \nfees beyond those that are reasonable and allowable, a felony, \npunishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n  This critical legislation will prevent families from enduring the \nsame agony that the Schneider's went through and will ensure that every \nadoptive child's safety and best interest is strictly maintained in all \nadoption cases.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2478\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Baby Selling Prohibition Act \n     of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 77 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 1596.

Accepting or charging excess amounts in connection with the \n              placement of a child or obtaining consent to adoption.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES:\n  S. 2749. A bill to establish a grant program to provide comprehensive \neye examinations to children, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide financial support to ensure that uninsured children who have \nfailed vision screenings are able to obtain the glasses or eye \ntreatments they need.\n  Almost every State in the Union has a system in place to detect \nvision problems at an early age. Indeed, 30 states and the District of \nColumbia require vision screening for children beginning with their \nentry into the school system and eleven additional states recommend \nsuch screenings for preschool children. But this system is incomplete. \nWhen children fail the screen, there is no requirement that they \nreceive treatment of any kind. And if they are uninsured, their \nfamilies often cannot afford a visit to the ophthalmologist and obtain \nthe treatment they need to address the problem identified by the \nscreening.\n  Mr. President, taking steps to identify a problem, but to then fail \nto address it doesn't make sense; in particular when delay in treatment \ncan have lifelong consequences. For example, one of the most common eye \ndiseases of early childhood, amblyopia or ``lazy eye,'' responds to \ntreatment 95 percent of the time when it is addressed by the age of \nthree. If treatment is delayed until the age of five, however, the \nlikelihood that the problem can be corrected is reduced to 10 percent. \nChildren who cannot correct these refractive vision problems start \nschool at an enormous disadvantage in terms of their ability to learn.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would help to obviate this \ndeficit. Simply put, it would authorize the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, acting through the Center for Disease Control Director, \nto provide $75 million worth of grants to states for exams and \nnecessary treatment for uninsured children who have failed a vision \nscreening and cannot afford follow-on treatment.\n  Ample evidence underscores the need for this type of legislation. A \nstudy conducted by Dr. Mark Preslan and Audrey Novak of the Maryland \nCenter for Sight, entitled The Baltimore Vision Screening Project found \nthat strabismus--also known as cross-eyes--amblyopia and refractive \nerrors, occurred in higher frequencies and remained untreated for a \npopulation sample of youth in schools in lower income areas. The \nstudy's main conclusion stated, ``Children with limited access to \nspecialized eye care must be provided with a mechanism for obtaining \nthese services.''\n  This disparity exists at the national level as well, and our minority \npopulations are especially underserved. A team of researchers from the \nUniversity of Michigan documented a national example of differential \naccess to vision treatment. Their research showed that minority \nchildren and uninsured children are far less likely to get complete eye \nexams or glasses. A study in January's Optometry and Vision Sciences \ndemonstrated that uninsured African American and Hispanic children were \nfar less likely to receive vision correction, and that this disparity \nresults from lack of services as opposed to less frequent occurrences \nof eye problems in these populations.\n  A study by the Kaiser Commission on the Uninsured reveals that \nuninsured children are over five times more likely to have an unmet \nneed for medical care. According to a report by the Caring Foundation \nfor Children, 20 percent of uninsured children have untreated vision \nproblems. According to Prevent Blindness America data, 12.1 million \nschool-aged children have vision impairment. Among preschool-aged \nchildren, more than 5 percent have a problem that can cause permanent \nsight loss if left untreated, and almost 80 percent of that 5 percent \nnever get an exam. Another study by the Vision Council of America \nreported that 40 percent of children who fail a vision screen do not \nreceive the recommended follow-up care. The same study found the \naverage delay between a failed screening and follow-up evaluation by an \neye-care professional was 4.1 years.\n  Most of our States are taking the important first step of identifying \nyoung children with vision problems through mandatory vision screening. \nThis legislation simply takes the next step to help provide a remedy \nfor those children who cannot afford treatment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 2751. A bill to encourage savings, promote financial literacy, and \nexpand\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\nopportunities for young adults by establishing KIDS Accounts; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I am introducing ``The America \nSaving for Personal Investment, Retirement, and Education (ASPIRE) Act \nof 2004'' along with Senator Corzine. A bipartisan group of members is \nintroducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives. The \nbill creates a Kids Investment and Development Savings (KIDS) Account \nfor every child at birth and creates a new opportunity for the children \nof low-income Americans to build assets and wealth.\n  This country has seen a growing number of Americans investing in the \nstock market and has witnessed an historic boom in homeownership, which \nhas increased to a record high 68 percent. However, this growth in \nassets has not reached every American. While many middle- and upper-\nincome families have increased their assets in the past decade, many \nlow-income families have not had the same financial success. A recent \nstudy conducted by the Federal Reserve found that the median net worth \nof families in the bottom 20 percent of the nation's income level was a \nmere $7,900 an amount that is far too low to ensure a comfortable \neconomic future for their family. This challenge needs to be addressed \nto ensure that lower income families have a significant opportunity to \naccrue wealth and expand opportunities for their families.\n  Under this legislation, KIDS Accounts would be created after a child \nis born and a Social Security number issued. A one-time $500 deposit \nwould automatically be placed into a KIDS account. Children from \nhouseholds below the national median income would receive an additional \ndeposit of $500 at birth and would be eligible to receive dollar-for-\ndollar matching funds up to $500 per year for voluntary contributions \nto the account, which cannot exceed $1,000 per year. All funds grow \ntax-free. Access to the account prior to age 18 would not be permitted, \nbut kids--in conjunction with their parents--would participate in \ninvestment decisions and watch their money grow. When the young person \nturns 18, he or she can use the accrued money for asset building \npurposes such as education, homeownership, and retirement planning. \nAccrued funds could also be rolled over into Roth IRA accounts to \nexpand investment options.\n  I would like to highlight what I view as the two major benefits of \nthis legislation. The first, and most apparent, is that this bill will \nhelp give younger individuals, especially low-income Americans, a sound \nfinancial start to begin their adult life. For example, a typical low-\nincome family making modest but steady contributions can create a KIDS \nAccount worth over $20,000 in 18 years. Second, and perhaps more \nimportant, is that KIDS Accounts creates opportunities for all \nAmericans to become more financially literate. The account holders and \ntheir guardians will choose from a list of possible investment funds \nand will be able to watch their investment grow over time. All \nAmericans will have the opportunity to see first hand that a smart \ninvestment now can grow over time into considerable wealth.\n  I believe that this bill could be a significant step forward in the \neffort to expand asset opportunities to all Americans and encourage my \ncolleagues to support this bipartisan effort.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nSantorum in introducing the ASPIRE Act of 2004, which would expand \nopportunities for young adults, encourage savings, and promote \nfinancial literacy, by establishing investment accounts, known as KIDS \nAccounts, for every child in America.\n  ASPIRE is based largely on a similar initiative in the United Kingdom \ndeveloped by Prime Minister Tony Blair. Yet despite its British roots, \nthe proposal is based on the most basic of American values. By giving \nevery young person resources with which to get a start in life, ASPIRE \nwill help realize the American ideal of equal opportunity. And by \nmaking every young person an investor, the proposal would encourage \nself reliance, promote savings, and give every family a personal stake \nin America's economy.\n  Under ASPIRE, an investment account would be established for every \nAmerican child upon receiving a Social Security number. Each account \nwould be funded initially with $500. Those with incomes less than the \nnational median would receive an additional contribution of up to $500, \nand would receive a one-for-one government match for their first $500 \nof private contributions each year. Up to $1000 of after-tax private \ncontributions would be allowed annually from any source.\n  Funds would accumulate tax-free and could not be withdrawn for \npurposes other than higher education until the child reaches the age of \n18. At that point, funds could be withdrawn either for higher education \nor for the purchase of a home. Funds left unspent would be saved for \nretirement under rules similar to those that apply to Roth IRAs. Once \nthe account holder reaches the age of 30, the initial $500 government \ncontribution would have to be repaid, though exceptions could be made \nto avoid undue hardship.\n  Accounts initially would be held by a government entity that would be \nbased on the successful Thrift Savings Plan, or TSP, which now manages \nretirement accounts for Federal employees with relatively low \nadministrative costs. As with the TSP, investors would have a range of \ninvestment options, such as a government securities fund, a fixed \nincome investment fund, and a common stock fund. However, once an \naccount holder reaches the age of 18, funds could be rolled over to a \nKIDS Account held at a private institution.\n  It is difficult to understate the potential impact of giving every \nAmerican child a fun investment account of their own. For the first \ntime, every child will have a meaningful incentive to learn the basics \nof investing, because they will have real resources to invest. For the \nfirst time, even families with modest incomes will have a significant \nincentive to save, to earn the government match. And, perhaps most \nfundamentally, for the first time, every American child will grow up \nknowing that when they reach adulthood, they will have the ability to \ninvest in themselves and in their own education. In short, every child \nwill have hope for a real future.\n\n  Considering its potentially significant social and individual \nbenefits, the ASPIRE Act requires an investment that is relatively \nmodest. It has been estimated that, when it becomes effective, the \nbill's cost would represent only about one tenth of one percent of the \nFederal budget. Yet the proposal differs from other proposals for new \nspending or tax cuts because, for the first 18 years, it would not \nreduce overall national savings at all. In that period, virtually every \ndollar of outlays would be saved, and would be available to expand \nlong-term economic growth. In fact, the proposal would lead to an \nincrease in national savings because of its incentives for families to \nsave more. This would help create the economic growth we need to handle \nthe added burdens associated with the impending retirement of the baby \nboomers.\n  Senator Santorum and I have been working on this legislation for many \nmonths, along with sponsors of identical legislation in the House, \nCongressmen Harold Ford, Patrick Kennedy, Thomas Petri and Phil \nEnglish. In that process, we have been assisted by a broad range of \nexperts and other interested parties, for which I am very grateful. \nHowever, I want to especially thank Ray Boshara and Reid Cramer of the \nNew America Foundation, who have been extraordinarily helpful in the \ndevelopment of the legislation, and who have taken the lead in efforts \nto promote this and other asset building initiatives.\n  I recognize that given the lateness of the session, it is unlikely \nthat this legislation will see action in the 108th Congress. However, \nSenator Santorum and I are hopeful that those with an interest in the \nproposal will review the language of the bill and give us feedback in \nthe coming months. We are open to suggestions for improvements and \nexpect to introduce a revised version of the legislation in the next \nCongress.\n  The ASPIRE Act is a big new idea based on simple, old time American \nvalues. It already enjoys strong bipartisan support from conservatives \nand progressives, alike, in both houses of Congress. I look forward to \nworking with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to secure its prompt \nenactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\n  S. 2752. A bill to reform Federal budget procedures, to impose \nspending safeguards, to combat waste, fraud, and abuse, to account for \naccurate Government agency costs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \njointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, with instructions \nthat if one Committee reports, the other Committee have thirty days to \nreport or be discharged.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family Budget \nProtection Act of 2004, legislation to help bring our Federal spending \nunder control. The companion to this bill, H.R. 3800, was introduced in \nthe House of Representatives earlier this year by Congressman Jeb \nHensarling of Texas, who has been joined by 103 cosponsors.\n  As all of our colleagues know, our Federal budget situation has been \nunder tremendous strain during the past several years. After enjoying \nseveral years of actual and projected surpluses in the later part of \nthe last decade, we have unfortunately suffered a near perfect storm of \nevents that has drastically turned the budget situation from one of \nsunny optimism to one of great concern. These events, of course, \ninclude the recession that followed the bursting of the high tech \nbubble and stock market adjustment, the corporate scandals, the tragic \nevents of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent expenditures for the \nwars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the need for increased spending for \nhomeland security.\n  The result of these events, combined with the tax cuts that were \nnecessary to get the economy back on a solid path of growth, have had a \ndevastating effect on the Federal budget and its outlook. While I fully \nsupport President Bush's initiatives for pursuing the war on terror and \nprotecting our homeland, along with his plan for helping the economy \nrecover, which has obviously worked, I am very concerned about our \nFederal budget and in finding a way to get it back to balance.\n  Much of what has happened to our budget has been unavoidable, given \nthe events of the past few years. In my view, we have simply had no \nchoice but to spend the money necessary to fight the war on terror and \nimprove our homeland security. Moreover, we will have to keep spending \nsignificant sums for these purposes. After all, providing for our \nnational security has to be our first and highest priority.\n  I also believe that the tax cuts of 2001, 2002, and 2003 were all \nnecessary to our future prosperity. In order to get our economy growing \nagain and get our people back to work, we needed the economic stimulus \nthat these tax cuts provided.\n  Not surprisingly, some of my colleagues point the finger solely at \nthese tax cuts as the culprit for our Federal deficits. In fact, \naccording to reports recently released by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the tax cuts accounted for only 24 percent of CBO's $2.9 \nbillion deficit projection between 2002 and 2011. CBO also estimated \nthat increased spending on entitlement programs and legislated spending \nincreases, particularly homeland security measures, accounted for 76 \npercent of the deficit projection over this same period. The tax cuts \ndid contribute to the deficit; however, they were crucial to the recent \neconomic recovery we are experiencing.\n\n  However, there are other factors that have been and are continuing to \ncontribute to growing deficits that are not vital to our national \nsecurity or future prosperity. What I am talking about here is the \ngrowing tendency for Congress to spend money unnecessarily on various \nother projects that have far less merit. And, I am talking about the \nfraud and waste that continues to plague our government.\n  It seems that just about every time I return home to the State of \nUtah, I talk with Utah taxpayers who want to know why, given our \ndeteriorating budget circumstances, Congress is not doing more to rein \nin excess spending. I find that Utahns, like other Americans, are \ngenerally willing to pay the high price of fighting the war on terror \nand of protecting our homeland. But no one wants to pay for wasteful \nspending or projects that are not necessary. Utahns are increasingly \nwondering why more cannot be done to ensure that their hard-earned \ndollars are not going to be wasted or misspent. I believe this bill \ngoes a long ways toward addressing these concerns.\n  I recognize that it is always tempting to buy now and pay later, \nextend budget deficits, and increase the size and scope of our \ngovernment. And, I realize that a government the size of ours is always \ngoing to have some fraud and waste associated with it. However, this \nirresponsible spending and this fraud and waste in government are \nmortgaging our children's future and shrinking our Nation's dynamic \nprivate sector. High deficits and the mountain of Federal debt \nrepresent real obligations that hurt our economic security and our \nability to prosper, both now and in the future.\n  I believe that a large part of the problem with this unwarranted \nspending, and with this fraud and waste, is rooted in the Federal \nbudget process itself. The current budget process is overly \ncomplicated, and in many respects, largely incomprehensible. More \nimportantly, it encourages overspending. There is no doubt that its \nsystemic problems contribute largely to our budget deficits.\n  The Family Budget Protection Act is an opportunity to overhaul a \nFederal budget process that desperately needs revision. It is an \nopportunity to tilt the process away from more spending and fraud and \nwaste toward a more responsible way of determining where the taxpayers \nhard-earned tax dollars are to be spent.\n  I think Congressman Hensarling may have said it best when he noted \nthat Washington clearly has a spending problem, not a taxing problem. \nIt is irresponsible for us to continue to demand more money from \ntaxpayers when we continue to flush much of that money straight down \nthe drain by funding wasteful, useless, antiquated, or unnecessary \ngovernment projects.\n  I recognize that it is very late in the second session of the 108th \nCongress and that in this very partisan election year, not much more \nlegislation is likely to be approved. I also recognize that some of the \nprovisions of this bill are controversial and that the House of \nRepresentatives recently defeated a bill that included some of these \nprovisions. However, I believe it is important to lay before the Senate \nthis year a comprehensive set of budget reform provisions, and to \nintroduce in this body a budget reform concept bill that can be \ndebated, discussed, examined over the next few months, and built upon \nin the 109th Congress.\n\n  Some of the major features of this legislation would accomplish the \nfollowing:\n  Provide a Joint Budget Resolution. The Family Budget Protection Act \nwould change the concurrent budget resolution into a joint budget \nresolution that is signed by the President and has the force of law. \nThis provision would enable both the President and Congress to commit \nto the same budget before spending any money that year. Our current \nbudget procedure does not bring Congress and the President to settle on \neven a basic budget framework until the very end of the process when \nthe government is on the verge of shutting down.\n  Simplify the Budget. This bill would simplify the current budget into \na one-page budget by replacing the current 20 budget functions with \nestablished spending levels for only four broad categories--mandatory \nspending, non-defense and defense discretionary spending, and a rainy \nday fund for emergencies.\n  Establish a Rainy Day Fund. This bill would abolish the practice of \ndesignating spending as ``emergency spending,'' which is a practice \noften used to avoid spending safeguards. Spending for true emergencies \nwould be paid for through a ``rainy day'' fund. All spending that is \nincurred through the ``rainy day'' fund must be defined as sudden, \nurgent, unforeseen, and temporary. Emergencies that exhaust the rainy \nday fund would be permissible if they were able to overcome a \nsupermajority point of order lying against them.\n  Set Up Government Shut-Down Protections. The Family Budget Protection \nAct would provide government shutdown protection through an automatic \ncontinuing resolution in the event that an agreement between Congress \nand the President on spending levels was not reached by the legal \ndeadline. In order to avoid simple inaction by Congress, Federal \nagencies would receive one percent less funding each quarter the \ngovernment operated under a continuing resolution.\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\n  Provide a Two-Thirds Supermajority Vote. New pay-go rules would be \nestablished setting up points of order against spending not included in \nthe budget. This bill would raise the bar for points of order to \nrequire a two-thirds supermajority vote (rather than the current three-\nfifths), in both the House and the Senate, to sanction over-budget \nspending and spending in violation of the caps.\n  Set Up Spending Caps. The bill would limit growth in entitlement \nspending to the current inflationary adjustment for each program and \ngrowth in population. The bill would also set discretionary spending \ncaps that would allow spending to grow for inflation, with a firewall \nseparating defense, nondefense, and emergency spending. These spending \ncaps would be protected by points of order and enforced with an across-\nthe board sequester if breached.\n  Establish Family Budget Protection Accounts. Perhaps one of the most \ncommon-sense provisions of the Family Budget Protection Act would be \nthe establishment of Family Budget Protection Accounts. These accounts \nwould allow Congress to target spending during the appropriations \nprocess and redirect that spending for family tax relief or deficit \nreduction at the end of the fiscal year.\n  Combat Waste, Fraud, and Abuse. Under the Family Budget Protection \nAct, every voluntary entitlement program and all discretionary programs \nwould be sunset in fiscal year 2008 and 2009 to allow for a thorough \ncost-benefit analysis to see whether they still merit Federal funding. \nEntitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare Part A, and \nFederal retiree benefits would be exempt from this sunset. The bill \nwould also set up a commission to submit recommendations on how to \neliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. The commission's recommendation \nwould either be approved or rejected by Congress as a package, \neliminating votes on changes to individual programs. Unlike past \nproposals, this provision would include defense and entitlement \nspending in its assessment. The bill would also initiate enhanced \nrescission authority for the President to propose the elimination of \nwasteful spending identified in any appropriations bill. The \nPresident's proposal would be transmitted to Congress and provided \nexpedited consideration through the legislative process.\n  The runaway freight train mentality of our Federal government \nspending simply cannot continue. It is imperative that we move to make \nthese common-sense budget reforms while we are still in a position to \ndo so--rather than continuing to let it control us.\n  I believe that strong economic growth, combined with tightly \ncontrolled spending, are the keys to reducing the deficit and getting \nthe Federal budget in balance again. Although much more needs to be \ndone, we have made great strides in restoring strong economic growth. \nAlong with our continued focus on providing for our national security \nand fighting the war on terror, I suggest to my colleagues that now is \nthe time to turn our attention to controlling spending. I have no doubt \nthat the reforms included in the Family Budget Protection Act can make \na significant contribution to this goal, and I recommend it to my \nfellow senators for their study and consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH:\n  S. 2753.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to protect social \nsecurity cost-of-living adjustments (COLA); to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 8 months ago, the Republican leadership \npushed through Congress a lemon of a Medicare prescription drug bill \nthat has been breaking down part by part since the day it was passed.\n  First, we learned drug companies were raising the prices of many \ndrugs, erasing what little discounts the administration's drug card \nprogram might have offered.\n  Next, we learned the administration concealed its cost estimates, \nmisled Congress, and threatened the Medicare actuary with termination \nfor trying to respond to Congressional requests for information.\n  Then, we heard that some seniors who enrolled in the program were \ngoing to see reductions in other benefits, such as food stamps.\n  Later, days after the Drug Card program began, seniors from across \nthe country began to report that it was too confusing and studies \nrevealed there were lower prices available from major online \npharmacies.\n  Finally, we learned that the HHS website established to help seniors \nnavigate their way through the labyrinth of the myriad cards was \nriddled with false information.\n  The most recent discovery, however, is the most troubling of all, \nbecause what we're talking about is not policy breakdown, but policy \nsabotage.\n  Let me explain: Every senior has his or her Medicare Part B premium \nwithdrawn from their Social Security check. But when the increase in \nhealth care inflation began to outpace seniors' Social Security cost of \nliving adjustments, Congress protected seniors by making it impossible \nfor a senior's Medicare premiums to go up more than the value of his or \nher Social Security COLA. It's called the ``hold harmless'' protection, \nand it makes a simple promise to seniors: The cost of health care will \nnot come at the expense of the cost of living.\n  We have now learned that behind closed doors and in the dark of \nnight, Republican leaders undermined this promise. Like Part B \npremiums, the new prescription drug premiums will come out of a \nsenior's Social Security check. But unlike in traditional Medicare, the \nnew drug bill does not protect seniors with a ``hold harmless'' \nprovision.\n  It was never mentioned in the debate and no one has stepped forward \nto take responsibility in the months since. But if we don't fix the \nproblem, it will eventually result in the decimation of seniors' Social \nSecurity annual cost of living adjustment.\n  Never have these protections been more important. In the past several \nyears, the consumer price index, on\n\n[[Page S8740]]\n\nwhich Social Security COLAs are pegged, has remained very low. At the \nsame time, the cost of health care has been skyrocketing by double-\ndigit percentages. In the 4 years of this administration, the \ncumulative increase in the Medicare monthly premiums will be at least \n$26, nearly twice as much as in the prior eight years under the Clinton \nadministration. In addition, the Medicare Part B premium increase for \n2005 is projected to be $114, the largest ever.\n\n  For seniors on a fixed income, every dollar counts. The hold harmless \nprotection is the only thing standing in the way of lower and lower \nSocial Security checks.\n  But the Republican leadership chose not to protect seniors in this \ndrug bill, despite the fact that the cost of pharmaceuticals is \nincreasing even faster than the cost of health care overall. Medicare \nPart D premiums are expected to rise 7.5 percent per year. The result \nwill be a steady erosion of Social Security checks, and real damage to \nseniors' ability to pay their bills and keep up with inflation.\n  According to a new report by the Joint Economic Committee, one in \nfour seniors will lose a quarter of their COLA just on Medicare premium \nincreases by 2007. In 2014, nearly two in three seniors will see the \nsame level of loss. And those most vulnerable will be the ones most \nseverely harmed. For an elderly woman with a monthly benefit of $500, \nthe increase in Medicare premiums will take an average of 60 percent of \nher COLA from 2007 to 2010, and an average of 66 percent from 2011 to \n2014.\n  Let's not mince words. This is the worst kind of bait and switch. We \ncannot stand by and allow seniors to be cheated out of their cost of \nliving increases in exchange for a confusing drug benefit that fails to \nbring down the cost of drugs.\n  Today, I am introducing the Social Security COLA Protection Act of \n2004 to make sure that senior citizens continue to receive a COLA that \nhelps them keep pace with inflation. This bill would restore seniors' \nprotections and ensure that no more than 25 percent of their annual \nCOLAs could be taken away by increases in Medicare premiums. The \nremaining 75 percent would be secure. For a senior citizen receiving a \n$600 monthly benefit, this bill would protect more than $2,200 over the \nnext 10 years. That's money seniors will need to cover increases in \nclothing, food, housing and energy prices.\n  We're not talking about adding an extra benefit to Social Security. \nWe're talking about protecting seniors' existing benefit from a drug \nplan that appears now to be little more than a wolf in sheep's \nclothing.\n  This wasn't the prescription drug bill seniors were promised. Upon \nthe passage of this bill, President Bush said, ``Some older Americans \nspend much of their Social Security checks just on their medications.  \n. . . Elderly Americans should not have to live with those kinds of \nfears and hard choices. This new law will ease the burden on seniors \nand will give them the extra help they need.''\n  As we have seen so often, there has been a gap between what this \nadministration promised, and what it delivered. In the guise of easing \none burden on seniors, the administration has added yet another.\n  I wish the White House and the Republican leadership in Congress had \nlistened more closely to some of the voices of seniors during the \ndebate last Fall. One man from Nashville, Tennessee looked at the \ndetails of this bill and asked, ``Do you think anybody in Washington \nhas any idea what people on a limited income have to do to live?''\n  If the authors of the prescription drug bill truly understood what \nseniors on fixed incomes must go through, they never would have passed \nit.\n  Democrats are fighting to make things right again. We do understand \nthe struggles of America's seniors and the burden drug costs put on \ntheir finances. Seniors were promised a real prescription drug benefit \nfor Medicare. The Republicans' prescription drug bill has proven to be \ntragically inadequate. The COLA protection bill we are introducing \ntoday represents an important step in repairing the damage, and \nDemocrats will keep fighting until seniors get the help they were \npromised and the benefit they deserve.\n  I want to thank the Joint Economic Committee Democrats for their \nefforts to identify and highlight this problem. Senator Jack Reed is \nthe senior Democratic Senator on the Committee, and the lead cosponsor \nof the COLA protection bill. Senator Patty Murray joined us in \nhighlighting the problem yesterday. She is also a cosponsor, along with \nfive other Senate Democrats.\n  This is truly a bicameral effort. My South Dakota colleague, \nStephanie Herseth, is sponsoring the House bill. This is the first bill \nshe is introducing in Congress, and I am proud that she is helping lead \nthis fight for seniors in South Dakota and across the country. Many \nother House Democrats are joining her in this effort.\n  Senator Reed will be inserting the JEC report into the Record. I \nencourage my colleagues to read it. I ask unanimous consent to print in \nthe Record a fact sheet on the bill that was prepared by Representative \nPelosi's office, as well as a document prepared by the House Ways and \nMeans Committee staff that provides several illustrative examples of \nhow the bill would work, how much retirees would save if it becomes \nlaw, and what percentage of Medicare enrollees will benefit. I also ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  We will continue our effort to protect America's seniors and address \nthe problems created by last year's prescription drug bill when \nCongress returns in the fall.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2754\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Yet medical inflation is rising rapidly, and \n     Medicare premium increases will soon consume the entire \n     Social Security COLA. If nothing is done, escalating drug \n     prices will lead to real cuts in the Social Security benefit \n     as a result of new Part D premium increases in 2007 and \n     beyond. Today, Democrats are unveiling a bill to limit how \n     much rising Medicare premiums can impact seniors' COLAs.\n       Social Security COLAs are vital to seniors and the \n     disabled. Millions of Americans rely on their Social Security \n     check each month to make ends meet. Each fall, millions of \n     retirees wait anxiously to learn what the Social Security \n     COLA will be for the coming year--because each dollar is \n     needed to balance their budget.\n       Republican Medicare bill will dramatically reduce Social \n     Security COLAs. Under the GOP Rx drug law, some seniors will \n     have an additional Medicare premium (``Part D'') deducted \n     from their Social Security check. With both the new Medicare \n     Part D premium (for prescription drugs) and the existing Part \n     B premiums (for physician and other outpatient care) deducted \n     from a retiree's Social Security check, Social Security COLAs \n     will be significantly eroded. According to a new report by \n     the Democratic staff of the Joint Economic Committee, when \n     the new drug benefit is in place in 2007 almost one-quarter \n     of Social Security beneficiaries will spend over 25 percent \n     of their COLA just on increases in Medicare premiums--and the \n     number will increase to 64 percent (22 million seniors and \n     people with disabilities) in 2014. For an elderly woman with \n     a monthly benefit of $500, the increase in Medicare premiums \n     will absorb almost 60 percent of the COLA from 2007-2010, and \n     69 percent from 2011-2014.\n       Making a bad problem worse. The goal of the Social Security \n     COLA is to maintain the purchasing power of the benefit check \n     in the face of rising prices. But that objective is \n     undermined if Medicare premiums, which are typically deducted \n     from Social Security checks, increase rapidly. Medical \n     inflation and increased utilization of outpatient services is \n     already increasing Part B premiums, but current law ensures \n     at least that total Social Security benefits do not go down. \n     By refusing to extend this same protection to the new Part D \n     premiums, and refusing to control drug prices, Republicans \n     have made a difficult situation even worse. While the Social \n     Security COLA only increases at the rate of inflation, the \n     premiums beneficiaries face under Part D will increase by the \n     rate of increase in drug prices. According to CBO \n     projections, Part D premiums will increase by an average of \n     7.5 percent a year from 2006 to 2014--a far greater rate of \n     increase than that expected for Part B or the Social Security \n     COLA.\n       Current protection needs improvement. The 2004 Medicare \n     Trustees Report projects that monthly Part B premiums will \n     rise by a record $11.50 for 2005--a one-year increase of more \n     than 17 percent. Given the increased pressures to increase \n     physician payments and the trend of shifting more services to \n     outpatient settings, which increase Part B premiums--and the \n     new costs of Part D--it is important to act now to protect a \n     portion of the COLA for seniors' basic needs.\n       Democrats' bill will protect Social Security. Democrats' \n     ``Social Security COLA Protection Act of 2004'' would ensure \n     that no more than 25 percent of a beneficiary's annual COLA \n     could be taken away by increases in Medicare premiums. Doing \n     so would guarantee that seniors and the disabled retain at \n     least 75 percent of the COLA to cover price increases in \n     other goods and services, such as food, clothing, housing and \n     energy costs. In 2007, the legislation would help over 14 \n     million Social Security recipients. By 2014, it will help \n     more than two-thirds of seniors and people with disabilities, \n     approximately 23 million Americans.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   How the COLA Protection Bill Works\n\n       Example 1. Widow with $500 in monthly Social Security \n     benefits in 2004\n       Her annual Social Security benefit is $6,000, and the COLA \n     will increase her income by $162 in 2005 (a 2.7 percent \n     increase).\n       However, Medicare Part B premiums are projected to rise by \n     at least $114 that year. Without the bill's protection, a \n     premium increase of $114 will eat up 70 percent of her COLA.\n       With the bill's protection, only 25 percent of her COLA \n     will be absorbed by Medicare premium increases, leaving 75 \n     percent ($122 per year) to cover other increases in her cost \n     of living. The bill preserves an additional $74 of COLA to be \n     used for other expenses.\n       By 2009, the bill will save $197 of her COLA. In 2014, $545 \n     of her COLA will be protected. Over 10 years, the projected \n     total savings for this beneficiary will reach $2,615.\n       Example 2. Retired couple with $1,100 in combined monthly \n     Social Security benefits in 2004.\n       Their annual benefits are $13,200: $8,400 for the husband \n     and $4,800 for the wife. A 2.7 percent COLA would increase \n     their income by $356 in 2005.\n       However, the Medicare Part B premiums paid by this couple \n     are projected to rise by at least $228 in 2005. Without the \n     bill's protection, a premium increase of $228 will eat up 64 \n     percent of their combined COLA.\n       With the bill's protection, only 25 percent of their COLAs \n     will be absorbed by Medicare premium increases, leaving 75 \n     percent ($267 per year) to cover other increases in their \n     cost of living. The bill preserves an additional $139 of COLA \n     to be used for other expenses.\n       By 2009, the bill will protect $358 of their COLA. In 2014, \n     $1,016 of their COLA will be protected. Over 10 years, the \n     projected total savings for this couple will reach $4,829.\n       How much would others save?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Savings      Average\n             Annual benefit amount                over 10       annual\n                                                   years      savings\\1\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n$7,200 ($600 per month).......................       $2,213         $221\n$9,000 ($750 per month).......................        1,611          161\n$9,600 ($800 per month).......................        1,410         140\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The particular amount in each year could differ from this average\n  because each year, the amount of protection provided by the bill would\n  depend on the interaction between the Medicare premium increase and\n  that individual's COLA increase. If the premium increase is large\n  while the COLA is small, savings would be larger. If the premium\n  increase is modest while the COLA is large, then savings would be\n  smaller.\n\n       What fraction of those who pay Medicare premiums would \n     benefit from the bill?\n       2005: 90 percent (This is a year when many beneficiaries \n     will need protection to prevent their COLA from being \n     swallowed by Medicare premium increases, because the premium \n     increase is projected to be the largest ever); 2007: 47 \n     percent; 2009: 64 percent; 2011: 68 percent; 2014: 67 \n     percent.\n                                   Ways and Means Democratic Staff\n                                            July 20, 2004, 10 a.m.\n\n                   Joint Economic Committee Democrats\n\n           Representative Pete Stark (D-CA)--Senior Democrat\n\n      Rising Medicare Premiums Undermine the Social Security COLA\n\n\n              new medicare law could cut benefits for some\n\n                   (Economic Policy Brief--July 2004)\n\n       Unlike most private pensions and other forms of retirement \n     annuity income, Social\n\n[[Page S8742]]\n\n     Security, benefits include an annual cost-of-living \n     adjustment (COLA) that is designed to prevent an erosion of \n     benefits due to inflation. Unfortunately, rising health care \n     costs and last year's Medicare law threaten this valuable \n     cost-of-living protection.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       In 1975 Congress replaced ad hoc increases in Social \n     Security benefits with an automatic COLA based on the \n     previous year's change in the consumer price index (CPI). The \n     CPI is an index of prices paid by the typical consumer for a \n     representative bundle of goods and services. The goal of the \n     COLA is to ensure that Social Security benefits keep pace \n     with increases in the price of food, clothing, and other \n     necessities--including medical care--so that seniors and \n     other beneficiaries can maintain a stable quality-of-life.\n       Participants in Medicare Part B, which covers doctors' \n     services, pay a monthly premium that is deducted from their \n     Social Security check. So too will most participants in \n     Medicare Part D, the new prescription drug program. The size \n     of the premiums is based on projected costs for those \n     respective programs. During periods of rapidly rising health \n     care costs, increases in Medicare premiums can represent a \n     significant fraction of the overall Social Security COLA for \n     many Social Security beneficiaries. With the latest \n     Medicare changes, some may even see their benefits cut as \n     their premium increases outpace their COLAs.\n       Current law puts a limit on the extent to which growth in \n     Medicare Part B premiums can erode the purchasing power of an \n     individual's Social Security benefit. The ``hold harmless'' \n     provision guarantees that the increase in a person's Part B \n     premium will not be larger than that person's COLA. This \n     ensures that the dollar amount of the benefit received after \n     deducting the Part B premium will never be reduced, but it \n     does not guarantee that the purchasing power of that benefit \n     will not fall. In fact, the entire COLA could be consumed. \n     The latest Medicare legislation does not apply even this \n     ``hold harmless'' protection to the Part D prescription drug \n     premium. Thus, seniors are exposed to the possibility that \n     large increases in medical costs, especially unchecked \n     prescription drug costs, could eat up a large piece of their \n     Social Security COLA and even cut their Social Security \n     benefit.\n\n\n   recent experience with colas and medicare part b premium increases\n\n       During the past three years, rapidly rising health \n     expenditures have been accompanied by large increases in \n     Medicare premiums. Based on current projections, the \n     cumulative increase in the monthly Part B Medicare premium \n     during the four years of the Bush Administration will be at \n     least $26, nearly twice as much as the total increase of \n     $13.40 over the entire eight years of the Clinton \n     Administration. At the same time that Medicare premiums have \n     been rising rapidly, inflation has been very low. As a \n     result, Social Security COLAs have been relatively modest, \n     and many beneficiaries have seen a substantial portion of \n     their COLA consumed by the increases in Medicare premiums.\n       In 2004, for example, Social Security beneficiaries \n     received a COLA of 2.1 percent ($2.10 for each $100 of \n     monthly benefit). At the same time, the monthly premium for \n     Medicare Part B increased from $58.70 to $66.60, an increase \n     of $7.90 or 13.5 percent. Table 1 shows what part of the COLA \n     was consumed by the increase in the Part B premium for \n     individuals receiving different levels of monthly benefit.\n\nTABLE 1.--IMPACT OF MEDICARE PREMIUM INCREASES ON SOCIAL SECURITY COLAS,\n                                  2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             Fraction of\n                                               COLA after        COLA\n                                2004 Social     deducting    absorbed by\n    Monthly Social Security       Security     increase in     Medicare\n   benefit in 2004 (dollars)        COLA        medicare       premium\n                                 (dollars)      premiums      increases\n                                                (dollars)     (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n384...........................         7.90            0.00          100\n500...........................        10.28            2.38           77\n750...........................        15.43            7.53           51\n1,000.........................        20.57           12.67           38\n1,250.........................        25.71           17.81           31\n1,500.........................        30.85           22.95          26\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: JEC Democratic staff, based on Congresssional Budget Office\n  projections.\n\n       Individuals with 2004 monthly Social Security benefits of \n     less than $384 received a COLA in 2004 that was less than the \n     increase in Medicare premiums. Because of the ``hold \n     harmless'' provision, their premium increase was limited to \n     the amount of their COLA. Still, for these individuals (an \n     estimated 1.4 million people), their entire Social Security \n     COLA was wiped out, leaving them nothing to pay for increases \n     in all other goods and services they consume.\n       Individuals with a monthly benefit of $1,000 (roughly the \n     average benefit of retired men) had to devote nearly 40 \n     percent of their COLA to the increase in their Medicare \n     premium. Those with a monthly benefit of $750 (roughly the \n     average benefit of retired women) needed half their COLA to \n     cover the increase in Medicare premiums. And those with a \n     monthly benefit of $500 (roughly the average benefit of wives \n     of retired workers) needed more than three-quarters of their \n     COLA to pay for the increase in their Medicare premium.\n\n\n            The Impact of Part D Prescription Drug Premiums\n\n       Current forecasts indicate that the Medicare Part B premium \n     increase in 2005 will be the largest dollar amount ever.\\1\\ \n     As a result, seniors can expect another year like 2004, when \n     increases in Medicare premiums will absorb a large percentage \n     of their COLA. CBO's current projections call for the rate of \n     increase in Medicare premiums to abate after 2005, but those \n     projections do not reflect possible legislative changes that \n     would increase physician payments, resulting in higher \n     premiums. Furthermore, beginning in 2006, seniors \n     participating in the Part D prescription drug program will \n     have an additional Medicare premium for that program deducted \n     from their Social Security check.\n       Using CBO's projections of the Social Security COLA and \n     Medicare premium costs, the Joint Economic Committee \n     Democratic staff has estimated the portion of the COLA that \n     will be absorbed by increases in Medicare premiums incoming \n     years. For a person with a monthly benefit of $500 (in 2004 \n     dollars), the annual increase in combined Part B and Part D \n     premiums will absorb almost three-fifths of the annual COLA, \n     on average, during the 2007-2010 period. Medicare premiums \n     will absorb over two-thirds of the COLA in the 2011-2014 \n     period. Increases in Medicare premiums will absorb a lesser \n     but still significant fraction of the COLA for individuals \n     with larger monthly benefits (Table 2). Because there is no \n     ``hold harmless'' protection, up to 2 percent of \n     beneficiaries could experience benefit cuts.\n\n    TABLE 2.--AVERAGE IMPACT OF MEDICARE PREMIUM INCREASES ON SOCIAL\n                 SECURITY COLAS, 2007-2010 AND 2011-2014\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             Average fraction of COLA\n                                            absorbed by Medicare Part B\n Monthly Social Security benefit  (2004    and Part D premium increases\n                dollars)                             (percent)\n                                         -------------------------------\n                                             2007-2010       2011-2014\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n500.....................................              59              69\n1,000...................................              24              34\n1,500...................................              16             23\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: JEC Democratic staff, based on Congressional Budget Office\n  projections.\n\n       Although the rising cost of Medicare Part B and Part D \n     premiums can absorb a very large fraction of the annual \n     Social Security COLA for those with modest benefit checks, \n     the problem is not confined to them. CBO estimates that in \n     2007, the first year that increases in Part D premiums will \n     have an impact, 6.9 million people, or nearly 25 percent of \n     those who have Medicare premiums withheld from their Social \n     Security benefit will see at least one-quarter of their \n     COLA absorbed by increases in combined Part B and Part D \n     premiums. By 2014, 64 percent of beneficiaries, or 22.2 \n     million people, will lose at least 25 percent of their \n     COLA to increases in their Medicare premium.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       For Social Security beneficiaries, the annual COLA is an \n     important protection against rising prices eroding the real \n     purchasing power of their benefit. In the past three years, \n     however, rapidly rising health care costs have undermined \n     this protection by driving up Medicare Part B premiums, which \n     are automatically deducted from participants' monthly Social \n     Security check.For many participants, the increase in \n     Medicare premiums has absorbed a large fraction of their \n     annual COLA, leaving little to deal with the rising costs of \n     all the other goods and services the COLA is meant to cover. \n     That problem will be aggravated when the new premiums for \n     Part D prescription drug coverage take effect, unless \n     policymakers take action to address this gutting of Social \n     Security COLA protection.\n\n\n                                Endnote\n\n       1. If past practice is followed, the Social Security COLA \n     percentage increase and the increase for Medicare premiums \n     will be announced in mid-October. Me calculations used in \n     this paper assume an increase in the 2005 monthly Part B \n     premium of $9.50. That is higher than the current CBO \n     baseline estimate of $8.70, but the JEC Democratic staff \n     believes that CBO's estimate will increase when it updates \n     its baseline in August. The Medicare actuaries are currently \n     predicting an even higher increase of $11.50 in the monthly \n     premium.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join with the distinguished \nDemocratic Leader and Senator Murray in introducing the ``Social \nSecurity COLA Protection Act of 2004.'' I would also ask unanimous \nconsent to submit for the Record the report by the Joint Economic \nCommittee Democratic staff entitled, ``Rising Medicare Premiums \nUndermine the Social Security COLA.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you. Mr. President, Social Security is the bedrock of \nthis country's social safety net and our most effective antipoverty \nprogram for seniors and the disabled. A valuable feature of Social \nSecurity is the annual cost of living adjustment, or COLA, which was \nenacted to ensure that the\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\nreal purchasing power of beneficiaries' checks would be preserved, and \nnot eaten away by inflation. I would also point out that such COLA \nprotection is missing from most private pensions.\n  Sadly, what the JEC Democrats' report has revealed is that large \nincreases in health care costs and the poor design of the new Medicare \nprescription drug plan have created a situation in which rising \nMedicare premiums are undermining the Social Security COLA. The problem \nis already serious, and we have not even begun to experience the impact \nof the prescription drug premium of the new Medicare Part D program \nthat will take effect in 2006.\n  The study shows, for example, that in the years 2011-2014, a person \nwith a monthly Social Security benefit of $500 (in today's dollars) \nwould see 69 percent of her COLA consumed by increases in Medicare Part \nB and Part D premiums. That leaves far too little of the COLA to cover \nincreases in prices of other necessities such as food, energy, and \nother medical expenses. Even people with larger monthly benefits would \nsee their COLAs substantially eroded by the increases in Medicare \npremiums.\n  Finally, the study shows that by 2014, if there is no legislation to \naddress this problem, 64 percent of beneficiaries who have their \nMedicare premiums deducted from their Social Security checks will lose \nat least 25 percent of their Social Security COLA to increases in those \npremiums.\n  The JEC Democratic staff study makes a compelling case that we have a \nserious problem on our hands. That is why I am happy to cosponsor ``The \nSocial Security COLA Protection Act of 2004.'' This legislation will \npreserve the essential safety net Social Security provides seniors, by \nmaking sure that at least 75 percent of their Social Security COLA is \nprotected from increases in Medicare premiums and available to offset \nincreasing cost of other goods and services seniors need in order to \nmaintain an adequate quality-of-life.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2755. A bill to amend the Consumer Credit Protection Act to ban \nabusive credit practices, enhance consumer disclosures, protect \nunderage consumers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is often said that small things can make \na very large difference in our society. That saying certainly fits the \nsubject I have come to speak briefly about this afternoon. That little \nthing in question that I am talking about is 3\\1/8\\ inches wide, 2\\1/8\\ \ninches long, and no thicker than one's fingernail. But it has a \nmonumental impact on how millions of Americans live their lives each \nand every day. The object to which I am referring, of course, is the \ncredit card.\n  We have come a long way from the day in 1950 when the Diner's Club \nissued the first universal credit card that allowed its holders to use \ncredit at certain very select restaurants in New York City. Today, the \ncredit card has become an indispensable part of how we do business in \nthe United States, and across the globe, for that matter.\n  For many Americans, the main appeal of the credit card is convenience \nand flexibility. They allow us to go out and eat, go to a shopping \nmall, to the movies, and stop off at the grocery store on the way home, \nwithout folding a single bill or fumbling for loose change in their \npockets. Credit cards allow people to shop for products on the Internet \nin a matter of seconds.\n  But for more and more Americans, credit cards serve a very different \npurpose. As the name implies, these cards provide access to credit. We \nare living in a time when real wages are failing to keep up with price \nincreases, when health care costs and college tuition are on the rise. \nMillions of Americans are having difficulty making ends meet. For \nAmericans who are strapped for cash, credit cards are much more than a \nconvenience. They have become the only way they can afford basic \nnecessities, such as food, gas, clothing, and medical care.\n  These Americans are not paying by credit card because they want to; \nthey are doing so because they have no other choice. It is this \nfunction of credit cards that make them so appealing to American \nconsumers, but I must also say it is this function that presents the \ngreatest danger to them as well.\n  Today, the level of credit card debt in the United States is at \nrecord heights. Total consumer debt in America is over $2 trillion. Out \nof that, $735 billion is credit card debt. The average American \nhousehold has over $9,000 worth of credit card debt. Let me repeat \nthat. The average family living in the United States has over $9,000 of \ncredit card debt. In comparison, the average family household income is \njust above $40,000.\n  Due in large part to credit card debt, more Americans are filing for \nbankruptcy. Last year, over 1.6 million families declared they were \nbankrupt. For every one family that actually does file for bankruptcy, \nthere are seven more whose debt suggests that they, in fact, should do \nthe same.\n  Credit card debt does not affect all Americans equally. It is a \ngrowing burden that is disproportionately being borne by middle-income, \nlow-income, and working-poor families. According to a recent report, \nduring the 1990s, on average, the American family saw its credit card \ndebt go up by 53 percent. The debt of middle-class families, those \nearning between $50,000 and $100,000 a year, went up 75 percent. For \nthe older Americans, senior citizens, their average credit card debt \nwent up 149 percent. Finally, for very low-income families, those \nmaking less than $10,000 a year, credit card debt grew by a shocking \n184 percent.\n  Why is this happening? Why are millions of Americans drowning in \ncredit card debt? There are some who would describe the numbers I just \nquoted as a matter of personal responsibility, that some Americans are \nspending way beyond their means and ultimately are paying the price.\n  I do believe personal responsibility is extremely important, but many \nof the victims of credit card debt today are not in that state because \nthey bought a home entertainment system, an expensive vacation, or a \nplasma TV set.\n  Take Roberto Towler. Roberto was a professional accountant who was \nvery careful to always pay his bills on time. In early 2000 he was \nforced to take 2 months off from work because of a back injury. The \nlost salary meant he had much less cash on hand than before. He had no \nalternative but to use his credit card for toiletries, clothes for his \nchildren, and groceries. He eventually was able to return to work and \nscale back the use of his credit card, but he found himself barely able \nto pay back his debt. Eventually Roberto was forced to file bankruptcy \nwith $22,000 of credit card debt.\n  Many Americans have stories just like Mr. Towler. They work hard, \nthey play by the rules, but after a few twists of fate suddenly find \nthemselves in a tremendous debt. For those caught in the quicksand of \ndebt, a credit card appears to be a lifeline. But, in reality, it only \npulls them in deeper and deeper.\n\n  We often speak of the ill and infirm as living on borrowed time. \nThese people are living on borrowed money.\n  In the middle of all this are credit card companies. If we demand \nresponsibility from individuals, and we should, and we do demand it, \nthen we also ought to demand it from corporations as well. \nResponsibility is not limited to those who are consumers alone.\n  The reason I am here today is because a good deal of the blame for \nthe crisis in credit card debt we are seeing in America lies in the \npractices of credit card companies.\n  I am not someone who takes regulatory reform lightly. I am not a \nbeliever in regulation that stifles innovation or efficiency. But at \nthe same time, when we see practices that are truly hurting working \nfamilies around the country, I believe we have an obligation to act. \nJust what kind of practices are we talking about? Let me spell it out.\n  Let's start with interest rates. I am not naive about this. I \ncertainly do not expect credit card companies to be terribly benevolent \nwhen it comes to interest rates. But what I expect, and what all \nAmericans deserve, is honesty and fairness.\n  We have all seen print ads and commercials that advertise \nfantastically low interest rates, sometimes as low as zero percent. But \nwhat these commercials don't tell you is that these teaser rates, as \nthey are called, often expire and rise considerably only after a few \nmonths.\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\n  If you slip up even once by failing to make a minimum monthly \npayment, your interest rate may go up even faster. Just one mistake can \nbe enough to drive an interest rate up by nearly 30 percentage points. \nOf course that information is usually hidden in the fine print of a \nlengthy disclosure statement.\n  Most Americans would assume that their interest rates will stay low \nas long as they make their minimum monthly payments. Not so. Today, \ncredit card companies don't just look at the bill that you pay them, \nthey look at your entire financial picture in deciding how high your \ninterest rate ought to be, how high a rate they ought to charge you.\n  I learned of a doctor in Illinois who had always paid his credit card \nbills on time and stayed within his credit card limits. Then one day he \ntook a look at his bill and discovered that the interest rate on his \ncredit card had jumped from 6 percent to nearly 17 percent. He asked \nthe credit card issuer, why? The company said that he was now a higher \nrisk.\n  What was the reason?\n  He had taken out a mortgage on his new home.\n  This is incredible to me. There are few things more rewarding to a \nfamily than buying their first home. We celebrate home ownership here \nin America. Apparently for credit card companies it's a reason to \ncelebrate as well, because it's an excuse to charge higher interest \nrates.\n  Interest rates, of course, are not the only way credit card companies \nmake money. In recent years, more and more companies have found another \nway to increase their bottom lines, by assessing exorbitant fees for \nthe most minor of offenses. Miss a payment by a single day and you may \nbe charged $30 or even $40 for that mistake. Gone are the grace periods \nthat gave consumers some reasonable leeway.\n  Over the past 2 years, the amount of money generated by credit card \nfees has simply skyrocketed. In fact, the term ``skyrocketed'' may be \nsomething of an understatement. In 1996, the fees raised $1.7 billion \nfor credit card companies. That's 1996. Last year the credit card \ncompanies raised $11 billion in fees alone, only 8 years later.\n  You might think that if credit card companies know that someone is a \nrisk they would take some action to limit that person's spending, such \nas lowering their credit line. Or perhaps they might not issue a card \nto that person in the first place.\n\n  But there is a little secret the credit card companies don't want \nAmericans to know. They are actively soliciting and signing up \ncustomers who are tremendous credit risks. They are soliciting these \npeople not in spite of the risk, but because of it.\n  Contrary to what one might think, customers who cannot afford to pay \ntheir bills on time are the credit card companies' best customers--not \ntheir worst. Unbelievably, these customers who do pay on time are known \nwithin the credit card industry as ``deadbeats.''\n  Let me repeat that. Those who pay their credit card bills on time are \nknown within the industry as ``deadbeats.'' Why is this? Because when \npeople fail to pay their bills on time, that means more profits for the \ncredit card industry, in the form of more interest charges and penalty \nfees.\n  How much more of a profit? Let's say you are the average American, \nwith $9,000 in credit card debt, which is the case today. Let's say you \nstopped accumulating any more debt and decided you would pay it off by \nmaking the minimum monthly payment of 2 percent. Let's say further that \nyour interest rate is 15 percent--which is just about the average \ntoday, I might add.\n  How long would it take you to pay off that debt? Five years? Ten \nyears? Twenty years? It would take 39 years to pay off your debt. Over \nthe course of those 39 years, you would pay $14,000 in interest \npayments alone, in addition to the $9,000 you owe. This is all \nassuming, of course, that your interest rate wouldn't rise over those \nyears and that you wouldn't be hit with unexpected fees.\n  Credit card companies know this. They know their greatest chance of \nfinancial profit lies in those customers who have the least chance of \npaying their bills on time. That is why they continue to solicit these \ncustomers and that is why those who do pay on time are known within the \nindustry as the deadbeats.\n  Last year, credit card companies mailed out 5 billion solicitations \nto about 200 million individuals in the United States. The average \nperson received about one offer every other week. The average household \nreceived more than one per week. I guarantee that a great many of these \npeople do not have sparkling credit ratings, yet these companies \ncontinue to send out offer after offer, hoping that yet another \ncustomer will take the bait.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from the July 6, 2004 edition of the Wall Street Journal \nentitled ``Growing Profit Source for Banks: Fees from Riskiest Card \nHolders.''\n  This goes into the topic in greater detail.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Wall Street Journal Online, July 6, 2004]\n\n    Growing Profit Source for Banks: Fees From Riskiest Card Holders\n\n                         (By Mitchell Pacelle)\n\n       When Jennifer Reid opened her credit-card statement in \n     April, she discovered how expensive it was to make full use \n     of her credit.\n       The 42-year-old X-ray technologist had run through $10,000 \n     of her $12,000 credit line on an MBNA Corp. card. In April, \n     her annual interest rate abruptly jumped to 24.98%, up from \n     19.98% the prior month and far above the initial single-digit \n     rate.\n       ``I don't understand,'' she recalls telling an MBNA \n     customer-service representative on the phone, complaining \n     that she hadn't been late with a single payment. The \n     representative agreed but pointed out that she had run up \n     more than $5,000 of debt on two other cards. Also, she was \n     making only slightly more than the minimum suggested monthly \n     payments on her MBNA card. He said the company now saw her as \n     a credit risk and feared it would take her forever to pay off \n     her debts. ``Isn't that what you want consumers to do?'' she \n     snapped back.\n       That's a question more financially strapped bank customers \n     are asking these days. For consumers who pay off their \n     credit-card balances each month, shop aggressively for \n     interest rates as low as 0%, and take advantage of generous \n     credit-card rewards programs, consumer credit has never been \n     cheaper. But for others like Ms. Reid, who went into debt so \n     she could move to a better job in Florida from South \n     Carolina, the trend is in the other direction.\n       Card users, consumer advocates and some industry experts \n     complain that banks are attempting to squeeze more and more \n     revenue from consumers struggling to make ends meet. Instead \n     of cutting these people off as bad credit risks, banks are \n     letting them spend--and then hitting them with larger and \n     larger penalties for running up their credit, going over \n     their credit limits, paying late and getting cash advances \n     from their credit cards. The fees are also piling up for \n     bounced checks and overdrawn accounts.\n       ``People think they are being swindled,'' says industry \n     consultant Duncan MacDonald, formerly a lawyer for the \n     credit-card division of Citigroup Inc. Penalty fees aren't \n     new, but they are becoming more important to the \n     industry's bottom line and are being borne by the people \n     who can least afford to pay them, he contends.\n       Cardweb.com, a consulting group that tracks the card \n     industry, says credit-card fees, including those from \n     retailers, rose to 33.4% of total credit-card revenue in \n     2003. That was up from 27.9% in 2000 and just 16.1% in 1996. \n     The average monthly late fee hit $32.01 in May, up from \n     $30.29 a year earlier and $13.30 in May 1996, the company \n     said. In 2003, the credit-card industry reaped $11.7 billion \n     from penalty fees, up 9% from $10.7 billion a year earlier, \n     according to Robert Hammer, an industry consultant.\n       ``As competitive pressure builds on the front-end pricing, \n     it has pushed a lot of the profit streams to the back end of \n     the card--to these fees,'' says Robert McKinley, chief \n     executive of CardWeb.com. Over the past two years, he said, \n     ``it's become much more aggressive.'' At industry \n     conferences, he notes, talk often turns to ``what the market \n     will bear.''\n       Banks say that penalties and fees are a necessary component \n     of new models for pricing financial services. Gone are the \n     days when banks collected hefty annual fees on all credit \n     cards and charged fat interest rates to all customers. Now, \n     the banks say, they must rely on risk-based pricing models \n     under which customers with the shakiest finances pay higher \n     rates and more fees.\n       ``We look at teaser rates as an area that we have to be \n     competitive in,'' said Richard Srednicki, a top credit-card \n     executive at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., during a conference \n     call with investors last fall. He said the bank tries to \n     ``mix and match how we compete'' on interest rates and fees \n     ``in order to make the kinds of returns that we're looking \n     for.''\n       An MBNA spokesman declined to comment on Ms. Reid's \n     experience but noted that one of the most important \n     considerations in setting a credit card's interest rate is \n     ``how a customer manages his account.'' If a customer's \n     financial circumstances change for\n\n[[Page S8745]]\n\n     the worse, he said, the bank has to raise the rate ``as a way \n     of balancing that greater risk.''\n       Such variable pricing has been embraced in recent years by \n     airlines, mortgage lenders and others. What raises the \n     hackles of bank customers, however, is that many don't \n     discover the rate changes and penalty fees until they have \n     already been hit with them. Those who complain are directed \n     to disclosure statements that most consumers never read. \n     These disclosures, says Mr. MacDonald, have ballooned from \n     little more than a page 20 years ago to 30 pages or more of \n     small print today.\n       Federal Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., one \n     of the nation's top bank regulators, warned bankers at a \n     conference last fall that ``no retail banking activity \n     generates more consumer complaints'' than credit-card \n     practices, ``and where there are persistent and serious \n     complaints, there is a fertile seedbed for legislation.''\n       Mr. Hawke raised the case in which a customer presents a \n     credit card at the cash register and the bank approves the \n     transaction even though it knows that the purchase will \n     push the customer over his credit limit. ``If, as a \n     practical matter, the line has been increased, is it \n     unfair or deceptive for the creditor to continue to impose \n     an overline `penalty'?'' he asked.\n       Until the early 1990s, most banks offered one main credit-\n     card product. It typically carried an annual interest rate of \n     about 18% and an annual fee of $25. Cardholders who paid late \n     or strayed over their credit limit were charged modest fees. \n     Profits from good customers covered losses from those who \n     defaulted.\n       Then card issuers, in an effort to grab market share, began \n     scrapping annual fees and vying to offer the lowest annual \n     interest rates. They junked simple pricing models in favor of \n     complex ones they say were tailored to cardholders' risk and \n     behavior. Eager to sustain growth in a market approaching \n     saturation, they began offering more cards to consumers with \n     spotty credit.\n       By the late 1990s, banks were attracting consumers with low \n     introductory rates, then subjecting some of them to a myriad \n     of ``risk-related fees,'' such as late fees and over-limit \n     fees. A 2001 survey by the Federal Reserve showed that 30% of \n     general-purpose credit-card holders had paid a late fee in \n     the prior year.\n       Like Ms. Reid, more customers are seeing red when they \n     discover the penalties on bank statements. Credit-card late-\n     payment charges have risen to as high as $39 for some \n     customers of Bank of America Corp., MBNA, and Providian \n     Financial Corp., and fewer banks grant grace periods. \n     Cardholders who exceed their credit limits face ``over \n     limit'' fees as high as $39 a month.\n       In a survey of 140 credit cards this year, the advocacy \n     group Consumer Action said 85% of the banks make it a \n     practice to raise interest rates for customers who pay late--\n     often after a single late payment. Nearly half raise rates if \n     they find out that a customer is in arrears with another \n     creditor.\n       Since the banks disclose the fees in the fine print of \n     their mailings, they have had little to fear from regulators \n     and the courts. Consumer lawyers have lost a string of \n     lawsuits challenging such practices. A little-noticed April \n     ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court said credit-card companies \n     don't have to include various penalty fees when they \n     calculate the ``finance charge'' listed on a customer's \n     monthly statement.\n       And bank regulators have been reluctant to promulgate new \n     regulations. The Federal Reserve Board and four other \n     regulatory groups recently disappointed consumer groups by \n     failing to take a strong stand against ``bounce protection'' \n     plans. These programs allow customers to overdraw their \n     checking accounts in exchange for a fee each time they do it \n     that can exceed $30. Critics call bounce protection little \n     more than an expensive short-term loan since the overdrawn \n     amount must be covered quickly.\n       Banks are charging as much as $32 per transaction when \n     customers write a check or make a debit-card purchase without \n     enough money in their accounts to cover the payment. Five \n     years ago, $20 was more typical.\n       Alicia Flynn, who works in the billing department of a San \n     Francisco hospital, used her Bank of America debit card on \n     Jan. 28 of last year to make four small purchases, including \n     a $2.27 cup of cafeteria soup. But several checks she and her \n     husband had written also hit their account that day. When the \n     bank tallied up the account later that day, it posted some of \n     the checks before the debit- card charges, which had already \n     been cleared at the register. That left the account \n     overdrawn by $40.17. The Flynns were hit with separate $28 \n     ``insufficient fund'' fees for two checks and all four \n     debit-card transactions, hitting the maximum daily penalty \n     of $140.\n       ``It is somewhat like having a meter maid put five parking \n     citations on your car for one parking violation,'' complains \n     Mrs. Flynn's husband, Richard Flynn.\n       Mr. Flynn later learned that subtracting the biggest check \n     first is standard procedure for Bank of America. In response \n     to his complaint letter, a Bank of America representative \n     enclosed a copy of a booklet she said every customer received \n     when opening an account, and directed Mr. Flynn to page 54. \n     It describes the policy and warns customers that ``this \n     method may result in additional overdraft fees.''\n       A bank spokesman maintains that most customers want large \n     checks to clear first because they tend to be for important \n     items such as a rent payment. The $28 penalty fee, he said, \n     is intended to ``make sure that customers don't run their \n     balances so close to zero,'' and is priced ``to assign a cost \n     of the risk it exposes the bank to.''\n       Banking fees have long been a subject of legislation and \n     litigation. One decision that has helped banks boost their \n     penalty fees came in 1996, when the Supreme Court said states \n     can't regulate such charges if they're levied by out-of-state \n     banks.\n       The 1968 federal Truth in Lending Act was enacted to \n     promote ``awareness of credit costs on the part of \n     consumers.'' It required ``meaningful disclosure of credit \n     terms'' but didn't say anything specifically about credit-\n     card fees. In the act, Congress directed the Federal Reserve \n     Board to enact regulations. The Fed responded with Regulation \n     Z, which requires credit-card issuers to disclose the cost of \n     credit as a dollar amount, known as the ``finance charge,'' \n     and as an annual percentage rate. Fees for late payments and \n     the like were not to be included in either calculation.\n       As a college student in the mid-1990s, Sharon R. Pfennig \n     signed up for a card with a $2,000 credit limit. In 1997, \n     buying clothing at a mall, she blew past her credit limit by \n     $192. Household International Inc. began tacking on a $20 \n     over-limit fee each month. Ms. Pfennig stopped using the card \n     and continued to make her $45 minimum monthly payments. But \n     the monthly penalty fee, coupled with the $35 to $40 she paid \n     each month as interest on her debt, caused her balance to \n     continue climbing. Her monthly over-limit fee then jumped to \n     $29, and her fee total eventually ballooned to about $700.\n       In 1999, Ms. Pfennig filed a lawsuit in Ohio federal court \n     against Household and MBNA, which had purchased the Household \n     credit-card portfolio that contained her account. The lawsuit \n     accused Household of misrepresenting the true cost of credit \n     by not including over-limit fees in its disclosed ``finance \n     charges'' on her monthly statement. The suit said this \n     practice, which adhered to Regulation Z, nonetheless violated \n     the Truth in Lending Act.\n       An appeals court agreed with Ms. Pfennig but the Supreme \n     Court, ruling April 21 of this year, sided with the credit-\n     card company. It said Regulation Z is reasonable and \n     companies that follow it are in compliance with the law.\n       ``I'm getting completely disheartened,'' said Sandusky, \n     Ohio, consumer lawyer Sylvia Goldsmith, who represented Ms. \n     Pfennig before the high court.\n       In the Pfennig case, MBNA and Household defended the \n     treatment of fees under current disclosure regulations as \n     simpler for both consumers and banks. ``This bright-line rule \n     ensures that creditors disclose over-limit fees in an \n     understandable and consistent manner, permitting consumers to \n     compare such fees across time and across credit-card issuers \n     in a meaningful way,'' the two banks noted in a Supreme Court \n     brief.\n       For now, the only way for consumers to know what they're \n     getting into is to plow through the disclosure materials they \n     receive when they open bank accounts or get new credit cards. \n     Most never do--as Mr. Flynn, the disgruntled Bank of America \n     customer, admits. ``We just opened a simple bank account, and \n     they gave us a 78-page booklet, small print, and they expect \n     us to read and understand it,'' he complains.\n       Ms. Reid, the Florida cardholder, says she is far more \n     careful now about studying her credit-card mail. ``I read eve \n     single solitary word now. I hope one of these days I won't \n     have to have a credit card at all.''\n\n  Mr. DODD. What I find most troubling about this trend is that credit \ncard companies have set their sights on the most vulnerable members of \nour society when it comes to debt--low-income individuals, the elderly, \nmentally retarded, and most recently, our children.\n  Go to any college campus in America and you are bound to come across \na table where an enthusiastic sales person is offering free T-shirts, \nor sports bags, or Frisbees--almost anything in exchange for signing up \nas a credit card customer. According to a report on CBS News, the \naverage college student is offered 8 cards in his or her first semester \nin college--8 credit cards. By the end of college, the average \ngraduating senior has 6 credit cards in his or her name.\n  Why are credit card companies targeting college students so \nfrequently? Because of their limited experience with financial matters, \nstudents tend to accumulate debt very quickly, and as a result, more \nand more of our young people are falling deeper and deeper into the \nfinancial hole from which they cannot escape.\n  In 1998, 67 percent of college students had a credit card. Today, 83 \npercent have credit cards. In 1998, the average college student \ngraduated with $1,800 in credit card debt. Today the average college \nsenior graduates with $3,000 in credit card debt.\n  I was shocked to learn that the fastest growing segment of our \npopulation that is forced to declare bankruptcy is people under the age \nof 25. Think of\n\n[[Page S8746]]\n\nthat. The fastest growing group of people declaring bankruptcy are \npeople under the age of 25.\n  When we think about bankruptcy, we generally envision middle-aged \nAmericans with failed businesses, investments gone bad, perhaps medical \nbills that have spiraled out of control. The answer is not so. It's \ncollege kids, recent graduates.\n  Some time ago, a piece on ``60 Minutes II'' told a story of one \nstudent's circumstance, Sean Moyer. I have told the story on the floor \nbefore but I think it deserves being repeated.\n  Sean's life began to spin out of control as a result of huge debts \nracked up in 3 years of college. He could not get loans to go to law \nschool, as he dreamed. His parents couldn't afford to pay his way.\n  Sean Moyer had 12 credit cards and more than $10,000 in debts. He had \ntwo jobs, one at the library, another as a security guard in a Holiday \nInn, but he still could not pay the collectors who continually harassed \nhim with letters and phone calls. In 1998, Sean Moyer took his own \nlife.\n  Three years after his son's death, his mother still gets pre-approved \ncredit card offers in Sean's name. According to his mother, one company \npreapproved Sean for a $100,000 credit card line.\n  How is the credit card industry doing as a result of these practices? \nThese companies are thriving. Credit Card Management, an industry \npublication, reported that 2003 was the most profitable year for credit \ncards since the magazine began tracking the industry in 1992.\n  What makes matters even more astonishing is that this is happening \nwhen interest rates are at an all-time low. Yet, for millions of \nAmericans, the interest rates they read about in the newspapers, those \nset by the Federal Reserve, bear absolutely no relationship whatsoever \nto interest rates that appear on their credit card bills.\n  Still, the industry wants more. In recent years, while they have been \nencouraging consumers to accumulate debt, credit card companies have \nsimultaneously been lobbying Congress to change bankruptcy laws to make \nit harder and harder for people to have their debts forgiven. This \namounts to a two pronged attack on working families in America--get \npeople into as much debt as possible, and then change the rules of the \ngame so they can't get rid of that debt.\n  It is time we stood up for consumers. It is time we restored a sense \nof responsibility to this industry.\n  I am here today to introduce the Credit Card Accountability, \nResponsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2004, also known as the Credit \nCARD Act. This bill takes aim at what I consider to be some of the more \negregious abuses of consumers by credit card companies.\n  This bill takes some simple, common-sense steps to stop abusive \npractices, educate cardholders, and stiffen the penalties on \ncorporations that violate the law.\n  First of all, I think we can all agree that it is reasonable for a \nconsumer to be clearly notified if his or her interest rates are going \nup. That is not a radical idea, that is just common sense. My bill \nwould require clear disclosure of any rate changes so there aren't any \nsurprises for the average consumer.\n  I also don't believe a company should be able to retroactively change \nthe interest rate on debt that already exists. If you want to raise \ninterest rates, fine, but raise them on future debt, not existing debt. \nOur bill would prohibit any retroactive interest rate changes.\n  Second, I believe that companies should be rewarding people for \nresponsible card use--not penalizing them. If you pay your bills on \ntime, your interest rate shouldn't go up. If you pay off your balances \nin full, your company shouldn't be able to charge you any new fees. If \nyou decide to cancel your card, your interest rate shouldn't go up. I \nam pointing out these facts because that is exactly what happens. My \nbill would codify all of these common-sense principles into law.\n  Third, my bill would protect some of the most vulnerable in our \nsociety--our Nation's youth--by implementing new requirements for \nissuing credit cards to people under the age of 21. We are not going to \nprohibit college students from getting cards, but we are going to make \nsure that companies can't simply give away cards to millions and \nmillions of students who they know will rack up years and years worth \nof debt and potentially face bankruptcy and financial ruin before their \nworking lives have barely begun.\n  If you apply for a credit card and you are under 21, under this bill \nyou will need one of three things: A signature of a parent or guardian \nwho is willing to take responsibility for your debt; information \nindicating that you have some other means of repaying any debt; or a \ncertification that you have completed a credit counseling course. And \nif you are a credit card company that offers cards to students under \n21, you will be required to comply with these requirements--or face \nserious penalties.\n  Finally, this bill requires companies to be honest with consumers by \nintroducing some new disclosure requirements. The most important one is \na box--prominently located on every single bill--containing four simple \npieces of information: The total balance on your account; your minimum \nmonthly payment; how long it will take to pay your bill if all you pay \nis the minimum monthly payment; and finally, how much you will have to \npay over time--in both interest and principal--if you only make the \nminimum payments.\n  The reason for these disclosures is simple, and to many, probably \nobvious: To allow consumers to know exactly what it means to carry a \ndebt, so they can decide whether or not to do so.\n  The Credit CARD Act also contains a number of additional disclosure \nrequirements to bring more transparency to an industry that has clearly \nreaped benefits from the use of fine print and lengthy and confusing \npolicy statements.\n  We are not asking for much here--only that companies be fair and \nstraightforward with consumers. Let us see some real disclosures so \nAmericans can understand what their bill means, how much they are being \ncharged, and why.\n  No one wants credit cards to disappear. I certainly believe credit \ncards are tremendously valuable and worthwhile as long as they are \nhandled responsibly. And no one wants people who need and deserve \ncredit to have no way to get it. But we can't simply stand by as more \nand more Americans fall deeper and deeper into debt with no way out. We \nneed to take some responsible action so that the credit card can still \nbe a useful financial tool without being a ticket to financial ruin.\n  If we are going to pass bankruptcy bills in the Senate that demand \nmore responsibility from consumers, shouldn't we demand more \nresponsibility from creditors, as well? This bill, the Credit CARD Act, \ndoes just that, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to adopt it.\n  I ask unanimous consent for the text of the bill to be printed in the \nRecord.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 2756. A bill to extend a certain high priority corridor in the \nStates of Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, transportation is a key element of \neconomic growth for rural Colorado. Providing access to the national \nhighway system through a well developed transportation corridor will \nboost economic opportunity and bring new dollars to the area as the \nflow of commerce increases through traffic, tourism and, hopefully, new \nindustry.\n  Previously, I introduced legislation to create the Heartland \nExpressway, a connecting highway of high priority roads on the national \nhighway system. However, a few had concerns about this legislation, so \nthe supporters went back to the drawing board. So, tonight I rise to \nintroduce a bill that reflects the compromise that each of the impacted \nstates have come to.\n  Through Ports-to-Plains and Heartland Expressway, we can bring \ngreater prosperity through trade and industry to the State of Colorado, \nwhile improving the safety and condition of our highways.\n  Based on the recommendation of the Eastern Colorado Mobility Study, \nauthored by the Colorado Department of Transportation, the corridor \nwill serve a wide variety of trucks and autos, bringing new dollars and \nboosting the economy.\n  The Heartland Expressway will result in user cost savings to \nbusinesses, have\n\n[[Page S8747]]\n\nfewer environmental impacts than other corridor alternatives, and will \nenhance or improve existing--and may even promote the construction of \nnew corridors and intermodal facilities--that will enhance the mobility \nof freight services within and through eastern Colorado.\n  The Heartland Expressway will penetrate and promote economic \ndevelopment in Denver, throughout north and southeast Colorado, into \nWyoming, and through Scotsbluff, NE to Rapid City, SD.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD:\n  S. 2757. A bill to provide for certain financial reporting \nrequirements to apply to the judicial branch of the Federal Government, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD.\n  S. 2758. A bill to provide for certain financial reporting \nrequirements to apply to the legislative branch of the Federal \nGovernment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills \nthat would ensure fiscal accountability throughout the Judicial and \nLegislative Branches of the Federal Government: the Judicial Branch \nFinancial Accountability Act of 2004 and the Legislative Branch \nFinancial Accountability Expansion Act of 2004. These bills would \nstrengthen the financial management of both branches by requiring them \nto prepare annual financial statements and have them independently \naudited.\n  These bills also build on S. 2680, the Financial Accountability \nExpansion Act of 2004, that Senator Akaka and I introduced on July 16, \n2004, to expand independent audit requirements to the remainder of the \nexecutive branch that currently is not covered under the Chief \nFinancial Officers Act or the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act. Taken \ntogether, this legislative package would ensure--for the first time--\nthat all agencies and entities in the entire United States Government \nare subject to stringent financial audit requirements.\n  Congressional efforts to improve financial management and to reduce \nthe waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars began almost 25 years \nago with the enactment of the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act \nof 1982, which intended to strengthen internal controls and accounting \nsystems. Another important financial management reform initiative was \nthe Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO) of 1990. Among other things, the \nCFO Act created 24 CFO and deputy CFO positions in cabinet departments \nand major executive branch agencies, and required the annual \npreparation and audit of financial statements.\n  I would briefly like to mention that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, which has 180,000 employees and a budget of over $30 billion, \nis the only cabinet level department not now subject to the CFO Act. In \norder to address this problem, on August 1, 2003, I was joined by \nSenator Akaka in introducing S. 1567, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Financial Accountability Act, which would subject the \ndepartment to the same financial management practices currently \nrequired of all other major Federal agencies. The Senate passed S. 1567 \nin November 2003, and the House of Representatives passed its version, \nH.R. 4259, on July 20, 2004. It is my hope and expectation that final \ncongressional action on this legislation will occur in the near future.\n  The CFO Act improved the financial management of cabinet departments \nand major Federal agencies; however, it did not address the fiscal \npolicies and practices of the rest of the executive branch. Therefore, \nin 2002, I was the Senate sponsor of the Accountability of Tax Dollars \nAct (ATDA). This legislation, which became law on November 7, 2002, \namended the CFO Act to require agencies with budget authority of over \n$25 million to prepare annual financial statements and have them \nindependently audited. Due to the enactment of the ATDA, an additional \n76 agencies are now subject to requirements for annual audited \nfinancial statements.\n  The ATDA also provided authority to the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget (OMB) to waive or exempt certain agencies from \nthe act's requirements. The OMB director may waive these requirements \nduring the first 2 years of implementation if an agency lacks the \nbudgeted resources or requires additional time to develop financial \nmanagement practices and systems. The OMB director may exempt agencies \nwith budget authority under $25 million if it is determined that there \nis an absence of risk associated with the agency's operations.\n  To improve upon the legislative changes Congress enacted in 2002, the \nFinancial Accountability Expansion Act of 2004, which I introduced last \nweek, would further expand the requirements of the CFO Act to every \nremaining entity in the executive branch. Each executive branch agency \nor entity, regardless of its size or budget authority, would be subject \nto the financial oversight and accountability that annual, \nindependently audited financial statements provide. In order to assist \nsmall agencies that may not have adequate financial resources or \npersonnel to comply with these requirements, this bill would authorize \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to enter into one or more contracts on \nbehalf of the agency, or multiple agencies through ``bundling,'' for \nthe preparation and independent audit of the financial statement.\n  To begin the process of expanding audit requirements through the \nExecutive Branch, on July 19, 2004, I was joined by Senator Akaka in \nintroducing S. 2688, the Executive Branch Financial Accountability \nReporting Act of 2004, which would require the Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget (OMB) to submit a report to the relevant \ncongressional committees that lists all Federal entities not currently \nrequired to prepare annual, independently audited financial statements. \nWe were pleased that the Governmental Affairs Committee favorably \nreported this bill on July 21, 2004, and we intend to work with our \ncolleagues to expedite Senate passage of this important legislation.\n  Although significant progress has been made in strengthening \nfinancial accountability of the executive branch, similar audit \nrequirements in the judicial and legislative branches are woefully \ninadequate or completely lacking. At a hearing held on July 8, 2004, by \nthe Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Financial Management, the \nBudget, and International Security, which I chair, we heard surprising \ntestimony that the judicial branch does not conduct annual audits of \nits financial statements. Similarly, many entities in the legislative \nbranch do not prepare annual financial statements, and many that do \nprepare financial statements do not have them independently audited.\n  As part of the Contract with America in the 104th Congress, the \nfinancial statements of the House of Representatives have been annually \naudited by an independent accounting firm. While several other \nlegislative branch entities voluntarily comply with the requirements of \nthe CFO Act--the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional \nBudget Office--these agencies of Congress are not statutorily required \nto do so. I find it disturbing that the United States Senate does not \nhold itself to the same standards of financial accountability that it \nimposes on the executive branch of government. The financial activities \nof all entities established by and within the legislative branch--such \nas the Senate Disbursing Office, the Capitol Police, the Library of \nCongress, the Government Accountability Office, the U.S. Botanic \nGarden, and the Architect of the Capitol--should be subject statutorily \nto the oversight provided by an independent financial statement audit.\n\n  In fiscal year 2004, the Congress appropriated over $3.5 billion for \nthe legislative branch and approximately $5.2 billion for the judicial \nbranch. To ensure that these two co-equal branches of government are \nsubject to independent audit requirements similar to the executive \nbranch, the legislative package I introduce today includes two bills to \nstrengthen the financial management practices of the Federal courts and \nlegislative entities.\n  The Judicial Branch Financial Accountability Act of 2004 that I \nintroduce today would require the Federal judiciary to have independent \naudits of annual financial statements covering\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\nall accounts and activities. In deference to a co-equal branch of \ngovernment, the bill would require the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States, the principal policy-making body for the administration \nof the U.S. Courts, to determine whether the U.S. Supreme Court, the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the U.S. Court of \nInternational Trade, and other judicial branch entities, should submit \nseparate financial statements, or whether there should be a single \nconsolidated statement that is independently audited.\n  To ensure that judicial branch entities have the procedures and \nresources in place to comply with the requirements of this act, this \nbill would require the submission of a report regarding the act's \nimplementation to the appropriate committees in the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives. This report is to be submitted not later than 90 days \nafter the date of the bill's enactment, and is to include any \nlegislative recommendations that may be necessary to carry out the \nprovisions of the act. Similar to the requirements imposed by OMB on \nexecutive branch entities, this bill would require the completion and \npublic release of the audited financial statement not later than 45 \ndays after the end of the fiscal year.\n  The second bill I introduce today--the Legislative Branch Financial \nAccountability Expansion Act of 2004--would require that each House of \nCongress and each legislative agency or other entity prepare financial \nstatements that must be independently audited. In order to ensure that \nentities in the legislative branch have the procedures and resources in \nplace that are necessary to fulfill this requirement, the bill requires \neach House of Congress and each legislative agency or other entity to \nsubmit a report to the appropriate committees in the Senate and House \nof Representatives regarding the implementation of the act. The report \nis to be submitted within 90 days of the date of enactment, and is to \ninclude whether the establishment of a special office is necessary to \ncarry out the act's requirements, as well as any legislative \nrecommendations that may be necessary.\n  Within 60 days after the submission of this report, each House of \nCongress is to establish an office to prepare the financial statement. \nEach legislative agency or other entity is also required to establish \nan office, or designate an individual if that is more appropriate, to \nprepare the financial statement. An independent audit of the financial \nstatement is to be completed and made public within 45 days after the \nclose of the applicable fiscal year.\n  I am sensitive to how other co-equal branches of the Federal \nGovernment conduct their fiscal affairs. Therefore, these bills defer \nto the leadership of these branches to determine the most appropriate \nmeans of implementing annual independent audits of financial \nstatements. In light of these sensitivities, I recognize that these \nbills represent the first step toward improving the financial \naccountability of the entire Federal Government. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to provide the best legislative solution to \nensure full and equal accountability for the use of taxpayer dollars.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the texts of the bills were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2757\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Children's \nHealth Improvement and Protection (CHIP) Act today, along with my \nfellow Senators Rockefeller, Chafee, and Snowe. This bill will ensure \nthat children continue to receive health care coverage through the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, which is especially important as \nthe Nation's economy struggles to recover and State budgets are \nstretched perilously thin.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, has shown great \nsuccess in reducing the number of children without health insurance. \nLast year, 5.8 million children were enrolled in CHIP, children who \notherwise would have limited access to critical screening and \ndiagnostic services and needed medical care. In 2003, 125,000 children \nin Massachusetts participated in CHIP and other Stats had similar \nsuccess.\n  The need for CHIP has always been clear. We know that children \nwithout health insurance are more than three times less likely to have \na regular source of health care than insured children. They are more \nthan four times as likely to delay needed medical care because of cost. \nAnd they are more than twice as likely as insured children to forego \nneeded prescription drugs and eyeglasses.\n  Despite the clear evidence that health insurance provides children \nwith a healthier start, continued success of the CHIP program is in \njeopardy. A number of States have budget shortfalls that will short-\nchange CHIP programs over the next several years. Last year, the \nCongress acted to prevent $2.7 billion in Federal funding for CHIP from \nreverting to the Treasury. However, this funding was a short-term \nsolution for long-term financing problems that will persist until CHIP \nis reauthorized in 2007. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has \nprojected that over 200,000 children are still at risk for losing their \nhealth coverage if additional steps are not taken.\n  This bill will provide the needed steps to support and expand the \nCHIP program. The Children's Health Improvement and Protection Act of \n2004 prevents $1.07 billion in Federal CHIP funds that are scheduled to \nexpire from reverting to the Treasury. In addition, this bill \nreallocates some of these funds to States that most need them. Seventy \npercent of the expiring fiscal year 1998, 1999, and 2000 funds would be \nredistributed to needy States and the remaining 30 percent of the funds \nwould be retained by the States that currently have them.\n  States that were unable to spend all of their fiscal year 2002, 2003, \nand 2004 CHIP allotments after 3 years would be able to keep half of \nthe unspent funds. The other 50 percent would be redistributed to \nStates that have fully spent their allotments during the 3-year period \nthey were available. Any retained or redistributed funds would be \navailable for 2 years. After that, our bill establishes a second \nredistribution for unspent funds, using the same 70-30 redistribution \nscheme I described previously.\n  Passage of CHIP was a great step forward in ensuring every child a \nhealthy start in life. It would be a grave mistake and a misplaced set \nof priorities to weaken this program that so many of us worked to enact \nand that is helping so many children. It makes no sense to have funds \nexpire and revert to the Treasury when we know that many States are \nstill facing severe deficits that have led to waiting lists or \n``freezes'' in their CHIP programs. This bill will allow States to \nmaintain their CHIP programs and allow them to grow. The health of the \nNation reflects the health of our children and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate to get this very important \nlegislation passed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Kennedy, and Ms. \n        Snowe):\n  S. 2759. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nmodify the rules relating to the availability and method of \nredistribution of unexpended SCHIP allotments, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, to introduce legislation that \nwill protect the health and well-being of America's children by \nrestoring funds to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In \n1997, Senator Chafee and I worked together to create the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program as part of the Balanced Budget Act. I am proud \nof the work we have done over the years to make improvements to this \ncritical program, which helps so many of our nation's children.\n  Since its inception, the CHIP program has been an unqualified \nsuccess. It has directly contributed to the decline in the number of \nchildren without health insurance in recent years. Last year, 5.8 \nmillion children were enrolled in CHIP, including over 35,000 children \nin my home state of West Virginia.\n  However, the continued success of the CHIP program is in serious \njeopardy. A number of States are projected to have insufficient Federal \nfunding to sustain their existing CHIP programs over the next several \nyears. On September 30, 2004, $1.07 billion in Federal CHIP funds are \nscheduled to expire and revert to the national treasury, despite \ngrowing unmet need in a number of States. If Congress does not act to \npreserve these funds, States will have no choice but to cut coverage \nfor low-income children.\n  Last year, we acted to protect children's health care by passing \nlegislation to prevent $2.7 billion in Federal funding for CHIP from \nreverting to the treasury. While this legislation went a long way to \naddress immediate CHIP funding shortfalls, it did not address the long-\nterm financing problems that will persist until CHIP is reauthorized in \nfiscal year 2007. The legislation we are introducing today would solve \nthe current CHIP financing problems and preserve health care coverage \nfor children through reauthorization, when Congress will have to \nconsider a better Federal financing mechanism for the program.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Chafee, Kennedy, and Snowe in \nintroducing legislation that represents a comprehensive approach to \nshoring up CHIP financing through reauthorization, thereby preventing a \ndevastating\n\n[[Page S8750]]\n\nenrollment decline and facilitating continued CHIP growth. Our bill \nwould extend the availability of the $1.07 billion in expiring CHIP \nfunds and target some of the funds to the States that need them the \nmost. It would also establish redistribution rules that will keep CHIP \nmoney in the CHIP program through fiscal year 2007.\n  The Children's Health Protection and Improvement Act will allow \nStates to continue offering health care to our Nation's children--the \nmost vulnerable population among us. It will ensure that healthy \nchildren have access to preventative check-ups and exams and that sick \nchildren can get the medication and treatment they need. This \nlegislation enjoys bipartisan support and is endorsed by the National \nGovernor's Association (NGA).\n  I urge my colleagues to make enactment of this critical legislation a \npriority. Congress must act on this legislation this year. We must do \nthis when we return. I recognize that we have very few legislative days \nleft, but this must be at the top of our list because our children \ncannot afford to wait. We must guarantee the continued success of the \nCHIP program and sustain the significant progress CHIP has made over \nthe years in reducing the ranks of uninsured children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2759\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Rockefeller \nand others today in introducing a bipartisan proposal to extend and \nredistribute expiring State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) \nfunds.\n  This legislation will allow States to retain $1.07 billion in funds \noriginally allocated for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, and \ncurrently scheduled to revert to the Federal Treasury on September 30, \n2004. The bill also applies a 70-30 redistribution formula to the 1998-\n2000 allotments. States with surplus funds scheduled to revert in \nSeptember will keep 30 percent of the money and cede 70 percent to \nStates that have exhausted their allotments. Additionally, the bill \nwill continue the current law redistribution rules through 2007. It \nallows States unable to spend all of their fiscal year 2002, 2003, and \n2004 SCHIP allotments within the 3-year limit, to keep half of the \nunspent funds. The other 50 percent would be redistributed to States \nthat have exhausted their allotments.\n  This proposal will prevent States from losing unexpended SCHIP \nallotments and allows States like Rhode Island, with efficient programs \nand a high-level of need, to receive redistributed money. Without this \nproposal, the overwhelming success of State SCHIP programs and quality \nhealth coverage to millions of uninsured children will be jeopardized.\n  Preserving the expiring funds is essential to guaranteeing that more \nthan 200,000 children will not lose their health insurance coverage \nbetween now and 2007. At a time when our Nation's uninsured rate has \nclimbed to 43.6 million, it makes little sense to take away Federal \nfunding from States that are desperately trying to enroll needy \nchildren. This legislation is crucial to many States including my State \nof Rhode Island. Without this remedy, Rhode Island is set to run out of \nSCHIP funds by 2005. At 5 percent, Rhode Island currently has the third \nlowest uninsured rate of any State in the Nation for children. This \nbill will enable Rhode Island to continue offering health coverage to \nthis vulnerable population.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Rockefeller and me in supporting \nthis important legislation. It is a crucial step toward ensuring that \nour Nation's children will have long-term access to quality health \ninsurance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 2762. A bill to encourage the use of indigenous feedstock from the \nCaribbean Basin region with respect to ethyl alcohol for fuel use; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nclose a loophole under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, CBI, trade \npreference program which could allow large quantities of Brazilian \nethanol to be shipped to the United States duty-free. This loophole \nallows companies to use the CBI program as a passthrough to get duty-\nfree treatment for Brazilian ethanol. This could end up displacing U.S. \nproduction and hurting Iowa's ethanol producers. I want to help make \nsure that does not happen.\n  Also, when the Caribbean Basin Initiative was enacted during the \nReagan administration, the purpose of the program was to encourage \ntrade and development with the region. I support the CBI program. \nHowever, I believe that the program should encourage meaningful \neconomic development in the region. Unfortunately, one special interest \nprovision in the statute permits ``wet'' ethanol from Brazil to be \nshipped to the CBI region and merely dehydrated, thus qualifying for \nduty-free access to the U.S. market. The dehydration process which \noccurs in the CBI region is not very complicated. It simply removes a \nsmall percentage of water from ``wet'' ethanol, thereby converting it \ninto ``dry'' ethanol. Such ``dry'' ethanol is provided duty-free access \nto the U.S. market. I do not believe that such simple processing is \nsubstantial enough to warrant the benefit of getting duty-free access \nto the U.S. market. In keeping with the original intent of the CBI, I \nbelieve that more meaningful economic activity should occur in the CBI \nregion before a product qualifies for duty-free treatment.\n  My bill would limit the opportunity to exploit this special interest \nprovision. It would introduce a fixed cap on the amount of ethanol that \ncan take advantage of the passthrough provision. The amount of the cap \nis based on the historical volume of ethanol exports from the CBI \nregion over the past 20 years. Thus, my bill will permit the continued \nduty-free importation of some ethanol that is simply dehydrated in the \nCBI region, based on historical trade amounts. However, my bill would \nput a stop to the unlimited future growth of such duty-free imports.\n  It is my belief that this modification should not impact any of the \nCBI companies that are currently operating ethanol plants in the \nregion. At the same time, my bill will encourage greater investment and \ndevelopment in the CBI region because ethanol that is produced from \nscratch in the CBI region, using CBI inputs, will continue to be \neligible for duty-free access to the U.S. market under the CBI program. \nIf ethanol is made from scratch in the CBI region then it will qualify \nfor duty-free treatment.\n  In sum, my bill only addresses new investments in dehydration plants, \nwhose sole purpose is to merely dehydrate Brazilian ethanol. Our tariff \npreference programs should not be granting economic incentives in the \nform of tariff preferences for such passthrough operations. In my mind, \nthat is not what the CBI program is for, and it is not fair for Iowa's \nethanol producers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2762\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ETHYL ALCOHOL FOR FUEL USE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (B) of section 423(c)(3) of \n     the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (19 U.S.C. 2703 note) is amended \n     to read as follows:\n       ``(B) The local feedstock requirement with respect to any \n     calendar year is--\n       ``(i) 0 percent with respect to the base quantity that is \n     entered;\n       ``(ii) 30 percent with respect to the 35,000,000 gallons of \n     dehydrated alcohol and mixtures entered in excess of the base \n     quantity; and\n       ``(iii) 50 percent with respect to all dehydrated alcohol \n     and mixtures entered after the amount specified in clause \n     (ii) is entered.''.\n       (b) Base Quantity.--Clause (i) of section 423(c)(3)(C) of \n     the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (19 U.S.C. 2703 note) is amended \n     to read as follows:\n       ``(i) The term `base quantity' means, with respect to \n     dehydrated alcohol and mixtures entered during any calendar \n     year--\n\n       ``(I) 90,000,000 gallons in the case of dehydrated alcohol \n     and mixtures produced in a distillation facility located in a \n     beneficiary country that was established before, and in \n     operation on July 1, 2004; and\n       ``(II) 0 gallons in the case of dehydrated alcohol and \n     mixtures produced in any other distillation facility located \n     in a beneficiary country.''.\n\n[[Page S8752]]\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to calendar years beginning after 2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 2763. A bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to clarify the \ntreatment of accelerator-produced and other radioactive material as \nbyproduct material; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Dirty Bomb \nProtections Acts along with Senators Gregg and Reid. This bill directs \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, to control key materials that \ncould be used in a dirty bomb. Unfortunately, some of these materials \nare currently exempt from Federal control.\n  This bill follows a prior bill that I introduced with Senator Gregg \nin 2002, which was the first bipartisan legislation to propose improved \ndomestic controls on materials that could be used in a ``dirty bomb.'' \nThis legislation was supported and acclaimed by international dirty \nbomb experts. It provided for the safeguarding of radioactive material \nagainst use by terrorists. The bill required proper tracking, recovery, \nstorage and export controls for radioactive material.\n  Since then, the IAEA Board of Governors accepted and its General \nConference endorsed the revised ``IAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety \nand Security of Radioactive Sources,'' which reflects many of the \nelements in that bill. The heads of state and government of the eight \nmajor industrialized democracies, G8, and over 30 other countries have \ncommitted to implement the code. And at the Sea Island Summit earlier \nthis year, G8 leaders urged all states to implement the code and \nrecognize it as a global standard.\n  Passage of the Dirty Bomb Protections Act would allow the U.S. to \nfully implement the commitments of the code by providing the NRC with \nauthority to control a set of substances for which they currently lack \nauthority, including Radium-226 and other naturally occurring \nradioactive materials that for historical reasons have remained outside \nof Federal control. To control these materials, the bill instructs the \nNRC to: (1) promulgate final implementing regulations governing such \nbyproduct material; and (2) prepare and give public notice of a \ntransition plan for State assumption of regulatory responsibility for \nsuch material.\n  I believe this bill represents an important step forward in our war \nagainst terror and our efforts to control access to materials that \ncould be used to produce a dirty bomb. The language is identical to \nlanguage that passed the EPW Committee unanimously last year. I look \nforward to working with Senator Inhofe and other Members of the Senate, \nas well as the NRC, to advance this important legislation this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Reed, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Carper, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Reid, Mrs. \n        Dole, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and Mr. Chafee):\n  2764. A bill to extend the applicability of the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Act of 2002; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce important legislation \nwhich I believe is vital to our economic security. I am proud to \nintroduce this legislation, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act \nof 2004, with Senators Bennett, Schumer, Jack Reed, Hagel, Dole, \nBunning, Crapo, Chafee, Harry Reid, and Ben Nelson.\n  As my colleagues know, the Senate hasn't been a model of legislative \nproductivity this year. It has been a very difficult year--there has \nbeen partisan gridlock on a whole host of issues.\n  It is against this backdrop, the day that we adjourn for 6 weeks for \nthe August recess which includes both conventions and campaigning, that \nI am proud to speak about an issue that has broad bipartisan support. \nThat issue is an extension of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.\n  This critically important legislation has a history of bipartisan \nsupport and I am pleased to say that the robust support on both sides \nof the aisle still exists as we consider an extension of the program.\n  The original TRIA legislation was not an easy undertaking. But we \npersevered, negotiated, and had a frank exchange of views over numerous \nmonths and in the end, even though it was at times a laborious, \ndifficult process, we produced a bipartisan bill that garnered 86 votes \nin this body on this critically important issue.\n  I worked closely with Democratic Senators Schumer, Sarbanes, Reed, \nand Corzine as well as Senators Bennett, Hagel, Phil Gramm, and many \nothers on the Republican side to get this critical bill passed. That is \nthe model that the Senate should follow more often and that is the \nmodel that we are following as we introduce a 2-year extension of the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act today which will provide continued \neconomic security and stability and avoid potential chaos in the \naftermath of a terrorist attack.\n  The September 11 tragedy resulted in disbelief, devastation, and \neconomic dislocation. An attack on our country seemed unimaginable. Few \nbelieved any significant major terrorist attack would occur, no less \nthe one as horrific and devastating as the one on 9/11.\n  September 11 changed everything, most visibly, of course, national \nand homeland security policy. But September 11 also fundamentally \nchanged the way insurers looked at terrorism risks which suddenly \nstarted to resemble an act of war. As a result, after\n9/11 the insurance market for terrorism nearly completely dried up. \nCoverage was unavailable. Many financial transactions weren't able to \nproceed. And construction workers and other hard-working Americans \nsuddenly found themselves economic victims of terrorism.\n  In short, we wrote TRIA for a very simple reason: hundreds of \nthousands of American jobs and billions of dollars of business \ninvestment hung in the balance.\n  We worked together on a bipartisan basis to pass this bill including \nsignificant support from this administration which deserves its fair \nshare of credit for enactment of the legislation in November 2002.\n\n  TRIA was created as a 3-year Federal program to help make sure the \npart of the commercial insurance marketplace, disrupted by 9/11, could \nwork again. Most Americans don't even know that TRIA provides a crucial \neconomic safety net for virtually every sector of our economy. \nTransportation, real estate, utilities, construction, travel and \ntourism, and financial institutions are just a few of the sectors that \nneed TRIA to protect them against the economic devastation that would \ncome because of a terrorist attack.\n  Under TRIA, the Government shoulders a share of the financial risk of \nfuture attacks. This makes sense--these attacks are against us as \nAmericans, against our democracy, our way of life.\n  But TRIA also required insurers to offer terrorism coverage on \ncommercial policies. In addition, insurance companies would have to \nbear an escalating financial burden in future years.\n  TRIA is working. This public-private ``shared loss'' mechanism is \nmaking terrorism insurance available to all businesses at a reasonable \ncost. Under TRIA, in the event of another terrorist attack, private \ninsurers will still shoulder tens of billions of dollars of terrorism \nrelated risk.\n  What TRIA does is act as a backstop to the private commercial \nproperty-casualty insurance system. It gives the market some certainty \nby establishing, by law, a limit to insured terrorism losses for the \ninsurance industry and the Federal Government.\n  The Mortgage Bankers Association recently surveyed its 40 largest \ncommercial/multi-family mortgage banking firms. A substantial majority \nof them believe that TRIA has made terrorism insurance both more \navailable and less expensive.\n  But the Mortgage Bankers also noted that failure to extend TRIA would \nprobably hurt the commercial real estate market. If we let TRIA expire, \nwe will see the same uncertain environment we saw before TRIA.\n  TRIA does not expire until the end of 2005. Now some may wonder why I \nam choosing today to join with Senator Bennett and others to introduce \nthis legislation to extend the program.\n  The answer is that we cannot wait until next year.\n  The economic safety net that TRIA provides will begin to come apart \nas\n\n[[Page S8753]]\n\nearly as this fall if Congress does not act.\n  In the next few months, commercial insurers and their policyholders \nwill begin negotiating new policies. But any 12-month policy taken out \nafter Jan 1 will include at least some time where TRIA doesn't exist if \nwe let it expire.\n  If we let TRIA expire, business consumers are going to have a hard \ntime getting the coverage they need. That can only hurt our economy, \nand I'm sure that all Senators share the goal of growing our economy.\n  If we don't act this year, insurers will have to evaluate every \npolicy as if the backstop will not exist for part of the coverage \nperiod.\n  Senator Bennett and I and other colleagues propose a 2-year extension \nthis year. That will help avoid destabilizing the insurance market, \nand, in turn, the national economy. It will give Congress, insurers, \nbusinesses, and Government officials time to gather all available, \nrelevant data.\n  Collecting that data--without fear of market disruption--will help \nall of us develop a more permanent solution for managing our Nation's \neconomic exposure to catastrophic terrorism.\n  I know there is plenty of partisan tension in the Senate this year. \nBut keeping our country safe from the economic devastation of a \nterrorist attack is a critical priority. It is too important to be \naffected by partisan politics. We didn't let that happen last time, and \nI hope everyone can work on a bipartisan basis and follow the \nbipartisan model--rare in this body these days--to make sure it doesn't \nhappen this time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my friend and colleague Senator Dodd to temporarily extend the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act. Senator Dodd was the author of the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, which was enacted in 2002, and I \nam joining with him in a bipartisan effort to extend this critically \nimportant legislation this year.\n  As a result of the devastating attacks of 9/11 and a nonexistent \nterrorism reinsurance market in its wake, TRIA was enacted to provide a \ntemporary economic safety net to our private insurance market. This \ntemporary backstop helped economic growth get back on track after the \nshock of 9/11. Under current market conditions TRIA is essential to the \ncontinued growth of nearly every sector of our economy--transportation, \nenergy, real estate, construction, travel and tourism, lodging, health \ncare, financial institutions, public entities, manufacturing, and \nretail.\n  TRIA came into existence for a very simple reason: hundreds of \nthousands of American jobs--and billions of dollars in business \ntransactions--hung in the balance due to uncertainty in the insurance \nmarkets. The September 11 attacks fundamentally altered the way \ninsurers looked at terrorism risks. As a result, the insurance market \nfor terrorism dried up; coverage was unavailable; many types of \nfinancial transactions were unable to proceed; hard-working Americans \nsuddenly found themselves economic victims of terrorism.\n  With broad, bipartisan support, Congress enacted TRIA in November \n2002. TRIA was designed to be a temporary, 3-year program to bring \nstability and functionality back to an essential sector of the \ncommercial insurance marketplace which ceased to exist after 9/11.\n  Fortunately, TRIA is working as intended. Terrorism insurance is \navailable to all businesses at a reasonable cost. Under TRIA, in the \nevent of further terror attacks, private insurers will cover tens of \nbillions of dollars of terrorism-related risk. TRIA acts as a backstop \nto the private commercial property-casualty insurance system and \nprovides some market certainty by establishing statutory caps for \ninsured terrorism losses.\n  TRIA has enabled billions of dollars of real estate and other \nbusiness transactions previously stalled to go forward without \nthreatening the solvency of the commercial enterprises involved or \ntheir insurers. A recent Mortgage Bankers Association, MBA, survey of \nits 40 largest commercial/multifamily mortgage banking firms revealed \nthat a substantial majority of those survey respondents believe that \nTRIA has made terrorism insurance both more available and less \nexpensive. Failure to extend TRIA with the uncertainties that still \nexist in the insurance marketplace would likely have an adverse impact \non the commercial real estate market by recreating the pre-TRIA \nenvironment that had led to rating agency downgrades of commercial \nmortgage-backed securities due to lack of adequate terrorism insurance.\n  TRIA does not currently expire until year-end 2005--which may cause \nsome to wonder why we are introducing legislation today to extend the \nprogram by 2 years now. In truth, the economic safety net that TRIA \nprovides will begin to fray as early as this fall if Congress does not \nact. Because insurers are now required to make terrorism coverage \navailable throughout the life of the program--a decision rendered by \nthe Treasury Department earlier this summer--there is a very real \nmismatch between TRIA's hard end-date and the commercial insurance \npolicies that will be written in the next few months.\n  TRIA currently has a ``hard'' end date, which means that the backstop \nexpires December 31, 2005. However, insurance policies that rely on \nTRIA are written every day of the year, generally for a 12-month term, \nalthough some commercial property policies covered by TRIA are \nmultiyear. Therefore, policies written after January 1, 2005, will have \na coverage term that extends beyond the life of the TRIA Federal \nbackstop. As a result, insurers will have no choice but to evaluate \nevery policyholder considered for coverage during this period as if the \nbackstop does not exist for part of the coverage period.\n  Because commercial insurers must make terrorism coverage available \nfor policies written at any time during 2005, insurers and \npolicyholders will be exposed to risk that they continue to be unable \nto carry during the part of the coverage term that runs beyond TRIA. \nPolicyholders, state insurance regulators and insurers understand that \nthis potential mismatch between policy periods and TRIA's expiration \nmakes it absolutely critical that Congress acts this year to extend \nTRIA beyond December 31, 2005.\n  Failure to extend TRIA beyond its current sunset date of December 31, \n2005, will create tremendous uncertainty and potential market upheaval \nfor both commercial policyholders and insurers beginning as early as \nthis fall, when annual policies for coverage starting after January 1, \n2005, are considered and negotiated.\n  Insurers and their policyholders already are beginning to negotiate \nterms, prices and provisions for policy contracts that will renew \nbeginning in January 2005 and extend into 2006. Unless TRIA is extended \nin 2004, policyholders whose coverage extends into 2006, and their \ninsurers, will not know whether TRIA's financial backstop will exist \nfor the full term of their coverage. This will make it difficult, if \nnot impossible, to accurately price such coverage and is likely to \ndramatically reduce the availability of terrorism insurance to business \nconsumers. Such an outcome can only harm the economic recovery \nunderway.\n  A full 2-year extension this year will help avoid destabilizing the \ninsurance market, and, in turn, the national economy, and will enable \nCongress, insurers, businesses and Government officials to gather all \navailable relevant data--including market data from all three years of \nTRIA as insurer deductibles rise from 7 percent of prior year \ncommercial premiums in 2003 to 15 percent of such premiums in 2005. \nCongressional action now will avoid a premature expiration of the \nFederal backstop in 2005 and help ensure the economic recovery \nmaintains its pace.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am very pleased to join Senators Dodd and Bennett and \nothers in introducing a bill to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act \nof 2002 for 2 years. I was actively engaged in the formulation of the \nact and this bill.\n  This is important, urgently needed legislation. There is a strong \nconsensus among the affected parties that the act should be extended \nnow. The act, without the extension, would expire at the end of 2005.\n  There is a mismatch. Unless TRIA is extended this year, it will be \nvery difficult, if not impossible, to accurately price coverage on \npolicies that extend into 2006. This will likely significantly reduce \nthe availability of terrorism coverage. That lack of coverage could \nadversely affect the economy and the economic recovery.\n\n[[Page S8754]]\n\n  TRIA is working. The General Accounting Office has found that: ``TRIA \nhas improved the availability of terrorism insurance, especially for \nsome high-risk policyholder.''\n  Fortunately, there have been no terrorism events on U.S. soil since \n9/11. We all know that we are under a constant threat and TRIA \ncontinues to be necessary.\n  I noted on the Senate floor when TRIA was passed in 2002 that \nGovernment is going to have to play a larger role. TRIA establishes a \npublic-private partnership on terrorism insurance. The private sector \ncould not solve this problem alone in 2002, plain and simple, and it \nstill cannot do so. We can quibble about how much and where that \nFederal role should be, but it is definitely needed.\n  This nonpartisan bill is essentially a 2-year extension of TRIA. The \nchanges that are made are minor, they include: extending the ``make \navailable'' provision; including group life insurance policies under \nthe act; gradually adjusting the aggregate industry loss level used to \ndetermine mandatory recoupment; providing for a 1 year ``soft landing'' \nfor policies written before December 31, 2007; and requiring a study \naddressing long-term solutions to terrorism exposure. These are \nworthwhile modifications.\n  The bottom line is a simple one, and that is, our No. 1 goal should \nbe keeping the economy on track in this brave new post-9/11 world. If \nthat means altering the balance between Government and private \ninvolvement, so be it.\n  TRIA has worked in New York City. It has translated into thousands of \njobs and desperately needed economic activity for the city, the region, \nand the entire country. If G-D forbid, there is another terrorism \ncatastrophe in this country I have no doubts that the Government will \nprovide the needed aid. TRIA addresses part of that effort in an \norderly manner. Our clear hope is that we will never again experience \ncatastrophes that make this bill necessary.\n  I am hopeful that this bill can be quickly considered by the Banking \nCommittee, passed by the Senate and House, and enacted into law this \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Voinovich, and Mrs. Dole):\n  S. 2765.

A bill to amend part D of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nnegotiate for lower prices for Medicare prescription drugs and to \neliminate the gap in coverage of Medicare prescription drug benefits, \nto reduce medical errors and increase the use of medical technology, to \nincrease services in primary and preventive care by non-physician \nproviders, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Prescription Drug and Health Improvement Act of 2004, \nwhich is legislation designed to reduce the high prices of prescription \ndrugs. Americans, specifically senior citizens, pay the highest prices \nin the world for brand-name prescription drugs. With 43 million \nuninsured Americans and many more senior citizens without an adequate \nprescription drug benefit, filling a doctor's prescription is \nunaffordable for many people in this country. The United States has the \ngreatest health care system in the world; however, too many seniors are \nforced to make difficult choices between life-sustaining prescription \ndrugs and daily necessities.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that in 2003 \nper capita spending on prescription drugs rose approximately 12 \npercent, with a similar rate of growth expected for this year. Much of \nthe increase in drug spending is due to higher utilization and the \nshift from older, lower cost drugs to newer, higher cost drugs. \nHowever, rapidly increasing drug prices are a critical component.\n  High drug prices, combined with the surging older population, are \nalso taking a toll on State budgets and private sector health insurance \nbenefits. Medicaid spending on prescription drugs increased at an \naverage annual rate of nearly 20 percent between 1998 and 2001. Until \nlower priced drugs are available, pressures will continue to squeeze \npublic programs at both the State and Federal level.\n  To address these problems, my legislation would reduce the high \nprices of prescription drugs to seniors by: one, allowing the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services, HHS, to negotiate prescription drug \nprices with manufacturers; and two, eliminate the coverage gap in the \nMedicare Prescription Drug Program. The bill's $400 billion price tag \nover the next 10 years would be offset by, three, reducing medical \nerrors, increasing the use of medical technology, and, four, increasing \nthe use of non-physician providers in primary and preventive health \ncare.\n  Prescription Drug Negotiation: This legislation would repeal the \nprohibition against interference by the Secretary of HHS with \nnegotiations between drug manufacturers, pharmacies, and prescription \ndrug plan sponsors and instead authorize the Secretary to negotiate \ncontracts with manufacturers of covered prescription drugs. It will \nallow the Secretary of HHS to use Medicare's large beneficiary \npopulation to leverage bargaining power to obtain lower prescription \ndrug prices for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Price negotiations between the Secretary of HHS and prescription drug \nmanufacturers would be analogous to the ability of the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to negotiate prescription drug prices with \nmanufacturers. This bargaining power enables veterans to receive \nprescription drugs at a significant cost savings.\n  In my capacity as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nintroduced the Veterans Prescription Drugs Assistance Act, S. 1153, \nwhich was reported out of committee on June 20, 2004.\n  This legislation would broaden the ability of veterans to access the \nVeterans Affairs Prescription Drug Program. All Medicare-eligible \nveterans will be able to purchase medications at a tremendous price \nreduction through the Veterans Affairs' Prescription Drug Program. In \nmany cases this would save veterans who are Medicare beneficiaries up \nto 90 percent on the cost of commonly prescribed medications. Similar \nsavings would be available to America's seniors from the savings \nachieved using the HHS bargaining power, like the Veterans Affairs \nbargaining power for the benefit of veterans.\n  Medicare Coverage Gap Elimination: The bill would eliminate the \ncoverage gap, also known as the ``doughnut hole,'' for beneficiaries in \nthe Medicare prescription drug program. Beginning in January 2006, \nMedicare beneficiaries with an individual income of over $13,470 and \ncouples with an income over $18,180, 150 percent of the poverty level, \nwill pay a monthly premium, approximately $35, a $250 deductible, and \ncoinsurance of 25 percent up to an initial coverage limit of $2,250, \nbut then do not receive coverage until they exceed $5,100 of total \nspending. Specifically, Medicare beneficiaries will have to make out-\nof-pocket payments for prescription drug purchases from $2,250 to\n\n[[Page S8755]]\n\n$5,100 in total spending. After $5,100 in total spending, the \ncoinsurance payment for those beneficiaries is 5 percent. Medicare \nbeneficiaries below 150 percent of the poverty level do not have a gap \nin drug coverage. My legislation would eliminate the gap in coverage \nfor those over 150 percent of the poverty level in the Medicare \nprescription drug program, by extending the 25 percent beneficiary \ncoinsurance payment from $2,250 to $5,100 in total spending.\n  This provision comes at an expected cost of $400 billion over 10 \nyears, which will be paid for through savings from reducing medical \nerrors, increasing the use of medical technology, and increasing the \nuse of non-physician providers in primary and preventive health care.\n  Reducing Medical Errors and Increasing the Use of Medical Technology: \nThe bill provides grants for demonstration programs to test best \npractices for reducing errors, testing the use of appropriate \ntechnologies to reduce medical errors, such as electronic medication \nsystems, and research in geographically diverse locations to determine \nthe causes of medical errors. The implementation of automated \nprescription drug dispensers will prevent adverse drug reactions, which \nin turn can cause further illness resulting in increased care needed to \ncorrect the error. The utilization of electronic records will reduce \nthe incidence of repeat medical tests, which will result in significant \ncost savings.\n  On November 29, 1999, the Institute of Medicine, IOM, issued a report \nentitled ``To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System.'' The IOM \nreport estimated that anywhere between 44,000 and 98,000 hospitalized \nAmericans die each year due to avoidable medical mistakes. However, \nonly a fraction of these deaths and injuries are due to negligence. \nMost errors are caused by system failures. The IOM issued a \ncomprehensive set of recommendations, including the establishment of a \nnationwide, mandatory reporting system; incorporation of patient safety \nstandards in regulatory and accreditation programs; and the development \nof a non-punitive ``culture of safety'' in health care organizations. \nThe report called for a 50-percent reduction in medical errors over 5 \nyears.\n  After the report was issued, I held a series of three Labor, Health \nand Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee hearings on medical \nerrors: Dec. 13, 1999--to discuss the findings of the Institute of \nMedicine's report on medical errors; Jan. 25, 2000--a joint hearing \nwith the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to discuss a national error \nreporting system and the VA's national patient safety program; Feb. 22, \n2000--a joint hearing with the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee to discuss the administration's strategy to reduce medical \nerrors.\n  After hearing from Government witnesses and experts in the field on \nmedical errors, I included $50 million in the fiscal year 2001 Senate \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education for a patient safety \ninitiative. In the Senate report, I also directed the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ, to: one, develop guidelines on \nthe collection of uniform error data; two, establish a competitive \ndemonstration program to test ``best practices''; and three, research \nways to improve provider training.\n  The committee also directed AHRQ to prepare an interim report to \nCongress concerning the results of the demonstration program within 2 \nyears of the beginning of the projects. The fiscal year 2002 Senate \nreport directed AHRQ to submit a report detailing the results of its \ninitiative to reduce medical errors. HHS combined both reports into \none, which it submitted to me earlier this year.\n  Since fiscal year 2001, the Labor/HHS Subcommittee has included \nwithin the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality funding for \nresearch into ways to reduce medical errors. The fiscal year 2002 \nappropriation was $55 million, in fiscal year 2003 another $55 million \nwas provided, and in fiscal year 2004 the appropriation was increased \nto $79.5 million.\n  The bill seeks to assist development of private sector technology \nstandards to reduce medical errors by examining information technology, \nproviding grants, and coordinating implementation by private sector \nentities. This would help ensure that this Federal investment will help \nfurther the national health information infrastructure by sharing the \ninformation collected through these demonstration projects with other \nhealth facilities nationally. These efforts would help reduce medical \nerrors and bring the Nation's health systems into the 21st century with \na projected cost savings of $150 billion over 10 years.\n  Primary and Preventive Care Services: The bill includes provisions \nfor the use of nonphysician providers such as nurse practitioners, \nphysician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists by increasing \ndirect reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid without regard to the \nsetting where services are provided. The services provided by non-\nphysician providers would insure that patients would receive benefits \nand services to which they are entitled without compromising the high \nstandards of medical care. The use of these health care professionals \nwould provide a significant cost savings to health care systems.\n  The bill creates a medical student tutorial program providing grants \nto encourage students early on in their medical training to pursue a \ncareer in primary care and provides grant assistance to medical \ntraining programs to recruit such students. This program is \nadvantageous for medical students by providing valuable primary care \nexperience, while offering services at a lower cost to primary care \nfacilities. The savings from this provision is estimated at $250 \nbillion over a 10-year period.\n  I believe this bill can provide desperately needed access to \ninexpensive, effective prescription drugs for America's seniors. The \ntime has come for concerted action in this arena. I urge my colleagues \nto move this legislation forward promptly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2767. A bill to provide an economic stimulus; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the \nSmall Business Economic Stimulus Act of 2004. In recent months, there \nhave been clear signs that America's economic downturn has ended and \nthat we are entering a period of renewed growth and prosperity. Yet not \nall of the economic news has been good. As I travel through \nPennsylvania, I still hear from too many companies that they cannot \nafford to make needed investments in equipment or research at this \ntime. As they postpone such investments, they also push off into the \nfuture the economic growth and opportunity that would flow from them. \nAs a result, I continue to meet far too many Pennsylvanians who are out \nof work. Thus while the economy is improving, it is still incumbent \nupon us in Congress to do everything in our power to aid this recovery \nand grow jobs. There is more we can do.\n  The bill I introduce today, the Small Business Economic Stimulus Act \nof 2004, will help American companies take the steps they need to grow \nand hire. Since small businesses create approximately 75 percent of new \njobs in America, my bill focuses on the needs of small business in \nparticular. My bill has three parts. Part one renews and extends three \ntax provisions which are crucial to encouraging new investments in R \nand equipment. Part two provides greater resources to trade offices and \ntrade promotion with a particular emphasis on programs that will enable \nAmerica's small businesses to better compete in foreign markets. Part \nthree creates a structure for association health plans which will \nenable small businesses to negotiate less expensive health plans for \ntheir employees, thereby saving money while continuing to provide \ncoverage. Together, these provisions amount to a targeted, measured, \nyet crucial shot in the arm for American small business and the \nAmerican economy.\n  The bill I introduce today will permanently extend the research and \ndevelopment tax credit. The R tax credit, which expired on June 30, \nhas proven to be of enormous value to American business. We all \nunderstand the importance of research and development to the American \neconomy. Most leading American companies owe their market dominance to \nthe innovations coming from R labs. Yet R is expensive, and it is \noften among the\n\n[[Page S8756]]\n\nfirst items to be cut when budgets get tight. The R tax credit serves \nAmerica by providing an economic incentive to companies to continue to \ninvest in the R that will provide the growth and opportunities of the \nfuture.\n  Studies have shown that the R tax credit significantly increases \nresearch and development expenditures. The marginal effect of $1 of the \nresearch credit creates approximately $1 of additional private research \nand development spending in the short-run, and as much as $2 of extra \nR spending in the long run. This is good for the American economy and \nthe American taxpayer. In fact, one study estimates that a permanent \nresearch credit would result in our gross domestic product increasing \nby $10 billion after 5 years and by $31 billion after 20 years.\n  In addition, the extension of the R tax credit will have benefits \nbeyond the purely economic. For example, the research and development \ntax credit has proven to be critical to the U.S. biomedical research \narena. The tax credit has contributed to many successes in U.S. \nscientific research and innovation, such as rapid progress in finding \ncures for life threatening diseases such as AIDS, cancer and multiple \nsclerosis. Today's diseases--Alzheimer's, AIDS, heart, liver and kidney \ndisease, prostate cancer and arthritis--are complex and are in the \nfinal stages for research breakthroughs. If we allow the incentives to \ninvest in medical progress to lapse, the consequence may be irrevocable \nand society may rue that decision for years to come.\n  Given the importance of the R tax credit, it makes little sense for \nCongress to continue to renew it for short terms. The investment of \nfunds in research and development is not a temporary fix but something \nthat should be consistently encouraged. Towards this end, my bill \npermanently extends the R tax credit. Such a permanent extension will \nsend a strong signal to American companies that the value of R is \nrecognized here in Washington. The permanent extension will also \nprovide greater certainty to companies seeking to make plans years in \nadvance.\n  My legislation will also renew two less well known but important tax \nprovisions which encourage capital investments. My bill extends for \nanother year a provision that allows companies to take an immediate 50-\npercent depreciation on purchases of qualified equipment and machinery. \nThis accelerated depreciation is currently set to expire in December, \n2004; equipment purchased thereafter would be subject to standard \ndepreciation tables. My bill provides that necessary equipment \npurchased between December 2004 and December 2005 will continue to \nqualify for the accelerated depreciation.\n  The availability of accelerated depreciation--especially at the high \nrate of 50 percent--makes an enormous difference to companies \ncontemplating large capital investments. Companies which simply could \nnot afford these investments under standard depreciation face a \ndramatically altered balance sheet once the accelerated depreciation is \nfactored in. Investments that did not previously make economic sense \nwill now be economically advantageous. As these investments are made, \ncompanies will grow and hire. This change in the balance sheet will \nreap a concrete benefit in jobs and growth.\n  In addition, my legislation extends the section 179 exclusion at the \ncurrent level of $100,000 through December 2007. This is another \nesoteric sounding provision that will produce very real economic \nbenefits. Under this provision, companies can immediately expense, that \nis, recognize as an expense to be deducted from revenues for tax \npurposes, up to $100,000 invested in equipment and machinery. The \nstandard section 179 deduction is only $25,000. Once again, this \nprovision will have the effect of making investments economically \nadvantageous when they otherwise would not be. The greater capital \ninvestment thereby fostered will lead to greater growth and job \nopportunities.\n  Beyond these tax incentives, my bill also seeks to help American \nbusiness through our trade policy. My legislation focuses on two \nprograms in particular which help small businesses find markets for \ntheir products abroad. My bill includes an increase in funding of $27 \nmillion for the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, USTDA. The USTDA has \nproven to be critical to small businesses seeking to sell their \nproducts abroad. The USTDA helps American businesses study and identify \nopportunities in foreign markets so that they can determine which \noptions will be profitable. To a small American business facing a very \nlarge global economy, the USTDA serves as an accessible and inexpensive \ninternational sales department.\n  USTDA's unique public-private partnership truly extends the \neffectiveness of taxpayers' dollars. Historically, $35 worth of exports \nare generated for every dollar invested by USTDA. As a result, $21 \nbillion in U.S. exports have been shipped overseas in concert with \nUSTDA's programs.\n  My legislation also includes $5 million in funding to promote the \nbenefits available under the Export Trading Company Act of 1982. This \nlegislation was enacted to stimulate U.S. exports by authorizing the \nSecretary of Commerce to issue export trade certificates of review to \ngroups of small businesses. A certificate of review protects the holder \nand the members identified in the certificate from State and Federal \nGovernment antitrust actions and from private treble damage antitrust \nactions for the export conduct specified in the certificate and carried \nout in compliance with its terms and conditions.\n  Given the realities of international trade, these antitrust \nexemptions are crucial. In order to compete in a challenging foreign \nmarket such as China, for example, it is extremely advantageous to have \na full-time sales representative on the ground there. Yet few small \nbusinesses can afford to hire full-time representatives and send them \nto China. The antitrust exemptions in the Export Trading Company Act of \n1982 would enable a group of small businesses to band together to hire \na sales representative, open an office, and pursue the other \nnecessities of international trade.\n  The Export Trading Company Act is good legislation which solves a \ncritical problem. Yet few American businesses exploring international \ntrade are aware of the opportunities under this act, let alone take \nadvantage of them. As a result, the enormous economic opportunities \ncreated by this law continue to go unrealized. I think that a minimal \ninvestment in marketing and promoting this act will pay for itself many \ntimes over in increased exports, growth and jobs.\n  Finally, my bill includes a provision that will enable small \nbusinesses to join together to negotiate more affordable health care \nplans for their employees. This provision will provide an enormous \neconomic boost to America's businesses--with the saving they gain from \nbetter health insurance rates they can invest, grow and hire. Yet this \nprovision also provides clear benefits beyond the purely economic. By \nmaking health insurance more affordable, this provision will help \nreverse the growth in the ranks of the uninsured.\n  According to a poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, \nAmericans worry more about rising health care costs than they do about \nterrorist attacks. There is a reason for such concern. More than 43 \nmillion Americans under age 65 lack health insurance coverage. The \nranks of the uninsured consist primarily of working families with low \nand moderate incomes--not just the unemployed. Nearly 26 million \nindividuals are employed and still are without health care coverage.\n\n  My bill will give small businesses the same market-based advantages \nwhen negotiating health insurance for their employees that large \ncompanies and unions currently enjoy. As independent entities, small \nbusinesses have little leverage when they negotiate with health \ninsurance providers, and the situation they face is often one of take \nit or leave it. Even when small businesses band together in local \npurchasing pools, the group is often not large enough to attract new \ninsurance companies with less expensive plans.\n  My act will allow small businesses to join together in large national \npools under the auspices of bona fide associations and either purchase \ninsurance from a provider or self-insure the same way that large \nemployers and unions do. For example, the American Restaurant \nAssociation could negotiate a plan on behalf of the hundreds of \nthousands of employees who work for its member businesses. Once the \nplan is in place, each individual restaurant could\n\n[[Page S8757]]\n\nchoose to participate in this plan at much better rates than they could \never have negotiated on their own.\n  I thank Senator Snowe for her leadership and hard work on this issue \nof association health plans. On March 6, 2003, Senator Snowe introduced \nS. 545, the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2003. This long and \nvery detailed bill addresses all of the issues needed to make \nassociation health plans a reality. I signed on as a cosponsor of S. \n545 on June 9, 2003, and I have included the text of S. 545 in my bill.\n  It is my sincere hope that the economic recovery will continue and \nwill pick up steam in the months to come. There is great reason for \noptimism. But our optimism must not blind us to the continuing problems \nthat Americans face. There are measures that Congress can take--today--\nwhich will help our businesses to grow, hire new employees, and provide \nhealth insurance to these employees at a more affordable rate. These \nmeasures will, in the long run, more than pay for themselves. We must \ntake these steps and do our part. I hope that my colleagues will join \nme in supporting the Economic Stimulus Act of 2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2768. A bill to provide competitive status to certain Federal \nemployees in the State of Alaska; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is the third occasion on which I \nhave spoken to the Senate about the life and accomplishments of the \nlate Thomas P. O'Hara, an Alaskan hero.\n  Thomas P. O'Hara was a protection ranger and pilot for the National \nPark Service, assigned to the Katmai National Park and Preserve in the \nBristol Bay region of western Alaska. On December 19, 2002, Ranger \nO'Hara and his passenger, a Fish and Wildlife Service employee, were on \na mission in the Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge. Their plane \nwent down on the tundra.\n  When the plane was reported overdue, a rescue effort consisting of 14 \nsingle-engine aircraft, an Alaska Air National Guard plane, and a Coast \nGuard helicopter quickly mobilized. Many of the single-engine aircraft \nwere piloted by Tom's friends. The wreckage was located late in the \nafternoon of December 20. The passenger survived the crash, but Ranger \nTom did not.\n  Tom O'Hara was an experienced pilot with 11,000 hours as a pilot-in-\ncommand. He was active in the communities of Naknek and King Salmon \nwhere he grew up, flying children to Bible camp and coaching young \nwrestlers. Tom provided a strong link between the residents of Bristol \nBay and the National Park Service.\n  Although Tom O'Hara was a most valued employee of the National Park \nService, he did not enjoy the same status as National Park Service \nemployees with competitive career status. Tom was hired under a special \nhiring authority established under the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act, ANILCA, which permits land management agencies like \nthe National Park Service to hire, on a noncompetitive basis, Alaskans \nwho by reason of having lived or worked in or near public lands in \nAlaska, have special knowledge or expertise concerning the natural or \ncultural resources of public lands and the management thereof.\n  Tom O'Hara possessed this knowledge and offered it freely to the \nNational Park Service. But because he was hired under this special \nauthority, his opportunities for transfer and promotion within the Park \nService were limited, even though his service was exemplary.\n  As a lasting memorial to Tom O'Hara's exemplary career, I am \nintroducing legislation today that will grant competitive status to \nANILCA local hire employees who hold permanent appointments with the \nFederal land management agencies after the completion of 1 year of \nsatisfactory service. In Tom's honor, the short title of this \nlegislation is the Thomas P.

A bill to provide that imported ethanol shall not count \ntoward satisfaction of any renewable fuel standard that may be enacted; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, recent media reports indicate that at \nleast two companies are actively considering plans to import Brazilian \nethanol into the United States duty-free through the Caribbean Basin. \nThese reports have generated understandable anxiety within the farm \ncommunity.\n  Cargill, the Minnesota-based agri-business giant, has confirmed that \nit is considering importing 63 million gallons of Brazilian ethanol \ninto the United States each year. And it has been reported that \nChevron-Texaco, one of the largest oil companies in the United States, \nis planning construction of a plant that will enable it to import 50 \nmillion to 100 million gallons of ethanol.\n  Farmers in South Dakota and throughout the Midwest are concerned that \nsuch import schemes could threaten the growth of the domestic ethanol \nindustry and undermine our effort to establish ethanol as a major \ndomestic energy source. They should be concerned. These import plans \nwould establish a dangerous precedent for other importers and \ndramatically undercut the ability of the pending Renewable Fuels \nStandard to enhance our national energy security and boost farm income.\n  The key to the next growth spurt in the domestic ethanol industry is \nbipartisan legislation I wrote with Senator Dick Lugar (R-IN) that \nwould set mandatory annual production targets for ethanol for the next \n10 years. Senator Lugar and I proposed the Renewable Fuels Standard, or \nRFS, 4 years ago as a means to grow the domestic ethanol industry in a \nway that both encourages investment in new community-sized ethanol \nfacilities and expands markets for farmers. We remain hopeful that this \nproposal will clear Congress before adjournment this year.\n  Under our proposed RFS, domestic ethanol demand would grow from 3 \nbillion gallons per year in 2004 to more than 5 billion gallons in \n2012, providing ethanol plants and farmers with a steady growth \nschedule that encourages investment in this domestic industry. This RFS \nwould create over 214,000 jobs, increase farm income by $1.3 billion \nannually, and save the U.S. $4 billion in imported oil each year.\n  Plans to import ethanol threaten these benefits by injecting an \nelement of market uncertainty into the RFS discussion that could dampen \ninvestment in community-sized ethanol facilities. Ethanol importation \nwould put the producers of Brazilian sugarcane in direct competition \nwith American corn growers. That is why today Senators Lugar, Hagel, \nNelson, and I are introducing legislation to clarify that ethanol \nimports will not count toward the RFS targets. This bill will ensure \nthat farmers and domestic ethanol investors will get the full benefit \nof the RFS, and it tells Cargill and Chevron accountants not to count \non the new demand created by the Renewable Fuels Standard to justify \nany scheme to import ethanol.\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\n  I understand that corporate executives feel an obligation to their \nshareholders. My obligation is to South Dakota farmers, ethanol \nproducers, and motorists who view increased ethanol demand as a means \nto establish greater control over their economic and energy future.\n  I have fought my entire public career against outright opposition and \nindifference from the giant corporate interests whose balance sheets \ndon't consider the value-added contribution of local economic \ndevelopment. This situation is no different. As a result of our \nefforts, Chevron won't get to import as much oil and refine and sell as \nmuch high-priced gasoline as they may like, and Cargill won't get to \nimport ethanol and compete against South Dakota producers.\n  The RFS program is designed to stimulate domestic production and \nenhance U.S. energy security, not to create a market opportunity for \nforeign ethanol. The bill I am introducing today will help make sure \nthat rural communities are able to attract investment capital to \nproduce clean burning energy, create quality jobs for their kids, and \nexpand local tax bases to accommodate better schools and community \nservices.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  Mr President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2769\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DISQUALIFICATION OF IMPORTED ETHANOL FOR THE \n                   PURPOSE OF ANY RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD.\n\n       For the purpose of any renewable fuel standard that may be \n     enacted after the date of enactment of this Act, ethanol that \n     is imported, or that is derived from any matter that is \n     imported, shall not count toward satisfaction of the \n     renewable fuel standard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 2770. A bill to establish a National Commission on American Indian \nTrust Holdings; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we all painfully know, the United \nStates has broken its word to Indian people, disregarded its treaty \nobligations, and breached its fiduciary trust responsibility. \nLitigation has been filed, and administrations of both political \nparties say the right thing, but then do not follow through to redress \nlegitimate grievances. The concepts of sovereignty and government-to-\ngovernment dialog are acknowledged, only later all too frequently to be \nignored.\n  This sad history was elevated to a new level of concern this spring \nby the resignation of Mr. Alan Balaran as Special Master in the Cobell \nclass action against the Department of the Interior. On April 5, 2004, \nMr. Balaran made some very serious charges against the Department of \nthe Interior in his official letter of resignation. He alleged that \nenergy companies, abetted by the Department of the Interior, routinely \npay Indian people less than they pay others for oil and gas easements. \nHe further alleged that Interior officials regularly put the interests \nof private companies ahead of the Department's fiduciary responsibility \nto Indian people.\n  These are disturbing charges leveled by an individual knowledgeable \nabout the long history of trust mismanagement. Congress must get to the \nbottom of this situation to fully satisfy our own fiduciary \nresponsibility to Indian people.\n  It is clear that neither the executive branch nor the Congress's \nhands are clean on the trust management issue. And this not a partisan \nfailure. It is a governmentwide failure that requires independent \nreview.\n  I am, therefore, today introducing legislation to create a National \nCommission on American Indian Trust Holdings. This Commission will be \nunique in several respects. First, it will be composed of 10 prominent \nU.S. citizens. Two individuals will each be appointed by the President, \nSenate majority leader, Senate minority leader, Speaker of the House, \nand House minority leader to place the Commission beyond politics. \nSecond, it will have the resources to hire the technical expertise \nneeded. Professionals with expertise in land and resources management, \naccounting, Federal Indian policy, and trust law, among other \ndisciplines will be included.\n  The Commission will build upon past efforts without duplicating past \nefforts.\n  Finally, the Commission will be charged with the responsibility of \nreporting to the President and the Congress within 1 year on: One, how \nto recoup, if possible, any damages that have resulted from the breach \nof fiduciary responsibility; and, two, how to prevent any such breaches \nin the future. We are looking for specific recommendations on how to \nfairly account for past mistakes, how to find closure on the trust \nissue, and how to prevent those mistakes from again happening in the \nfuture.\n  The overall goal of the Commission is to fully and completely examine \nthe very serious charges made by Mr. Balaran, as outlined in his letter \nto Judge Lamberth. The Commission would also be authorized to examine \nother breaches of trust and to report back to the Congress and such \nexecutive departments as may seem appropriate.\n  Many words have been spoken over many years about trust \nresponsibility and the breach of trust and fiduciary obligations, but \nvery little concrete action has resulted from these words. Mr. \nBalaran's charges should be a wake-up call to all civic-minded \nAmericans to demand that fairness be restored to the administration of \nIndian trust accounts. I sincerely hope that, given the track record of \nthe past 10 years, an independent panel of distinguished Americans will \nbe given an opportunity to succeed where the executive and legislative \nbranches have fallen short. Their review will at least get to the \nbottom of Mr. Balaran's charges. And perhaps we can use the results of \nthis examination to generate momentum for exploring the larger trust \nissues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Balaran's letter of resignation and \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    April 5, 2004.\n     Re: Cobell v. Norton, No. 96-1285.\n\n     Hon. Royce C. Lamberth\n     U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Washington, \n         DC.\n\n       Dear Judge Lamberth: I hereby tender my resignation as \n     Special Master in the Cobell case, effective the close of \n     business on April 5, 2004.\n       This is an extraordinarily important case. I have been \n     privileged to work on it. For the past several months, \n     however, my efforts have been undermined by a series of \n     motions lodged by the Department of the Interior--one of \n     Cobell's two co-defendants--seeking my disqualification.\n       It is evident Interior will continue filing such motions, \n     preventing the case from moving forward. The agency's \n     motivation is clear. In recent months, I have reported \n     evidence of a practice--abetted by Interior--of energy \n     companies routinely paying individual Indians much less than \n     they pay non-Indians for oil and gas pipeline easements \n     across the Southwest. I also have uncovered evidence that \n     Interior fails to diligently monitor oil and gas leasing \n     activities on individual Indian lands. To prevent further \n     investigation into these matters, Interior seeks my removal \n     from the Cobell case.\n       The timing of Interior's efforts to disqualify me is not \n     coincidental. Interior filed its May 2003 disqualification \n     motion shortly after I found the agency withheld salient data \n     from its quarterly reports to the Court. The agency accused \n     me, of improperly retaining the services of a former Interior \n     contractor to obtain information germane to that \n     investigation. You found this accusation frivolous, \n     suggesting it was Interior that acted improperly by impeding \n     my investigation and that Interior had an ulterior motive for \n     seeking my removal. You were correct.\n       Interior's disqualification attempts stemmed from events \n     that took place several months earlier, beginning with my \n     March 6, 2003 visit to the Office of Appraisal Services of \n     the Navajo Regional Office in Gallup, New Mexico. There, in \n     the presence of the Department of Justice and Interior \n     counsel, the Chief Appraiser admitted that he appraised oil \n     and gas easements running across individual Indian lands for \n     amounts considerably less than the appraised value of \n     identical interests held by non-Indians. The Chief Appraiser \n     also admitted destroying evidence of his 20-year practice of \n     doing so. Interior has never denied that the Chief Appraiser \n     destroyed valuable trust information or that energy companies \n     pay individual Indians a fraction of what they pay similarly \n     situated non-Indians as a result of these inadequate \n     appraisals. (Nor has the agency taken any\n\n[[Page S8759]]\n\n     disciplinary action against the Chief Appraiser. To the \n     contrary, it has gone to great lengths to protect him by \n     retaining the services of two attorneys to defend his conduct \n     during a recent deposition.)\n       On August 20, 2003, I issued a report chronicling my \n     findings. This report was just the beginning. I soon began to \n     uncover evidence that Interior was putting the interests of \n     private energy companies ahead of the interests of individual \n     Indian beneficiaries.\n       On September 19, 2003, for example, I visited Minerals \n     Management Service's (MMS) Office of Minerals Revenue \n     Management (MRM) in Dallas--the repository of Interior's oil \n     and gas audit files. My visit was prompted by two events: (1) \n     the March 2003 report of Interior's Office of the Inspector \n     General, revealing that MMS officials not only fabricated oil \n     and gas audit files but were rewarded for their efforts; and \n     (2) Justice's denial of my repeated requests for access to \n     these files. As you noted in your March 15, 2004 decision \n     denying Interior's disqualification motion, since August \n     1999, I have visited dozens of sites to ensure that Interior \n     was safeguarding trust documentation in accordance with your \n     directives. Interior not only approved of these visits, but \n     encouraged its employees to cooperate with me fully during my \n     inspections. My visit to Dallas was different. After only two \n     hours, during which I uncovered chaotic recordkeeping \n     practices and missing audit files, NMS officials informed me \n     that Justice ordered that I leave.\n       The reason for this dramatic shift in policy is obvious. \n     Whereas my previous investigations exposed random incidents \n     of unprotected trust documents in remote Interior locations, \n     my recent findings implicated the agency's systemic failure \n     to properly monitor the activities of energy companies \n     leasing minerals on individual Indian lands. The consequences \n     of these findings could cost the very companies with which \n     senior Interior officials maintain close ties, millions of \n     dollars. (In that regard, I direct you to the recent \n     Inspector General Report of Investigation (PI-SI-02-0053-I), \n     discussing the relationship between Interior's most senior \n     officials and energy company executives.) Interior did not \n     want this information to come to light and for the first and \n     only time during my five-year tenure as Special Master, \n     ordered me to leave a site.\n       Just one week after my Dallas site visit, in a motion filed \n     on September 26, 2003, Interior issued the following \n     ultimatum: either you rule on its disqualification motion by \n     October 15, or the government would file a mandamus petition \n     in the Court of Appeals, seeking to have that Court \n     disqualify me. At that time, the government knew you were \n     beginning a six-defendant criminal trial on October 1, 2003, \n     that involved multiple counts of murder, drug offenses, and \n     racketeering, making it impossible for you to rule on the \n     disqualification issue by the October 15 ``deadline.'' \n     Interior was just going through the motions and, in mid-\n     October, filed its mandamus petition in the Court of Appeals.\n       It is evident that Interior, supported by the Department of \n     Justice, is committed to removing me from this case. It is \n     also plain that the agency's efforts to unseat me bear no \n     relationship to the reasons it offers in its disqualification \n     motion, but rather to my discovery of significant problems \n     with its appraisal and record-keeping practices. A full \n     investigation into these matters might well result in energy \n     companies being forced to repay significant sums to \n     individual Indians. Interior could not let this happen,\n       Justice has been much too long in coming for the hundreds \n     of thousands of Native Americans whose land the government \n     has supposedly held in trust, in some cases for over a \n     century. Billions of dollars are at stake. It is past time to \n     get systems in place that will enable the Departments of the \n     Interior and Treasury to track trust data accurately in the \n     future, as well as render an honest and reliable accounting \n     in the present. In this respect, my presence in the case has \n     become a distraction. And while I am confident that \n     Interior's disqualification motions would ultimately be \n     denied, I have no doubt that were I to continue as Special \n     Master, the agency's efforts to disqualify me would persist \n     and accelerate. Given this, I will be of no practical service \n     to the Court. I hope that, with my resignation, the parties \n     will be able to move rapidly toward fundamental reforms. I \n     also hope that, understanding this background, my successors \n     will be more efficacious.\n       Finally, on a personal note, you are a courageous, \n     decisive, and diligent judge who strives to do justice in \n     each and every case. It has been my honor to have served with \n     you. Thank you for giving me this opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alan L. Balaran,\n     Special Master.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 2770\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NATIONAL COMMISSION ON AMERICAN INDIAN TRUST \n                   HOLDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has entered into treaties with Indian \n     tribes under which the United States made various commitments \n     to Indian tribes and Indian people;\n       (2) the United States functions, by treaty and statute, as \n     a trustee for Indian tribes and individual Indians;\n       (3) the United States has a fiduciary obligation to Indian \n     tribes and Indian people and, in accordance with that \n     obligation, must use the highest standard of care to protect \n     the assets of Indian tribes and individual Indians;\n       (4) the United States has failed Indian tribes and \n     individual Indians and abridged its treaty and other \n     obligations relating to the handling of trust fund management \n     and historical accounting;\n       (5) mismanagement of Indian trust assets by the United \n     States is a longstanding problem that spans many \n     administrations;\n       (6) the complexity and longevity of that mismanagement \n     neither mitigates the injustice visited on Indian tribes and \n     the 300,000 individual Native Americans whose accounts have \n     been shortchanged nor absolves the United States of its \n     responsibility to correct the situation in a timely manner;\n       (7) in 1996 a civil action, Cobell v. Norton, Civ. No. 96-\n     1285 (RCL), was brought in the United States District Court \n     for the District of Columbia to attempt to obtain an order \n     compelling the United States to account for the trust funds \n     managed by the United States on behalf of individual Indians \n     and take all necessary action to bring the United States into \n     compliance with its fiduciary duties;\n       (8) those funds are generated from Indian trust land \n     royalties resulting from leases of that land to oil, \n     agricultural, timber, mining, and other interests;\n       (9) on April 5, 2004, Mr. Alan L.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleague \nSenator Bill Frist in introducing this bipartisan legislation to \nimprove the prevention and treatment of cancer. The Quality of Care for \nIndividuals with Cancer Act is a result of the combined efforts of many \nin the cancer community, including patients, families, cancer \nsurvivors, and health providers. Its goal is to see that as many of our \nfellow citizens as possible are able to obtain state-of-the-art cancer \ncare.\n  The Nation's continuing investment in medical research in the past \ndecade has led to many new and innovative options in cancer treatment \nand prevention. We all want to believe that when a loved one or someone \nwe know is diagnosed with cancer, they will benefit from the latest and \nmost effective treatments. Unfortunately, that is often not the case.\n  Many cancer patients receive the wrong care, too little care, or even \ntoo much care. Colon cancer is 85 percent curable if it is detected \nearly through screening. Yet today less than half of all Americans who \nshould be screened for colon cancer are actually screened. If we do not \nact to correct these problems, over a quarter of a million parents, \nsons and daughters, will die from this curable cancer in the next 5 \nyears.\n  Much more can be done to extend the reach of high-quality cancer care \nand\n\n[[Page S8767]]\n\nreduce this burden of unnecessary suffering and premature death. New \ndiscoveries of science can be brought much more quickly from the \nresearch laboratory to the bedside of the patient and to the practice \nof medicine in all communities.\n  Our bill will help assure that the care of cancer patients is \ncoordinated from diagnosis through successful treatment. The quality of \nend of life care will be significantly improved. Needed programs will \nbe established to meet the ongoing needs of cancer survivors and their \nfamilies.\n  Health care provider training will make the latest in cancer care \navailable through improved education and networking. Patients will have \naccess to providers who know how to deliver the most effective cancer \ntreatment at the right time and in the right way.\n  Today, the best in medical research is too often not available to \ntreat and cure many different types of cancer, especially leukemia, \nbreast cancer, and prostate cancer. The treatments will vary for each \npatient, but the standard of excellence in cancer care should be widely \navailable to all. Enactment of this legislation will bring that day \ncloser, and I look forward to its enactment, its implementation, and \nthe benefits it will bring to so many of our fellow citizens in the \nyears ahead.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 2772. A bill to promote the development of the emerging commercial \nhuman space flight industry, to extend the liability indemnification \nregime for the commercial space transportation industry, to authorize \nappropriations for the Office of the Associate Administrator for \nCommercial Space Transportation, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to proudly introduce the \nSpace Commercial Human Ascent Serving Expeditions Act also known as the \nSpace CHASE Act.\n  Because Oklahoma has significant history in aviation, I believe it is \nwell positioned to be a leading State in the up-and-coming commercial \nspace industry.\n  Since 1910, beginning with Charles F. Willard who only flew a few \nhundred yards in a south Oklahoma City field, Oklahomans have been \nflying.\n  The following year, Clyde Cessna, an automobile dealer from Enid who \nlater formed the Cessna Aircraft Company, flew his mono-wing airplane \nnear Jet, OK.\n  Such early flights in Oklahoma continued and in 1929 perhaps one of \nthe most notable aviation events occurred in Waynoka, OK, where Charles \nLindbergh stopped on the first transcontinental passenger air and rail \nservice.\n  By 1931, Wiley Post, from Maysville, OK, gained international \nrecognition when he flew around the world in a little over 8 days. In \nJuly 1991, I had the honor of recreating Post's trip on its 60th \nanniversary.\n  Oklahoma's aviation history does not stop there. On November 2, 1929, \n26 licensed women pilots founded what was known as the 99 Club, or the \nNinety-Nines. It was called so at the suggestion of its first \npresident, Amelia Earheart, because of the 117 licensed women pilots in \nAmerica who were contacted about joining the club, only 99 actually \njoined. The South Central Section of the 99 Club comprising several \nStates including Oklahoma, has through the years, issued several \npublications and in 1962, Mary Lester of the Oklahoma Chapter created a \nnew version of the Club's publication, the Ninety-Nine News. Today, the \n99 club is an international organization of licensed women pilots from \n35 countries, with its international headquarters at Will Rogers World \nAirport in Oklahoma City.\n  In 1999, the Oklahoma State Legislature established the Oklahoma \nSpace Industry Development Authority OSIDA to create a commercial \nspaceport that will ``expand and economically develop the space \nfrontier with advanced spacecraft operating facilities.'' Furthermore, \nOSIDA's mission is to carry out this vision with ``. . . deliberate and \nforceful . . . planning and development of spaceport facilities, launch \nsystems and projects, and to successfully promote and stimulate the \ncreation of space commerce, education and space related industries in \nOklahoma.''\n  In March of 2001, I appealed to NASA, on behalf of the Oklahoma Space \nIndustry Development Authority, to receive nearly a quarter of a \nmillion dollars in grant money. Part of this grant is paid for the \nopening of the Oklahoma Spaceport. My efforts to build a space industry \nin Oklahoma are coming to fruition with that March 2002 launch of \n``Dark Sky Station,'' from the Spaceport in Burns Flat. The rest of the \nmoney from the NASA grant went to nine other organizations around the \nState, dedicated to providing space-related education.\n  I applaud OSIDA for this aggressive economic plan and, as a result, \nknow of 15 companies that have entered into Memoranda of Understanding \nwith OSIDA: Armadillo Aerospace; Space Development; XCOR Aerospace; \nZero Gravity; Pioneer Rocketplane; Vela Technology; Rocketplane, Ltd.; \nJP Aerospace; TGV Rockets; JP Skylaunch; Space Adventures; Jim Schouten \nEnterprises; Universal Spaceliners; Takeoff Technologies; and Space \nAssets.\n  Oklahoma is also home to business done by other such companies and \nentities as: Beyond-Earth Enterprises, which is helping to revitalize \nthe passion of space travel by providing payload launch capabilities at \naffordable rates; the Global Space League, Inc., a 501(c)3 nonprofit \ninstitution which takes science experiments from students, kindergarten \nthrough university level, to remote places normally accessible only to \nprofessional scientists; and HighShips, which is in the business of \ndeveloping innovative lighter-than-air flying vehicles.\n  Several communities in southwestern Oklahoma stand to either benefit \nfrom, take part in, or have synergies with commercial space development \nincluding: Burns Flat which boasts the third longest runway in North \nAmerica, Sayre, Frederick, Elk City, Hobart and Altus Air Force Base. I \nlook forward to working with these communities in the future, such as \nwith Oklahoma House District 63 Representative Don Armes.\n  I encourage any and all companies and individuals who would like to \nbecome involved in the commercial space industry to come to \nsouthwestern Oklahoma. Oklahoma welcomes space industries with these \nfeatures; Tax and Financial Incentives, Oklahoma Quality Job Program: \nQuarterly cash payments of 5% of new payroll for 10 years; Investment \nTax Credit: Credit equal 1% of the investment in depreciable property \nfor 5 years-doubles in this Enterprise zone; Sales/Use Tax Refund: \nRefunds tax paid on construction materials in new manufacturing \nfacility; Property Tax Exemptions: 5-year abatement on 100 percent of \nproperty tax on new investment in manufacturing space; Sales/Use Tax \nExemption: Available for machinery and equipment used in manufacturing, \nincluding property consumed; Accelerated Federal Property \nDepreciations: Provides approximately 40 percent shorter recovery \nperiod for depreciable property on Indian land.\n\n  Training Incentives: Vocational Technology School free to employees; \ncustomized assistance in employee screening; job training partnership \nprogram.\n  Financing: Oklahoma Finance Authority low cost loans; venture capital \nprogram facilitated by the agency; bonding by the agency; business \nfinancial assistance.\n  Site Specifics: existing available buildings: Hangars, office space, \nmaintenance, warehouses; over 13,500 feet runway, ramp space; 3,000 \nacres of open space; utilities, infrastructure in place; rail spur, \nmajor Interstate Highway access; more than 340 days of clear skies; \npolar and ISS orbit launch windows available; no environmental issues; \nsite geology supports any type of construction.\n  Please come to Oklahoma to advance commercial space exploration and \navail yourself of Oklahoma's benefits.\n  Coming from Oklahoma's distinguished aviation heritage and innovative \nactivity in the aerospace sector, as well as my experience as a \ncommercially licensed pilot instructor, I rise today to introduce what \nI believe is a bill to benefit current and future aerospace companies \nin Oklahoma and throughout our entire Nation.\n  This legislation came to fruition after I facilitated many \nnegotiations between the Federal Aviation Authority, the House Science \nSubcommittee\n\n[[Page S8768]]\n\non Space and Aeronautics, the Senate Commerce Committee, aerospace \ncompanies and the Oklahoma Space Industrial Development Authority.\n  My language adds to H.R. 3752, the Commercial Space Launch Amendments \nAct of 2004, which updates the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984, by \naccounting for a new class of sub-orbital launch vehicles that use \nhybrid technology--a combination of rocket and jet engines--to create a \nfair approach to future civilian suborbital flights.\n\n  In this legislation to advance the commercial space community, I have \nsuccessfully covered hybrid aerospace vehicles.\n  By defining a sub-orbital vehicle as a rocket-propelled vehicle, ``in \nwhole or in part, intended for flight on a sub-orbital trajectory, and \nwhose thrust is greater than its lift for the majority of the rocket-\npowered portion of its ascent,'' aerospace companies will now face less \nregulation than with previous definitions for this type of vehicle.\n  Under my language, the FAA's Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation will now have sole regulation authority for sub-orbital \nhybrid vehicles, and will now be appropriately considered and licensed \nas launch vehicles. By this classification, aerospace companies such as \nRocketplane, which utilizes hybrid technology, will now avoid being \nforced to go through a lengthy two-step licensing process formerly \nrequired for both launch vehicles and commercial aircraft and will have \nthe opportunity to be licensed to carry civilian passengers much more \nquickly.\n  In addition to the definition of sub-orbital flight, I am also proud \nof the indemnification and insurance provisions of this legislation \nwhich make it possible for small companies to enter into this business \nfield, and am happy to create the new ``experimental permit'' \nframework.\n  I know that my colleagues, House Science Space and Aeronautics \nSubcommittee Chairman Rohrabacher and Committee Chairman Boehlert, and \ntheir aide, Timothy Hughes, have worked diligently to update the \nCommercial Space Launch Act of 1984 by introducing and passing H.R. \n3752.\n  I particularly want to thank my fellow Oklahoman and House Science \nCommittee member Frank Lucas for requesting my involvement in this \nlegislation, along with requests from Oklahoma State Senator Gilmer \nCapps, Oklahoma State Representative Jack Bonny, Oklahoma Lieutenant \nGovernor Mary Fallon, and the Oklahoma Space Industry Development \nAuthority, Congressman Lucas' colloquy with Chairman Boehlert on the \nfloor the House of Representatives on March 4, 2004, speaks of his \ninterest in ensuring that this very commercial space legislation \ninclude hybrid vehicles that fly a bit like rockets and a bit like \nairplanes:\n\n       Mr. Boehlert. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may \n     consume to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) for the \n     purposes of a colloquy.\n       Mr. Lucas of Oklahoma. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the \n     gentleman from New York (Mr. Boehlert) and the gentleman from \n     Tennessee (Mr. Gordon) bringing this important bill to the \n     floor, because the emerging commercial human space flight \n     industry presents tremendous opportunities for my State of \n     Oklahoma and our Nation as a whole. I am particularly \n     appreciative of this bill's intent to ease the regulatory \n     burdens for entrepreneurs who are developing new suborbital \n     reusable launch vehicles.\n       Mr. Boehlert. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?\n       Mr. Lucas of Oklahoma. I yield to the gentleman from New \n     York.\n       Mr. Boehlert. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his \n     kind words. He is correct in stating that this legislation \n     seeks to put in place sufficient Federal regulation to \n     protect the general public while also promoting this \n     important new industry.\n       Mr. Lucas of Oklahoma. As you know, Mr. Chairman, some \n     suborbital reusable launch vehicles that will be used in \n     commercial human space flight activities may have some \n     attributes normally associated with airplanes as well as many \n     attributes of rockets. My hope is that such hybrid vehicles \n     would not have to be regulated under two separate regimes. \n     What are the chairman's views on this matter?\n       Mr. Boehlert. I thank the gentleman for that question.\n       This is a very important issue on which we have worked \n     extensively with industry and the executive branch in \n     developing this bill. As currently drafted, H.R. 3752 \n     incorporates definitions promulgated by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration to distinguish between suborbital rockets, \n     which are under the jurisdiction of FAA's Associate \n     Administrator for Commercial Space Transport, and other \n     aerospace vehicles which are regulated by another part of the \n     FAA. That said, I would be happy to keep working with the \n     gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) and other interested \n     parties as the bill moves forward to revisit the important \n     issue of how best to regulate hybrid vehicles that are \n     engaged in commercial human space flight.\n       Mr. Lucas of Oklahoma. I thank the chairman and I look \n     forward to continuing to work with him and our colleagues in \n     the other body to see if we can create a single regime for \n     hybrid commercial space flight vehicles.\n\n  While I realize H.R. 3752 creates fairness in regulation for the \nnewly emerging civilian space flight industry, I believe my language \ntakes it a step further by ensuring all companies entering this field \nhave a level licensing playing field including those using hybrid \ntechnologies.\n  These are exciting times for this field of human endeavor. We are \ncurrently in the middle of a competition for the ANSARI X PRIZE. This \ncompetition is a courageous effort to refocus society's attention on \nthe last frontier--space. To win the $10 million ANSARI X PRIZE, the \nsuccessful team will launch a craft carrying at least three people to \nan altitude of at least 100 km, 62.5 miles, return safely to Earth, \nthen repeat it with the same craft within 2 weeks.\n  With pilot Mike Melvill, the Burt Rutan team made a flight on June \n21, 2004, but control problems prevented the repeat flight within the 2 \nweeks.\n  This brilliant concept of the Ansari X Prize exemplifies the \nexcellence that can be achieved through an incentivized approach rather \nthan a governmental mandate or punitive approach. Incentivize and \nsafely get government out of the way is the philosophy of my bill. \nTempt not only the pocketbook but the vision of anyone who has the \ncreativity and imagination to pursue it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8768-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8768-S8776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 415--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n     PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON \n                          GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 418\n\n       Whereas countless families in the United States live with \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 1 in 6 men in the United States will be diagnosed \n     with prostate cancer in his lifetime;\n       Whereas over the past decade, prostate cancer has been the \n     most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer and the second most \n     common cancer killer of men in the United States;\n       Whereas over 230,000 men in the United States will be \n     diagnosed with prostate cancer and 29,900 men in the United \n     States will die of prostate cancer in 2004, according to \n     American Cancer Society estimates;\n       Whereas 30 percent of new cases occur in men under the age \n     of 65;\n       Whereas a man in the United States turns 50 years old about \n     every 14 seconds, increasing the occurrence of cancer and, \n     particularly, of prostate cancer;\n       Whereas African-American males suffer a prostate cancer \n     incidence rate as much as 60 percent higher than White males \n     and have double the mortality rates;\n       Whereas obesity is a significant predictor of prostate \n     cancer severity and death;\n       Whereas if a man in the United States has 1 family member \n     diagnosed with prostate cancer, he has double the risk of \n     prostate cancer, if he has 2 family members with such \n     diagnosis, he has 5 times the risk, and if he has 3 family \n     members with such diagnosis, he has a 97-percent risk of \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas screening by both digital rectal examination and \n     prostate specific antigen blood test can diagnose the disease \n     in earlier and more treatable stages and reduce prostate \n     cancer mortality;\n       Whereas ongoing research promises to further improvements \n     in prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and \n     treatments; and\n       Whereas educating people in the United States, including \n     health care providers, about prostate cancer and early \n     detection strategies is crucial to saving men's lives and \n     preserving and protecting families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2004 as ``National Prostate Cancer \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) declares that the Federal Government has a \n     responsibility to--\n       (A) raise awareness about the importance of screening \n     methods and treatment of prostate cancer;\n       (B) increase research funding that is commensurate with the \n     burden of the disease so that the causes of prostate cancer, \n     and improved screening, treatments, and a cure for prostate \n     cancer, may be discovered; and\n       (C) continue to consider ways for improving the access to, \n     and quality of, health care services for detecting and \n     treating prostate cancer; and\n       (3) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States, interested \n     groups, and affected persons to--\n       (A) promote awareness of prostate cancer;\n       (B) take an active role in the fight to end the devastating \n     affects of prostate cancer on individuals, their families, \n     and the economy; and\n       (C) observe the month of September 2004 with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 419--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \nTO THE CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT AND THE SMOOTH TRANSITION OF EXECUTIVE \n                                 POWER\n\n  Mr. CORNYN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S. Res. 419\n\n       Whereas members of the Senate, regardless of political \n     party affiliation, agree that the American people deserve a \n     Government that is failsafe and foolproof, and that \n     terrorists should never have the ability to disrupt the \n     operations of the Government;\n       Whereas continuity of governmental operations in the wake \n     of a catastrophic terrorist attack remains a pressing issue \n     of national importance before the United States Congress;\n       Whereas, at a minimum, terrorists should never have the \n     ability, by launching a terrorist attack, to change the \n     political party that is in control of the Government, \n     regardless of which party is in power;\n       Whereas, whenever control of the White House shall change \n     from one political party to another, the outgoing President \n     and the incoming President should work together, and with the \n     Senate to the extent determined appropriate by the Senate, to \n     ensure a smooth transition of executive power, in the \n     interest of the American people;\n       Whereas, under the current presidential succession statute \n     in section 19 of title 3, United States Code, the members of \n     the cabinet, defined as the heads of the statutory executive \n     departments under section 101 of title 5, United States Code, \n     fall within the line of succession to the presidency;\n       Whereas, during previous presidential transition periods, \n     the incoming President has had to serve with cabinet members \n     from the prior administration, including subcabinet officials \n     from the prior administration acting as cabinet members, for \n     at least some period of time;\n       Whereas the Constitution vests the appointment power of \n     executive branch officials in the President, by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, and nothing in this \n     resolution is intended to alter either the constitutional \n     power of the President or the constitutional function of the \n     Senate with regard to the confirmation of presidential \n     nominees;\n       Whereas an incoming President cannot exercise the \n     constitutional powers of the President, in order to ensure a \n     smooth transition of Government, until noon on the 20th day \n     of January, pursuant to the terms of the twentieth amendment \n     to the Constitution;\n       Whereas cooperation between the incoming and the outgoing \n     President is therefore the only way to ensure a smooth \n     transition of Government;\n       Whereas Congress throughout history has acted consistently \n     and in a bipartisan fashion to encourage measures to ensure \n     the smooth transition of executive power from one President \n     to another, such as through the enactment of the Presidential \n     Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note; Public Law 88-277) \n     and subsequent amendments;\n       Whereas Congress has previously concluded that ``[t]he \n     national interest requires'' that ``the orderly transfer of \n     the executive power in connection with the expiration of the \n     term of office of a President and the inauguration of a new \n     President . . . be accomplished so as to assure continuity in \n     the faithful execution of the laws and in the conduct of the \n     affairs of the Federal Government, both domestic and \n     foreign'' under the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 (3 \n     U.S.C. 102 note; Public Law 88-277);\n       Whereas Congress has further concluded that ``[a]ny \n     disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power \n     could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-\n     being of the United States and its people'' under the \n     Presidential Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note; \n     Public Law 88-277); and\n       Whereas Congress has previously expressed its intent ``that \n     appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or \n     minimize any disruption'' and ``that all officers of the \n     Government so conduct the affairs of the Government for which \n     they exercise responsibility and authority as (1) to be \n     mindful of problems occasioned by transitions in the office \n     of the President, (2) to take appropriate lawful steps to \n     avoid or minimize disruptions that might be occasioned by the \n     transfer of the executive power, and (3) otherwise to promote \n     orderly transitions in the office of President'' under the \n     Presidential Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note; \n     Public Law 88-277): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that during \n     the period preceding the end of a term of office in which a \n     President will not be serving a succeeding term--\n       (1) that President should consider submitting the \n     nominations of individuals to the Senate who are selected by \n     the President-elect for offices that fall within the line of \n     succession;\n       (2) the Senate should consider conducting confirmation \n     proceedings and votes on the nominations described under \n     paragraph (1), to the extent determined appropriate by the \n     Senate, between January 3 and January 20 before the \n     Inauguration; and\n       (3) that President should consider agreeing to sign and \n     deliver commissions for all approved nominations on January \n     20 before the Inauguration to ensure continuity of \n     Government.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday I rose to address this body in \nsupport of a Senate resolution on a profoundly nonpartisan issue. As \nPresident Bush and the United States government continue their fight to \nprotect the American way of life in the war against terrorism, they \nhave also been fighting another battle to protect American ideals and \nprinciples--a battle against human trafficking and slavery. Most \nAmericans would be shocked to learn that the institution of slavery--an \ninstitution that hundreds of thousands of Americans shed precious blood \nto destroy--continues to persist today--not just around the world, but \nhidden in communities across America. This is a new fight against an \nold evil. It is the most fundamental civil rights issue of our time.\n  I was pleased to work with my lead Democrat co-sponsor, Senator \nSchumer, as well as with Senators Graham of South Carolina, Leahy, and \nClinton, to introduce and obtain full Senate approval of Senate \nResolution 414. That resolution expressed strong support for the \nJustice Department's recent efforts to combat human trafficking, under \nthe leadership of the Civil Rights Division. The resolution noted that \nthe Justice Department recently held its first-ever National Conference \non Human Trafficking in Tampa, Florida, where it announced a new \ncomprehensive model state anti-trafficking law. The resolution \nencouraged states to consider adopting such laws where they do not \ncurrently exist.\n  Today, I rise in support of a Senate resolution on another profoundly \nnonpartisan issue--the preservation of our system of government in the \nwake of a catastrophic terrorist attack. Just as most Americans would \nbe shocked to learn about the incidence of forced labor and sexual \nservitude in communities across the country, I believe most Americans \nwould be shocked to learn that our laws are profoundly inadequate to \nensure continuity of governmental operations in the wake of a \ncatastrophic terrorist attack.\n  I have spent a great deal of time and energy this past year on the \nissue of continuity of government. Last September, I chaired two \nhearings to examine continuity of government problems in the two \npolitical branches of government. On September 9, I chaired a hearing \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee to examine continuity problems in the \nCongress, and on September 16, Senator Lott and I co-chaired a joint \nhearing of the Senate Rules and Judiciary Committees to look at \nproblems in our system of Presidential succession.\n  These are not partisan issues. These are imminently nonpartisan \nissues, and so I was pleased to work on those hearings with my \ndistinguished colleagues on the other side of the aisle--Senator Leahy, \nthe ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator \nFeingold, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nthe Constitution, Civil Rights, and Property Rights, which I am honored \nto chair.\n\n  In November, I introduced Senate Joint Resolution 23, a proposed \nconstitutional amendment to ensure continuity of Congress. \nConstitutional legal experts across the political spectrum have \nrecognized that our current laws are inadequate to ensure continuity of \nCongressional operations in the wake of a catastrophic terrorist \nattack, and that only a constitutional amendment can ensure that the \nAmerican people will never have to suffer under martial law.\n  The constitutional amendment I introduced implements the \nrecommendations of the bipartisan blue ribbon Continuity of Government \nCommission, sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute and the \nBrookings Institution. That commission is led by two of our nation's \ntruly most distinguished American statesmen--its honorary co-chairmen, \nformer Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford--as well as by its two \ndistinguished co-chairmen, former Senator Alan Simpson and former White \nHouse Counsel Lloyd Cutler. The commission is comprised of former high-\nranking government officials of both parties, and ably staffed by \nNorman Ornstein, John Fortier, and Thomas Mann.\n  I know that there are sharp divisions in the House over what kinds of \ncontinuity measures to adopt--whether\n\n[[Page S8771]]\n\nemergency interim appointments are appropriate and necessary, or if \nexpedited special elections alone are sufficient. It is important to \nrecognize that my amendment takes no position in that debate. My \namendment would not compel either chamber of Congress to adopt any \nparticular methodology for redressing continuity problems. It would \nsimply empower Congress to adopt legislation to guarantee continuity of \nCongressional operations--power that Congress does not currently \npossess. It is modeled after Article II of the Constitution, which \nempowers Congress to adopt legislation to provide for continuity of the \nPresidency.\n  On January 27 of this year, I chaired a hearing of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee so that legal experts could examine the need for \nSenate Joint Resolution 23. And on that same day, I introduced \nimplementing legislation (S. 2031), entitled the Continuity of the \nSenate Act of 2004. Continuity problems affect both the House and the \nSenate. Indeed, the Senate arguably faces the most dire problem of \nall--if a majority of Senators are incapacitated, Congress could be \ndisabled for as long as four years, the amount of time it takes to \nelect a new majority of Senators. The Continuity of the Senate Act of \n2004 would implement the constitutional amendment proposed by Senate \nJoint Resolution 23. It would simply empower each state to adopt \ncontinuity measures for their senators in case of incapacity--following \nthe model of the 17th Amendment with respect to Senate vacancies. I am \npleased that Senators Dodd and Lott agreed to serve as original co-\nsponsors of this legislation. After all, they are the ranking Democrat \nand Republican, respectively, on the Senate Rules Committee--the \ncommittee that would have jurisdiction to consider the Continuity of \nthe Senate Act, in the event that the constitutional amendment I have \nproposed is approved by two-thirds of the Congress and three-fourths of \nthe states.\n  On May 13, I convened a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee \non the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights--the subcommittee \nthat possesses jurisdiction over constitutional amendments. I am \npleased that the subcommittee approved Senate Joint Resolution 23 on a \nbipartisan vote. I am particularly pleased that the resolution was \nsupported by my distinguished colleague, the subcommittee's ranking \nDemocrat, Senator Feingold. I know from working with him these past \nseveral months that he is no fan of constitutional amendments. And of \ncourse, everyone in this chamber agrees that the Constitution should \nnot be amended casually. Yet he recognized--as have constitutional \nlegal experts across the political spectrum--that the only way to \nensure continuity of Congressional operations is a constitutional \namendment. I look forward to working with Senator Hatch, the chairman \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, in coming weeks and months so that \nthe full committee can consider the merits of, and the need for, Senate \nJoint Resolution 23.\n\n  Of course, Congress is not the only institution that faces serious \nproblems of continuity of operations. Our laws are also inadequate with \nrespect to Presidential succession. Article II of the Constitution \ngives Congress the power to enact laws to address Presidential \nsuccession--just as my proposed constitutional amendment would give \nCongress such power with respect to continuity of Congress. Yet legal \nexperts across the political spectrum have written that the current \nPresidential succession statute is unconstitutional and unworkable.\n  Accordingly, I introduced legislation in February, right before \nPresident's Day, to reform the Presidential succession statute (S. \n2073). That same day, I also introduced a Senate resolution (S. Con. \nRes. 89) to establish a protocol for ensuring proper transition between \nan outgoing President and a newly elected President. Both measures were \ncosponsored by Senator Lott, the chairman of the Rules Committee, which \nexercises jurisdiction over such matters.\n  I am pleased to introduce a more robust version of that same \nresolution today for the Senate's consideration, in the form of a \nSenate resolution that requires the consent of only this body. It is an \nimportant step to ensuring that, no matter what, at a minimum, \nterrorists will never be able to determine, by launching a terrorist \nstrike, which party controls the White House.\n  Imagine if you will that it is January 20, the inauguration date for \na new incoming President. The sun is shining, and the American people \nare watching. The new President and Vice President sit on the center \nplatform just steps away from the Capitol Rotunda, joined by American \nand foreign dignitaries. Leaders of both Houses of Congress sit nearby \nas well. It is a beautiful day--but as national security and continuity \nof government experts have long recognized, it is also a window of \nvulnerability. If terrorists launched a successful strike on \nInauguration Day, it could wipe out not only our new President, but \nalso the first three people who are in the line of Presidential \nsuccession under our current Presidential succession statute--the Vice \nPresident, the Speaker of the House, and the President pro tempore of \nthe Senate.\n  What happens next?\n  Well, imagine that the election of the prior year had resulted in a \nchange of political party control of the White House. During previous \nPresidential transition periods, a new incoming President has had to \nserve with Cabinet members from the prior administration--including \nsub-Cabinet officials from the prior administration acting as Cabinet \nmembers--for at least some period of time. That means that, in the \nevent of a successful inaugural day attack, the official who could rise \nto become Acting President, perhaps serving for four full years, could \nvery well be a member of the outgoing administration--indeed, a member \nof the political party that the American people expelled from office at \nthe most recent election.\n  The resolution I introduce today would help prevent this from \nhappening. As the resolution acknowledges, members of the Senate, \nregardless of political party affiliation, agree that the American \npeople deserve a Government that is failsafe and foolproof. We agree \nthat terrorists should never have the ability to disrupt the operations \nof the Government. We agree that continuity of governmental operations \nin the wake of a catastrophic terrorist attack remains a pressing issue \nof national importance before the United States Congress. And we agree \nthat, at a minimum, terrorists should never have the ability, by \nlaunching a terrorist attack, to change the political party that is in \ncontrol of the Government--a principle that applies regardless of which \nparty is in power.\n  An incoming President, of course, cannot exercise the constitutional \npowers of the President, in order to ensure a smooth transition of \nGovernment, until noon on the 20th day of January, pursuant to the \nterms of the Twentieth Amendment of the Constitution. Accordingly, \ncooperation between the incoming and the outgoing President is the only \nway to ensure a smooth transition of government.\n  Whenever control of the White House shall change from one political \nparty to another, the outgoing President and the incoming President \nshould work together, and with the Senate to the extent deemed \nappropriate by the Senate, to ensure a smooth transition of executive \npower, in the interest of the American people. Accordingly, the \nresolution establishes a non-binding protocol--a protocol with three \nparts.\n  First, the resolution states that an outgoing President should \nconsider submitting the nominations of individuals to the Senate who \nare selected by the President-elect for offices that fall within the \nline of succession. Under the current Presidential succession statute \n(3 U.S.C. Sec. 19), that means the members of the Cabinet, defined as \nthe heads of the statutory executive departments (5 U.S.C. Sec. 101).\n  Second, the resolution provides that the Senate should consider \nconducting confirmation proceedings and votes on Cabinet nominations, \nto the extent deemed appropriate by the Senate, between January 3 and \nJanuary 20 before the Inauguration. Of course, nothing in the \nresolution purports to alter the constitutional powers of either the \nPresident or the Senate, and indeed, nothing in this resolution could \nconstitutionally do so.\n  And third, the resolution encourages the outgoing President to \nconsider agreeing to sign and deliver commissions for all approved \nnominations on January 20 before the Inauguration--all to ensure \ncontinuity of government.\n\n[[Page S8772]]\n\n  I am pleased that this resolution has received such strong support \namongst experts in the fields of continuity of government and \nconstitutional law. This is a truly nonpartisan effort, so I am \nparticularly pleased that the resolution is so enthusiastically \nsupported by constitutional legal experts such as Walter Dellinger, \nCass Sunstein, Laurence Tribe, Michael Gerhardt, and Howard Wasserman. \nRather than repeat their words here, I will simply ask unanimous \nconsent that their letters be included in the Congressional Record at \nthe close of my remarks.\n  Throughout history, Congress has acted consistently and in a \nbipartisan fashion to encourage measures to ensure the smooth \ntransition of Executive power from one President to another. I think, \nfor example, of the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, and its \nsubsequent amendments. In that Act, Congress concluded that ``[t]he \nnational interest requires'' that ``the orderly transfer of the \nexecutive power in connection with the expiration of the term of office \nof a President and the inauguration of a new President . . . be \naccomplished so as to assure continuity in the faithful execution of \nthe laws and in the conduct of the affairs of the Federal Government, \nboth domestic and foreign.'' Congress further concluded that ``[a]ny \ndisruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could \nproduce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the United \nStates and its people.'' Accordingly, Congress expressed its intent \n``that appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or minimize \nany disruption'' and ``that all officers of the Government so conduct \nthe affairs of the Government for which they exercise responsibility \nand authority as (1) to be mindful of problems occasioned by \ntransitions in the office of President, (2) to take appropriate lawful \nsteps to avoid or minimize disruptions that might be occasioned by the \ntransfer of the executive power, and (3) otherwise to promote orderly \ntransitions in the office of President.''\n  Close cooperation between an incoming President and an outgoing \nPresident is the only way to ensure a smooth transition of government. \nSo this evening, just days away from the first of our nation's two \ngreat political conventions, I am pleased to introduce a resolution to \nensure continuity of government during a unique window of \nvulnerability--the Presidential inaugural period. And I look forward to \nfurther debate and discussion on other legislation to ensure the \ncontinuity of our national government.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Harvard University,\n\n                                     Cambridge, MA, July 22, 2004.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the \n         Constitution, Civil Rights & Property Rights, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I am writing to commend you for \n     drafting the Resolution whose text you have shared with me \n     expressing the sense of the Senate with respect to continuity \n     of government and the smooth transition of Executive power. I \n     write not as a friend and supporter of Senators Kerry and \n     Edwards, whose election this November to the presidency and \n     vice presidency I believe you know I strongly favor, but as a \n     citizen of this nation and, for more than 30 years, a \n     professor of constitutional law who is devoted to the success \n     of its government of, by, and for the people,\n       The Resolution I have read is a non-binding measure that \n     creates no obligations or rights and imposes no restrictions. \n     For this reason among others, it is fully consistent with the \n     Constitution of the United States. Unlike some such non-\n     binding measures, however, this one seems to me extremely \n     wise. It entails no posturing, and the recommendations it \n     makes for the transition from an incumbent president's \n     administration to that of a newly elected president who is \n     not the incumbent--a situation I fervently hope we will \n     confront between November 2, 2004, and January 20, 2005--seem \n     to me not only sensible but potentially crucial, especially \n     during a period of our history when fanatic international \n     terrorism threatens to disrupt our political and governmental \n     processes. The recommendations are such that a non-partisan, \n     good-government perspective would commend this Resolution to \n     the entire Senate, and I strongly support its adoption.\n           Yours truly,\n     Laurence Tribe.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             University of Chicago Law School,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, July 22, 2004.\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     Chairman, Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil \n         Rights, and Property Rights, Senate Committee on the \n         Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I am writing to express support, from \n     the standpoint of constitutional structure and good \n     governance, for the proposed resolution involving continuity \n     in government, which would contain the following language:\n       ``Resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that during \n     the period preceding the end of a term of office in which a \n     President will not be serving a succeeding term--\n       (1) that President should consider submitting the \n     nominations of individuals to the Senate who are selected by \n     the President-elect for offices that fall within the line of \n     succession;\n       (2) the Senate should consider conducting confirmation \n     proceedings and votes on the nominations described under \n     paragraph (1), to the extent deemed appropriate by the \n     Senate, between January 3 and January 20 before the \n     Inauguration; and\n       (3) that President should consider agreeing to sign and \n     deliver commissions for all approved nominations on January \n     20 before the Inauguration, to ensure continuity of \n     Government''\n       The significant advantage of the suggested process is that \n     in the event of terrorist attack or other large-scale \n     disruption, it would reduce the risk that there would be \n     ``gaps'' in the personnel and operation of the Executive \n     Branch. If the process operates as suggested, then there \n     would be no period in which certain high-level offices (those \n     that fall within the line of succession) lack personnel of \n     the President's choosing. A disadvantage of the suggested \n     process is that it would put perhaps unwelcome time pressure \n     on both the President-elect and the Senate--while also \n     putting the sitting President in a mildly awkward position. \n     Nonetheless, the text of the Resolution is not rigid \n     (``should consider''), and there are large virtues, for the \n     President-elect and the Senate alike, of providing an early, \n     expeditious process for ensuring that the President's Cabinet \n     is in place. The process thus promises to reduce a serious \n     danger without compromising important structural values.\n       One of the most central goals of our constitutional system \n     is to create an energetic and unitary executive branch, one \n     that is capable of prompt and expeditious action. See The \n     Federalist No. 70; E. Corwin, The President--Office and \n     Powers 3-30 (1957). This resolution, at once bipartisan and \n     nonpartisan, would serve to promote that goal under \n     contemporary conditions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cass R. Sunstein.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        O'Melveny & Myers LLP,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 2004.\n     Re: ``Smooth Transition'' Proposed Legislation.\n\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: On rare occasions a suggestion comes \n     along that is truly a good government idea. The ``smooth \n     transition'' resolution you have proposed is a premier \n     example. It is a simple idea that would strengthen our \n     government, regardless of party and regardless of ideology. \n     To have the outgoing President, in his final weeks in office, \n     submit to the Senate the nominations of those individuals the \n     new President-elect has chosen for the cabinet is not merely \n     a convenience: it is essential in an era in which our \n     government must be ever vigilant.\n       I served in the White House in February, March and April of \n     1993. As you will recall, the position of Attorney General \n     was not filled in a timely fashion. In my view this resulted \n     in serious mistakes being made, as the President turned to \n     the White House staff for advice and legal opinions that \n     would have come from the Department of Justice had there been \n     a functioning Attorney General. Because of the great and \n     steady influence of career lawyers at Justice, the advice \n     from that Department is generally more solid and consistent \n     over time than a President receives when he has to rely on \n     the White House to carry out duties that should be performed \n     by the Attorney General. So I know first hand how important \n     it is to have new Department Heads in place at the moment the \n     new President is sworn in to office.\n       Your amendment does more than facilitate the smooth \n     functioning of government. It sets the right tone at a time \n     when so many partisan battles divide us in spirit. Our \n     parties should compete vigorously on policy and present \n     alternative visions and plans to the American people. But \n     then we should facilitate rather than inhibit the capacity of \n     the prevailing party to do the job the American people have \n     chosen them to do. This is a sentiment I expressed four years \n     ago in the pages of The Wall Street Journal as the new \n     administration of President George W. Bush came to power. I \n     am taking the liberty of including a copy of ``The Wrong Way \n     to Oppose'' from the Journal for January 10, 2001. I wish I \n     had thought of your idea and included it in that piece.\n       I hope your resolution is adopted with great bi-partisan \n     support. Best wishes to you.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Walter E.

John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on the \n         Constitution, Civil Rights, and Property Rights, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I write to express my support for the \n     resolution you are introducing suggesting that the President \n     and Senate should each consider taking particular actions \n     later this year to ensure a smooth transition and the \n     continuity of government. I share your concerns about \n     possibly crippling attacks against our government by \n     terrorists and your efforts to ameliorate the effects of any \n     such attacks. I believe your proposed resolution expresses a \n     noble ideal for the President and the Senate to work together \n     as smoothly and quickly as possible to ensure that the \n     administration is fully staffed and operational during the \n     critical period after the 2004 presidential election and \n     before Inauguration Day in January 2005.\n       I appreciate that resolutions on presidential nominations \n     touch upon extremely sensitive constitutional terrain. The \n     Appointments Clause of the Constitution vests the President \n     with the authority to nominate certain high-ranking \n     officials, and presidents have fiercely protected this \n     prerogative from encroachment by the Senate. The Appointments \n     Clause also vests the Senate with the authority to provide \n     its ``Advice and Consent'' on presidential nominations, and \n     the Senate has defended this authority from interference by \n     any other branch. I believe your resolution has merit in part \n     because it accords due respect for the respective \n     appointments authorities of the President and the Senate. It \n     is non-binding. It does not require either branch to do \n     anything it prefers not to do. It shows due respect for the \n     autonomy of the President and the Senate in exercising their \n     respective authorities over federal appointments. Separation \n     of powers problems arise when one branch encroaches upon, or \n     seeks to usurp, the authority of another branch. But, to its \n     credit, the resolution avoids such problems by both \n     acknowledging that its purpose is not to ``alter the \n     constitutional power of the President or the constitutional \n     function of the Senate with regard to the confirmation of \n     Presidential nominations'' and by calling upon the President \n     and the Senate merely to ``consider'' taking certain actions \n     later this year--the President in possibly nominating the \n     President-elect's nominees for cabinet and other offices \n     requiring confirmation, and the Senate in considering holding \n     confirmation proceedings and votes on these nominations prior \n     to the Inaugural.\n       I understand that the President-Elect may not be able, for \n     whatever reason, to nominate all the people he would like by \n     his inaugural. I also understand that the Senate may not be \n     able, for whatever reason, to act as quickly as either the \n     President-Elect or resolution suggests it ought to in taking \n     final action upon his nominations. I also understand that \n     Presidents-Elect's nominees sometimes run into troubles in \n     confirmation proceedings, and there is no way to prevent at \n     least some impasses from occurring. But your resolution does \n     not require either the President or the Senate to do anything \n     in particular; it merely expresses a noble ideal shared by \n     those voting for it.\n       I believe that this resolution, like your proposed \n     constitutional amendment S.J. Res. 23, should be commended \n     for its non-partisanship. I share your hope for a smooth \n     transition and continuity of the government for whoever wins \n     this November.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Michael J. Gerhardt,\n                                Arthur B. Hanson Professor of Law.\n\n\n                             Florida International University,\n\n                                         Miami, FL, July 22, 2004.\n     Hon. John C. Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn:  I write in support of your Sense-of-\n     Senate Resolution, proposing a new informal practice for \n     nominating and confirming Cabinet officials when the White \n     House changes party hands. The Resolution urges an outgoing \n     President to nominate, and the new Senate to hold hearings \n     and confirm, some or all of the President-elect's Cabinet \n     prior to the January 20 Inauguration.\n       Thomas Jefferson's ascension to the presidency has been \n     labeled the Revolution of 1800 in part because it marked one \n     of the first peaceful and orderly transfers of executive \n     power. The continued peaceful and orderly transfer of \n     executive power between political parties and ideologies has \n     become a hallmark of the American constitutional order.\n       However, the Inauguration ceremony that attends this \n     orderly transfer of power, with leaders of all three branches \n     of the federal government present, marks one of two periods \n     in which presidential succession and continuity is uniquely \n     vulnerable to terrorist attack. The other vulnerable period \n     is when the President addresses a Joint Session of Congress. \n     And the safety valve used then--having one person in the line \n     of presidential succession, whether the Vice President or a \n     Cabinet member, outside of Washington--is not available in \n     the Inauguration scenario. The only people in the line of \n     presidential succession not present at the January 20 \n     ceremony are Cabinet Secretaries (or perhaps only deputies \n     acting as secretary) remaining from the outgoing \n     administration. It would be inconsistent with the expressed \n     will of the People if a terrorist event on January 20, 2004 \n     left the nation (only to use the next possible example of \n     this scenario) not with four years of a President Kerry and \n     Vice President Edwards, but with four years of Acting \n     President Rumsfeld.\n       The proposal addresses this problem by ensuring that the \n     Cabinet members in the line of succession during the handover \n     of power on noon on January 20 will be the hand-picked policy \n     surrogates of the incoming President, those who had been \n     chosen to help the new President exercise executive power and \n     represent the national electoral constituency. Should tragedy \n     strike the Inauguration, the executive branch that emerges \n     conforms politically and ideologically with the public will \n     expressed the previous November. The acting president would \n     be of the same political party and policy commitments as the \n     person just chosen by the People through the Electoral \n     College.\n       I emphasize several aspects of the proposed practice. \n     First, it urges the Senate to hold hearings and floor votes \n     ``to the extent feasible.'' This practice does not short-\n     circuit the Senate's advice-and-consent role or rigorous \n     vetting of the President-elect's Cabinet. It commands that \n     the Senate take best efforts in the two-plus weeks between \n     January 3 and Inauguration Day to confirm the new Cabinet, \n     particularly some or all of the high-profile positions at the \n     top of the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, \n     and Homeland Security. Second, it urges the outgoing \n     President to sign and deliver Commissions to the new \n     Secretaries on the morning of January 20, prior to the \n     ceremony. Until that point, the lame-duck President still \n     acts in the event of emergencies with the counsel of his own \n     Cabinet.\n       Finally, the Resolution must be considered in light of the \n     Presidential Succession Act of 2004, S. 2073, 108th Cong. \n     (2004), which (properly, both as a constitutional and policy \n     matter) removes legislative officers from the line of \n     presidential succession. The practice created by the \n     Resolution, in connection with the proposed changes to the \n     succession statute, thus provides the only way to ensure a \n     popularly and politically justifiable method of presidential \n     succession in the event of an Inauguration Day tragedy.\n       This informal practice benefits both political parties and \n     the American People as a whole, ensuring a smooth transition \n     whenever executive power transfers between parties. In fact, \n     the partisan cooperation inherent in the practice (an \n     outgoing President of one party nominating the policy support \n     of his successor) may ease the political rancor in the wake \n     of a heated election. This plan deserves the support of both \n     parties and should be passed.\n       Thank you for your time. Best of luck in your efforts.\n           Cordially,\n                                             Howard M.

Con. Res. 132\n\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton helped found and shape the \n     United States by dedicating his life to serve distinguished \n     careers as an American revolutionary soldier and statesman;\n       Whereas in 1772, Alexander Hamilton arrived in New York as \n     a student from the West Indian Island of Nevis;\n       Whereas in 1781, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Hamilton of \n     the Continental Army led a regiment of New York troops in the \n     Battle of Yorktown, the decisive and final major battle in \n     the Revolutionary War;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton served as a strong voice in the \n     Continental Congress and as an influential force as a New \n     York Delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton joined James Madison and John \n     Jay to write a majority of the Federalist Papers that urged \n     the people of New York to ratify the Constitution;\n       Whereas from 1789 to 1795, Alexander Hamilton served in \n     President George Washington's Administration as the first \n     Secretary of the Treasury and established the first Bank of \n     the United States to manage trade and finance;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton's innovative mind created public \n     credit, a circulating medium, and the financial framework of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton proposed the creation of the \n     Revenue Marines, today known as the Coast Guard, a branch of \n     the military that Congress created to secure the revenue of \n     the United States against contraband;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton exercised his vision for the \n     United States to establish a strong domestic manufacturing \n     base; and\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton is known as the ``Father of \n     Paterson'' for his championing of the Society for \n     Establishing Useful Manufactures (SUM), a group that founded \n     Paterson, New Jersey in 1791, and established it as one of \n     the first industrial centers of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress affirms its support for preserving \n     the image of Alexander Hamilton on the face of $10 Federal \n     reserve notes because of his standing as one of the United \n     States most influential founding fathers.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate \nconcurrent resolution which affirms the support of Congress for \npreserving the image of Alexander Hamilton on the $10 bill. Alexander \nHamilton is a Founding Father of our Nation. He was a Lieutenant \nColonel in the Revolutionary War, a voice in the Continental\n\n[[Page S8775]]\n\nCongress, and a delegate to the Constitutional Convention. He authored \nmore than 50 of the 85 ``Federalist Papers.'' He organized the Revenue \nMarines, known today as the Coast Guard, and played a crucial role in \nthe creation of the U.S. Navy. And Alexander Hamilton is the creator of \none of America's first industrial and manufacturing centers, in \nPaterson, NJ.\n  Alexander Hamilton was also America's first Secretary of the Treasury \nand the founder of the first United States Bank. He is responsible for \nthe financial system that our country maintains today. He created the \nfirst bank, the first tax system, the first budget, and a strong \ncurrency. He had a vision for establishing the economic viability of \nour fledgling country based on banking, investment, manufacturing, \nindustry, and commerce. We are an economic superpower and a model for \nthe rest of the world in large part because of Alexander Hamilton.\n  When we look to the Founding Fathers who played significant roles in \nthe formation of America, we see that among them, George Washington has \na monument in our Nation's Capital, and his image is on the $1 bill and \nthe quarter deservedly so. Thomas Jefferson also has an impressive \nmemorial in Washington, the main building of the Library of Congress is \nnamed after him, and his image is on the $2 bill and the nickel--again, \ndeservedly so. Alexander Hamilton's image is on the $10 bill--and it \nshould remain on the $10 bill. There is perhaps no other American more \nresponsible for the fact that we have a $10 bill.\n  Of course, Washington and Jefferson were our first and third \nPresidents. Many of our other Presidents have been or will be \nappropriately memorialized in some fashion. For instance, our 40th \nPresident, Ronald Reagan, has had Washington National Airport and the \nsecond largest Federal building in the country, only the Pentagon is \nbigger, named after him. The headquarters of the Central Intelligence \nAgency at Langley, VA, has been named after our 41st President, George \nH. W. Bush. One of the four office buildings for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives has been named after our 38th President, Gerald Ford. \nAnd the Old Executive Office Building--right next to the White House--\nhas been named after our 34th President, Dwight Eisenhower.\n  We stand in a Senate Chamber steeped in history; in a country quite \nconscious and proud of its birth. We revere those individuals such as \nWashington, Jefferson, and Hamilton who were present at the creation of \nour great Nation and helped to establish the democracy we enjoy as a \nbirthright. It is our duty to uphold their legacy and preserve their \nimage. Alexander Hamilton played an instrumental role in our triumph in \nthe Revolutionary War, the birth of our democracy, and the \nestablishment of our financial system. His image must, at the very \nleast, remain on the $10 bill. There have been many Presidents, and \nthere will be many more. But there will be no more Founding Fathers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 133--DECLARING GENOCIDE IN DARFUR, SUDAN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Levin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. \nMikulski, Mrs. Dole, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Leahy, \nMr. Byrd, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Smith) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 133\n\n       Whereas Article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (signed at Paris on \n     December 9, 1948) states that ``the Contracting Parties \n     confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or \n     in time of war, is a crime under international law which they \n     undertake to prevent and to punish'';\n       Whereas Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide declares that ``in the \n     present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts \n     committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a \n     national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) \n     killing members of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or \n     mental harm to members of the group; (c) deliberately \n     inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to \n     bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) \n     imposing measures intended to prevent births within the \n     group; and (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to \n     another group'';\n       Whereas Article 3 of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide affirms that ``[the] \n     following acts shall be punishable: (a) genocide; (b) \n     conspiracy to commit genocide; (c) direct and public \n     incitement to commit genocide; (d) attempt to committed \n     genocide; and (e) complicit in genocide'';\n       Whereas in Darfur, Sudan, an estimated 30,000 innocent \n     civilians have been brutally murdered, more than 130,000 \n     people have been forced from their homes and have fled to \n     neighboring Chad, and more than 1,000,000 people have been \n     internally displaced; and\n       Whereas in March 2004 the United Nations Resident \n     Humanitarian Coordinator stated: ``[T]he war in Darfur \n     started off in a small way last year but it has progressively \n     gotten worse. A predominant feature of this is that the brunt \n     is being borne by civilians. This includes vulnerable women \n     and children . . . The violence in Darfur appears to be \n     particularly directed at a specific group based on their \n     ethnic identity and appears to be systemized.'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) declares that the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, \n     Sudan, are genocide;\n       (2) reminds the Contracting Parties to the Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide \n     (signed at Paris on December 9, 1948), particularly the \n     Government of Sudan, of their legal obligations under the \n     Convention;\n       (3) declares that the Government of Sudan, as a Contracting \n     Party, has violated the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;\n       (4) deplores the failure of the United Nations Human Rights \n     Commission to take appropriate action with respect to the \n     crisis in Darfur, Sudan, particularly the failure by the \n     Commission to support United States-sponsored efforts to \n     strongly condemn gross human rights violations committed in \n     Darfur, and calls upon the United Nations and the United \n     Nations Secretary General to assert leadership by calling the \n     atrocities being committed in Darfur by their rightful name: \n     ``genocide'';\n       (5) calls on the member states of the United Nations, \n     particularly member states from the African Union, the Arab \n     League, and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, to \n     undertake measures to prevent the genocide in Darfur, Sudan, \n     from escalating further, including the imposition of targeted \n     means against those responsible for the atrocities;\n       (6) commends the Administration's leadership in seeking a \n     peaceful resolution to the conflict in Darfur, Sudan, and in \n     addressing the ensuing humanitarian crisis, including the \n     visit of Secretary of State Colin Powell to Darfur in June \n     2004 to engage directly in efforts to end the genocide, and \n     the provision of nearly $140,000,000 to date in bilateral \n     humanitarian assistance through the United States Agency for \n     International Development;\n       (7) commends the President for appointing former Senator \n     John Danforth as Envoy for Peace in Sudan on September 6, \n     2001, and further commends the appointment of Senator \n     Danforth as United States Ambassador to the United Nations;\n       (8) calls on the Administration to continue to lead an \n     international effort to stop genocide in Darfur, Sudan;\n       (9) calls on the Administration to impose targeted means, \n     including visa bans and the freezing of assets, against \n     officials and other individuals of the Government of Sudan, \n     as well as Janjaweed militia commanders, who are responsible \n     for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur, Sudan; \n     and\n       (10) calls on the United States Agency for International \n     Development to establish a Darfur Resettlement, \n     Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction Fund so that those \n     individuals driven off their land may return and begin to \n     rebuild their communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 134--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n        THAT THE PARTHENON MARBLES SHOULD BE RETURNED TO GREECE\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Sarbanes) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con Res. 134\n\n       Whereas the Parthenon was built on the hill of the \n     Acropolis in Athens, Greece in the mid-fifth century B.C. \n     under the direction of the Athenian statesman Pericles and \n     the design of the sculptor Phidias.\n       Whereas the Parthenon is the ultimate expression of the \n     artistic genius of Greece, the preeminent symbol of the Greek \n     cultural heritage--its art, architecture, and democracy--and \n     of the contributions that modern Greeks and their forefathers \n     have made to civilization;\n       Whereas the Parthenon has served as a place of worship for \n     ancient Greeks, Orthodox Christians, Roman Catholics, and \n     Muslims;\n       Whereas the Parthenon has been adopted by imitation by the \n     United States in many preeminent public buildings, including \n     the Lincoln Memorial;\n\n[[Page S8776]]\n\n       Whereas over 100 pieces of the Parthenon's sculptures--now \n     known as the Parthenon Marbles--were removed from the \n     Parthenon under questionable circumstances between 1801 and \n     1816 by Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, while Greece was \n     still under Ottoman rule;\n       Whereas the removal of the Parthenon Marbles, including \n     their perilous voyage to Great Britain and their careless \n     storage there for many years greatly endangered the Marbles;\n       Whereas the Parthenon Marbles were removed to grace the \n     private home of Lord Elgin, who transferred the Marbles to \n     the British Museum only after severe personal economic \n     misfortunes;\n       Whereas the sculptures of the Parthenon were designed as an \n     integral part of the structure of the Parthenon temple; the \n     carvings of the friezes, pediments, and metopes are not \n     merely statuary, movable decorative art, but are integral \n     parts of the Parthenon, which can best be appreciated if all \n     the Parthenon Marbles are reunified.\n       Whereas the Parthenon is a universal symbol of culture, \n     democracy, and freedom, making the Parthenon Marbles of \n     concern not only to Greece but to all the world;\n       Whereas, since obtaining independence in 1830, Greece has \n     sought the return of the Parthenon Marbles;\n       Whereas the return of the Parthenon Marbles would be a \n     profound demonstration by the United Kingdom of its \n     appreciation and respect for the Parthenon and classical art;\n       Whereas returning the Parthenon Marbles to Greece would be \n     a gesture of good will on the part of the British Parliament, \n     and would set no legal precedent, nor in any other way affect \n     the ownership or disposition of other objects in museums in \n     the United States or around the world;\n       Whereas the United Kingdom should return the Parthenon \n     Marbles in recognition that the Parthenon is part of the \n     cultural heritage of the entire world and, as such, should be \n     made whole;\n       Whereas Greece would provide care for the Parthenon Marbles \n     equal or superior to the care provided by the British Museum, \n     especially considering the irreparable harm caused by \n     attempts by the museum to remove the original color and \n     patina of the Marbles with abrasive cleaners;\n       Whereas Greece is constructing a new, permanent museum in \n     full view of the Acropolis to house all the Marbles, \n     protected from the elements in a safe, climate-controlled \n     environment;\n       Whereas Greece has pledged to work with the British \n     government to negotiate mutually agreeable conditions for the \n     return of the Parthenon Marbles;\n       Where the people of Greece have a greater, ancient bond to \n     the Parthenon Marbles, which were in Greece for over 2,200 \n     years of the over 2,430-year history of the Parthenon;\n       Whereas the British people support the return of the \n     Parthenon Marbles, as reflected in several recent polls;\n       Whereas a resolution signed by a majority of members of the \n     European Parliament urged the British government to return \n     the Parthenon Marbles to their natural setting in Greece;\n       Whereas the British House of Commons Select Committee on \n     Culture, Media and Sport is to be commended for examining the \n     issue of the disposition of the Parthenon Marbles in hearings \n     held in 2000; and\n       Whereas Athens, Greece--birthplace of the Olympics--was \n     selected as the host city of the Olympics Games in 2004, and \n     the Parthenon Marbles should returned to their home in Athens \n     in 2004;

Mr. FRIST (for Mr. Gregg) submitted an amendment intended to \nbe proposed by him to the bill S. 720, to amend title IX of the Public \nHealth Service Act to provide for the improvement of patient safety and \nto reduce the incidence of events that adversely effect patient safety; \nwhich was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Patient Safety and Quality \n     Improvement Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1999, the Institute of Medicine released a report \n     entitled To Err is Human that described medical errors as the \n     eighth leading cause of death in the United States, with as \n     many as 98,000 people dying as a result of medical errors \n     each year.\n       (2) To address these deaths and injuries due to medical \n     errors, the health care system must identify and learn from \n     such errors so that systems of care can be improved.\n       (3) In their report, the Institute of Medicine called on \n     Congress to provide legal protections with respect to \n     information reported for the purposes of quality improvement \n     and patient safety.\n       (4) The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee of \n     the Senate held 4 hearings in the 106th Congress and 1 \n     hearing in the 107th Congress on patient safety where experts \n     in the field supported the recommendation of the Institute of \n     Medicine for congressional action.\n       (5) Myriad public and private patient safety initiatives \n     have begun. The Quality Interagency Coordination Taskforce \n     has recommended steps to improve patient safety that may be \n     taken by each Federal agency\n\n[[Page S8777]]\n\n     involved in health care and activities relating to these \n     steps are ongoing.\n       (6) The research on patient safety unequivocally calls for \n     a learning environment, rather than a punitive environment, \n     in order to improve patient safety.\n       (7) Voluntary data gathering systems are more supportive \n     than mandatory systems in creating the learning environment \n     referred to in paragraph (6) as stated in the Institute of \n     Medicine's report.\n       (8) Promising patient safety reporting systems have been \n     established throughout the United States and the best ways to \n     structure and use these systems are currently being \n     determined, largely through projects funded by the Agency for \n     Healthcare Research and Quality.\n       (9) Many organizations currently collecting patient safety \n     data have expressed a need for legal protections that will \n     allow them to review protected information and collaborate in \n     the development and implementation of patient safety \n     improvement strategies. Currently, the State peer review \n     protections are inadequate to allow the sharing of \n     information to promote patient safety.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) encourage a culture of safety and quality in the United \n     States health care system by providing for legal protection \n     of information reported voluntarily for the purposes of \n     quality improvement and patient safety; and\n       (2) ensure accountability by raising standards and \n     expectations for continuous quality improvements in patient \n     safety.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       Title IX of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 299 et \n     seq.) is amended--\n       (1) in section 912(c), by inserting ``, in accordance with \n     part C,'' after ``The Director shall'';\n       (2) by redesignating part C as part D;\n       (3) by redesignating sections 921 through 928, as sections \n     931 through 938, respectively;\n       (4) in 934(d) (as so redesignated), by striking the second \n     sentence and inserting the following: ``Penalties provided \n     for under this section shall be imposed and collected by the \n     Secretary using the administrative and procedural processes \n     used to impose and collect civil money penalties under \n     section 1128A of the Social Security Act (other than \n     subsections (a) and (b), the second sentence of subsection \n     (f), and subsections (i), (m), and (n)), unless the Secretary \n     determines that a modification of procedures would be more \n     suitable or reasonable to carry out this subsection and \n     provides for such modification by regulation.'';\n       (5) in section 938(1) (as so redesignated), by striking \n     ``921'' and inserting ``931''; and\n       (6) by inserting after part B the following:\n\n                  ``PART C--PATIENT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT\n\n     ``SEC. 921.

Mr. FRIST (for Mr. Kyl (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nLugar, and Mr. Biden)) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution S. Con. Res. 81, expressing the concern of Congress over \nIran's development of the means to produce nuclear weapons; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following:\n     That Congress--\n       (1) condemns--\n       (A) the failure of the Government of Iran for nearly two \n     decades to report material, facilities, and activities to the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in contravention of \n     its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement; and\n       (B) Iran's continuing deceptions and falsehoods to the IAEA \n     and the international community about its nuclear programs \n     and activities;\n       (2) concurs with the conclusion reached in the Department \n     of State's Annual Report on Adherence to and Compliance with \n     Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Agreements and Commitments \n     that Iran is pursuing a program to develop nuclear weapons;\n       (3) urges the President to provide to the IAEA whatever \n     financial, material, or intelligence resources are necessary \n     to enable the IAEA it to fully investigate Iran's nuclear \n     activities;\n       (4) calls upon all states party to the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, \n     and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 \n     (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the ``Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty''), including the United States, to \n     use appropriate means to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear \n     weapons, including the suspension of all nuclear and other \n     cooperation with Iran, including the provision of dual use \n     items, until Iran fully implements the Additional Protocol to \n     its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA (hereafter in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``Additional Protocol'') and is \n     clearly in compliance with its obligations under the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty;\n       (5) declares that Iran, through its many breaches during \n     the past 18 years of its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA, \n     has forfeited the right to be trusted with the development of \n     a full nuclear fuel cycle, especially with uranium conversion \n     and enrichment and plutonium reprocessing technology, \n     equipment, and facilities;\n       (6) declares that the revelations of Iran's nondisclosure \n     of additional enrichment and nuclear-weapons-applicable \n     research activities, as detailed in the reports of February \n     24, 2004, and June 1, 2004, by the Director General of the \n     IAEA, together with the statement by the Government of Iran \n     that it will not disclose other research programs, constitute \n     ample evidence of Iran's continuing policy of noncompliance \n     with the letter and spirit of its obligations under its \n     Safeguards Agreement and the Additional Protocol;\n       (7) recognizes, in contrast with Iran's behavior, the \n     positive example of Libya's decision to renounce and \n     dismantle its nuclear weapons program and to provide full, \n     complete, and transparent disclosure of all its nuclear \n     activities, which has enabled the IAEA to rapidly understand \n     and verify with high confidence the extent and scope of \n     Libya's program and has led to the establishment of direct \n     diplomatic relations with Libya, the gradual lifting of U.S. \n     sanctions, and the establishment of cooperative programs \n     between the United States and Libya;\n       (8) foresees a similar future for Iran, once that country \n     renounces and dismantles its\n\n[[Page S8780]]\n\n     weapons of mass destruction and long-range ballistic missile \n     programs and renounces its support for international \n     terrorist organizations;\n       (9) notes the assistance that the United States has \n     provided to southeastern Iran since the Bam earthquake on \n     December 26, 2003;\n       (10) calls upon Iran to immediately and permanently cease \n     all efforts to acquire sensitive nuclear fuel cycle \n     capabilities, in particular all uranium enrichment \n     activities, including importing, manufacturing, and testing \n     of related equipment;\n       (11) urges Iran to comply with its international \n     commitments and to rescind its decisions--\n       (A) to manufacture and construct centrifuges;\n       (B) to produce feed material that could be used in those \n     centrifuges; and\n       (C) to construct a heavy-water moderated reactor that could \n     be used for plutonium production;\n       (12) calls upon Iran to honor its stated commitments and \n     legal obligations--\n       (A) to grant IAEA inspectors prompt, full and unrestricted \n     access;\n       (B) to cooperate fully with the investigation of its \n     nuclear activities; and\n       (C) to demonstrate a new openness and honesty about all its \n     nuclear programs;\n       (13) welcomes the June 26, 2004, declaration at the United \n     States-E.U. Summit in Shannon, Ireland, in which the European \n     Union and the United States pledged to implement United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, which identifies \n     actions states should take--\n       (A) to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction;\n       (B) to establish new measures in accordance with the G8 \n     Action Plan on Non-Proliferation, announced June 9, 2004, at \n     the G8 Summit in Sea Island, Georgia; and\n       (C) to preserve the integrity of the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty;\n       (14) urges close cooperation between the United States and \n     the European Union in accordance with the reaffirmation in \n     their June 26, 2004, declaration of ``the IAEA Board of \n     Governors' Iran resolutions, which deplore Iran's \n     insufficient cooperation and call on Iran, inter alia, to \n     cooperate fully and in a timely and proactive manner, with \n     IAEA investigation of its nuclear programme and suspend all \n     enrichment-related and reprocessing activities'';\n       (15) calls upon the members of the European Union not to \n     resume discussions with Iran on multilateral trade agreements \n     until the IAEA Director General reports that Iran has \n     suspended all nuclear weapons development activity, and not \n     to implement such trade agreements until Iran has verifiably \n     and permanently ceased all nuclear weapons development \n     activity, including a permanent cessation of uranium \n     conversion and enrichment and plutonium reprocessing \n     activities;\n       (16) further calls upon the members of the European Union \n     to undertake such additional measures, including imposing \n     sanctions and sponsoring an IAEA Board of Governors report on \n     non-compliance pursuant to Article XII of the IAEA Statute, \n     as may be necessary to persuade Iran to cease all nuclear \n     weapons development activity and to fulfill its obligations \n     and commitments to the IAEA;\n       (17) in light of ongoing revelations of the noncompliance \n     of the Government of Iran regarding its obligations under the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and pledges to the IAEA, and \n     in light of the consequent and ongoing questions and concerns \n     of the IAEA, the United States, and the international \n     community regarding Iran's nuclear activities--\n       (A) urges Japan to ensure that Japanese commercial entities \n     not proceed with the development of Iran's Azadegan oil \n     field;\n       (B) urges France and Malaysia to ensure that French and \n     Malaysian commercial entities not proceed with their \n     agreement for further cooperation in expanding Iran's liquid \n     natural gas production field;\n       (C) calls on all countries to intercede with their \n     commercial entities to ensure that these entities refrain \n     from or suspend all investment and investment-related \n     activities that support Iran's energy industry; and\n       (D) calls on Member States of the United Nations to prevent \n     the Government of Iran from continuing to pursue and develop \n     programs or facilities that could be used in a nuclear \n     weapons program and to end all nuclear cooperation with Iran, \n     including the provision of dual use items, until Iran \n     complies fully with its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA \n     and its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty;\n       (18) deplores any effort by any country to provide nuclear \n     power-related assistance to Iran at this time, and calls upon \n     Russia--\n       (A) to use all appropriate means to urge Iran to meet fully \n     its obligations and commitments to the IAEA; and\n       (B) to suspend nuclear cooperation with Iran and not \n     conclude a nuclear fuel supply agreement for the Bushehr \n     reactor that would enter into force before Iran has \n     verifiably and permanently ceased all nuclear weapons \n     development activity, including a permanent cessation of \n     uranium conversion and enrichment and plutonium reprocessing \n     activities;\n       (19) calls upon the governments of the countries whose \n     nationals and corporations are implicated in assisting \n     Iranian nuclear activities, including Pakistan, Malaysia, the \n     United Arab Emirates, and Germany--\n       (A) to fully investigate such assistance;\n       (B) to grant the IAEA all necessary access to individuals, \n     sites, and information related to the investigations;\n       (C) to take all appropriate action against such nationals \n     and corporations under the laws of those countries;

and\n       (B) as appropriate, to specify areas in which Iran \n     continues to be in noncompliance with its agreements with the \n     IAEA or with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or in \n     which its compliance is uncertain;\n       (21) urges the United Nations Security Council, bearing in \n     mind its decision in Resolution 1540 that the ``proliferation \n     of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as their \n     means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international \n     peace and security,'' to consider measures necessary--\n       (A) to support the inspection efforts by the IAEA; and\n       (B) to prevent Iran from further engaging in clandestine \n     nuclear activities;\n       (22) further urges the United Nations Security Council, \n     immediately upon receiving any report from the IAEA regarding \n     the continuing non-compliance of Iran with its obligations, \n     to address the threat to international peace and security \n     posed by Iran's nuclear weapons program and take such action \n     as may be necessary under Article 39, Article 40, and Article \n     41 of the Charter of the United Nations;\n       (23) urges the United Nations Security Council, the Nuclear \n     Suppliers Group, the Zangger Committee, and other relevant \n     international entities to declare that non-nuclear-weapon \n     states under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that commit \n     significant violations of their safeguards agreements \n     regarding uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing or \n     engage in activities intended to support a military nuclear \n     program thereby forfeit their right under the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty to engage in nuclear fuel-cycle \n     activities;\n       (24) further urges the United Nations Security Council, the \n     Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Zangger Committee, the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency, other relevant \n     international entities, and all states party to the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty, including the United States, to \n     seek consensus, no later than the 2005 Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in Geneva, \n     Switzerland, on the best and most equitable means to limit \n     the right of non-nuclear weapons states to engage in those \n     nuclear fuel cycle activities that could contribute to the \n     development of nuclear weapons, while providing those states \n     assured and affordable access to--\n       (A) nuclear reactor fuel and other materials used in \n     peaceful nuclear activities; and\n       (B) spent fuel management; and\n       (25) urges the President to keep Congress fully and \n     currently informed concerning the matters addressed in this \n     resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3570. Mr. FRIST (for Mr. Kyl) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 81, expressing the concern of \nCongress over Iran's development of the means to produce nuclear \nweapons; as follows:\n\n       Whereas it is the policy of the United States to oppose, \n     and urgently to seek the agreement of other nations also to \n     oppose, any transfer to Iran of any goods or technology, \n     including dual-use goods or technology, wherever that \n     transfer could contribute to its acquiring chemical, \n     biological, or nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council decided, in \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, that ``all \n     States shall refrain from providing any form of support to \n     non-State actors that attempt to develop, acquire, \n     manufacture, possess, transport, transfer or use nuclear, \n     chemical, or biological weapons and their means of \n     delivery'';\n       Whereas the United States has imposed sanctions numerous \n     times on persons and entities transferring equipment and \n     technical data to Iran to assist its weapons of mass \n     destruction programs;\n       Whereas on January 1, 1968, Iran signed the Treaty on the \n     Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, \n     London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March \n     5, 1970 (the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'');\n       Whereas Iran, as a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty as a non-nuclear weapons state, is obligated never to \n     develop or acquire nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas Iran did not declare to the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency (IAEA) the existence of the Natanz Pilot Fuel \n     Enrichment Plant and the production-scale Fuel Enrichment \n     Facility under construction at Natanz until February 2003, \n     after the existence of the plant and facility was revealed by \n     an opposition group;\n       Whereas it is estimated that the Natanz Pilot Fuel \n     Enrichment Plant could produce\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\n     enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon every \n     year-and-a-half to two years;\n       Whereas it is estimated that the Natanz Fuel Enrichment \n     Facility could, when completed, produce enough highly \n     enriched uranium for as many as 25 to 30 nuclear weapons per \n     year;\n       Whereas, in his report of June 6, 2003, the Director \n     General of the IAEA stated that Iran had failed to meet its \n     obligations under its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA to \n     report all nuclear material imported into Iran--specifically, \n     the importation of uranium hexafluoride, uranium \n     tetrafluoride and uranium dioxide in 1991--the processing and \n     use of that material, and the facilities involved in the use \n     and processing of the material;\n       Whereas the IAEA Director General stated in the same report \n     that Iran had produced uranium metal and was building a \n     uranium metal processing facility, despite the fact that \n     neither its light water reactors nor its planned heavy water \n     reactors require uranium metal for fuel;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors urged Iran in June 2003 \n     to promptly rectify its failures to meet its obligations \n     under its Safeguards Agreement, not to introduce nuclear \n     material into the Natanz Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant, and to \n     cooperate fully with the Agency in resolving questions about \n     its nuclear activities;\n       Whereas the IAEA Director General reported to the Board of \n     Governors of the IAEA in August 2003 that Iran had failed to \n     disclose additional nuclear activities as required by its \n     Safeguards Agreement and continued to fail to resolve \n     questions about its undeclared uranium enrichment activities, \n     including those raised by the detection of two types of \n     highly enriched uranium particles at the Natanz Pilot Fuel \n     Enrichment Plant;\n       Whereas on August 19, 2003, after earlier denials, Iran \n     admitted in a letter that it had carried out uranium \n     conversion experiments in the early 1990's, experiments that \n     included bench scale preparation of uranium compounds and \n     that should have been disclosed to the IAEA in accordance \n     with its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors on September 12, 2003, \n     called on Iran to suspend all further uranium enrichment and \n     any plutonium reprocessing activities, disclose all its \n     nuclear activities, and cooperate fully with the IAEA, and to \n     sign, ratify, and fully implement the Additional Protocol \n     between Iran and the IAEA for the application of safeguards \n     (the ``Additional Protocol'') to strengthen investigation of \n     all nuclear activities within Iran, and requested all third \n     countries to cooperate closely and fully with the IAEA in \n     resolving questions about Iran's nuclear program;\n       Whereas IAEA inspectors and officials continued to confront \n     Iran with discrepancies in its explanations of its nuclear \n     activities;\n       Whereas on October 21, 2003, Iran and the Foreign Ministers \n     of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom issued a joint \n     statement in which Iran indicated that it had decided to \n     suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities as \n     defined by the IAEA;\n       Whereas the Governments of France, Germany, and the United \n     Kingdom promised a dialogue with Iran to ease Iran's access \n     to modern technologies and supplies in a range of areas once \n     certain international concerns regarding Iran are fully \n     resolved;\n       Whereas, in a subsequent letter on October 23, 2003, Iran \n     further admitted that it had tested uranium enrichment \n     centrifuges at the Kalaye Electric Company between 1998 and \n     2002 using its previously undeclared imported uranium \n     hexafluoride;\n       Whereas in that same letter, Iran admitted that it had a \n     laser uranium enrichment program, in which it used 30 \n     kilograms of uranium not previously declared to the IAEA, \n     another violation of its Safeguards Agreement;\n       Whereas Iran indicated initially that its laser enrichment \n     program had achieved uranium enrichment levels of slightly \n     more than 3 percent, but the Director General's report of \n     June 1, 2004, states that the IAEA later learned that Iran \n     ``had been able to achieve average enrichment levels of 8 \n     percent to 9 percent, with some samples of up to \n     approximately 15 percent'';\n       Whereas the June 1, 2004, report states also that Iran's \n     declaration of October 21, 2003, failed to include \n     information that should have been provided, including the \n     fact that ``some samples from'' the laser uranium enrichment \n     project ``had been sent for assessment to the supplier's \n     laboratory'';\n       Whereas, in its letter of October 23, 2003, Iran also \n     admitted that it had irradiated 7 kilograms of uranium \n     dioxide targets and reprocessed them to extract plutonium, \n     another violation of its legal obligation to disclose such \n     activities under its Safeguards Agreement;\n       Whereas Iran told the IAEA on November 10, 2003, that it \n     would sign and ratify the Additional Protocol and would act \n     in accordance with the Additional Protocol pending its entry-\n     into-force;\n       Whereas, on November 10, 2003, Iran further informed the \n     IAEA Director General that it had decided to suspend all \n     enrichment and reprocessing activities in Iran, not to \n     produce feed material for enrichment processes, and not to \n     import enrichment related items;\n       Whereas the IAEA, through its investigative and forensic \n     activities in Iran and elsewhere, has uncovered and \n     confronted Iran about numerous lies concerning its nuclear \n     activities;\n       Whereas the Director General of the IAEA reported to the \n     IAEA Board of Governors on November 10, 2003, that Iran has \n     concealed many aspects of its nuclear activities from the \n     IAEA, in breach of its obligations under its Safeguards \n     Agreement;\n       Whereas, despite Iran's subsequent pledge to, once again, \n     fully disclose all of its nuclear activities to the IAEA, the \n     Director General of the IAEA, in a February 24, 2004, report, \n     found that Iran continued to engage in deception regarding \n     its nuclear activities, including failing to disclose a more \n     sophisticated enrichment program using more advanced \n     enrichment centrifuge technology imported from foreign \n     sources, and providing incomplete and unsupported \n     explanations about experiments to create a highly toxic \n     isotope of polonium that outside experts say is useful as a \n     neutron initiator in nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas the Director General's reports of February 24, \n     2001, and June 1, 2004, stated that environmental samples \n     from one room at the Kalaye Electric Company workshop and \n     from equipment that had been present in that workshop showed \n     more than trace quantities of uranium enriched to 36 percent \n     U-235, despite finding only negligible traces of this on \n     imported centrifuge components, and that the types of uranium \n     contamination at that workshop differed from those found at \n     Natanz, which would appear to contradict Iran's assertion \n     that the source of contamination at both sites is imported \n     centrifuge components and perhaps also its assertion that it \n     has not enriched uranium to more than 1.2 percent U-235 using \n     centrifuge technology;\n       Whereas the Director General stated in the June 1, 2004, \n     report, that ``the contamination is different on domestic and \n     imported centrifuges,'' that ``it is unlikely'' that the 36 \n     percent U-235 contamination was due to components acquired \n     from Iran's principal supplier country, and that ``important \n     information about the P-2 centrifuge programme has frequently \n     required repeated requests, and in some cases continues to \n     involve changing or contradictory information'';\n       Whereas these deceptions by Iran are continuing violations \n     of Iran's Safeguards Agreement and of Iran's previous \n     assurances to the IAEA and the international community of \n     full transparency;\n       Whereas despite Iran's commitment to the IAEA and to \n     France, Germany, and the United Kingdom that it would suspend \n     uranium enrichment activities, it has repeatedly emphasized \n     that this suspension is temporary and continued to \n     manufacture and, until April 2004, to import, uranium \n     enrichment centrifuge parts and equipment, allowing it to \n     resume and expand its uranium enrichment activities whenever \n     it chooses;\n       Whereas the statements on February 25, 2004, of Hassan \n     Rowhani, Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council \n     of Iran, that Iran was not required to reveal to the IAEA its \n     research into more sophisticated ``P2'' uranium enrichment \n     centrifuges, and that Iran has other projects which it has no \n     intention of declaring to the IAEA, are contrary to--\n       (1) Iran's commitment to the IAEA in an October 16, 2003, \n     letter from the Vice President of Iran and the President of \n     Iran's Atomic Energy Organization that Iran would present a \n     ``full picture of its nuclear activities'' and ``full \n     transparency'';\n       (2) Iran's commitment to the foreign ministers of the \n     United Kingdom, France, and Germany of October 21, 2003, to \n     full transparency and to resolve all outstanding issues; and\n       (3) its statement to the IAEA's Board of Governors of \n     September 12, 2003, of its commitment to full transparency \n     and to ``leave no stone unturned'' to assure the IAEA of its \n     peaceful objectives;\n       Whereas Libya received enrichment equipment and technology, \n     and a nuclear weapons design, from the same nuclear black \n     market that Iran has used, raising the question of whether \n     Iran, as well, received a nuclear weapon design that it has \n     refused to reveal to international inspectors;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation has announced that it will \n     soon conclude an agreement to supply Iran with enriched \n     nuclear fuel for the Bushehr nuclear power reactor, which, if \n     implemented, would undercut the international effort to \n     persuade Iran to cease its nuclear weapons development \n     program;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution of March \n     13, 2004, which was adopted unanimously, noted with ``serious \n     concern that the declarations made by Iran in October 2003 \n     did not amount to the complete and final picture of Iran's \n     past and present nuclear programme considered essential by \n     the Board's November 2003 resolution,'' and also noted that \n     the IAEA has discovered that Iran had hidden more advanced \n     centrifuge associated research, manufacturing, and testing \n     activities, two mass spectrometers used in the laser \n     enrichment program, and designs for hot cells to handle \n     highly radioactive materials;\n       Whereas the same resolution also noted ``with equal concern \n     that Iran has not resolved all questions regarding the \n     development of its enrichment technology to its current \n     extent, and that a number of other questions remain \n     unresolved, including the sources of all HEU contamination in \n     Iran; the location, extent and nature of work undertaken on \n     the basis of the advanced centrifuge design; the nature, \n     extent, and purpose of activities involving the planned\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\n     heavy-water reactor; and evidence to support claims regarding \n     the purpose of polonium-210 experiments'';\n       Whereas Hassan Rowhani on March 13, 2004, declared that \n     IAEA inspections would be indefinitely suspended as a protest \n     against the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution of March 13, \n     2004, and while Iran subsequently agreed to readmit \n     inspectors to one site by March 29, 2004, and to others in \n     mid-April, 2004, including four workshops belonging to the \n     Defence Industries Organization, this suspension calls into \n     serious question Iran's commitment to full transparency about \n     its nuclear activities;\n       Whereas Iran informed the IAEA on April 29, 2004, of its \n     intent to produce uranium hexafluoride in amounts that the \n     IAEA concluded would constitute production of feed material \n     for uranium centrifuges and wrote in a letter of May 18, \n     2004, that its suspension of all uranium enrichment \n     activities ``does not include suspension of production of \n     UF6,'' which contradicted assurances provided in its letter \n     of November 10, 2003;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution of June 18, \n     2004, which was also adopted unanimously, ``deplores'' the \n     fact that ``Iran's cooperation has not been as full, timely \n     and proactive as it should have been'' and ``underlines that, \n     with the passage of time, it is becoming ever more important \n     that Iran work proactively to enable the Agency to gain a \n     full understanding of Iran's enrichment programme by \n     providing all relevant information, as well as by providing \n     prompt access to all relevant places, data and persons'';\n       Whereas the same resolution also expresses regret that \n     Iran's suspension ``commitments have not been comprehensively \n     implemented and calls on Iran immediately to correct all \n     remaining shortcomings'';\n       Whereas the same resolution also calls on Iran, as further \n     confidence-building measures, voluntarily to reconsider its \n     decision to begin production testing at the Uranium \n     Conversion Facility and its decision to start construction of \n     a research reactor moderated by heavy water, as the reversal \n     of those decisions would make it easier for Iran to restore \n     international confidence undermined by past reports of \n     undeclared nuclear activities in Iran;\n       Whereas Iran then announced its decision to resume \n     production of centrifuge components, notwithstanding both the \n     IAEA Board of Governors resolution of September 12, 2003, \n     which called on Iran ``to suspend all further uranium \n     enrichment-related activities,'' and Iran's voluntary \n     suspension of all uranium enrichment activities pursuant to \n     its agreement of October 21, 2003, with the foreign ministers \n     of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany;\n       Whereas Iran's pattern of deception and concealment in \n     dealing with the IAEA, the Foreign Ministers of France, \n     Germany, and the United Kingdom, and the international \n     community, its receipt from other countries of the means to \n     enrich uranium, its use of sources who provided a nuclear \n     weapon design to another country, its production of \n     centrifuge components at Defence Industries Organization \n     workshops, and its repeated breaches of its Safeguards \n     Agreement suggest strongly that Iran has also violated its \n     legal obligation under article II of the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty not to acquire or seek assistance in \n     acquiring nuclear weapons; and\n       Whereas the maintenance or construction by Iran of \n     unsafeguarded nuclear facilities or uranium enrichment or \n     reprocessing facilities will continue to endanger the \n     maintenance of international peace and security and threaten \n     United States national interests: Now, therefore, be it\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3571. Mr. FRIST (for Mr. Kyl) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 81, expressing the concern of \nCongress over Iran's development of the means to produce nuclear \nweapons; as follows:\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``Expressing the concern of \n     Congress over Iran's development of the means to produce \n     nuclear weapons.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3572. Mr. FRIST (for Mr. Kyl (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nLugar, and Mr. Biden)) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution H. Con. Res. 398, expressing the concern of Congress over \nIran's development of the means to produce nuclear weapons; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following:\n     That Congress--\n       (1) condemns--\n       (A) the failure of the Government of Iran for nearly two \n     decades to report material, facilities, and activities to the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in contravention of \n     its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement; and\n       (B) Iran's continuing deceptions and falsehoods to the IAEA \n     and the international community about its nuclear programs \n     and activities;\n       (2) concurs with the conclusion reached in the Department \n     of State's Annual Report on Adherence to and Compliance with \n     Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Agreements and Commitments \n     that Iran is pursuing a program to develop nuclear weapons;\n       (3) urges the President to provide to the IAEA whatever \n     financial, material, or intelligence resources are necessary \n     to enable the IAEA it to fully investigate Iran's nuclear \n     activities;\n       (4) calls upon all states party to the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, \n     and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 \n     (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the ``Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty''), including the United States, to \n     use appropriate means to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear \n     weapons, including the suspension of all nuclear and other \n     cooperation with Iran, including the provision of dual use \n     items, until Iran fully implements the Additional Protocol to \n     its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA (hereafter in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``Additional Protocol'') and is \n     clearly in compliance with its obligations under the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty;\n       (5) declares that Iran, through its many breaches during \n     the past 18 years of its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA, \n     has forfeited the right to be trusted with the development of \n     a full nuclear fuel cycle, especially with uranium conversion \n     and enrichment and plutonium reprocessing technology, \n     equipment, and facilities;\n       (6) declares that the revelations of Iran's nondisclosure \n     of additional enrichment and nuclear-weapons-applicable \n     research activities, as detailed in the reports of February \n     24, 2004, and June 1, 2004, by the Director General of the \n     IAEA, together with the statement by the Government of Iran \n     that it will not disclose other research programs, constitute \n     ample evidence of Iran's continuing policy of noncompliance \n     with the letter and spirit of its obligations under its \n     Safeguards Agreement and the Additional Protocol;\n       (7) recognizes, in contrast with Iran's behavior, the \n     positive example of Libya's decision to renounce and \n     dismantle its nuclear weapons program and to provide full, \n     complete, and transparent disclosure of all its nuclear \n     activities, which has enabled the IAEA to rapidly understand \n     and verify with high confidence the extent and scope of \n     Libya's program and has led to the establishment of direct \n     diplomatic relations with Libya, the gradual lifting of U.S. \n     sanctions, and the establishment of cooperative programs \n     between the United States and Libya;\n       (8) foresees a similar future for Iran, once that country \n     renounces and dismantles its weapons of mass destruction and \n     long-range ballistic missile programs and renounces its \n     support for international terrorist organizations;\n       (9) notes the assistance that the United States has \n     provided to southeastern Iran since the Bam earthquake on \n     December 26, 2003;\n       (10) calls upon Iran to immediately and permanently cease \n     all efforts to acquire sensitive nuclear fuel cycle \n     capabilities, in particular all uranium enrichment \n     activities, including importing, manufacturing, and testing \n     of related equipment;\n       (11) urges Iran to comply with its international \n     commitments and to rescind its decisions--\n       (A) to manufacture and construct centrifuges;\n       (B) to produce feed material that could be used in those \n     centrifuges; and\n       (C) to construct a heavy-water moderated reactor that could \n     be used for plutonium production;\n       (12) calls upon Iran to honor its stated commitments and \n     legal obligations--\n       (A) to grant IAEA inspectors prompt, full and unrestricted \n     access;\n       (B) to cooperate fully with the investigation of its \n     nuclear activities; and\n       (C) to demonstrate a new openness and honesty about all its \n     nuclear programs;\n       (13) welcomes the June 26, 2004, declaration at the United \n     States-E.U. Summit in Shannon, Ireland, in which the European \n     Union and the United States pledged to implement United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, which identifies \n     actions states should take--\n       (A) to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction;\n       (B) to establish new measures in accordance with the G8 \n     Action Plan on Non-Proliferation, announced June 9, 2004, at \n     the G8 Summit in Sea Island, Georgia; and\n       (C) to preserve the integrity of the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty;\n       (14) urges close cooperation between the United States and \n     the European Union in accordance with the reaffirmation in \n     their June 26, 2004, declaration of ``the IAEA Board of \n     Governors' Iran resolutions, which deplore Iran's \n     insufficient cooperation and call on Iran, inter alia, to \n     cooperate fully and in a timely and proactive manner, with \n     IAEA investigation of its nuclear programme and suspend all \n     enrichment-related and reprocessing activities'';\n       (15) calls upon the members of the European Union not to \n     resume discussions with Iran on multilateral trade agreements \n     until the IAEA Director General reports that Iran has \n     suspended all nuclear weapons development activity, and not \n     to implement such trade agreements until Iran has verifiably \n     and permanently ceased all nuclear weapons development \n     activity, including a permanent cessation of uranium \n     conversion and enrichment and plutonium reprocessing \n     activities;\n       (16) further calls upon the members of the European Union \n     to undertake such additional measures, including imposing \n     sanctions and sponsoring an IAEA Board of Governors report on \n     non-compliance pursuant to Article XII of the IAEA Statute, \n     as may be necessary to persuade Iran to cease all nuclear \n     weapons development activity and to\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\n     fulfill its obligations and commitments to the IAEA;\n       (17) in light of ongoing revelations of the noncompliance \n     of the Government of Iran regarding its obligations under the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and pledges to the IAEA, and \n     in light of the consequent and ongoing questions and concerns \n     of the IAEA, the United States, and the international \n     community regarding Iran's nuclear activities--\n       (A) urges Japan to ensure that Japanese commercial entities \n     not proceed with the development of Iran's Azadegan oil \n     field;\n       (B) urges France and Malaysia to ensure that French and \n     Malaysian commercial entities not proceed with their \n     agreement for further cooperation in expanding Iran's liquid \n     natural gas production field;\n       (C) calls on all countries to intercede with their \n     commercial entities to ensure that these entities refrain \n     from or suspend all investment and investment-related \n     activities that support Iran's energy industry; and\n       (D) calls on Member States of the United Nations to prevent \n     the Government of Iran from continuing to pursue and develop \n     programs or facilities that could be used in a nuclear \n     weapons program and to end all nuclear cooperation with Iran, \n     including the provision of dual use items, until Iran \n     complies fully with its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA \n     and its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty;\n       (18) deplores any effort by any country to provide nuclear \n     power-related assistance to Iran at this time, and calls upon \n     Russia--\n       (A) to use all appropriate means to urge Iran to meet fully \n     its obligations and commitments to the IAEA; and\n       (B) to suspend nuclear cooperation with Iran and not \n     conclude a nuclear fuel supply agreement for the Bushehr \n     reactor that would enter into force before Iran has \n     verifiably and permanently ceased all nuclear weapons \n     development activity, including a permanent cessation of \n     uranium conversion and enrichment and plutonium reprocessing \n     activities;\n       (19) calls upon the governments of the countries whose \n     nationals and corporations are implicated in assisting \n     Iranian nuclear activities, including Pakistan, Malaysia, the \n     United Arab Emirates, and Germany--\n       (A) to fully investigate such assistance;\n       (B) to grant the IAEA all necessary access to individuals, \n     sites, and information related to the investigations;\n       (C) to take all appropriate action against such nationals \n     and corporations under the laws of those countries; and\n       (D) to immediately review and rectify their export control \n     laws, regulations, and practices in order to prevent further \n     assistance to countries pursuing nuclear programs that could \n     support the development of nuclear weapons;\n       (20) urges the IAEA Board of Governors, in accordance with \n     Article XII of the IAEA Statute--\n       (A) to report to the United Nations Security Council that \n     Iran has been in noncompliance with its agreements with the \n     IAEA; and\n       (B) as appropriate, to specify areas in which Iran \n     continues to be in noncompliance with its agreements with the \n     IAEA or with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or in \n     which its compliance is uncertain;\n       (21) urges the United Nations Security Council, bearing in \n     mind its decision in Resolution 1540 that the ``proliferation \n     of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as their \n     means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international \n     peace and security,'' to consider measures necessary--\n       (A) to support the inspection efforts by the IAEA; and\n       (B) to prevent Iran from further engaging in clandestine \n     nuclear activities;\n       (22) further urges the United Nations Security Council, \n     immediately upon receiving any report from the IAEA regarding \n     the continuing non-compliance of Iran with its obligations, \n     to address the threat to international peace and security \n     posed by Iran's nuclear weapons program and take such action \n     as may be necessary under Article 39, Article 40, and Article \n     41 of the Charter of the United Nations;\n       (23) urges the United Nations Security Council, the Nuclear \n     Suppliers Group, the Zangger Committee, and other relevant \n     international entities to declare that non-nuclear-weapon \n     states under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that commit \n     significant violations of their safeguards agreements \n     regarding uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing or \n     engage in activities intended to support a military nuclear \n     program thereby forfeit their right under the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty to engage in nuclear fuel-cycle \n     activities;\n       (24) further urges the United Nations Security Council, the \n     Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Zangger Committee, the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency, other relevant \n     international entities, and all states party to the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty, including the United States, to \n     seek consensus, no later than the 2005 Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in Geneva, \n     Switzerland, on the best and most equitable means to limit \n     the right of non-nuclear weapons states to engage in those \n     nuclear fuel cycle activities that could contribute to the \n     development of nuclear weapons, while providing those states \n     assured and affordable access to--\n       (A) nuclear reactor fuel and other materials used in \n     peaceful nuclear activities; and\n       (B) spent fuel management; and\n       (25) urges the President to keep Congress fully and \n     currently informed concerning the matters addressed in this \n     resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3573. Mr. FRIST (for Mr. Kyl (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein)) \nproposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution H. Con. Res. 398, \nexpressing the concern of Congress over Iran's development of the means \nto produce nuclear weapons; as follows:\n\n       Whereas it is the policy of the United States to oppose, \n     and urgently to seek the agreement of other nations also to \n     oppose, any transfer to Iran of any goods or technology, \n     including dual-use goods or technology, wherever that \n     transfer could contribute to its acquiring chemical, \n     biological, or nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council decided, in \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, that ``all \n     States shall refrain from providing any form of support to \n     non-State actors that attempt to develop, acquire, \n     manufacture, possess, transport, transfer or use nuclear, \n     chemical, or biological weapons and their means of \n     delivery'';\n       Whereas the United States has imposed sanctions numerous \n     times on persons and entities transferring equipment and \n     technical data to Iran to assist its weapons of mass \n     destruction programs;\n       Whereas on January 1, 1968, Iran signed the Treaty on the \n     Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, \n     London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March \n     5, 1970 (the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\");\n       Whereas Iran, as a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty as a non-nuclear weapons state, is obligated never to \n     develop or acquire nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas Iran did not declare to the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency (IAEA) the existence of the Natanz Pilot Fuel \n     Enrichment Plant and the production-scale Fuel Enrichment \n     Facility under construction at Natanz until February 2003, \n     after the existence of the plant and facility was revealed by \n     an opposition group;\n       Whereas it is estimated that the Natanz Pilot Fuel \n     Enrichment Plant could produce enough highly enriched uranium \n     for a nuclear weapon every year-and-a-half to two years;\n       Whereas it is estimated that the Natanz Fuel Enrichment \n     Facility could, when completed, produce enough highly \n     enriched uranium for as many as 25 to 30 nuclear weapons per \n     year;\n       Whereas, in his report of June 6, 2003, the Director \n     General of the IAEA stated that Iran had failed to meet its \n     obligations under its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA to \n     report all nuclear material imported into Iran--specifically, \n     the importation of uranium hexafluoride, uranium \n     tetrafluoride and uranium dioxide in 1991--the processing and \n     use of that material, and the facilities involved in the use \n     and processing of the material;\n       Whereas the IAEA Director General stated in the same report \n     that Iran had produced uranium metal and was building a \n     uranium metal processing facility, despite the fact that \n     neither its light water reactors nor its planned heavy water \n     reactors require uranium metal for fuel;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors urged Iran in June 2003 \n     to promptly rectify its failures to meet its obligations \n     under its Safeguards Agreement, not to introduce nuclear \n     material into the Natanz Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant, and to \n     cooperate fully with the Agency in resolving questions about \n     its nuclear activities;\n       Whereas the IAEA Director General reported to the Board of \n     Governors of the IAEA in August 2003 that Iran had failed to \n     disclose additional nuclear activities as required by its \n     Safeguards Agreement and continued to fail to resolve \n     questions about its undeclared uranium enrichment activities, \n     including those raised by the detection of two types of \n     highly enriched uranium particles at the Natanz Pilot Fuel \n     Enrichment Plant;\n       Whereas on August 19, 2003, after earlier denials, Iran \n     admitted in a letter that it had carried out uranium \n     conversion experiments in the early 1990's, experiments that \n     included bench scale preparation of uranium compounds and \n     that should have been disclosed to the IAEA in accordance \n     with its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors on September 12, 2003, \n     called on Iran to suspend all further uranium enrichment and \n     any plutonium reprocessing activities, disclose all its \n     nuclear activities, and cooperate fully with the IAEA, and to \n     sign, ratify, and fully implement the Additional Protocol \n     between Iran and the IAEA for the application of safeguards \n     (the ``Additional Protocol'') to strengthen investigation of \n     all nuclear activities within Iran, and requested all third \n     countries to cooperate closely and fully with the IAEA in \n     resolving questions about Iran's nuclear program;\n       Whereas IAEA inspectors and officials continued to confront \n     Iran with discrepancies in its explanations of its nuclear \n     activities;\n       Whereas on October 21, 2003, Iran and the Foreign Ministers \n     of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom issued a joint \n     statement in which Iran indicated that it had decided to \n     suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities as \n     defined by the IAEA;\n       Whereas the Governments of France, Germany, and the United \n     Kingdom promised a\n\n[[Page S8784]]\n\n     dialogue with Iran to ease Iran's access to modern \n     technologies and supplies in a range of areas once certain \n     international concerns regarding Iran are fully resolved;\n       Whereas, in a subsequent letter on October 23, 2003, Iran \n     further admitted that it had tested uranium enrichment \n     centrifuges at the Kalaye Electric Company between 1998 and \n     2002 using its previously undeclared imported uranium \n     hexafluoride;\n       Whereas in that same letter, Iran admitted that it had a \n     laser uranium enrichment program, in which it used 30 \n     kilograms of uranium not previously declared to the IAEA, \n     another violation of its Safeguards Agreement;\n       Whereas Iran indicated initially that its laser enrichment \n     program had achieved uranium enrichment levels of slightly \n     more than 3 percent, but the Director General's report of \n     June 1, 2004, states that the IAEA later learned that Iran \n     ``had been able to achieve average enrichment levels of 8 \n     percent to 9 percent, with some samples of up to \n     approximately 15 percent'';\n       Whereas the June 1, 2004, report states also that Iran's \n     declaration of October 21, 2003, failed to include \n     information that should have been provided, including the \n     fact that ``some samples from'' the laser uranium enrichment \n     project ``had been sent for assessment to the supplier's \n     laboratory'';\n       Whereas, in its letter of October 23, 2003, Iran also \n     admitted that it had irradiated 7 kilograms of uranium \n     dioxide targets and reprocessed them to extract plutonium, \n     another violation of its legal obligation to disclose such \n     activities under its Safeguards Agreement;\n       Whereas Iran told the IAEA on November 10, 2003, that it \n     would sign and ratify the Additional Protocol and would act \n     in accordance with the Additional Protocol pending its entry-\n     into-force;\n       Whereas, on November 10, 2003, Iran further informed the \n     IAEA Director General that it had decided to suspend all \n     enrichment and reprocessing activities in Iran, not to \n     produce feed material for enrichment processes, and not to \n     import enrichment related items;\n       Whereas the IAEA, through its investigative and forensic \n     activities in Iran and elsewhere, has uncovered and \n     confronted Iran about numerous lies concerning its nuclear \n     activities;\n       Whereas the Director General of the IAEA reported to the \n     IAEA Board of Governors on November 10, 2003, that Iran has \n     concealed many aspects of its nuclear activities from the \n     IAEA, in breach of its obligations under its Safeguards \n     Agreement;\n       Whereas, despite Iran's subsequent pledge to, once again, \n     fully disclose all of its nuclear activities to the IAEA, the \n     Director General of the IAEA, in a February 24, 2004, report, \n     found that Iran continued to engage in deception regarding \n     its nuclear activities, including failing to disclose a more \n     sophisticated enrichment program using more advanced \n     enrichment centrifuge technology imported from foreign \n     sources, and providing incomplete and unsupported \n     explanations about experiments to create a highly toxic \n     isotope of polonium that outside experts say is useful as a \n     neutron initiator in nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas the Director General's reports of February 24, \n     2001, and June 1, 2004, stated that environmental samples \n     from one room at the Kalaye Electric Company workshop and \n     from equipment that had been present in that workshop showed \n     more than trace quantities of uranium enriched to 36 percent \n     U-235, despite finding only negligible traces of this on \n     imported centrifuge components, and that the types of uranium \n     contamination at that workshop differed from those found at \n     Natanz, which would appear to contradict Iran's assertion \n     that the source of contamination at both sites is imported \n     centrifuge components and perhaps also its assertion that it \n     has not enriched uranium to more than 1.2 percent U-235 using \n     centrifuge technology;\n       Whereas the Director General stated in the June 1, 2004, \n     report, that ``the contamination is different on domestic and \n     imported centrifuges,'' that ``it is unlikely'' that the 36 \n     percent U-235 contamination was due to components acquired \n     from Iran's principal supplier country, and that ``important \n     information about the P-2 centrifuge programme has frequently \n     required repeated requests, and in some cases continues to \n     involve changing or contradictory information'';\n       Whereas these deceptions by Iran are continuing violations \n     of Iran's Safeguards Agreement and of Iran's previous \n     assurances to the IAEA and the international community of \n     full transparency;\n       Whereas despite Iran's commitment to the IAEA and to \n     France, Germany, and the United Kingdom that it would suspend \n     uranium enrichment activities, it has repeatedly emphasized \n     that this suspension is temporary and continued to \n     manufacture and, until April 2004, to import, uranium \n     enrichment centrifuge parts and equipment, allowing it to \n     resume and expand its uranium enrichment activities whenever \n     it chooses;\n       Whereas the statements on February 25, 2004, of Hassan \n     Rowhani, Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council \n     of Iran, that Iran was not required to reveal to the IAEA its \n     research into more sophisticated ``P2'' uranium enrichment \n     centrifuges, and that Iran has other projects which it has no \n     intention of declaring to the IAEA, are contrary to--\n       (1) Iran's commitment to the IAEA in an October 16, 2003, \n     letter from the Vice President of Iran and the President of \n     Iran's Atomic Energy Organization that Iran would present a \n     ``full picture of its nuclear activities'' and ``full \n     transparency'';\n       (2) Iran's commitment to the foreign ministers of the \n     United Kingdom, France, and Germany of October 21, 2003, to \n     full transparency and to resolve all outstanding issues; and\n       (3) its statement to the IAEA's Board of Governors of \n     September 12, 2003, of its commitment to full transparency \n     and to ``leave no stone unturned'' to assure the IAEA of its \n     peaceful objectives;\n       Whereas Libya received enrichment equipment and technology, \n     and a nuclear weapons design, from the same nuclear black \n     market that Iran has used, raising the question of whether \n     Iran, as well, received a nuclear weapon design that it has \n     refused to reveal to international inspectors;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation has announced that it will \n     soon conclude an agreement to supply Iran with enriched \n     nuclear fuel for the Bushehr nuclear power reactor, which, if \n     implemented, would undercut the international effort to \n     persuade Iran to cease its nuclear weapons development \n     program;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution of March \n     13, 2004, which was adopted unanimously, noted with ``serious \n     concern that the declarations made by Iran in October 2003 \n     did not amount to the complete and final picture of Iran's \n     past and present nuclear programme considered essential by \n     the Board's November 2003 resolution,'' and also noted that \n     the IAEA has discovered that Iran had hidden more advanced \n     centrifuge associated research, manufacturing, and testing \n     activities, two mass spectrometers used in the laser \n     enrichment program, and designs for hot cells to handle \n     highly radioactive materials;\n       Whereas the same resolution also noted ``with equal concern \n     that Iran has not resolved all questions regarding the \n     development of its enrichment technology to its current \n     extent, and that a number of other questions remain \n     unresolved, including the sources of all HEU contamination in \n     Iran; the location, extent and nature of work undertaken on \n     the basis of the advanced centrifuge design; the nature, \n     extent, and purpose of activities involving the planned \n     heavy-water reactor; and evidence to support claims regarding \n     the purpose of polonium-210 experiments'';\n       Whereas Hassan Rowhani on March 13, 2004, declared that \n     IAEA inspections would be indefinitely suspended as a protest \n     against the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution of March 13, \n     2004, and while Iran subsequently agreed to readmit \n     inspectors to one site by March 29, 2004, and to others in \n     mid-April, 2004, including four workshops belonging to the \n     Defence Industries Organization, this suspension calls into \n     serious question Iran's commitment to full transparency about \n     its nuclear activities;\n       Whereas Iran informed the IAEA on April 29, 2004, of its \n     intent to produce uranium hexafluoride in amounts that the \n     IAEA concluded would constitute production of feed material \n     for uranium centrifuges and wrote in a letter of May 18, \n     2004, that its suspension of all uranium enrichment \n     activities ``does not include suspension of production of \n     UF6,'' which contradicted assurances provided in its letter \n     of November 10, 2003;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution of June 18, \n     2004, which was also adopted unanimously, ``deplores'' the \n     fact that ``Iran's cooperation has not been as full, timely \n     and proactive as it should have been'' and ``underlines that, \n     with the passage of time, it is becoming ever more important \n     that Iran work proactively to enable the Agency to gain a \n     full understanding of Iran's enrichment programme by \n     providing all relevant information, as well as by providing \n     prompt access to all relevant places, data and persons'';\n       Whereas the same resolution also expresses regret that \n     Iran's suspension ``commitments have not been comprehensively \n     implemented and calls on Iran immediately to correct all \n     remaining shortcomings'';\n       Whereas the same resolution also calls on Iran, as further \n     confidence-building measures, voluntarily to reconsider its \n     decision to begin production testing at the Uranium \n     Conversion Facility and its decision to start construction of \n     a research reactor moderated by heavy water, as the reversal \n     of those decisions would make it easier for Iran to restore \n     international confidence undermined by past reports of \n     undeclared nuclear activities in Iran;\n       Whereas Iran then announced its decision to resume \n     production of centrifuge components, notwithstanding both the \n     IAEA Board of Governors resolution of September 12, 2003, \n     which called on Iran ``to suspend all further uranium \n     enrichment-related activities,'' and Iran's voluntary \n     suspension of all uranium enrichment activities pursuant to \n     its agreement of October 21, 2003, with the foreign ministers \n     of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany;\n       Whereas Iran's pattern of deception and concealment in \n     dealing with the IAEA, the Foreign Ministers of France, \n     Germany, and the United Kingdom, and the international \n     community, its receipt from other countries of the means to \n     enrich uranium, its use of sources who provided a nuclear \n     weapon design to another country, its production of \n     centrifuge components at Defence Industries Organization \n     workshops, and its repeated breaches of its Safeguards \n     Agreement suggest strongly that Iran has also violated its\n\n[[Page S8785]]\n\n     legal obligation under article II of the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty not to acquire or seek assistance in \n     acquiring nuclear weapons; and\n       Whereas the maintenance or construction by Iran of \n     unsafeguarded nuclear facilities or uranium enrichment or \n     reprocessing facilities will continue to endanger the \n     maintenance of international peace and security and threaten \n     United States national interests: Now, therefore, be it\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3574. Mr. FRIST (for Mr. Kyl (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein)) \nproposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution H. Con. Res. 398, \nexpressing the concern of Congress over Iran's development of the means \nto produce nuclear weapons; as follows:\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``Expressing the concern of \n     Congress over Iran's development of the means to produce \n     nuclear weapons.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3575.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Prescott National Forest in Yavapai County, Arizona \n     includes approximately 170 square miles of parcels of Federal \n     land and private land intermingled in a checkerboard pattern;\n       (2) the Federal land is administered by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture as National Forest System land;\n       (3) the private land is owned by the Yavapai Ranch Limited \n     Partnership and the Northern Yavapai, L.L.C.;\n       (4) portions of the private land within the checkerboard \n     area (including the land located in or near the Pine Creek \n     watershed, Juniper Mesa Wilderness Area, Haystack Peak, and \n     the Luis Maria Baca Float No. 5) possess attributes valuable \n     for public management, use, and enjoyment, including--\n       (A) outdoor recreation;\n       (B) stands of old growth pine and juniper;\n       (C) wildlife habitat;\n       (D) cultural and archaeological resources; and\n       (E) scenic vistas;\n       (5) the checkerboard ownership pattern of private land and \n     Federal land within the Prescott National Forest impedes \n     sound and efficient management and use of the intermingled \n     National Forest System land;\n       (6) acquisition by the United States of certain parcels of \n     land through a land exchange with Yavapai Ranch Limited \n     Partnership and the Northern Yavapai, L.L.C., for addition to \n     Prescott National Forest would serve the public objectives \n     of--\n       (A) acquiring private land that meets the criteria for \n     inclusion in the National Forest System;\n       (B) consolidating a large area of National Forest System \n     land to allow--\n       (i) permanent public access, use, and enjoyment of the \n     land; and\n       (ii) efficient management of the land;\n       (C) minimizing cash outlays by the United States to achieve \n     the objectives described in subparagraphs (A) and (B); and\n       (D) reducing administrative costs to the United States \n     through--\n       (i) elimination of approximately 350 miles of boundary \n     between private land and the Federal parcels; and\n       (ii) reduction of right-of-way, special use, and other \n     permit processing and issuance for roads and other facilities \n     on National Forest System land;\n       (7) additional parcels of National Forest System land \n     within Yavapai County, Arizona have been identified for \n     inclusion in the land exchange because the parcels--\n       (A) have lost their forest character;\n       (B) meet the National Forest Plan criteria for exchange; \n     and\n       (C) are managed under special use permits and leases for a \n     variety of purposes (including municipal water treatment \n     facilities, sewage treatment facilities, city parks, camps, \n     and airport-related facilities) that--\n       (i) limit the usefulness of the parcels for general \n     National Forest System purposes; but\n       (ii)(I) are to be conveyed by the Yavapai Ranch Limited \n     Partnership, to the third-party permit or lease holders in \n     accordance with agreements acceptable to all parties to the \n     agreements; or\n       (II) are to be purchased directly from the Secretary in \n     accordance with this Act; and\n       (8) the exchange and conveyance of the Federal land should \n     not result in adverse impacts on existing water users, State \n     water right holders, or the Verde River.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to authorize, \n     direct, and facilitate--\n       (1) an equal value exchange of Federal land and non-Federal \n     land between the United States, Yavapai Ranch Limited \n     Partnership, and the Northern Yavapai, L.L.C.; and\n       (2) the conveyance of portions of certain parcels of the \n     Federal land for community and other uses.\n\n     SEC. 102.

Mr. President, I respectfully request if the chairman of \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senator Inhofe, would \nengage in a colloquy with me on the impact of the several Surface \nTransportation extension bills on the so-called ``donor'' States. As \nthe chairman is well aware, TEA-21 contains a fundamental principle of \nfairness for donor States which guarantees that no State will receive \nless than a 90.5 percent rate of return of their gas tax contributions \nto the Highway trust fund. In the preceding extension bills for fiscal \nyear 2004, this matter was not addressed because it was expected that a \nfull surface transportation reauthorization bill would be enacted this \nyear. I know my chairman has worked tirelessly to pass a new \ntransportation bill, but regrettably we have not completed our work.\n  As we face the end of the fiscal year, the multiple highway extension \nbills have not followed the TEA-21 Minimum Guarantee program and the \nresult is that, to date, many States will not receive the 90.5 percent \nguarantee in fiscal year 2004. I am particularly concerned because \nagain this temporary extension bill does not follow the TEA-21 formula.\n  I appreciate the chairman's diligence on this matter and I am aware \nthat some funding remains in fiscal year\n\n[[Page S8791]]\n\n2004 which may be used to correct this problem. I would like to ask the \nchairman if my understanding of this situation is correct, and would be \ngrateful for the chairman's view of this matter.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senator from Virginia is correct that the several \ntransportation extension bills enacted this year require that the next \nlegislation we enact must address the ``donor'' State issue for fiscal \nyear 2004. I remain committed to guaranteeing that all States receive a \nminimum of 90.5 percent rate of return for their trust fund \ncontributions in fiscal year 2004. As some funding remains in the \nfiscal year, I am committed to maintaining the Minimum Guarantee \nprogram for this year so that no State receives less than a 90.5 \npercent return on their trust fund contributions.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly. People watching \nsometimes wonder what is going on in the quorum call. This is hours' \nworth of quorum call right here. It took only 20 seconds to read it.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 133, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 133) declaring \n     genocide in Darfur, Sudan.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today the Senate is taking historic \naction, stating clearly that the atrocities occurring in Darfur are \ngenocide, reminding the world of its obligations under the Genocide \nConvention, and calling on the administration to lead an international \neffort to stop the genocide. This resolution, which I introduced with \nmy colleague, Sam Brownback, has broad, bipartisan support, and its \nunanimous approval by the U.S. Senate sends a powerful message--that \nthis body will not remain silent as genocide occurs.\n  The situation remains, as U.N. officials have called it, ``the \nworld's worst humanitarian catastrophe.'' At least 30,000 have been \nkilled. Mr. President, 1.2 million have been violently displaced from \ntheir villages, of whom 200,000 have fled to Chad. The potential death \ntoll is horrifying. Andrew Natsios, Administrator of the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development, has predicted that 300,000 will die this \nyear, even in an ``optimistic'' scenario in which humanitarian \nassistance is provided, and that up to one million are at risk.\n  This disaster is the result of the deliberate policies of the \nGovernment of Sudan and the ``janjaweed'' militias under its control. \nEarlier this week, Human Rights Watch reported how Sudanese government \ndocuments themselves prove Khartoum's complicity. Those documents \ndescribe, in plain terms, the government's military support for the \nmilitias--its, quote ``loyalist tribes''--and its policy of tolerating \nthe abuse of civilians by the militias.\n  What has been the result? Janjaweed militias, along with Sudanese \nforces, have engaged in systematic attacks against civilians in Darfur. \nAs recently confirmed by U.S. Government satellite photographs, \nvillages have been burnt to the ground. Livestock and food stock have \nbeen destroyed, and water sources poisoned. Humanitarian assistance has \nbeen denied. Militias have murdered civilians and abducted children.\n  Just this week, on Monday, Amnesty International issued a report \ndescribing how rape has been used as a weapon of war in Darfur. Amnesty \ndescribed how women and girls as young as 8 have been raped and \nabducted, often with the involvement or acquiescence of Sudanese \nauthorities. Janjaweed militia have raped women in public, in front of \ntheir families, with the intent of adding humiliation to the violence. \nAmnesty reports gang rapes, rapes of pregnant women, and torture and \nkillings in the context of sexual violence. Darfurian women, who are \noften reluctant to talk about these experiences, nonetheless described \nhow they were abducted and held captive during the day, when militia \nmembers were looting villages, so that they could be raped at night. \nAmnesty reported how rapes have occurred during attacks on villages, \nduring the flight of civilians, and in the camps, all with total \nimpunity. Not a single member of the janjaweed or the Sudanese armed \nforces have been charged with committing rape or abducting civilians.\n  In addition to stopping this violence, we must act now to prevent \ndeath from starvation and disease. Hundreds of thousands of civilians \nare currently crowded into camps, where conditions are simply stated, \nhorrendous. Humanitarian organizations now estimate that nearly half of \nthe internationally displaced civilians in Darfur have inadequate food \nand shelter, that 61 percent lack sufficient water, and that 87 percent \nlack adequate sanitation. Many of the camps are off limits to \ninternational relief workers, and much of the countryside is \ninaccessible as well.\n  The rains are adding to the obstacles presented to the humanitarian \norganizations. So, too, is the lack of security created by the militias \nand Sudanese forces. The result may be a complete break in the food \npipeline, and the deaths of hundreds of thousands. As U.N. Under \nSecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egelan said last week, \n``We are now in this moment of truth, which will last for some weeks.''\n\n  Along with my colleague, Senator Brownback, I have introduced a \nresolution declaring the situation in Darfur to be genocide. Why is \nthis so? To begin with, it is undisputed that the murders, rapes, \nabductions of children, displacements and denial of humanitarian \nassistance have been directed at particular ethnic groups, specifically \nthe ethnically African groups--the Fur, Zagahwa, and Massalit. Both the \nU.S. and the U.N. have stated that ``ethnic cleansing'' is occurring. \nThe U.S. Ambassador for War Crimes, Pierre-Richard Prosper, has said \nthat there are ``indicators of genocide.''\n  What does the Genocide Convention of 1948 state? It defines genocide \nas killing, causing serious bodily harm, and deliberately inflicting \nconditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction--\nall of which have occurred in Darfur--committed with intent to destroy, \nin whole or in part, a national ethnical, racial or religious group. \nThe Convention does not require that a certain number have died before \nit is genocide, only that the acts are occurring.\n  This declaration is important because of our obligation--and that of \nthe world--to stop genocide before it is too late. After all, the full \nname of the Genocide Convention is the ``Convention on the Prevention \nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.'' Article I of the Convention \nstates that the contracting parties ``undertake to prevent and punish'' \ngenocide. The United States and every other permanent member of the \nU.N. Security Council is a party to the Genocide Convention.\n  The Genocide Convention arose out of the horror of the Holocaust, in \na moment of history in which the world vowed never again to permit this \nevil. But the world has spoken much more recently. In late January \n2004, 55 governments participated in the Stockholm International Forum, \n``Preventing Genocide; Threats and Responsibilities.'' Those \ngovernments, which included the U.S., the U.K., France and Russia, \ndeclared, quote:\n\n       The Holocaust . . . challenged the foundations of human \n     civilization . . . We are committed to shouldering our \n     responsibility to protect groups identified as potential \n     victims of genocide, mass murder or ethnic cleansing, drawing \n     upon the range of tools at our disposal to prevent such \n     atrocities in accordance with international law and fully \n     upholding the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \n     the Crime of Genocide.\n\n  This was this January. What do these words mean without action? More \nwords, mere condemnations are not sufficient. Nor is humanitarian \nassistance possible without real intervention. The lack of food, water \nand sanitation have reached critical levels. But the problem is caused, \nand compounded, by the lack of security. As Jan Egelan said last week, \nquote ``The number one problem now is lack of security. Our trucks are \nlooted, our humanitarian workers are threatened and attacked.''\n  We must find ways to stop this catastrophe. This resolution calls on \nthe President to lead an international effort to stop this genocide. In \nmy view,\n\n[[Page S8793]]\n\nto be effective, we must take whatever actions are necessary, including \narmed intervention, to save the hundreds of thousands of lives that are \nat stake. I have called for a U.N.-authorized multinational force, as \nwell as the provision of assistance to the African Union's critically \nimportant, but thus far, inadequate mission.\n  In the end, the only thing that will matter is whether we have saved \nthese lives, whether we have done whatever it takes to stop this \ngenocide. This resolution is a powerful statement. But it must also \nserve as an impetus to the administration and to the rest of the world \nto act. Morally and legally, we have no other option.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 133) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 133\n\n       Whereas Article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (signed at Paris on \n     December 9, 1948) states that ``the Contracting Parties \n     confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or \n     in time of war, is a crime under international law which they \n     undertake to prevent and to punish'';\n       Whereas Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide declares that ``in the \n     present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts \n     committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a \n     national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) \n     killing members of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or \n     mental harm to members of the group; (c) deliberately \n     inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to \n     bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) \n     imposing measures intended to prevent births within the \n     group; and (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to \n     another group'';\n       Whereas Article 3 of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide affirms that ``[the] \n     following acts shall be punishable: (a) genocide; (b) \n     conspiracy to commit genocide; (c) direct and public \n     incitement to commit genocide; (d) attempt to committed \n     genocide; and (e) complicit in genocide'';\n       Whereas in Darfur, Sudan, an estimated 30,000 innocent \n     civilians have been brutally murdered, more than 130,000 \n     people have been forced from their homes and have fled to \n     neighboring Chad, and more than 1,000,000 people have been \n     internally displaced; and\n       Whereas in March 2004 the United Nations Resident \n     Humanitarian Coordinator stated: ``[T]he war in Darfur \n     started off in a small way last year but it has progressively \n     gotten worse. A predominant feature of this is that the brunt \n     is being borne by civilians. This includes vulnerable women \n     and children . . . The violence in Darfur appears to be \n     particularly directed at a specific group based on their \n     ethnic identity and appears to be systemized.'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) declares that the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, \n     Sudan, are genocide;\n       (2) reminds the Contracting Parties to the Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide \n     (signed at Paris on December 9, 1948), particularly the \n     Government of Sudan, of their legal obligations under the \n     Convention;\n       (3) declares that the Government of Sudan, as a Contracting \n     Party, has violated the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;\n       (4) deplores the failure of the United Nations Human Rights \n     Commission to take appropriate action with respect to the \n     crisis in Darfur, Sudan, particularly the failure by the \n     Commission to support United States-sponsored efforts to \n     strongly condemn gross human rights violations committed in \n     Darfur, and calls upon the United Nations and the United \n     Nations Secretary General to assert leadership by calling the \n     atrocities being committed in Darfur by their rightful name: \n     ``genocide'';\n       (5) calls on the member states of the United Nations, \n     particularly member states from the African Union, the Arab \n     League, and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, to \n     undertake measures to prevent the genocide in Darfur, Sudan, \n     from escalating further, including the imposition of targeted \n     means against those responsible for the atrocities;\n       (6) commends the Administration's leadership in seeking a \n     peaceful resolution to the conflict in Darfur, Sudan, and in \n     addressing the ensuing humanitarian crisis, including the \n     visit of Secretary of State Colin Powell to Darfur in June \n     2004 to engage directly in efforts to end the genocide, and \n     the provision of nearly $140,000,000 to date in bilateral \n     humanitarian assistance through the United States Agency for \n     International Development;\n       (7) commends the President for appointing former Senator \n     John Danforth as Envoy for Peace in Sudan on September 6, \n     2001, and further commends the appointment of Senator \n     Danforth as United States Ambassador to the United Nations;\n       (8) calls on the Administration to continue to lead an \n     international effort to stop genocide in Darfur, Sudan;\n       (9) calls on the Administration to impose targeted means, \n     including visa bans and the freezing of assets, against \n     officials and other individuals of the Government of Sudan, \n     as well as Janjaweed militia commanders, who are responsible \n     for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur, Sudan; \n     and\n       (10) calls on the United States Agency for International \n     Development to establish a Darfur Resettlement, \n     Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction Fund so that those \n     individuals driven off their land may return and begin to \n     rebuild their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8793-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8793-S8794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONDEMNING THE ATTACK ON THE AMIA JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER IN BUENOS \n                     AIRES, ARGENTINA, IN JULY 1994\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mohsen Rabbani, a \n     former cultural attache at the Iranian Embassy in Buenos \n     Aires; Ali Balesh-Abadi, an Iranian diplomat; and Ali Akbar \n     Parvaresh, a former minister of education;\n       Whereas Hadi Soleimanpour, Iran's Ambassador to Argentina \n     in the 1990s, also has an international arrest warrant \n     pending against him by Argentine authorities for his \n     suspected primary role in the AMIA bombing;\n       Whereas it is reported that suicide bomber Ibrahim Hussein \n     Berro, a Lebanese citizen, carried out the attack on AMIA;\n       Whereas it has been reported that contact was made by the \n     Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires to Ibrahim Hussein Berro, who \n     lived in a mosque in Canuelas, Argentina, in the days before \n     the AMIA bombing;\n       Whereas Argentine officials have acknowledged that there \n     was negligence in the initial phases of the investigation \n     into the 1994\n\n[[Page S8794]]\n\n     bombing, including the destruction or disappearance of \n     material evidence;\n       Whereas the first major criminal trial regarding the \n     bombing did not begin until September 2001, and those who are \n     currently on trial are former policemen and civilians who are \n     accused of playing roles only in the procurement and delivery \n     of the vehicle that was used in the bombing;\n       Whereas the judge who had presided since 2001 over the \n     investigation and trial related to the AMIA bombing was \n     removed in December 2003 due to charges that he bribed a key \n     witness in the AMIA case;\n       Whereas the new trial judge, Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, deals \n     with many other important cases and has few supporting staff;\n       Whereas on March 17, 1992, terrorists bombed the Embassy of \n     Israel in Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing 29 people and \n     injuring more than 200, and the perpetrators of the attack \n     also remain at large;\n       Whereas an inability to extradite suspected Islamic \n     militants and Iranian officials has debilitated the efforts \n     of the Government of Argentina to prosecute masterminds and \n     planners of the 1994 AMIA bombing;\n       Whereas evidence indicates that the tri-border area where \n     the borders of Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil meet is \n     suspected of harboring organizations that support terrorism \n     and engage in drug and arms smuggling and an assorted array \n     of other illicit, revenue-raising activities;\n       Whereas the Government of Argentina supports the 1996 \n     Declaration of Lima to Prevent, Combat and Eliminate \n     Terrorism, which refers to terrorism as a ``serious form of \n     organized and systematic violence that is intended to \n     generate chaos and fear among the population, results in \n     death and destruction, and is a reprehensible criminal \n     activity'';\n       Whereas the Government of Argentina supports the 1998 \n     Commitment of Mar del Plata, which calls terrorist acts \n     ``serious common crimes that erode peaceful and civilized \n     coexistence, affect the rule of law and the exercise of \n     democracy, and endanger the stability of democratically \n     elected constitutional governments and their socioeconomic \n     development of our countries'';\n       Whereas the Government of Argentina actively supports the \n     development of the Three Plus One Counterterrorism Dialogue \n     with Brazil, Paraguay, and the United States;\n       Whereas the Government of Argentina was successful in \n     enacting a law on cooperation from defendants in terrorist \n     matters, a law that will be helpful in pursuing full \n     prosecution in the 1994 AMIA bombing and other terrorist \n     cases; and\n       Whereas the Second Specialized Conference on Terrorism held \n     in Mar del Plata, Argentina on November 23 and November 24, \n     1998, concluded with the adoption of the Commitment of Mar \n     del Plata, calling for the establishment within the \n     Organization of American States (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``OAS'') of an Inter-American Committee Against \n     Terrorism (referred to in this resolution as ``CICTE''): Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) reiterates its strongest condemnation of the 1994 \n     attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, \n     Argentina, and honors the victims of this heinous act;\n       (2) expresses its sympathy to the relatives of the victims, \n     who have waited 10 years without justice for the loss of \n     their loved ones, and may have to wait even longer for \n     justice to be served;\n       (3) underscores the concern of the United States regarding \n     the continuing, decade-long delay in the proper resolution of \n     this case;\n       (4) strongly urges the Government of Argentina to continue \n     to dedicate and provide the resources necessary for its \n     judicial system and intelligence agencies to investigate all \n     areas of the AMIA case, including by implementing Argentine \n     President Nestor Kirchner's Executive order mandating the \n     opening of the archives of the SIDE of Argentina, and to \n     prosecute with due haste those who are responsible for the \n     bombing;\n       (5) calls upon the international community to cooperate \n     fully with the investigation, including by making \n     information, witnesses, and suspects available for review and \n     questioning by the appropriate Argentine authorities;\n       (6) encourages the President to direct United States law \n     enforcement agencies to provide support and cooperation, if \n     requested, to the Government of Argentina, for the purposes \n     of deepening and expanding the investigation into this \n     bombing and suspected activities in support of terrorism in \n     the tri-border area where the borders of Argentina, Paraguay, \n     and Brazil meet;\n       (7) encourages the President to direct the United States \n     Representative to the OAS to--\n       (A) seek support from OAS member countries for the creation \n     of a special task force of the CICTE to assist, as requested \n     by the Government of Argentina, in the investigation of all \n     aspects of the 1994 AMIA terrorist attack; and\n       (B) urge OAS member countries to designate Hizballah as a \n     terrorist organization if they have not already done so;\n       (8) stresses the need for international pressure on the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Government \n     of the Syrian Arab Republic to extradite for trial \n     individuals and government officials who are accused of \n     planning or perpetrating the AMIA attack, and to immediately, \n     unconditionally, and permanently cease any and all assistance \n     to terrorists; and\n       (9) desires a lasting, warm relationship between the United \n     States and Argentina that is built, in part, on mutual \n     abhorrence of terrorism and commitments to peace, stability, \n     and democracy in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8794-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8794-S8795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF UKRAINE TO ENSURE A DEMOCRATIC, TRANSPARENT, \nAND FAIR ELECTION PROCESS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ON OCTOBER 31, \n                                  2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign \nRelations Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Con. \nRes. 106 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the concurrent resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 106) urging the \n     Government of Ukraine to ensure a democratic, transparent, \n     and fair election process for the presidential election on \n     October 31, 2004.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to urge passage of S. Con. Res. \n106, a bipartisan resolution calling upon the Government of Ukraine to \nensure a democratic, transparent and fair election process for the \npresidential elections scheduled to be held in late October. This \nresolution, by encouraging fair, open and transparent elections, is a \nconcrete expression of the commitment of the U.S. Congress to the \nUkrainian people.\n  The resolution underscores that an election process and the \nestablishment of a genuinely democratic political system consistent \nwith Ukraine's freely undertaken OSCE commitments is a prerequisite for \nUkraine's full integration into the Western community of nations as an \nequal member, including into NATO. The October elections will be vital \nin determining Ukraine's course for years to come. They present the \nUkrainian authorities with a real opportunity to demonstrate their \ncommitment to OSCE principles and values.\n  As cochairman of the Helsinki Commission, I would point out that \nUkrainian President Leonid Kuchma recently cosigned a Declaration with \nRussia and leaders of several other independent former Soviet states \ncriticizing the OSCE for focusing too much attention on human rights \nand democratization. While disappointing, this diatribe is not \nsurprising given the fact that under President Kuchma's leadership, \nUkraine's record in such as media freedoms, elections, the rule of law \nand corruption has moved in the wrong direction. It is up to the OSCE \nstates, including Ukraine, to implement their freely undertaken OSCE \ncommitments and to take corrective measures if necessary--something I \nhope the Ukrainian authorities will be mindful of in the run-up to the \nelections.\n  Ukraine's pre-election environment has already been decidedly \nproblematic and of great concern to the United States and the \ninternational community. The pending resolution, S. Con. Res. 106, \nfocuses squarely on key problem areas, including increasing control and \nmanipulation of the media and attempts by national authorities to limit \naccess to international broadcasting, including Radio Liberty. Among \nother concerns are the serious obstacles to free assembly and a free \nand fair political campaign as well as substantial irregularities in \nseveral recent elections, most notably, the mayoral election held in \nApril in the western Ukrainian city of Mukacheve. This election was \nmarred by intimidation, violence, fraud and manipulation of the vote \ncount, electoral disruptions and irregularities.\n  According to the most recent report of the nonpartisan Ukrainian \nnongovernmental Committee of Voters of Ukraine:\n\n       There was no improvement in the political environment in \n     June compared to April and May. Instead, CVU observed an \n     increase in the number of cases of government pressure on the \n     opposition designed to impede their activities. Potential \n     candidates did not enjoy equal access to the media. . . . The \n     level of criminal interference in the pre-election process \n     remains very high, thus threatening free elections.\n\n\n[[Page S8795]]\n\n\n  S. Con Res. 106 outlines those measures the Ukrainian authorities \nneed to take--consistent with their own laws and international \nagreements--for a free, fair, open and transparent election process. \nThe Ukrainian authorities at all levels, including the executive, \nlegislative and judicial branches, need to ensure an election process \nthat enables all of the candidates to compete on a level playing field. \nThis includes the various ministries and agencies involved directly or \nindirectly in the elections process, as well as Ukraine's courts.\n  Ukraine's October presidential elections should be a watershed for \nthe future direction of that country of great potential. Ukrainian \nauthorities need to radically improve the election environment if there \nis to be hope for these elections to meet OSCE standards. By doing so, \nthey will go a long way in restoring the trust of the citizens of \nUkraine and strengthening Ukraine's independence and democracy.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 106\n\n       Whereas the establishment of a democratic, transparent, and \n     fair election process for the 2004 presidential election in \n     Ukraine and of a genuinely democratic political system are \n     prerequisites for that country's full integration into the \n     Western community of nations as an equal member, including \n     into organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas the Government of Ukraine has accepted numerous \n     specific commitments governing the conduct of elections as a \n     participating State of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), including provisions of the \n     Copenhagen Document;\n       Whereas the election on October 31, 2004, of Ukraine's next \n     president will provide an unambiguous test of the extent of \n     the Ukrainian authorities' commitment to implement these \n     standards and build a democratic society based on free \n     elections and the rule of law;\n       Whereas this election takes place against the backdrop of \n     previous elections that did not fully meet international \n     standards and of disturbing trends in the current pre-\n     election environment;\n       Whereas it is the duty of government and public authorities \n     at all levels to act in a manner consistent with all laws and \n     regulations governing election procedures and to ensure free \n     and fair elections throughout the entire country, including \n     preventing activities aimed at undermining the free exercise \n     of political rights;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires a \n     period of political campaigning conducted in an environment \n     in which neither administrative action nor violence, \n     intimidation, or detention hinder the parties, political \n     associations, and the candidates from presenting their views \n     and qualifications to the citizenry, including organizing \n     supporters, conducting public meetings and events throughout \n     the country, and enjoying unimpeded access to television, \n     radio, print, and Internet media on a non-discriminatory \n     basis;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires that \n     citizens be guaranteed the right and effective opportunity to \n     exercise their civil and political rights, including the \n     right to vote and the right to seek and acquire information \n     upon which to make an informed vote, free from intimidation, \n     undue influence, attempts at vote buying, threats of \n     political retribution, or other forms of coercion by national \n     or local authorities or others;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires \n     government and public authorities to ensure that candidates \n     and political parties enjoy equal treatment before the law \n     and that government resources are not employed to the \n     advantage of individual candidates or political parties;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires the \n     full transparency of laws and regulations governing \n     elections, multiparty representation on election commissions, \n     and unobstructed access by candidates, political parties, and \n     domestic and international observers to all election \n     procedures, including voting and vote-counting in all areas \n     of the country;\n       Whereas increasing control and manipulation of the media by \n     national and local officials and others acting at their \n     behest raise grave concerns regarding the commitment of the \n     Ukrainian authorities to free and fair elections;\n       Whereas efforts by the national authorities to limit access \n     to international broadcasting, including Radio Liberty and \n     the Voice of America, represent an unacceptable infringement \n     on the right of the Ukrainian people to independent \n     information;\n       Whereas efforts by national and local officials and others \n     acting at their behest to impose obstacles to free assembly, \n     free speech, and a free and fair political campaign have \n     taken place in Donetsk, Sumy, and elsewhere in Ukraine \n     without condemnation or remedial action by the Ukrainian \n     Government;\n       Whereas numerous substantial irregularities have taken \n     place in recent Ukrainian parliamentary by-elections in the \n     Donetsk region and in mayoral elections in Mukacheve, Romny, \n     and Krasniy Luch; and\n       Whereas the intimidation and violence during the April 18, \n     2004, mayoral election in Mukacheve, Ukraine, represent a \n     deliberate attack on the democratic process: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) acknowledges and welcomes the strong relationship \n     formed between the United States and Ukraine since the \n     restoration of Ukraine's independence in 1991;\n       (2) recognizes that a precondition for the full integration \n     of Ukraine into the Western community of nations, including \n     as an equal member in institutions such as the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO), is its establishment of a \n     genuinely democratic political system;\n       (3) expresses its strong and continuing support for the \n     efforts of the Ukrainian people to establish a full \n     democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights in \n     Ukraine;\n       (4) urges the Government of Ukraine to guarantee freedom of \n     association and assembly, including the right of candidates, \n     members of political parties, and others to freely assemble, \n     to organize and conduct public events, and to exercise these \n     and other rights free from intimidation or harassment by \n     local or national officials or others acting at their behest;\n       (5) urges the Government of Ukraine to meet its \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     commitments on democratic elections and to address issues \n     previously identified by the Office of Democratic \n     Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the OSCE in its \n     final reports on the 2002 parliamentary elections and the \n     1999 presidential elections, such as illegal interference by \n     public authorities in the campaign and a high degree of bias \n     in the media;\n       (6) urges the Ukrainian authorities to ensure--\n       (A) the full transparency of election procedures before, \n     during, and after the 2004 presidential elections;\n       (B) free access for Ukrainian and international election \n     observers;\n       (C) multiparty representation on all election commissions;\n       (D) unimpeded access by all parties and candidates to \n     print, radio, television, and Internet media on a non-\n     discriminatory basis;\n       (E) freedom of candidates, members of opposition parties, \n     and independent media organizations from intimidation or \n     harassment by government officials at all levels via \n     selective tax audits and other regulatory procedures, and in \n     the case of media, license revocations and libel suits, among \n     other measures;\n       (F) a transparent process for complaint and appeals through \n     electoral commissions and within the court system that \n     provides timely and effective remedies;

and\n       (B) Iran's continuing deceptions and falsehoods to the IAEA \n     and the international community about its nuclear programs \n     and activities;\n       (2) concurs with the conclusion reached in the Department \n     of State's Annual Report on Adherence to and Compliance with \n     Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Agreements and Commitments \n     that Iran is pursuing a program to develop nuclear weapons;\n       (3) urges the President to provide to the IAEA whatever \n     financial, material, or intelligence resources are necessary \n     to enable the IAEA it to fully investigate Iran's nuclear \n     activities;\n       (4) calls upon all states party to the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, \n     and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 \n     (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the ``Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty''), including the United States, to \n     use appropriate means to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear \n     weapons, including the suspension of all nuclear and other \n     cooperation with Iran, including the provision of dual use \n     items, until Iran fully implements the Additional Protocol to \n     its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA (hereafter in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``Additional Protocol'') and is \n     clearly in compliance with its obligations under the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty;\n       (5) declares that Iran, through its many breaches during \n     the past 18 years of its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA, \n     has forfeited the right to be trusted with the development of \n     a full nuclear fuel cycle, especially with uranium conversion \n     and enrichment and plutonium reprocessing technology, \n     equipment, and facilities;\n       (6) declares that the revelations of Iran's nondisclosure \n     of additional enrichment and nuclear-weapons-applicable \n     research activities, as detailed in the reports of February \n     24, 2004, and June 1, 2004, by the Director General of the \n     IAEA, together with the statement by the Government of Iran \n     that it will not disclose other research programs, constitute \n     ample evidence of Iran's continuing policy of noncompliance \n     with the letter and spirit of its obligations under its \n     Safeguards Agreement and the Additional Protocol;\n       (7) recognizes, in contrast with Iran's behavior, the \n     positive example of Libya's decision to renounce and \n     dismantle its nuclear weapons program and to provide full, \n     complete, and transparent disclosure of all its nuclear \n     activities, which has enabled the IAEA to rapidly understand \n     and verify with high confidence the extent and scope of \n     Libya's program and has led to the establishment of direct \n     diplomatic relations with Libya, the gradual lifting of U.S. \n     sanctions, and the establishment of cooperative programs \n     between the United States and Libya;\n       (8) foresees a similar future for Iran, once that country \n     renounces and dismantles its weapons of mass destruction and \n     long-range ballistic missile programs and renounces its \n     support for international terrorist organizations;\n       (9) notes the assistance that the United States has \n     provided to southeastern Iran since the Bam earthquake on \n     December 26, 2003;\n       (10) calls upon Iran to immediately and permanently cease \n     all efforts to acquire sensitive nuclear fuel cycle \n     capabilities, in particular all uranium enrichment \n     activities, including importing, manufacturing, and testing \n     of related equipment;\n       (11) urges Iran to comply with its international \n     commitments and to rescind its decisions--\n       (A) to manufacture and construct centrifuges;\n       (B) to produce feed material that could be used in those \n     centrifuges; and\n       (C) to construct a heavy-water moderated reactor that could \n     be used for plutonium production;\n       (12) calls upon Iran to honor its stated commitments and \n     legal obligations--\n       (A) to grant IAEA inspectors prompt, full and unrestricted \n     access;\n       (B) to cooperate fully with the investigation of its \n     nuclear activities; and\n       (C) to demonstrate a new openness and honesty about all its \n     nuclear programs;\n       (13) welcomes the June 26, 2004, declaration at the United \n     States-E.U. Summit in Shannon, Ireland, in which the European \n     Union and the United States pledged to implement United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, which identifies \n     actions states should take--\n       (A) to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction;\n       (B) to establish new measures in accordance with the G8 \n     Action Plan on Non-Proliferation, announced June 9, 2004, at \n     the G8 Summit in Sea Island, Georgia; and\n       (C) to preserve the integrity of the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty;\n       (14) urges close cooperation between the United States and \n     the European Union in accordance with the reaffirmation in \n     their June 26, 2004, declaration of ``the IAEA Board of \n     Governors' Iran resolutions, which deplore Iran's \n     insufficient cooperation and call on Iran, inter alia, to \n     cooperate fully and in a timely and proactive manner, with \n     IAEA investigation of its nuclear programme and suspend all \n     enrichment-related and reprocessing activities'';\n       (15) calls upon the members of the European Union not to \n     resume discussions with Iran on multilateral trade agreements \n     until the IAEA Director General reports that Iran has \n     suspended all nuclear weapons development activity, and not \n     to implement such trade agreements until Iran has verifiably \n     and permanently ceased all nuclear weapons development \n     activity, including a permanent cessation of uranium \n     conversion and enrichment and plutonium reprocessing \n     activities;\n       (16) further calls upon the members of the European Union \n     to undertake such additional measures, including imposing \n     sanctions and sponsoring an IAEA Board of Governors report on \n     non-compliance pursuant to Article XII of the IAEA Statute, \n     as may be necessary to persuade Iran to cease all nuclear \n     weapons development activity and to fulfill its obligations \n     and commitments to the IAEA;\n       (17) in light of ongoing revelations of the noncompliance \n     of the Government of Iran regarding its obligations under the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and pledges to the IAEA, and \n     in light of the consequent and ongoing questions and concerns \n     of the IAEA, the United States, and the international \n     community regarding Iran's nuclear activities--\n       (A) urges Japan to ensure that Japanese commercial entities \n     not proceed with the development of Iran's Azadegan oil \n     field;\n       (B) urges France and Malaysia to ensure that French and \n     Malaysian commercial entities not proceed with their \n     agreement for further cooperation in expanding Iran's liquid \n     natural gas production field;\n       (C) calls on all countries to intercede with their \n     commercial entities to ensure that these entities refrain \n     from or suspend all investment and investment-related \n     activities that support Iran's energy industry; and\n       (D) calls on Member States of the United Nations to prevent \n     the Government of Iran from continuing to pursue and develop \n     programs or facilities that could be used in a nuclear \n     weapons program and to end all nuclear cooperation with Iran, \n     including the provision of dual use items, until Iran \n     complies fully with its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA \n     and its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty;\n       (18) deplores any effort by any country to provide nuclear \n     power-related assistance to Iran at this time, and calls upon \n     Russia--\n       (A) to use all appropriate means to urge Iran to meet fully \n     its obligations and commitments to the IAEA; and\n       (B) to suspend nuclear cooperation with Iran and not \n     conclude a nuclear fuel supply agreement for the Bushehr \n     reactor that would enter into force before Iran has \n     verifiably and permanently ceased all nuclear weapons \n     development activity, including a permanent cessation of \n     uranium conversion and enrichment and plutonium reprocessing \n     activities;\n       (19) calls upon the governments of the countries whose \n     nationals and corporations are implicated in assisting \n     Iranian nuclear activities, including Pakistan, Malaysia, the \n     United Arab Emirates, and Germany--\n       (A) to fully investigate such assistance;\n       (B) to grant the IAEA all necessary access to individuals, \n     sites, and information related to the investigations;\n       (C) to take all appropriate action against such nationals \n     and corporations under the laws of those countries; and\n       (D) to immediately review and rectify their export control \n     laws, regulations, and practices in order to prevent further \n     assistance to countries pursuing nuclear programs that could \n     support the development of nuclear weapons;\n       (20) urges the IAEA Board of Governors, in accordance with \n     Article XII of the IAEA Statute--\n       (A) to report to the United Nations Security Council that \n     Iran has been in noncompliance with its agreements with the \n     IAEA; and\n       (B) as appropriate, to specify areas in which Iran \n     continues to be in noncompliance\n\n[[Page S8797]]\n\n     with its agreements with the IAEA or with the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty, or in which its compliance is \n     uncertain;\n       (21) urges the United Nations Security Council, bearing in \n     mind its decision in Resolution 1540 that the ``proliferation \n     of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as their \n     means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international \n     peace and security,'' to consider measures necessary--\n       (A) to support the inspection efforts by the IAEA; and\n       (B) to prevent Iran from further engaging in clandestine \n     nuclear activities;\n       (22) further urges the United Nations Security Council, \n     immediately upon receiving any report from the IAEA regarding \n     the continuing non-compliance of Iran with its obligations, \n     to address the threat to international peace and security \n     posed by Iran's nuclear weapons program and take such action \n     as may be necessary under Article 39, Article 40, and Article \n     41 of the Charter of the United Nations;\n       (23) urges the United Nations Security Council, the Nuclear \n     Suppliers Group, the Zangger Committee, and other relevant \n     international entities to declare that non-nuclear-weapon \n     states under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that commit \n     significant violations of their safeguards agreements \n     regarding uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing or \n     engage in activities intended to support a military nuclear \n     program thereby forfeit their right under the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty to engage in nuclear fuel-cycle \n     activities;\n       (24) further urges the United Nations Security Council, the \n     Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Zangger Committee, the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency, other relevant \n     international entities, and all states party to the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty, including the United States, to \n     seek consensus, no later than the 2005 Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in Geneva, \n     Switzerland, on the best and most equitable means to limit \n     the right of non-nuclear weapons states to engage in those \n     nuclear fuel cycle activities that could contribute to the \n     development of nuclear weapons, while providing those states \n     assured and affordable access to--\n       (A) nuclear reactor fuel and other materials used in \n     peaceful nuclear activities; and\n       (B) spent fuel management; and\n       (25) urges the President to keep Congress fully and \n     currently informed concerning the matters addressed in this \n     resolution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3570\n\n       Strike the preamble and insert the following:\n\n       Whereas it is the policy of the United States to oppose, \n     and urgently to seek the agreement of other nations also to \n     oppose, any transfer to Iran of any goods or technology, \n     including dual-use goods or technology, wherever that \n     transfer could contribute to its acquiring chemical, \n     biological, or nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council decided, in \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, that ``all \n     States shall refrain from providing any form of support to \n     non-State actors that attempt to develop, acquire, \n     manufacture, possess, transport, transfer or use nuclear, \n     chemical, or biological weapons and their means of \n     delivery'';\n       Whereas the United States has imposed sanctions numerous \n     times on persons and entities transferring equipment and \n     technical data to Iran to assist its weapons of mass \n     destruction programs;\n       Whereas on January 1, 1968, Iran signed the Treaty on the \n     Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, \n     London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March \n     5, 1970 (the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'');\n       Whereas Iran, as a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty as a non-nuclear weapons state, is obligated never to \n     develop or acquire nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas Iran did not declare to the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency (IAEA) the existence of the Natanz Pilot Fuel \n     Enrichment Plant and the production-scale Fuel Enrichment \n     Facility under construction at Natanz until February 2003, \n     after the existence of the plant and facility was revealed by \n     an opposition group;\n       Whereas it is estimated that the Natanz Pilot Fuel \n     Enrichment Plant could produce enough highly enriched uranium \n     for a nuclear weapon every year-and-a-half to two years;\n       Whereas it is estimated that the Natanz Fuel Enrichment \n     Facility could, when completed, produce enough highly \n     enriched uranium for as many as 25 to 30 nuclear weapons per \n     year;\n       Whereas, in his report of June 6, 2003, the Director \n     General of the IAEA stated that Iran had failed to meet its \n     obligations under its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA to \n     report all nuclear material imported into Iran--specifically, \n     the importation of uranium hexafluoride, uranium \n     tetrafluoride and uranium dioxide in 1991--the processing and \n     use of that material, and the facilities involved in the use \n     and processing of the material;\n       Whereas the IAEA Director General stated in the same report \n     that Iran had produced uranium metal and was building a \n     uranium metal processing facility, despite the fact that \n     neither its light water reactors nor its planned heavy water \n     reactors require uranium metal for fuel;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors urged Iran in June 2003 \n     to promptly rectify its failures to meet its obligations \n     under its Safeguards Agreement, not to introduce nuclear \n     material into the Natanz Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant, and to \n     cooperate fully with the Agency in resolving questions about \n     its nuclear activities;\n       Whereas the IAEA Director General reported to the Board of \n     Governors of the IAEA in August 2003 that Iran had failed to \n     disclose additional nuclear activities as required by its \n     Safeguards Agreement and continued to fail to resolve \n     questions about its undeclared uranium enrichment activities, \n     including those raised by the detection of two types of \n     highly enriched uranium particles at the Natanz Pilot Fuel \n     Enrichment Plant;\n       Whereas on August 19, 2003, after earlier denials, Iran \n     admitted in a letter that it had carried out uranium \n     conversion experiments in the early 1990's, experiments that \n     included bench scale preparation of uranium compounds and \n     that should have been disclosed to the IAEA in accordance \n     with its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors on September 12, 2003, \n     called on Iran to suspend all further uranium enrichment and \n     any plutonium reprocessing activities, disclose all its \n     nuclear activities, and cooperate fully with the IAEA, and to \n     sign, ratify, and fully implement the Additional Protocol \n     between Iran and the IAEA for the application of safeguards \n     (the ``Additional Protocol'') to strengthen investigation of \n     all nuclear activities within Iran, and requested all third \n     countries to cooperate closely and fully with the IAEA in \n     resolving questions about Iran's nuclear program;\n       Whereas IAEA inspectors and officials continued to confront \n     Iran with discrepancies in its explanations of its nuclear \n     activities;\n       Whereas on October 21, 2003, Iran and the Foreign Ministers \n     of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom issued a joint \n     statement in which Iran indicated that it had decided to \n     suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities as \n     defined by the IAEA;\n       Whereas the Governments of France, Germany, and the United \n     Kingdom promised a dialogue with Iran to ease Iran's access \n     to modern technologies and supplies in a range of areas once \n     certain international concerns regarding Iran are fully \n     resolved;\n       Whereas, in a subsequent letter on October 23, 2003, Iran \n     further admitted that it had tested uranium enrichment \n     centrifuges at the Kalaye Electric Company between 1998 and \n     2002 using its previously undeclared imported uranium \n     hexafluoride;\n       Whereas in that same letter, Iran admitted that it had a \n     laser uranium enrichment program, in which it used 30 \n     kilograms of uranium not previously declared to the IAEA, \n     another violation of its Safeguards Agreement;\n       Whereas Iran indicated initially that its laser enrichment \n     program had achieved uranium enrichment levels of slightly \n     more than 3 percent, but the Director General's report of \n     June 1, 2004, states that the IAEA later learned that Iran \n     ``had been able to achieve average enrichment levels of 8 \n     percent to 9 percent, with some samples of up to \n     approximately 15 percent'';\n       Whereas the June 1, 2004, report states also that Iran's \n     declaration of October 21, 2003, failed to include \n     information that should have been provided, including the \n     fact that ``some samples from'' the laser uranium enrichment \n     project ``had been sent for assessment to the supplier's \n     laboratory'';\n       Whereas, in its letter of October 23, 2003, Iran also \n     admitted that it had irradiated 7 kilograms of uranium \n     dioxide targets and reprocessed them to extract plutonium, \n     another violation of its legal obligation to disclose such \n     activities under its Safeguards Agreement;\n       Whereas Iran told the IAEA on November 10, 2003, that it \n     would sign and ratify the Additional Protocol and would act \n     in accordance with the Additional Protocol pending its entry-\n     into-force;\n       Whereas, on November 10, 2003, Iran further informed the \n     IAEA Director General that it had decided to suspend all \n     enrichment and reprocessing activities in Iran, not to \n     produce feed material for enrichment processes, and not to \n     import enrichment related items;\n       Whereas the IAEA, through its investigative and forensic \n     activities in Iran and elsewhere, has uncovered and \n     confronted Iran about numerous lies concerning its nuclear \n     activities;\n       Whereas the Director General of the IAEA reported to the \n     IAEA Board of Governors on November 10, 2003, that Iran has \n     concealed many aspects of its nuclear activities from the \n     IAEA, in breach of its obligations under its Safeguards \n     Agreement;\n       Whereas, despite Iran's subsequent pledge to, once again, \n     fully disclose all of its nuclear activities to the IAEA, the \n     Director General of the IAEA, in a February 24, 2004, report, \n     found that Iran continued to engage in deception regarding \n     its nuclear activities, including failing to disclose a more \n     sophisticated enrichment program using more advanced \n     enrichment centrifuge technology imported from foreign \n     sources, and providing incomplete and unsupported \n     explanations about experiments to create a highly toxic \n     isotope of polonium that outside experts say is useful as a \n     neutron initiator in nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas the Director General's reports of February 24, \n     2001, and June 1, 2004, stated that environmental samples \n     from one room\n\n[[Page S8798]]\n\n     at the Kalaye Electric Company workshop and from equipment \n     that had been present in that workshop showed more than trace \n     quantities of uranium enriched to 36 percent U-235, despite \n     finding only negligible traces of this on imported centrifuge \n     components, and that the types of uranium contamination at \n     that workshop differed from those found at Natanz, which \n     would appear to contradict Iran's assertion that the source \n     of contamination at both sites is imported centrifuge \n     components and perhaps also its assertion that it has not \n     enriched uranium to more than 1.2 percent U-235 using \n     centrifuge technology;\n       Whereas the Director General stated in the June 1, 2004, \n     report, that ``the contamination is different on domestic and \n     imported centrifuges,'' that ``it is unlikely'' that the 36 \n     percent U-235 contamination was due to components acquired \n     from Iran's principal supplier country, and that ``important \n     information about the P-2 centrifuge programme has frequently \n     required repeated requests, and in some cases continues to \n     involve changing or contradictory information'';\n       Whereas these deceptions by Iran are continuing violations \n     of Iran's Safeguards Agreement and of Iran's previous \n     assurances to the IAEA and the international community of \n     full transparency;\n       Whereas despite Iran's commitment to the IAEA and to \n     France, Germany, and the United Kingdom that it would suspend \n     uranium enrichment activities, it has repeatedly emphasized \n     that this suspension is temporary and continued to \n     manufacture and, until April 2004, to import, uranium \n     enrichment centrifuge parts and equipment, allowing it to \n     resume and expand its uranium enrichment activities whenever \n     it chooses;\n       Whereas the statements on February 25, 2004, of Hassan \n     Rowhani, Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council \n     of Iran, that Iran was not required to reveal to the IAEA its \n     research into more sophisticated ``P2'' uranium enrichment \n     centrifuges, and that Iran has other projects which it has no \n     intention of declaring to the IAEA, are contrary to--\n       (1) Iran's commitment to the IAEA in an October 16, 2003, \n     letter from the Vice President of Iran and the President of \n     Iran's Atomic Energy Organization that Iran would present a \n     ``full picture of its nuclear activities'' and ``full \n     transparency'';\n       (2) Iran's commitment to the foreign ministers of the \n     United Kingdom, France, and Germany of October 21, 2003, to \n     full transparency and to resolve all outstanding issues; and\n       (3) its statement to the IAEA's Board of Governors of \n     September 12, 2003, of its commitment to full transparency \n     and to ``leave no stone unturned'' to assure the IAEA of its \n     peaceful objectives;\n       Whereas Libya received enrichment equipment and technology, \n     and a nuclear weapons design, from the same nuclear black \n     market that Iran has used, raising the question of whether \n     Iran, as well, received a nuclear weapon design that it has \n     refused to reveal to international inspectors;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation has announced that it will \n     soon conclude an agreement to supply Iran with enriched \n     nuclear fuel for the Bushehr nuclear power reactor, which, if \n     implemented, would undercut the international effort to \n     persuade Iran to cease its nuclear weapons development \n     program;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution of March \n     13, 2004, which was adopted unanimously, noted with ``serious \n     concern that the declarations made by Iran in October 2003 \n     did not amount to the complete and final picture of Iran's \n     past and present nuclear programme considered essential by \n     the Board's November 2003 resolution,'' and also noted that \n     the IAEA has discovered that Iran had hidden more advanced \n     centrifuge associated research, manufacturing, and testing \n     activities, two mass spectrometers used in the laser \n     enrichment program, and designs for hot cells to handle \n     highly radioactive materials;\n       Whereas the same resolution also noted ``with equal concern \n     that Iran has not resolved all questions regarding the \n     development of its enrichment technology to its current \n     extent, and that a number of other questions remain \n     unresolved, including the sources of all HEU contamination in \n     Iran; the location, extent and nature of work undertaken on \n     the basis of the advanced centrifuge design; the nature, \n     extent, and purpose of activities involving the planned \n     heavy-water reactor; and evidence to support claims regarding \n     the purpose of polonium-210 experiments'';\n       Whereas Hassan Rowhani on March 13, 2004, declared that \n     IAEA inspections would be indefinitely suspended as a protest \n     against the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution of March 13, \n     2004, and while Iran subsequently agreed to readmit \n     inspectors to one site by March 29, 2004, and to others in \n     mid-April, 2004, including four workshops belonging to the \n     Defence Industries Organization, this suspension calls into \n     serious question Iran's commitment to full transparency about \n     its nuclear activities;\n       Whereas Iran informed the IAEA on April 29, 2004, of its \n     intent to produce uranium hexafluoride in amounts that the \n     IAEA concluded would constitute production of feed material \n     for uranium centrifuges and wrote in a letter of May 18, \n     2004, that its suspension of all uranium enrichment \n     activities ``does not include suspension of production of \n     UF6,'' which contradicted assurances provided in its letter \n     of November 10, 2003;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution of June 18, \n     2004, which was also adopted unanimously, ``deplores'' the \n     fact that ``Iran's cooperation has not been as full, timely \n     and proactive as it should have been'' and ``underlines that, \n     with the passage of time, it is becoming ever more important \n     that Iran work proactively to enable the Agency to gain a \n     full understanding of Iran's enrichment programme by \n     providing all relevant information, as well as by providing \n     prompt access to all relevant places, data and persons'';\n       Whereas the same resolution also expresses regret that \n     Iran's suspension ``commitments have not been comprehensively \n     implemented and calls on Iran immediately to correct all \n     remaining shortcomings'';\n       Whereas the same resolution also calls on Iran, as further \n     confidence-building measures, voluntarily to reconsider its \n     decision to begin production testing at the Uranium \n     Conversion Facility and its decision to start construction of \n     a research reactor moderated by heavy water, as the reversal \n     of those decisions would make it easier for Iran to restore \n     international confidence undermined by past reports of \n     undeclared nuclear activities in Iran;\n       Whereas Iran then announced its decision to resume \n     production of centrifuge components, notwithstanding both the \n     IAEA Board of Governors resolution of September 12, 2003, \n     which called on Iran ``to suspend all further uranium \n     enrichment-related activities,'' and Iran's voluntary \n     suspension of all uranium enrichment activities pursuant to \n     its agreement of October 21, 2003, with the foreign ministers \n     of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany;\n       Whereas Iran's pattern of deception and concealment in \n     dealing with the IAEA, the Foreign Ministers of France, \n     Germany, and the United Kingdom, and the international \n     community, its receipt from other countries of the means to \n     enrich uranium, its use of sources who provided a nuclear \n     weapon design to another country, its production of \n     centrifuge components at Defence Industries Organization \n     workshops, and its repeated breaches of its Safeguards \n     Agreement suggest strongly that Iran has also violated its \n     legal obligation under article II of the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty not to acquire or seek assistance in \n     acquiring nuclear weapons; and\n       Whereas the maintenance or construction by Iran of \n     unsafeguarded nuclear facilities or uranium enrichment or \n     reprocessing facilities will continue to endanger the \n     maintenance of international peace and security and threaten \n     United States national interests: Now,

By Senate Resolution 77 of \nthe 107th Congress, agreed to on April 26, 2001, the Senate authorized \nthe chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, acting jointly, to \nprovide investigative records, obtained by the subcommittee in the \ncourse of its investigation, in response to these requests.\n  Last year, the permanent subcommittee initiated a followup to its \nearlier investigation to evaluate the enforcement and effectiveness of \nkey statutory anti-money laundering provisions, using Riggs Bank of the \nDistrict of Columbia as a case history. The subcommittee held a hearing \non the results of its investigation on July 15 of this year.\n  The subcommittee is seeking authority, like that granted in the 107th \nCongress, to respond to requests from law enforcement and other \ngovernment agencies for access to investigative records obtained by the \nSubcommittee in the course of its recent investigation. This resolution \nwould accordingly authorize the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, acting jointly, to provide copies of its investigative \nrecords from the Riggs Bank investigation in response to such requests.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 407\n\n       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 2004, \n     215,990 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 40,110 \n     women will die from this disease;\n       Whereas it is estimated that about 2,000,000 women were \n     diagnosed with breast cancer in the 1990s, and that in nearly \n     500,000 of those cases, the cancer resulted in death;\n       Whereas African-American women suffer a 30 percent greater \n     mortality from breast cancer than White women and more than a \n     100 percent greater mortality from breast cancer than women \n     from Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian populations;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease as a woman at age 50;\n       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n\n[[Page S8804]]\n\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide safe screening and early \n     detection of breast cancer in many women;\n       Whereas mammography is an excellent method for early \n     detection of localized breast cancer, which has a 5-year \n     survival rate of more than 97 percent;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute and the American \n     Cancer Society continue to recommend periodic mammograms; and\n       Whereas the National Breast Cancer Coalition recommends \n     that each woman and her health care provider make an \n     individual decision about mammography: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 15, 2004, as ``National Mammography \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     day with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8804-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AMENDING TITLES III AND IV OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3463, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3463) to amend titles III and IV of the Social \n     Security Act to improve the administration of unemployment \n     taxes and benefits.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3463, the SUTA \nDumping Prevention Act of 2003. This bill cleared the House on July 14 \nby voice vote, and was held at the desk in the Senate to facilitate its \nquick passage. On July 15, I introduced a companion bill with Senator \nKennedy, S. 2662, and it is cosponsored by Senators Grassley, Baucus, \nEnsign, Levin, Gregg and Murray.\n  SUTA stands for State Unemployment Tax Avoidance. This bill addresses \nemployers who have lowered their State unemployment tax rate by \nchanging their ``experience rating.'' Experience rating is used to \ndetermine an employer's unemployment tax rate. It means that companies \nwho have laid off more workers are required to pay more in State \nunemployment taxes, and companies that have had fewer layoffs pay less. \nExperience rating provides several incentives for employers, including \nencouraging employers to maintain a stable workforce, and an incentive \nto contest claims when employees quit or are fired for cause.\n  This legislation cracks down on employers who intentionally avoid \npaying their fair share of State unemployment taxes. It prohibits \nshifting employees into shell companies with the sole purpose being to \navoid paying the proper amount in unemployment taxes by changing their \nexperience rating. H.R. 3463 ends this abusive practice by requiring \nStates to deter tax rate manipulation and prevent SUTA dumping by \nrequiring that tax rate-related unemployment experience be transferred \nwith a business once it is transferred to another employer. It also \nimposes penalties when the law is violated.\n  SUTA dumping was first exposed in December 2002 by the Labor \nDepartment's Employment and Training Administration. Since then several \nStates have enacted SUTA dumping legislation, including Arkansas, \nMaine, North Carolina and Washington. Though according to the General \nAccounting Office, three-fifths of State unemployment administrators \nindicated their State law is unable to combat the problem.\n  H.R. 3463 also includes language to make sure unemployment insurance \npayments are not fraudulently paid to people who have returned to work. \nThe legislation includes a new hire database provision that authorizes \nStates to access nationwide work history information to ensure that \nworkers on a payroll are not also collecting an unemployment check.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that H.R. 3463 will \ndecrease the Federal deficit by $499 million over 5 years and $510 \nmillion over 10 years. The savings result from increased collections \nfrom employers who are currently engaging in SUTA dumping, and \nadditional savings from eliminating fraudulent unemployment insurance \npayments to employed workers. The SUTA dumping provision will reduce \nthe Federal deficit by $429 million over 10 years, and the new hire \ndatabase provision by $81 million over 10 years.\n  These revenues will be added to unemployment trust funds, which \ninclude triggers that lower unemployment tax rates as trust fund \nbalances rise. Enactment of H.R. 3463 promotes fairness and will lead \nto reduced tax rates for employers who are today overtaxed.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3463) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/22/senate-section/article/S8804-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 409\n\n       Whereas approximately 13,000,000 individuals in the United \n     States have serious long-term health conditions that may \n     force them to seek assistance with daily tasks;\n       Whereas 56 percent of the individuals in the United States \n     with serious long-term health conditions are age 65 or older;\n       Whereas the percentage of the population over the age of 65 \n     is expected to rise from 13 percent in 2004 to 20 percent in \n     2020;\n       Whereas the number of individuals entering the workforce \n     and the number of health care professionals with geriatric \n     training are not keeping pace with the changing demographics;\n       Whereas medicaid paid for 51 percent of total long-term \n     care spending in 2002, as compared to the 15 percent of total \n     long-term care spending paid by medicare;\n       Whereas the long-term care system of the United States, \n     funded largely with Federal and State dollars, will have \n     difficulty supporting the coming demographic shift;\n       Whereas 80 percent of seniors live at home or in community-\n     based settings;\n       Whereas 3,900,000 people of the United States who are over \n     age 65 receive long-term care assistance in home and \n     community settings;\n       Whereas 65 percent of seniors who need long-term care rely \n     exclusively on friends and family, and another 30 percent \n     rely on a combination of paid caregivers and friends or \n     family;\n       Whereas 15 percent of all seniors over the age of 65 suffer \n     from depression;\n       Whereas studies have suggested that 25 to 50 percent of \n     nursing home residents are affected by depression;\n       Whereas approximately 1,450,000 people live in nursing \n     homes in the United States;\n       Whereas by 2018 there will be 3,600,000 seniors in need of \n     a nursing home bed, which will be an increase of more than \n     2,000,000 from 2004;\n       Whereas as many as 60 percent of nursing home residents do \n     not have regular visitors;\n       Whereas older patients with significant symptoms of \n     depression have significantly higher health care costs than \n     seniors who are not depressed;\n       Whereas people who are depressed tend to be withdrawn from \n     their community, friends, and family;\n       Whereas the Corporation for National and Community Service \n     (CNS) Senior Corps programs currently provide seniors with \n     the opportunity to serve their communities through the \n     Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, Foster Grandparent \n     Program, and Senior Companion Program;\n       Whereas through the Senior Companion Program in particular, \n     in the 2002 to 2003 program year, more than 17,000 low-income \n     seniors volunteered their time assisting 61,000 frail elderly \n     and homebound individuals who have difficulty completing \n     daily tasks;\n       Whereas numerous volunteer organizations across the United \n     States enable Americans of all ages to participate in similar \n     activities;\n       Whereas Faith in Action, 1 volunteer organization, brings \n     together 40,000 volunteers of many faiths to serve 60,000 \n     homebound people with long-term health needs or disabilities \n     across the country, 64 percent of whom are 65 years of age or \n     older;\n       Whereas the thousands of volunteers that, through the \n     Senior Companion Program and volunteer organizations \n     nationwide, provide\n\n[[Page S8806]]\n\n     companionship and assistance to frail elderly individuals and \n     homebound seniors, deserve to be commended for their work;\n       Whereas the demand for these services outstrips the number \n     of volunteers, and organizations are seeking to enlist more \n     individuals in the United States in the volunteer effort;\n       Whereas companionship and assistance programs for seniors \n     with long-term health needs offer many demonstrated benefits, \n     such as: allowing frail elderly individuals to remain in \n     their homes; enabling seniors to maintain independence for as \n     long as possible; providing encouragement and friendship to \n     lonely seniors; and providing relief to family caregivers;\n       Whereas regular visitation and assistance is the best way \n     of assuring seniors that they have not been forgotten, and \n     State and local recognition of regular visitation programs \n     can call further attention to the importance of volunteering \n     on an ongoing basis; and\n       Whereas a month dedicated to service for seniors and \n     recognized across the United States will call attention to \n     volunteer organizations serving seniors and provide a \n     platform for recruitment efforts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2004 as ``Service for Seniors \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the need for companionship and assistance \n     with daily tasks among seniors with long-term health \n     conditions throughout the year, and encourages the people of \n     the United States to volunteer regularly with homebound frail \n     elderly or at a nursing home or long-term care facility;\n       (3) encourages volunteer organizations that offer \n     companionship and assistance to seniors to incorporate \n     ``Service for Seniors Month'' in their recruitment efforts;\n       (4) encourages individuals in the United States to \n     volunteer in these service organizations in order to give \n     back to a generation that sacrificed so much;
