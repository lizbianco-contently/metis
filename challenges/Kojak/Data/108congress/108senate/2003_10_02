Following that time, the Senate \nwill resume consideration of the supplemental appropriations for Iraq \nsecurity.

I understand there are a number of Members on both sides of \nthe aisle who will want to speak to that amendment. Additional votes \nwill occur throughout the day as we work through the pending \namendments.\n  I thank the two managers for their efforts thus far. I believe there \nis an understanding to rotate back and forth on the amendments and that \nwill help to keep an orderly process throughout.\n  I look forward to another day of constructive debate, and I encourage \nMembers to communicate with the chairman and ranking member if they \ndesire to offer an amendment to the bill. We need to work through these \namendments in a sequential way, one at a time, so it is helpful if \nSenators will work in advance to schedule consideration of their \namendments.\n  In addition, there are four judges who are ready for consideration. I \nlook forward to talking to the leadership on the other side of the \naisle as to an appropriate time that we can schedule votes for them as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12305-7", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, while the majority leader is on the floor, I \nwas thinking of the words spoken by the Chaplain this morning. It came \nto my mind that there haven't been enough accolades extended. There \nwere others involved, but the two I know involved were you and Senator \nMikulski, working to have this fine man brought here as the Senate \nChaplain.\n  I have been able to visit with him on a couple of occasions and of \ncourse every morning to hear the wonderful prayers he utters on behalf \nof the Senate and the country. I simply want to extend thanks to \nSenator Mikulski and you and any others involved in this selection. \nHere is a man who is qualified to do so many different things. There \naren't many people who can be referred to as ``doctor,'' ``chaplain,'' \n``admiral,'' but Dr. Black can be, because he is all three and probably \na lot more.\n  So I think, even though so much goes unsaid around here, this is \nsomething that should be said. This is a great addition to the Senate \nfamily. I, on behalf of the entire Senate, extend my\n\n[[Page S12306]]\n\nappreciation to you and Senator Mikulski, who was so enthused about \nthis man when she told us who the chaplain was going to be.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the comments by the \nassistant Democratic leader. I will just briefly add to that, because \nso many of our colleagues do have the opportunity to be with the \nChaplain in many ways that America doesn't see. Just two nights ago we \nwere at an event for adoption from foster homes. Our colleagues and \nothers see the Chaplain open this body every day. That is something \nthat is apparent. What they don't see is the fellowship, the \ncontributions, the nights, like two nights ago, where the Chaplain \nrepresented, yes, the Senate; yes, the Congress; but indeed the United \nStates at events at night, giving the invocation before 900 people, 6 \nblocks from here in the Reagan Building.\n  He is the 62nd Chaplain, a great heritage to follow. We are delighted \nto be able to have his fellowship, his leadership, and his counsel as \nwe go forth each day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12306-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The whole issue of the $87 billion is so misunderstood by \nmost of the American people, I would like to try to put it in a context \nthat is more understandable. First of all, you are talking about $87 \nbillion, of which $66 billion is going back into the military. Most of \nthat is rebuilding the military for what happened to the military \nduring the 1990s, and to rebuild it, to get us up to be able to meet \nthe challenges that are very serious today. I would like to go into \nmore detail on that, but there is not time in this 5 minutes.\n  But I would say this, of the $87 billion--and you take away the $66 \nbillion--we are talking about $20 billion, less $5 billion. It is very \nimportant we understand this; $5 billion of this will be going toward \nborder security, having nothing to do with rebuilding infrastructure, \nrebuilding any of the water systems, electrical systems, the highways, \nthe other infrastructure systems we are going to have to get done.\n  It leaves $15 billion.\n  The big discussion here is--and I know it sounds good to the American \npeople and it sounds good to my wife--with all of the potential oil \nrevenues, why don't we restructure this as a loan as opposed to a \ngrant? There is very good reason for that.\n  CSIS has come up with an analysis of the debt that is owed currently \nby Iraq. It is not just $140 billion or the $200 billion figure you \nhave heard. When you put the claims in there that would have to be \nsubordinate to the $383 billion, if we do restructure this as a loan, \nit would come in only after $383 billion has been repaid by some \nsource. We all know logically that would never ever happen. But the \nrewards of expending this $15 billion and doing it quickly, as the \nPresident is requesting, are immense. To have a friend in that country \nof Iraq in the Middle East would have a great benefit for us.\n  When you stop to think about just the cost of petroleum for the no-\nfly zone, that amounts to $15 billion each decade. If we don't do this, \nwe are going to be right back in that box where we didn't finish the \njob we should have finished in 1991 and 1996. Now is the time to finish \nthe job.\n  I suggest to you that the greatest disservice we could do to our \ntroops on the ground over in Iraq would be to stall this thing, to not \nget over there and put the necessary money in to fix the \ninfrastructure.\n  I am not sure how many people in this body know how much our troops \nare doing. They are actually putting roofs on buildings, they are \nactually constructing houses, and they are doing things on their own \nwith their own labor. They desperately need to have us come in and make \nthe necessary fixes.\n  We have had a success story. My gosh, we have had over 5,000 \nbusinesses started. The hospitals and clinics are now open. The schools \nopened 2 days ago, and 56,000 Iraqis are now working in the security \ncontrol system.\n  All of this can continue only if we get the $15 billion over there \nfor the reparations and to take care of the infrastructure. If we don't \ndo that, we are leaving our troops out there in a very dangerous \nsituation.\n  I would like for everyone to remember their history a little bit.\n  The Treaty of Versailles was in 1919, at the end of World War I. \nFrance insisted on leaving $32 billion in debt for the Germans to pay. \nAs a result of being covered up with debt and knowing there was no \npossible way out, they became ripe for Hitler to come along. And we \nknow the rest of the story.\n  That is the same situation we are facing in Iraq right now. If we \ndon't come to the table with the $15 billion and get in there and start \nrepairing the infrastructure and continue the success we have had so \nfar, and do it immediately, then we are going to leave our troops \nhanging out there to dry.\n  For the sake of national security, the most significant thing we \nprobably will be dealing with--certainly in this year and maybe during \nour entire careers--is to get the money in there and get the job done, \nand this time not do what we did in 1991 or 1996 but finish the job and \nbring this country back up so it can be our ally in the Middle East.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, one of the anecdotes about politics I \nenjoy the most and that I think is most illustrative of some of the \nsituation that is going on now with respect to Iraq relates to the late \nPauline Kael. She was the movie editor for the New Yorker magazine. In \n1972, when Richard Nixon won an overwhelming and historic victory in \nthe Presidential election, carrying every single State except \nMassachusetts and the District of Columbia, Pauline Kael was terribly \nsurprised. She said when commenting on this: Nixon can't possibly have \nwon. I don't know a single person who voted for him.\n  There might be some who will say that speaks well of her circle of \nfriends, but it demonstrates that she lived in a very tight \nintellectual circle and had no real contact with what was happening in \nthe country as a whole.\n  I cite that because I think that is what is happening with respect to \nreporting in Iraq right now. I had an experience over the weekend which \nI will share briefly before I yield the remainder of our morning \nbusiness time to the Senator from Texas.\n  An old friend from Utah and his wife came to Washington on a tourist \nvisit, and I took them around to the various monuments. This man and \nhis wife expressed great concern about Iraq. The wife said: We have \nreal problems in\n\n[[Page S12307]]\n\nIraq. I said: Yes, we do. Tell me what they are, from your perspective.\n  She said: People are dying all the time, and we are making no \nprogress whatsoever, and we have no plan of making progress. We are in \nreal trouble in Iraq. I said to her: Let me ask you a few things. I \nsaid: Are you aware of the fact that about 90 percent of the country is \npeaceful and that the attacks on Americans are taking place only in \nwhat is known as the Sunni Triangle, which goes from Baghdad to Tikrit, \nand that outside of the Sunni Triangle Americans are not being attacked \nand killed? She said: No, I didn't know that.\n  I said: Which country do you think is providing the most troops other \nthan America to help fight for security in Iraq? She said: I guess it \nis the British. I said: No, it is not the British. Not the British? Is \nthere another country that has more troops in Iraq fighting for Iraq \nbesides the British? I said: Yes. It is the Iraqis. She said: What do \nyou mean? Why, there are close to 50,000 Iraqis under arms providing \nsecurity support for Americans. She said: I didn't know that.\n  I said: How many schools do you think have been reopened since the \nwar? She said: I assume probably none. I said: No. I said: 90 percent \nof the schools and hospitals are now operating. She said: I didn't \nknow.\n  I will not prolong the time because the Senator from Texas wishes to \nspeak. But the point is that we have in the American press today a lot \nof Pauline Kaels, someone who said, I don't know a single person who \nvoted for Richard Nixon, in the face of the most historic landslide we \nhad with Richard Nixon. We have press people who are telling us what is \ngoing on in Iraq who don't know anybody who has anything good to say \nabout what is going on in Iraq.\n  I have said before and I will conclude with this: During the height \nof hostilities in Iraq, to watch television, it was clear we were \nlosing the war on CNN. But, fortunately, we won it on Fox. Ultimately, \nthe fact that we won came through even to the CNN executives.\n\n  I think the good things that are happening in Iraq will eventually \ncome through, even to the people at CNN and the New York Times and some \nof the other places that are living in a Pauline Kael world.\n  I yield the remainder of our morning business time to the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I inquire how much time remains on our \nside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas has 20 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the President, and I thank the Senator from Utah \nfor the courtesy and the opportunity to rise to say a few words about \nthe President's budget request.\n  I want to be clear about this. The sooner we accomplish our mission \nof securing Iraq and freeing the economy and stabilizing the \ngovernment, the sooner our young men and women will be able to come \nhome and we can turn Iraq over to the Iraqis so that they can enjoy the \nblessings of self-government and liberty.\n  By the same token, the longer we delay in voting on this supplemental \nrequest, the longer we delay in getting money that is needed both to \nsupport our troops and to restructure that troubled region and the \nlonger it will be before our troops will be able to come home to their \nfamilies. Slowing this funding request merely delays the return of our \ntroops from harm's way. And that should not be the role of the Senate, \neither unintentionally or otherwise.\n  We all know that the Congress voted to authorize the President to use \nnecessary force to remove Saddam Hussein's regime last November. But \nthere are some in this body today who appear to be playing the politics \nof the moment, making claims that seem to exploit for political gain \nthe hardships that our military is enduring in serving the cause of \nfreedom. This is nothing more than crass political games. They \ncertainly have no place in this body.\n\n  I have the utmost respect and regard for my fellow Senators. Yet I \nmust confess that I am dumbfounded at how soon some have appeared to \nforget the truth of Saddam's vile regime. The fundamental question we \nought to be asking is, Are the Iraqi people better off today than they \nwere under Saddam's regime? The answer to that is unequivocally yes. \nAre the American people safer today than they were when Saddam was in \npower? Again, the answer is unequivocally yes. The only remaining \nquestion is, Have we finished the job we started with Saddam's ouster? \nThe answer to that question is no. But we must and we will.\n  I had the honor of traveling to Iraq with members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee last June. I was sickened by the inhumanity \nevidenced by the mass graves, holding some 300,000 Iraqis and others \nwho were victims of Saddam's regime. I was also shocked to learn from a \nU.N. representative that there are some 1.5 million people simply \nmissing. We do not know whether they are dead or alive.\n  The suggestion in the face of these silent witnesses that Iraq, the \nMiddle East, indeed the entire free world, are not better off today \nthan before we took Saddam down is simply false.\n  Today there is religious freedom and human rights in Iraq unlike \nanything experienced during Saddam's regime. The Iraqi people now have \nhope, they have a future, something that must have seemed only like a \ndream to them a few short months ago.\n  I am proud to commend President Bush for the resolute leadership that \nhe has demonstrated in pursuing the war on terror both in Iraq and \naround the world. Everyone who has been engaged in this fight, whether \nit is the most junior recruit or the Commander in Chief, is doing a \nremarkable job under extraordinarily difficult circumstances. I \nstrongly believe we must remain committed to finishing the job in Iraq \nby supporting this supplemental.\n  I ask those who oppose this supplemental or who want to slow it down \nor who want to cut it in pieces and engage in lengthy delay, what is \nthe message America sends to our enemies in the war on terror if we are \nshaken in our commitment? Do we doubt our mission so easily? Do our \ninternational commitments mean so little? We did not undertake the war \nagainst terror because it was easy. We undertook it because it was the \nright thing to do, because it was necessary to make America safer.\n  As I said, there are some in the Senate who have advocated separating \nthe moneys requested in this $87 billion supplemental between \nassistance to the troops and reconstruction of Iraq. I am opposed to \nany such separation and I am glad we voted down an amendment yesterday \non that issue. Some argue that we should loan the money to Iraq instead \nof providing it to Iraq in the form of a grant--that is, that portion \nthat should go to reconstruction. If we are to get our young men and \nwomen in uniform back home as soon as possible, which should be our \ngoal, and turn the government over to the Iraqi people as soon as \npossible, which should also be our goal, we should not allow for any \ndelay in the delivery of these funds.\n  General Abizaid, the CENTCOM commander, testified before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee that these reconstruction funds are \ninextricably intertwined with the security of our men and women on the \nground.\n\n  I also believe it would be foolish to extract what would be only an \nillusory guarantee of loan repayment, and the delay in getting such \nloan funds to those who need it on the ground will likely jeopardize \nthe security of our troops, according to General Abizaid.\n  The economic assistance and the reconstruction support requested \ntoday are essential to the success and security of our troops and \nessential to our success in Iraq. We must build up Iraqi security, we \nmust gain the confidence of the Iraqi people by improving the \ninfrastructure, and we must begin the capacity to deal with all of the \nthreats they face on the ground.\n  I share my colleagues' concerns and their sense of fiscal \nresponsibility when dealing with taxpayer dollars. I strongly believe \nwe should be good stewards of the taxpayers' money at all times. I wish \nthis newfound concern pervaded all aspects of our fiscal \nresponsibilities in Congress, not just this one. We cannot preach \nfiscal restraint on one hand and practice fiscal irresponsibility on \nthe other. True, responsibility cannot depend on political convenience.\n\n[[Page S12308]]\n\n  The numbers we are dealing with today are hard for many to grasp but \nboil down to the American taxpayer, according to a recent USA Today \narticle, this way: Each year American households spend about 1 percent \nof their income on alcoholic beverages, another 1 percent on tobacco \nproducts, and we spent about .7 percent of our income on cosmetics. To \nput it into context, if this request were approved, our combined \noperations to combat terror in the Middle East and Afghanistan will \nhave cost .8 percent of our income next year, a bit more than we \nannually spend on makeup and shampoo and a bit less than we annually \nspend on alcohol and tobacco. Significant? Yes. Budget busting? No. \nWorth it? Yes.\n  The American people are well aware that we are engaged in a \nPresidential election season and they recognize the difference between \nthose with an honest difference of opinion and those who seek to \nexploit the President's handling of the war purely in order to gain \npolitical advantage. I find something particularly unsavory about the \ncomments of those who seek political advantage in questioning our \ncommitment to our troops and our dedication to winning the war on \nterror. Those who spend their time playing political games with our \nmission in Iraq, even as our young men and women labor to secure and \nstabilize that fledgling nation, do a dishonor not only to themselves \nbut to our soldiers in the field and the memories of those who have \nsacrificed everything they had opposing Saddam's blood thirsty regime.\n  There are clearly obstacles to overcome in Iraq and there will \ncertainly be setbacks along the way, as we have seen. I only hope the \npolitics of the moment do not drive criticism that only serves to \nundermine our commitment to winning the war on terror and American \nresolve. We must not cut and run. We must not leave the Iraqi people \nwith a promise unfulfilled. We owe it to our young men and women in \nuniform to give them our unequivocal support as they labor on in a \ndangerous place for an honorable cause.\n  Our troops, I am convinced, have the will to win. I only hope our \npoliticians share that will to win.\n  As President Kennedy said 42 years ago:\n\n       Let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill, \n     that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any \n     hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the \n     survival and the success of liberty.\n\n  I only wish those who are consciously or not intent on denying our \ntroops what they need to finish the job and to get home as soon as \npossible will stop to reconsider. We have liberated Iraq of Saddam \nHussein and now we must simply finish the job. We seek to make Iraq \nsecure, to make it a place where the rule of law can be established so \nthat civilian leaders, including the Iraqi Governing Council, can \nestablish a new government for a new nation. This is not an easy task \nand it is not without cost. But it must be done, so Iraq can flourish \nas a free nation, and so that the victories won, the lives lost, will \nnot be in vain.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I understand Senator Dole is coming to the \nfloor, and I just want to, until she gets here, say a few words about \nwhat happened at the Environment and Public Works Committee yesterday \nwhen the confirmation of Governor Leavitt of Utah was being considered.\n  I have the honor of serving on four committees in the Senate, \nincluding the Judiciary Committee, which, as we all know, has proven to \nbe a particularly contentious committee, with the unprecedented \nfilibuster of some of President Bush's most highly qualified nominees.\n  But yesterday, for the first time, we saw some of the politics of the \nJudiciary Committee, the obstructionism there, pervading the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, for the first time, when it \ncame to considering and voting on the nomination of Governor Leavitt of \nUtah to serve as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency. Rather than have a debate, rather than have an honest debate, \nand then an up-or-down vote on this important nomination, what we saw \nwas simply a boycott. Members of the committee on the other side of the \naisle simply decided not to show up, making it impossible for us to \nachieve a quorum and impossible for us to vote on the confirmation of \nGovernor Leavitt.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand how those who claim to be \npro-environment would simply obstruct the confirmation of a highly \nqualified nominee and leave the Environmental Protection Agency \nheadless. Denying leadership to that large agency concerned with the \nprotection of our environment and enforcement of our environmental laws \nand claiming to be pro-environment strikes me as inconsistent.\n\n  So I fear that as the primary season approaches for the Presidential \nrace in 2004, what we are seeing again is the unfortunate intrusion of \nPresidential election politics into the work of the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, what that means is the people's work is not being \ndone; the Environmental Protection Agency is denied the confirmation of \na highly qualified nominee and is left leaderless. Certainly that \ncannot be pro-environment under any stretch of the imagination.\n  Some said there were 400 questions in writing that had been submitted \nto Governor Leavitt, which, in fact, he did his best to answer. But at \nleast one Senator said: Well, I don't really care about the answers to \nthe questions. I am going to vote to confirm him, but I want him to go \nthrough the exercise of answering those questions anyway so we can get \nhim on record.\n  Well, the problem is that the nominee is somebody who has not yet \nserved in that position. He is hobbled, to some extent, to be able to \nanswer some of the questions that have been proposed. So he has to say: \nWell, if confirmed as Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, I will do everything within my power to investigate this issue, \nand to get to the bottom of it, and to respond to your concern, \nSenator.\n  But, otherwise, he is left without the opportunity for an up-or-down \nvote, and the EPA is left without a head--hardly a place where we need \nto be. We would not be in that condition if it were not for \nPresidential election politics pervading yet another committee's work \nwhen it is concerned with the protection of our environment.\n  I know in the Judiciary Committee this morning we have another \nnominee of the President who we are going to take back up, Judge \nCharles Pickering. It remains to be seen whether Judge Pickering's name \nwill be added to the growing list of those who are being denied an up-\nor-down vote in this body because a minority of the Senate refuses to \nallow that up-or-down vote--an unprecedented act of obstruction and \nsomething which has not occurred before the obstruction of Miguel \nEstrada's nomination, that of Priscilla Owen, that of Bill Pryor. I \nhope that list is not further lengthened by adding the name of Charles \nPickering.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I was not planning on speaking this morning. \nHowever, my friend from Texas, the junior Senator from Texas, talked \nabout something that I think deserves a response.\n\n[[Page S12309]]\n\n  The Senator from Texas said--and I quote--there has been ``an \nunprecedented act of obstruction.'' He is referring to President Bush's \nnominees being withheld, not allowing votes on judges.\n  Mr. President, I do not know--and I do not mean this to be cute or \nsmart or mean spirited, but I do not know what kind of math my friend \nfrom Texas is using if he is talking about unprecedented acts of \nobstruction.\n  Right now in the Federal judiciary there is a 5-percent vacancy rate. \nWe have four judges on the calendar now, and they will be approved \nwithin the next, probably, 24 hours. So that will bring the number of \njudges approved during the Bush administration to nearly 170. I do not \nhave the exact number. I have lost track of it but nearly 170.\n  Three judges have been turned down: Bill Pryor from Alabama, Miguel \nEstrada from the District of Columbia, and Priscilla Owen from Texas.\n  Unprecedented obstructionism? We are talking about 170 to 3. So my \nmath indicates that is pretty good.\n  When Senator Daschle took control of the Senate as majority leader, a \ndecision was made that there would be no payback. It would not be \npayback time. In fact, a decision was made that we would do everything \nwe could to get the nominations approved that were sent to us by \nPresident Bush. We have done that. The record is clear.\n  However, my friend from Texas should go back and look at how \nPresident Clinton was treated. People waited for years and years and \nwere not even allowed a hearing. As we know, it was necessary on a \nnumber of occasions to file cloture. Cloture was invoked, and the \njudges were approved.\n  It is easy to come on the Senate floor and throw out terms such as \n``unprecedented acts of obstructionism,'' but it is not true. No matter \nhow many times you say it, it still is not true.\n  Pat Leahy, who has been the chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee during the approximately 3 years of the Bush \nPresidency, has done an outstanding job of moving these judges. I don't \nknow how we could do better. I guess we could be a rubber stamp for the \nPresident's nominees. That is not what the Founding Fathers envisioned. \nThey believed these names should be submitted to the Senate. The Senate \nshould evaluate them and make a decision at that time whether or not \nthe nominees are what the country should have in the way of judges.\n  A decision was made in the case of Miguel Estrada. He didn't answer \nquestions. He would not supply his memoranda from his time as Solicitor \nGeneral. For those and other reasons, he was not approved. Priscilla \nOwen was criticized by the President's own lawyer, Mr. Gonzales, who is \nnow the White House chief lawyer. He and Priscilla Owen served together \non the Texas Supreme Court. She was criticized very heavily by Mr. \nGonzales at that time. That is just a little bit of her problem. We \nknow that she, by almost any standard, was quite radical--an activist, \nfor lack of a better word. And we know Attorney General Pryor from \nAlabama was someone whose record was not such that he should become a \nlifetime appointment on the Federal bench.\n  That is 3, 3 to approximately 170. I do not know the exact number, \nbut that is fairly close. By any math course you ever took, 170 to 3 is \npretty good. In fact, it is real good. I wish we had had that kind of \ntreatment when Bill Clinton was President.\n  I again remind everyone the vacancy rate in the Federal judiciary is \nnow 5 percent. It is the best it has been in decades. Rather than \nhaving people come and push these little barbs at the Democrats on the \nJudiciary Committee, they should be giving them accolades for the \ncooperation they have maintained during President Bush's tenure.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina wishes to speak as in morning business.

Mr. President, many of my colleagues and I have been \nurging the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to review \nand investigate the leak that revealed the identity of an undercover \nCIA agent. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nresponded by saying that we are blowing things out of proportion, that \nour motives are political. I have to disagree. This is a serious issue, \nand it is not just those on my side of the aisle who have concerns \nabout the obvious conflict of interest for the Justice Department to \ninvestigate this matter on its own.\n  I am referring to the Washington Post-ABC poll that was released. The \npoll found that nearly 7 in 10 Americans believe a special type of \nprosecutor should be named to investigate allegations that the Bush \nadministration officials illegally leaked the name of an undercover CIA \nagent. The survey found that 81 percent of Americans considered the \nmatter serious, while 72 percent thought it was likely that someone in \nthe White House leaked the agent's name. It's clear the people of this \ncountry want a full, fair and independent investigation.\n  I would also like to take a minute to respond to comments from my \ncolleague from Minnesota that were made earlier Wednesday. I believe he \nmay have been misinformed. I wanted to make sure my colleague from \nMinnesota was clear on the difference between an independent counsel \nand a special counsel. Yesterday I had again stated the need for the \nAttorney General to appoint a special counsel to investigate this leak \nregarding an undercover CIA agent. We all know that a Federal law was \nbroken--that is clear--a law that provides for stiff penalties, \nimprisonment, and fines. It is a Federal crime, under the Intelligence \nIdentities and Protection Act of 1982 to intentionally disclose \ninformation identifying a covert agent to anyone not authorized to \nreceive this classified information.\n  Columnist Robert Novak printed that information. We need to know who \nthe senior administration official or officials were that gave him that \ninformation. But we also need to find out who gave that information to \nthe administration officials.\n  Let me be clear about this. There is a cancer spreading in this \nadministration. Most have focused only on who it was who gave the name \nof the undercover agent to Mr. Novak, the columnist. Clearly that is \nillegal. But there is another question behind that. How did that \nindividual or individuals get access to this classified information \nabout this undercover agent? Who gave that individual this information? \nDid it come from the National Security Council? Did it come from the \nState Department? Did it come from the CIA itself? Did someone in the \nWhite House request this dossier on Mr. Wilson and his wife? Or was it \nvoluntarily given to them by someone in the CIA or the National \nSecurity Council or somewhere else? This is an even deeper question \nbecause it goes to what they wanted this information for. Why would \nindividuals high in the administration want the information about who \nwas\n\n[[Page S12310]]\n\nan undercover agent and who was not, unless they had the intention of \nusing that information to intimidate Mr. Wilson, to put a chilling \neffect on those who might want to disagree with this administration's \nposition on Iraq.\n\n  That, I believe, is another concern we have--the chilling effect. The \ngreatest weapon we have in our fight against international terrorism is \nnot a ballistic missile, it is not this missile defense shield that \npeople want to build over this country, it is not our laser-guided \nbombs; the best weapon we have against international terrorism is the \nintelligence and information we get from agents in the field around the \nglobe, working with our friends and allies and others, so that we can \nget to the terrorists in their incubation, before they are able to \ncarry out their dastardly deeds, break up their cells, break up their \nlines of communication. It is the intelligence and information that we \nneed to win this battle against terrorism.\n  If, however, one of our agents in the field and all that agent's \ncontacts now think that at some time this administration, or an \nadministration in the future, can ``out'' them, release their name, \nthen that puts kind of a damper on whether or not they are going to get \ninformation. That could put people's lives in jeopardy, put them at \nrisk in the future.\n  For example, the woman who was outed, Valerie Plame, had in fact \ntraveled overseas as an undercover agent. I assume now people will be \nlooking at whom she contacted, whom she talked to, who were her sources \nof information. This is not, as I said the other day, some little real \nestate deal out in Arkansas. This is not just some President \nphilandering with some White House aide. This has to do with the \nsecurity of our country.\n  According to the Washington Post, a senior administration official \ntold the Post that before Novak's column appeared, two top White House \nofficials called at least six journalists and disclosed the identity of \nthe CIA agent. Now the Justice Department is investigating.\n  So let's get this straight. The Attorney General, appointed by the \nPresident, is investigating the President's office. As I said \nyesterday, and I say again this morning, if an investigation ever cried \nout for a special counsel, this is it. Again, I point to an article \nthat appeared on the front page of the New York Times today, which \nsaid: Attorney General is closely linked to inquiry figures. Rove was a \nconsultant. Deep political ties between top White House aides and \nAttorney General John Ashcroft have put him into a delicate position as \nthe Justice Department begins a full investigation into whether \nadministration officials illegally disclosed the name of an undercover \nCIA agent. Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political advisor, whose possible \nrole in the case has raised questions, was a paid consultant to three \nof Mr. Ashcroft's campaigns in Missouri--twice for Governor and for \nUnited States Senator in the 1980s and 1990s. Jack Oliver, the deputy \nfinance chairman of Mr. Bush's 2004 reelection campaign, was the \ndirector of Mr. Ashcroft's 1994 Senate campaign and later worked as Mr. \nAshcroft's deputy chief of staff.\n  Does anyone really believe that this Attorney General can, with a \nstraight face, say they are going to investigate these people when they \nwork for them and they have close ties? As I said, a special counsel is \nneeded desperately.\n  In response yesterday morning, when I called for this, my colleague \nfrom Minnesota accused some of my colleagues and me of ``rank political \nhypocrisy'' when it comes to calling for a special counsel. He said \nthis, and I quote from the Record today:\n\n       I'm a slight student of history. I believe in 1999 there \n     was an effort in this body, led by Senator Collins from \n     Maine, a bipartisan effort to put in place a provision to \n     allow for a special prosecutor. And it was blocked. It was \n     stopped by the very same folks today that are talking about \n     needs for a special prosecutor. I think, and I am going to be \n     very blunt here, what we are hearing is a little rank \n     political hypocrisy when it comes to calls for a special \n     prosecutor.\n\n  That is in the Congressional Record today from Senator Coleman of \nMinnesota. I think Senator Coleman needs to brush up on his history. In \n1999, the independent counsel law expired. Republicans were in charge \nof the Senate and they chose not to reauthorize it. This law allows the \nAttorney General to recommend an independent counsel, to lead an \ninvestigation, and a three-judge panel chooses that counsel. That \nindependent counsel was accountable to no one. It had its own staff, \nbudget, and missions. The investigations could go on indefinitely.\n\n  My main problem with the Office of Independent Counsel was that the \ninvestigations could go on forever, with a bottomless budget that \ntaxpayers had to pay. The Collins alternative was a step in the right \ndirection, which limited the time on these investigations. But the \nRepublican leadership never scheduled a vote--never scheduled a vote.\n  By the way, former independent counsel Kenneth Starr opposed renewing \nthat law. Regardless, appointing an independent counsel or prosecutor \nis not what I have been talking about. I don't believe I've ever \nmentioned appointing an independent counsel. I have said the Attorney \nGeneral should appoint a special counsel. There is a big difference. \nThe Attorney General alone can appoint an outside special counsel if he \nbelieves there is an inherent conflict of interest or if he deems it is \nin the public interest for a special counsel to be appointed. The \nspecial counsel reports to the Attorney General, who pays the counsel's \nsalary and the salary of his or her staff.\n  The key to the special counsel is this. At the end of the \ninvestigation, the Attorney General must report to Congress all \ninstances where he blocked the special counsel from taking an action, \nsuch as subpoenaing documents or putting a witness before a grand jury. \nThat is the kind of balance we need in this kind of situation, when the \nadministration is obligated to investigate itself.\n  So I think the Senator from Minnesota not only needs to brush up on \nhis history but also definitions. It was an entirely different issue in \n1999. The law had expired. The Republican majority did not move to \nreauthorize it and to even call for a vote to reauthorize the \nindependent counsel law. Quite frankly, I am one of those who don't \nbelieve in these independent counsels because they go on forever and \nthey are accountable to no one. They can investigate whatever they \nwant. That is not what I am calling for.\n  What I am calling for is the Attorney General to use the authority he \nhas under the law to appoint a special counsel, someone of prominence, \nsomeone of integrity, someone who would assure the American people the \ninvestigation will be done fairly, objectively, and thoroughly, and let \nthe chips fall where they may. It would not go on forever. The Attorney \nGeneral decides the salary and the pay and how much staff. But the key \nis this: The special counsel would have, under the auspices of the \nAttorney General, the ability to subpoena witnesses, to subpoena \ndocuments and records, to take a person before a grand jury. The \nAttorney General could say no and stop it, but at least we would know \nthat. The people of America would know whether or not the Attorney \nGeneral stopped the special counsel from getting certain documents or \nreferring a witness to a grand jury. Therein lies the check and balance \nthat is so important to making sure we have an open and transparent \nsystem of Government.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is time we have a special counsel.\n  I am honored to yield to my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend this question: If someone within the CIA \nhad divulged the name of this operative, that person, it seems to me, \nwould be subject to criminal penalties and would be considered a \ntraitor; is that true?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I know the person would be subject to criminal penalties. \nI am not certain I know the definition of a ``traitor,'' but I think it \nwould be closely akin to that. I don't want to make a statement. I \ndon't know the absolute definition of ``traitor,'' I say to my friend. \nObviously, it would be subject to penalties. We have Aldrich Ames right \nnow spending his life in prison without parole because he divulged the \nname of operatives, undercover agents, whose associates and others were \nkilled in the former Soviet Union, and Aldrich Ames today is where he \nought to be: in prison for life without parole.\n\n[[Page S12311]]\n\n  The same applies here, it would seem to me, I say to my friend from \nNevada, that this is a case where not only someone in the CIA but \nanyone in a position who has access to this classified information \nwould be subject to this. Again, I say to my friend from Nevada, since \nhe is on the floor, I really think many of the people who are inquiring \nabout this are stopping short because they are only focusing on who \ngave the information to Mr. Novak. There is a deeper and I think even \nmore profound question to be asked: How did those individuals in the \nadministration get that classified information? How did they come by \nthat information to know this Valerie Plame was an undercover agent? \nThat raises very serious questions.\n  Mr. REID. If I can answer and ask a question. First of all, Webster's \ncompact dictionary I have in my desk says a traitor is one who betrays \ntrust. So certainly if a CIA agent leaked to the press the name of one \nof his colleagues who is an undercover agent, he would be a traitor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I accept that definition. I say to my friend, my feelings \nand my senses are that someone with this kind of information who leaked \nit I think has violated the law and betrayed the government and the \ncitizens of the United States.\n  Mr. REID. The next question I ask my friend: So if a CIA operative \nwould be subject to criminal penalties and would be considered a \ntraitor for doing this activity, certainly someone working within the \nadministration, within the White House, would be considered the same; \nis that not true?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the Senator from Nevada has it exactly right. \nThat is true, they would be considered the same. I thank the Senator \nfor asking the question because it does clarify a point.\n  If I can take off from what the Senator from Nevada just asked me--\nand it is a good point, it should be made--what would happen in the \nadministration if someone in the CIA had leaked this kind of \ninformation about an undercover agent. What would happen? I will tell \nyou what would happen. They would have that person locked up in jail \nbefore nightfall, and they would be prosecuted to the full extent of \nthe law. My friend from Nevada raises a good question: What is the \ndifference between that and someone in the White House \nor administration doing the same thing?\n\n  Again, it is time for a special counsel. As the New York Times said \nthis morning on the front page, both Mr. Rove and Mr. Oliver have close \nconnections with Mr. Ashcroft. I don't know whether they are involved \nin this or not, but they are both very high in the administration. \nThere are too many close ties between Attorney General Ashcroft and \npeople high in this administration for the people of this country to be \nassured that we are going to have a fair, independent, full, and \nthorough investigation. Let the chips fall where they may and \nprosecute--yes, prosecute--the people responsible for leaking this \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, I intend to take the floor of the Senate every day to \ntalk about this issue. We cannot allow this to be swept under the rug. \nWe cannot allow a coverup to go on day after day. This is a President \nelected by the people, a servant of the people. And I don't think it is \nenough for any President to say: We will let the Attorney General \ninvestigate. The buck stops on the President's desk. I can only say if \nan allegation had been made about someone on my staff doing something \nlike that, I would call them in, and I would have them sign a notarized \nlegal document right there: I, so and so, had nothing to do with any \nleak and know no information about it whatsoever. Sign it.\n  That is what the President can do, and we can have this information \nout about who called Mr. Novak, who called these other reporters. We \nwould know it before the sun went down today. That is why this coverup \ncannot continue to go on. The American people deserve better than this, \nand they are going to get it. We are going to find out who put our \ncountry at risk, who committed these treasonous activities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, before proceeding to my remarks about \nthe pending amendment, I point out to Members of the Senate that we are \nall familiar with the National Endowment for Democracy and the fact \nthat it provides funds to the International Republican Institute and \nthe National Democratic Institute, which operate overseas to help \npromote democracy, human rights, and all of the things that Americans \nbelieve are important.\n  The National Democratic Institute recently issued a report on Iraq \nthat I think is noteworthy, and I am going to point out some excerpts \nfrom that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from this report be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright currently \nchairs the National Democratic Institute and she points out:\n\n       The past half-century provides ample proof that democracy \n     is more than just another form of government; it is also a \n     powerful generator of international security, prosperity and \n     peace.\n\n  According to the NDI, inside Iraq there is an explosion of democratic \npolitics.\n\n       . . . NDI will find fertile ground for democracy promotion \n     initiatives on a scale not seen since the heady days of the \n     fall of the Berlin wall.\n\n  That bears repeating, that the National Democratic Institute finds \nwithin Iraq today an explosion of democracy, and fertile ground for \ndemocracy promotion initiatives on a scale not seen since the fall of \nthe Berlin wall.\n  Another finding of the NDI that I think is noteworthy is that the \nIraqis are grateful for their liberation. There has been some notion \npromoted, I think by many in the press, that somehow the Iraqis are \nsorry that Saddam is gone. The NDI, headed by Madeleine Albright, finds \nthat the Iraqis are grateful for their liberation.\n  In addition, the NDI finds significant evidence of support for the \nUnited States. For example, they say:\n\n       In Kirkuk, there was a large painted sign reading ``Thank \n     you USA'' in English and in Kurdish.\n\n  Additionally, the NDI found overwhelming support for liberation, but \nlack of stability or economic opportunity obviously does erode, to some \nextent, support for the U.S.\n  They found that security and jobs are a precondition to democracy. We \nknow that, and that is what this supplemental is all about. They found \nIraqi frustrations are due to fear and uncertainty, not hostility \ntoward the United\n\n[[Page S12312]]\n\nStates. This is the National Democratic Institute, headed by Madeleine \nAlbright, which said that Iraqi frustrations are due to fear and \nuncertainty, not to hostility toward the United States.\n  The NDI also found that the Iraqis need our help now, and that is \nwhat this supplemental is all about. They also found that chaos and \nslow progress would feed the forces of radicalism, which seems an \nobvious statement to this Senator, and I believe their findings \nhighlight the fact that time to act on the supplemental is now. That is \nwhy this bill is before the Senate and why we are moving forward with \nthis important supplemental to finish the job in Iraq and give the \nIraqis a chance to realize their aspirations.\n  As we all have recognized, the world changed dramatically on \nSeptember 11, 2001. It changed in that the unprovoked attack on America \nrequired that America defend itself from the shadowy network of \ninternational terrorism.\n  To protect American lives and buildings, the President announced his \nintention to go after international terrorists wherever they were and \nafter the regimes that supported those efforts, whoever they were. He \nwarned that the costs would be high, that patience would be required, \nbut that America would win the struggle.\n  Today we are here to pay the price of freedom by moving this \nsupplemental forward. Many have already paid the ultimate price for \nfreedom, whether it was soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan, civilians in \nthe World Trade Towers, passengers in airlines wrestling control from \nterrorist hijackers, or the passengers themselves giving their own \nlives. Yes, many have paid the ultimate price of freedom. The question \nis, Will Congress pay?\n\n  Some say the price of freedom is too high and we have already paid \ntoo much. So while we have won the war in Iraq, the struggle today is \nwhether America will pay the price to win the peace, just as we did \nafter World War II. This is a question, of course, we have struggled \nwith before.\n  In the past, we have sometimes won wars but actually lost the peace. \nBut not always. At the end of the Civil War, President Lincoln \nforeswore revenge, retribution, and reparation payments against the \nSouth. His spirit marched on as America paid for the reconstruction of \nthe South, ravaged by the effects of 5 years of a new, more devastating \ntype of warfare. Clearly, if we look at America today, we won that \npeace.\n  At the end of World War II, America again won the peace. We did not \nwant the emergence of another Weimar Republic of Germany, which, racked \nby debt and desolation, would spawn yet another new greater threat. Of \ncourse, that was the result after World War I, costing us a second \npayment of even more lives and paying the price for freedom in World \nWar II. Instead of a failed peace, such as we had after World War I, in \n1948 the Marshall plan of aid and trade inaugurated a restoration of \nEurope, a halt to Communism and an unprecedented expansion of freedom \nand peace.\n  This is a picture of President Truman signing the Marshall plan in \n1948. Interestingly enough, that was in the middle of a tough \nPresidential election. It would have been easy for the Republican-\ncontrolled Congress to have politicized that effort, to have criticized \nPresident Truman for advocating that kind of spending on the \nreconstruction of Europe, but instead they came together on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Arthur Vandenberg, Joseph Barton, and the other Republicans who were \nin the majority in the Congress that year joined hands with President \nTruman and said: Let's make this bipartisan, let's finish the job in \nEurope, let's do it right and give the Europeans a chance to develop \ndemocracy and freedom, something that was lost after World War I.\n  Today we face the very same challenges. Historians may very well \nrecord that now is when the American Millennium began anew, and an \nunprecedented expansion phase, not of America herself, but of the idea \nthat America represents and shares with all freedom-loving countries.\n\n  Through one of history's great ironies, the very ideas that were \nattacked on September 11, 2001, American ideas like democracy, \nindividual freedom, limited government, and free markets--these ideas \nwhen attacked did not retreat but were revitalized, not just here but \nin countries where history records little evidence of even the most \nbasic human rights.\n  But now, here, today, the scribes of history can say this is when \ncivilization, freedom, and peace began a new march forward, rather than \na stagnant period of isolationism of war, oppression, and decline.\n  I agree this will be the defining debate of this Congress. As history \nhangs in the balance, as the world wonders whether America will promote \nthe freedom and democracy we brought to Western Europe and Japan after \nWorld War II, and to Eastern Europe and Russia after the cold war \nvictory, America should look on this debate with hope and fear. America \nshould hope we in Congress will come together to give peace and freedom \na birth in a region not known for it, but we fear that politics may \nprevent that.\n  The challenge we face today to which I alluded earlier is to come \ntogether behind the President's request, like the Congress did on a \nbipartisan basis for President Truman and the Marshall plan: to give \nIraq a true opportunity to become a bastion of democracy and freedom in \nthe Middle East.\n  This bill signing I referred to earlier was the first of a total of \n$10.9 billion appropriated for the Marshall plan during 1949 to 1951, \nto rebuild Europe and Japan. When you adjust that for inflation, that \nis equivalent to about $83 billion in today's dollars, over 4 times \nwhat the President is calling for in the rebuilding of Iraq. The \nMarshall plan was four times larger than what the President is asking \nus to do today in rebuilding Iraq. Polling data back in that era, 1948, \nshowed only 68 percent of Americans had heard of the Marshall plan, and \nonly half of those who had heard of it approved of it. Back in 1948, \nclearly, spending money to rebuild Europe was not popular, but \nRepublicans and Democrats put aside their differences, rallied behind \nPresident Truman and, as I indicated earlier, people like Arthur \nVandenberg of Michigan, Charles Eaton of New Jersey, and Joseph Martin \nof Massachusetts, along with others in a Republican-controlled \nCongress, joined hands with President Truman to get the job done.\n  We need leaders like the Vandenbergs and Martins, leaders like those \nwho crossed the aisle to enact President Truman's Marshall plan to \nrebuild Europe and Japan. We need those leaders today. The election is \n13 months away. Let's not start it this soon. Let's do the right thing \nhere in the Senate to give Iraq a real opportunity to achieve its \ndreams. Let's do what is right for America. The politics will take care \nof itself in the next year.\n  What I had hoped for was a high level of bipartisanship. \nUnfortunately, we have gotten a high level of politics out of all of \nthis. This is the first great military challenge to America in the new \nmillennium. We hear calls out on the Presidential campaign trail for \nthe President's impeachment. One Member of the Senate said that. Or \nregime change, said another Member of the Senate running for the \nPresidency. We heard the war for Iraq was a fraud and that the removal \nof an unbelievably brutal dictator was described by one candidate as \n``supposedly'' a good thing. We hear there is no chance for military \nsuccess, like that of World War I, World War II, Korea, the cold war, \nor Desert Storm, that gave freedom to Western Europe, Japan, North \nAfrica, South Korea, Russia, Eastern Europe, or Kuwait. We are told our \nmilitary efforts can only end in a Vietnam-style quagmire and failure. \nWe hear that paying the price to win the peace and bring our soldiers \nhome is too much.\n  And last, and most destructively, we hear every benefit of the doubt \ngiven to a brutal dictator, while every conceivable doubt is hurled \nupon this administration, our intelligence networks, and our allies.\n  It should not be that way and it doesn't have to be that way. We can \ncome together. The President's plan says yes, let's make aid and trade \nwork together, not just to rebuild Iraq and end the terrorism, but to \nbuild a working democratic state based on individual freedom and free \nmarkets. That is how to win the peace. But, frankly, in its details, \ndemocracy and peace is pretty routine stuff. It doesn't get a lot\n\n[[Page S12313]]\n\nof press. Winning the war, that gets a lot of press. So do efforts that \nthreaten the peace. But winning the peace itself involves terribly \nmundane stuff.\n\n  For example, taking out a terrorist training camp is news. But \nbuilding police training academies is not. The former wins the war, the \nlatter wins the peace.\n  Using bulldozers to cover the populations of whole Iraqi towns in \nmass graves is part of the horrific terror that gets press coverage. \nBut using garbage trucks to keep towns clean and safe from pestilence \nand disease is the boredom of peacetime. When humans are treated as \nrefuse, that is a sign of war. When human refuse is treated, that is a \nmark of peacetime.\n  Garbage trucks and police academies are the mundane, boring signposts \nthat peace and democracy are progressing. We see all sorts of routine \nsigns of progress that get no press. Fifty-eight of the largest cities \nof Iraq have hired police forces. Some 70,000 Iraqis are patrolling the \nstreets of their country. No one reports this--no one. Medical supplies \nare flowing to hospitals, with regular paychecks going to doctors and \nnurses. No one is reporting that. Vaccinations are available across the \ncountry and antimalaria sprays are proceeding. No one is reporting \nthat. Again, more mundane stuff that makes for peace and progress. \nAirports are reopening and so are ports. Provisional representative \ncouncils are formed in major cities, especially in Baghdad, and 150 \nnewspapers are publishing, with foreign publications, radio and \ntelevision broadcasts also available. That is a radical change over \nthere, but show me the press clippings covering the progress. I haven't \nseen any--none.\n  We see other signs of progress we would call a normal life--120,000 \nBaghdad students returning to classrooms last May; 1.2 million school \nkits are being prepared for the coming school year which started this \nweek; 5 million math and science books will be distributed. Banks are \nopening, crops are being harvested, the Baghdad symphony is performing, \nbookstores are reopening, and artists are displaying their works. None \nof this is reported because it is not newsworthy here in the United \nStates. But it is news there, and proof of peace and democracy \nsprouting up all over Iraq.\n  Peace and democracy are sprouting in Iraq, but you would be hard \npressed to find news reports here because mainly failure and setbacks \ncount as news. And, of course, certain papers and broadcasters focus on \nthe Presidential candidates, calling the President's efforts a failure. \nWe should not be too surprised. Presidential politics is the most \npowerful political force in America. But I urge people to ask \nthemselves, why didn't Presidential politics destroy the Marshall plan \nback in 1948, closer to a Presidential election year than we are now? \nPresidential politics did not destroy the Marshall plan because Members \nof the Senate on a bipartisan basis rose above that and did what was \nright for America and right for Europe.\n  I believe it was due to the fact that Republicans and Democrats alike \nwanted to ensure history did not repeat itself. They knew of their \nfriends and comrades who died in World War II because they failed to \nwin the peace after World War I. The threat of poverty and despair in \nEurope was real, and so was the effort by communists to take advantage \nof that. But mostly, they didn't want the sacrifice of their sons, \nbrothers, fathers and husbands in World War II to be in vain. to them \nand us, lives and freedom should be more important than power and \npolitics.\n  So I ask, can we set aside politics and ask what happens if we fail \nin Iraq? Perhaps we are not motivated by the good that can come from a \ndemocratic Iraq. But surely we should consider the disaster that can \nbefall the world if in this war against terrorism, we fail to bring \npeace and democracy to Iraq and Afghanistan. Our children and their \nchildren will have lost their chance for peace, freedom and prosperity.\n  This is a defining moment, but if we look after the interest of the \nnext generation rather than the next election--like President Truman \nand the Republican Congress did back in 1948 with the Marhsall plan--we \ncan do something great for Iraq, for the world and for our children.\n  So, I ask us to think of the future generations like those who formed \nthe Marshall plan considered in their deliberations. I ask us to come \ntogether to do what is right for future generations. I ask for unity, \nand to promote that end, I will offer an amendment that should unify \nthis body. Let us set aside the rancor and agree that the Armed Forces \nof the United States have performed brilliantly in Operation Enduring \nFreedom in Afghanistan and in Operation Iraq Freedom in Iraq.\n  Since October 7, 2001, when the Armed Forces of the United States and \nits coalition allies launched military operations in Afghanistan, \ndesigned as Operation Enduring Freedom, our soldiers and allies have \nremoved the Taliban regime, eliminated Afghanistan's terrorist \ninfrastructure, and captured significant and numerous members of Al \nQaeda.\n  Since March 19, 2003, when the Armed Forces of the United States and \nits coalition allies launched military operations, designated as \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, our soldiers have removed Saddam Hussein's \nregime, eliminated Iraq's terrorist infrastructure, ended Iraq's \nillicit and illegal programs to acquire weapons of mass destruction, \nand captured significant international terrorists.\n  During all this time, during the heat of battle, our soldiers have \nacted with all the efficiency that war time commands, but all the \ncompassion and understanding that an emerging peace requires. They have \nacted in the finest tradition of U.S. soldiers and are to be commended \nby this body.\n  That is what this situation requires of us today. I hope as we move \nforward with this debate on the supplemental, Members will remember the \nimportance of pulling together to finish the job in Iraq.\n  I yield.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   Excerpts From A Recent National Democratic Institute Report on Iraq\n\n       ``The past half-century provides ample proof that democracy \n     is more than just another form of government; it is also a \n     powerful generator of international security, prosperity and \n     peace.''--Madeleine K. Albright, NDI Chairman\n       An Explosion of democratic politics: ``After three days in \n     Baghdad it is already clear that NDI will find fertile ground \n     for democracy promotion initiatives on a scale not seen since \n     the heady days of the fall of the Berlin wall. There has been \n     a virtual explosion of politics in Iraq's capital city with \n     as many as 200 parties and movements having made themselves \n     known to the Coalition Provisional Authority.''\n       The Iraqis are grateful for their liberation. ``NDI's \n     overwhelming finding--in the north, south, Baghdad, and among \n     secular, religious, Sunni, Shiite, and Kurdish groups in both \n     urban and rural areas--is a grateful welcoming of the demise \n     of Saddam's regime and a sense that this is a pivotal moment \n     in Iraq's history. A leading member of a newly formed \n     umbrella movement, the Iraq Coalition for Democracy, put it \n     this way, ``We already see the positive results the Americans \n     have brought--we are free to talk to you, to organize a \n     movement and party, free to meet and demonstrate and all of \n     this was made possible by the Americans.''\n        Significant evidence of support for the United States: \n     ``In Kirkuk, there was a large painted sign reading, ``Thank \n     you USA!'' in English and in Kurdish. In Erbil and \n     Suleimaniya, there were many ``Thank you to the USA'', \n     ``Thank you to President George Bush'' banners as well as \n     ``peace and prosperity come with democracy.''\n        Overwhelming support for liberation, but lack of stability \n     or economic opportunity erode support for the U.S.: ``Across \n     the board, the people of NDI met with in southern Iraq \n     supported the forceful ouster of Saddam--a person many \n     described as ``Nero'' and a ``criminal towards his people''. \n     Although southerners were clearly conscious of the \n     discrimination they had suffered under Saddam's Baathist \n     rule, many were quick to add that poor security conditions \n     and a lack of basic necessities are having a negative impact \n     on attitudes toward the U.S.''\n        ``The main findings of the research reveal that, in every \n     community, the Iraqis are grateful for the ouster of Saddam \n     Hussein but have a strong desire for order and governance. \n     They feel a mix of excitement and fear about the prospect \n     of freedom and democracy, and have differing views about \n     the role of Islam in the country's new political order.''\n       Security and jobs are a precondition to Democracy. ``One \n     former general, previously part of the Free Officers \n     Movement, summed up the state of Iraqi ``anxious \n     ambivalence'' this way, ``People need a rest. They need \n     security and jobs and, maybe after a year they can be \n     educated about political parties and democracy and then they \n     can choose heir future properly.''\n       Iraqi frustrations are due to fear and uncertainty, not \n     hostility to the United States. ``Faced with rising crime, \n     uncertain economic prospects, and chaotic daily conditions, \n     complaining--to anyone who will listen--has become a national \n     pastime. Part of\n\n[[Page S12314]]\n\n     the problem is a perceived lack of access to those in \n     authority, but mostly the complaints are a symptom of \n     uncertainty, not an expression of hostility to the United \n     States or its aims in for Iraq.''\n       The Iraqis need our help now. ``Time is not on the side of \n     the coalition or Iraqi democrats. Current conditions play \n     into the hands of extremists--religious and nationalist--who \n     point to lack of progress as proof of the need for a strong \n     hand.''\n       Chaos and slow progress feed the forces of radicalism. ``In \n     fact, many Iraqi political forces are benefiting from the \n     societal chaos. Islamic forces, including the Shia dominated \n     Da'awa party and Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution \n     in Iraq, with their inherent legitimacy, established \n     networks, and communications facilities through the Mosque, \n     are flourishing and establishing positions of dominance in \n     Shiite slums, small cities and the underdeveloped \n     countryside.''\n       Time to act on the supplemental is now. ``In conclusion, \n     this is not a time for despair or second-guessing but for \n     action. There is an urgent need for democratic education, \n     party strengthening, for coalition building and for material \n     assistance to democratic movements and organizations. The \n     political vacuum is being filled by those with an interest in \n     destroying and separating rather than uniting and building--\n     only concerted efforts to strengthen the democratic middle \n     can help stem that tide.''\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, has the distinguished majority whip yielded \nhis time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky controls \nan additional 1 minute. The minority side has 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to support the amendment \nintroduced by Senator McConnell for one reason and one reason only: I \nsupport our troops, and I share the sentiment all Americans have in \nholding our men and women in uniform in the highest regard.\n  It is a fact that there are differences in this country about United \nStates policy toward Iraq. But there is no disagreement that our \nmilitary personnel have been brave and courageous. They have made \nsacrifices for our country and more than 300 have made the ultimate \nsacrifice. I grieve for their loss and my heart goes out to their \nfamilies and loved ones.\n  Families throughout America are proud of their sons, daughters, \nfathers and mothers who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are \nanxious about reports of daily attacks on United States soldiers in \ncentral Iraq and are hopeful that already lengthy deployments are not \nfurther extended. I share both their pride and their anxiety. I, too, \nthink about our troops every day. I think about their families. I thing \nabout their sacrifices.\n  The McConnell amendment makes note of these sacrifices. It also \ncommends organizations such as the USO and Operation Dear Abby that \nhelp support our troops. The amendment also states that there should be \nappropriate ceremonies to honor and welcome them home. I hope these \nceremonies occur sooner rather than later.\n  California has a rich military tradition. Military personnel from \nacross the State and from all branches have been serving bravely in \nIraq and Afghanistan. I am especially proud of these military men and \nwomen and wish them a safe return home.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on March 20 of this year, the Senate passed \nS. Res. 95, a resolution commending the President and the men and women \nof the United States Armed Forces, and the civilian personnel \nsupporting them, for their efforts in the war in Iraq. I cosponsored \nthat resolution. While there was some language in that resolution I \nwould have changed or deleted, I felt it was appropriate and drafted in \na relatively non-political, balanced way such that even those of us who \nhad opposed the resolution authorizing the use of unilateral, pre-\nemptive force could support.\n  Today, the Republican leadership has put forward another resolution, \nwhich again commends the President and the men and women of the Armed \nForces, as well as the civilian personnel who have supported them. I \nwill also vote for this resolution. Of course we commend the troops, \ntheir families, and the Defense Department's civilian personnel, for \ntheir courage and sacrifice for their country. I have commended the \nextraordinary efforts of our troops in virtually every statement I have \nmade about Iraq.\n  But this resolution goes further than S. Res. 95, in ways that I \ndisagree with. It commends the contribution of defense contractors, for \nexample. I have nothing against defense contractors. Many deserve \nrecognition for their indispensable, innovative contributions to the \nsuccess of our Armed Forces, including defense contractors in my own \nState of Vermont. It is, for example, these companies that developed \nthe precision-guided weapons that helped to reduce the number of \ncivilian casualties in Iraq. But other contractors have engaged in \npractices that have bilked American taxpayers out of many millions of \ndollars, overcharging for their services or manipulating the bidding \nprocess. I do not commend those contractors.\n  I also disagree with some of the wording of this resolution, because \nit may leave the wrong impression. For example, at one point it states \n``Whereas the United States pursued sustained diplomatic, political, \nand economic efforts to remove those threats peacefully.'' It is true \nthat the administration went to the United Nations, belatedly, under \npressure from Congress and the rest of the world, to seek support for \nthe use of force against Saddam Hussein. But it went to the United \nNations with an attitude of ``you're either with us or against us,'' \nand when they did not get everything they wanted as quickly as they \nwanted it, they prematurely abandoned the diplomatic process and \nlaunched a unilateral military attack for the purported purpose of \nupholding U.N. resolutions without the support of the U.N. Security \nCouncil. The administration's diplomatic and political efforts were \ngrudging, half hearted, and ineffective.\n  In addition, I am concerned, and disappointed, that this resolution \nmakes no mention whatsoever of our diplomats and aid workers who are \nworking tirelessly in Iraq under extremely dangerous and difficult \nconditions. Their bravery and sacrifice should also be recognized.\n  Mr. President, we want Iraq to become a democratic, prosperous \nnation. But let's be honest. We know why the Republican leadership \nhastily drafted this resolution last night. It is increasingly obvious \nto the American people that the war in Iraq, where United States \nsoldiers are being killed and wounded every day 4 months after the \nPresident declared the ``mission accomplished,'' is going to drag on \nfor years and cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The $87 billion \nsupplemental appropriations bill we are considering is fraught with \nproblems, and even Republicans are realizing that it is unpopular with \na majority of their constituents. Compounding that, the White House is \nfacing an internal probe of the leak of the identity of a covert CIA \nemployee. So what do they do, they trot out another ``feel good'' \nresolution praising the President, in an effort to divert attention \nfrom the real issues. We have seen this too many times before.\n  Again, I will vote for this resolution because I am concerned about \nour troops and want them to know that each and every one of us supports \nthem as they risk their lives to bring peace and security to Iraq. But \nI would hope that in the future we do better than these simplistic, \npolitically motivated resolutions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I share the reservations of many of my \ncolleagues about the McConnell amendment. Each and every Senator \nsupports our troops in Iraq, but many of us do not support the decision \nby the Bush administration to go to war.\n  This amendment states the pride and admiration we all feel for our \ntroops, their families, and all of those who aided in the effort. But \nit also contains several provisions many of us disagree with.\n  The President has stated, there is no evidence that Saddam Hussein \nwas involved in the attacks on the World Trade Center, yet this \namendment leaves the impression that he was. This amendment also states \nthat our military action brought an end to Iraq's illegal programs to \nacquire weapons of mass destruction, but no evidence whatever has been \nfound that Saddam had even begun to reactivate these programs of the \npast.\n  In addition, the amendment commends the President and Secretary \nRumsfeld for planning and carrying out Operation Iraqi Freedom. No one \ndoubted we would win the war. but we had no plan to win the peace, and \nSecretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz misled the President \nand the country about the need to go to war.\n\n[[Page S12315]]\n\n  As the evidence now makes clear, Iraq was not an imminent threat to \nour national security. Iraq did not have longstanding ties to terrorist \ngroups. Iraq was not developing nuclear weapons. No weapons of mass \ndestruction have been found in Iraq.\n  It is wrong to put American lives on the line for a dubious cause. \nMany of us continue to believe that this was the wrong war at the wrong \ntime. There were alternatives short of a premature rush to a unilateral \nwar that could have accomplished our goals in Iraq with fare fewer \ncasualties and far less damage to our goals in the war against \nterrorism.\n  This resolution commemorates Operation Iraqi Freedom as if the war \nwere over and our men and women are coming home. We know this is not \nthe case, despite the President's declaration of ``mission \naccomplished'' aboard the aircraft carrier 5 long months ago.\n  Our service men and women still face constant danger in Iraq. \nAmerican lives are lost almost daily in Iraq. They were told they would \nbe welcomed as liberators. Instead, they are increasingly resented as \noccupiers and are under siege every day. They face surprise attacks and \ndeadly ambushes from unknown enemies. It is increasingly difficult to \ntell friend from foe. The average number of attacks against American \nsoldiers recently increased from 13 to 22 each day.\n  Three hundred and sixteen Americans have been killed in Iraq since \nthe war began. In the 5 months since President Bush declared ``mission \naccomplished,'' 178 American soldiers have died. Ten soldiers from \nMassachusetts have made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq. Each day \nanother eight soldiers or Marines are wounded in Iraq.\n  These are not just statistics. Each fallen soldier has someone who \nmourns their loss. That loss--whether it's a husband or wife, a son or \ndaughter, a brother or sister, or a father or mother--weighs heavily on \nus as well, and we must do our best to see that their sacrifice is not \nin vain.\n  The administration still has no credible plan to end this war. Our \ntroops deserve a plan that will bring in adequate foreign forces to \nshare the burden, restore stability and build democracy in Iraq, and \nbring us closer to the day when our troops will come home with honor.\n  Our soldiers' lives are at stake. Patriotism is not the issue. \nSupport for our troops is not the issue. The safety of the 140,000 \nAmerican servicemen and women serving in Iraq today is the issue, and, \nit is our solemn responsibility to question--and question vigorously--\nthe administration's current request for funds. So far, the \nadministration has failed--and failed utterly--to provide a plausible \nplan for the future of Iraq and to ensure the safety of our troops.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, West Virginians know sacrifice. Families \nfrom the Mountain State have lost loved ones in both Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Members of the West Virginia National Guard and the \nmembers of the Reserves have been deployed around the world, their \nlives on the line each day in the most dangerous of circumstances. Our \ntroops deserve to be commended, as do all Americans who have supported \nthem: their husbands and wives; their sons and daughters; and all the \nmembers of their communities.\n  I have grave concerns for the situations that our troops now find \nthemselves in. In Iraq, constant attacks have caused the toll in \nAmerican lives to more than double after May 1. In Afghanistan, which \nis in danger of becoming the forgotten war, Taliban and al-Qaida \nterrorists are hiding in the mountains, regaining their strength, and \nplotting against us.\n  I will vote for the resolution that is before the Senate, but only \nbecause we must not offend those who have sacrificed in the wars in \nwhich the United States is now engaged. It should be a moral obligation \nto support those who have lost loved ones in battle, and those who wear \nour Nation's uniform.\n  But I do not agree with many of the where-as clauses to the \nresolution that are before the Senate. It is wrong to commingle the \nimages of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. I do not agree that our \nattack on Iraq is part of the ``Global War on Terrorism.'' It is \nmisleading to imply that the United States had run out of diplomatic \noptions before attacking Iraq. It is dangerous to think that we have \neliminated Afghanistan's terrorist infrastructure. The first three \npages of this resolution lay out a distorted history of how we came to \nbe involved in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We need to stop the \nspin and distortions. They do a disservice to the public.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the McConnell \namendment today, because I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments in \nits resolve clauses expressing the Senate's tremendous admiration and \nappreciation for our men and women in uniform who have served in \nOperation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Their \ncontributions and their service deserve our unified and enduring \nsupport.\n  However, the findings contained in the amendment seem to link Saddam \nHussein's regime to the terrorist attacks on the United States that \noccurred on September 11, 2001. No evidence supports such a link, and \nthose who continue to confuse these issues do the American people a \ngreat disservice, as they encourage an unfocused and unwise approach to \nour first national security priority, the fight against terrorism.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to have voted for Senator \nMcConnell's resolution commending America's Armed Forces. It is right \nfor us to thank our troops for their service. It is right to thank \nmilitary families for their sacrifice. It is right to thank great \norganizations like the USO for their support to our men and women in \nuniform.\n  However, I am puzzled by some of the findings in the McConnell \namendment.\n  We were all told last year that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \nand was ready to use them. Well, the jury is still out on that. But \npress reports suggest that Dr. Kay's team has not yet found any actual \nweapons. So I am not sure it is accurate to say the war ended Iraq's \nWMD programs.\n  The Bush administration now acknowledges that there is no evidence of \nties between Saddam Hussein's regime and al-Qaida and the September 11 \nattacks. Yet the amendment seems to combine Operation Enduring Freedom \nin Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom as ``two campaigns in the \nGlobal War on Terrorism.'' I am not sure what ``terrorist \ninfrastructure'' was destroyed in Iraq. Some reports indicate the \nterrorist presence in Iraq has actually increased since the collapse of \nSaddam Hussein's brutal regime.\n  I just don't want anyone to think my vote means I agree with every \nword of this amendment. I voted for the McConnell amendment because I \nabsolutely stand behind our troops and their families.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of Senator \nMcConnell's sense of the Senate amendment because it expressed strong \nsupport for our Nation's armed services and their success in \naccomplishing the important mission to overthrow the regime of Saddam \nHussein. I am especially proud of the men and women in uniform from \nArkansas who represent the best and brightest our country has to offer. \nIt is vital that we continue to support our troops in every way we can, \nas they continue to come under attack in Iraq.\n  As Congress continues debate on this legislation and related bills in \nthe future, I believe we in Congress have a responsibility to exercise \ncareful oversight of the administration's plan to rebuild Iraq and to \nask tough questions about specific plans, objectives, and results to \nensure our mission is accomplished. To that end, we must realistically \nassess the United States efforts in the war on terror. While the \ndedication and efficiency of the men and women who comprise our \nmilitary is unparalleled, recent difficulties in Iraq demonstrate that \nthere is much work left to be done.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there is no question that I, along with \nevery Member of this body, support the troops. But with respect to the \namendment proposed by the Senator from Kentucky, the majority ought to \nbe ashamed for wasting the Senate's time with this political booby \ntrap.\n  The amendment states that Saddam was a threat to our national \nsecurity. He was not. We had him contained in the north and the south \nwith overflights, and had the weapons inspectors\n\n[[Page S12316]]\n\nback in doing their work in Iraq. The amendment states that the United \nStates pursued sustained diplomatic, political, and economic efforts to \nremove the so-called threat peacefully. That is wrong. We said to the \nUnited Nations, ``Get out of the way. You're irrelevant.'' We said to \nthe international community, ``You're either with us or against us.'' \nBefore we removed Saddam, we removed Hans Blix. The amendment says we \neliminated terrorist infrastructure in Afghanistan and Iraq. Just read \nthe morning paper and you will know that is not true. They have plenty \nof terrorist infrastructure, and they are killing our soldiers every \nday.\n  As I have said many times before, the majority is only interested in \nthe needs of the campaign, not the needs of the country. We have \nserious work to do, and they are playing political games. If we really \nsupported our troops, we would pay for this war. Instead, we are \ntelling our troops that they not only have to fight the war, they have \nto come home and pay for it, too.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Kentucky, if the Senator yields \nback his time, we will yield back our time and go to a vote on this \nmatter.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. We yield the time on our side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment (No. 1795), as modified. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment, No. \n1796, to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Provision of Funds for Security and \n     Stabilization of Iraq Through Partial Suspension of \n     Reductions in Highest Income Tax Rate for Individual \n     Taxpayers.--The table contained in paragraph (2) of section \n     1(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     (relating to reductions in rates after June 30, 2001) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     The corresponding percentages shall\n                                      be substituted for  the following\n  ``In the case of taxable years                percentages:\n  beginning during calendar year:  -------------------------------------\n                                      28%      31%      36%      39.6%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2001..............................    27.5%    30.5%    35.5%      39.1%\n2002..............................    27.0%    30.0%    35.0%      38.6%\n2003 and 2004.....................    25.0%    28.0%    33.0%      35.0%\n2005 and thereafter...............    25.0%    28.0%    33.0%   38.2%''.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2004.\n       (c) Application of EGTRRA Sunset to This Section.--The \n     amendment made by this section shall be subject to title IX \n     of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n     2001 to the same extent and in the same manner as the \n     provision of such Act to which such amendment relates.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. We have spoken to the chief sponsors of this amendment, \nSenators Biden and Kerry. There is a tentative agreement on our side as \nto how much time will be used. The floor staffs are working now to see \nif we can enter into an agreement in the next little bit. In the \nmeantime, rather than waste valuable floor time, Senator Biden is going \nto begin his debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am prepared to enter into a time \nagreement. In the meantime, rather than waste time, let me begin to \ndiscuss my amendment.\n  We had a debate yesterday, an opening debate about whether we should \nbe moving forward with this legislation for $87 billion to fund the \nwar. Again, for those who may be listening, I want to state where I, as \nthey say in the vernacular, come from on this score.\n  I have been one among many, from Senator Reed, former West Point \ngraduate, an Army officer, a U.S. Senator, to John McCain, to Chuck \nHagel, on both sides of the aisle, among those who have said that our \nbiggest problem is we have not, quite frankly, devoted sufficient \nresources in a timely way to winning the peace in Iraq. So I began from \nthe premise that there is no doubt we have to spend billions of more \ndollars. There is no doubt we have to keep in Iraq tens of thousands of \nAmerican troops for some time. As a matter of fact, I said that as long \nago as July of 2002.\n  I approach this thing from the perspective of one who thinks we must \ndo more. I have several basic problems with the approach we are taking. \nI know the Presiding Officer and I had a very brief conversation about \nthis. He made reference yesterday to me, that I was somewhat exercised \nin my presentation yesterday. I was. I am, because I think there is \nsuch a gigantic opportunity here to enhance the security interests of \nthe United States.\n\n  So, again, the reason I bother to say this is, I think there are two \nserious problems with the approach the President is taking now relative \nto this $87 billion. One is, I think that after examination--and I will \nhave several more amendments before this debate is over--I think there \nis some padding in this reconstruction money.\n  I am one who believes you cannot bring security to Iraq without \nbringing basic services to Iraq. I think there is a direct and \nimmediate correlation. Those who say you can separate support for the \nmilitary and reconstruction money either have not been to Iraq or don't \nthink we should be in Iraq or, with all due respect, don't understand \nthe dynamics.\n  The degree to which clean water doesn't flow, the degree to which \nyoung women are being raped in the streets, the degree to which police \nofficers are afraid to go to their stations and do their job, the \ndegree to which the electric lights do not go on, the degree to which \nthe oil pipelines are blown up, there is a direct correlation between \nthat and the danger posed to our troops, the danger posed to our being \nable to preserve the peace or bring about or win the peace. So I don't \nmake that dichotomy between reconstruction moneys and moneys relating \nto ``supporting our troops.''\n  Reconstruction money will support our troops. It supports our troops. \nMy disagreement with the President is that--I am not talking about past \ndisagreements and mistakes made or not\n\n[[Page S12317]]\n\nmade, in my view, just from this moment on--I think if you look at the \nreconstruction funds, some of it is--maybe not intentionally--inflated.\n  For example, there is a provision in there for x number of pickup \ntrucks. We were not talking about Humvees or military vehicles. They \nneed pickup trucks. The government needs them for basic, mundane \npurposes. Well, in the authorization here, we are going to pay $32,000 \nfor a pickup truck. I can take them to a nice Chrysler plant in my \nState and get them for $18,000.\n  We are also talking about building prison cells. I spent some time, \nalong with my friend, Senator Lugar, and my friend, Senator Hagel, out \nat the police training academy in Baghdad, and we talked to--I might \nadd, we have a first-class team there. These are serious guys. These \nguys know their way around. They have been in Bosnia, Kosovo, and \nAfghanistan, and they understand this. There is money in here that \ncomes to $50,000 per prison cell. We need to build prisons. There are \nno functioning prisons in Iraq. We have to build them.\n  By the way, the guy running our prison operation there, when asked \nhow long it would take if he had all the resources he needed, he said \nit would take a couple years to get a prison system up and running.\n  But that is not the point. We are going to pay $55,000 per bed in an \nIraqi prison. We pay half that here in the United States of America. We \nare in a country, I might add, where the building specs and \nrequirements are less than they are here. So I think we have to be \nresponsible and take a look at the details of this.\n  So my first concern is about whether or not the money is being \nefficaciously allocated. That is a responsibility of oversight that we \nhave. That is our job. We can do it in a timely way and we will get \nthis finished within a week or so and get it done. That is the first \nconcern I have, in a practical sense, on what we are going to do on the \nfloor.\n\n  The second concern is my monumental concern. My friend from Utah--and \nwe say that lightly, but he really is my friend--a conservative \nRepublican--and for those of you who think none of us get along around \nhere, we have very different views, but we are close friends. I can say \nto him that my biggest problem is how we pay for this. That is what I \nwant to talk about right now because that is the second significant \nelement of my concern on the immediate question before us: Do we \nappropriate or authorize to be appropriated $87 billion or do we \nappropriate $87 billion for this effort? I want to speak to that. That \nis what my amendment is about. That is what is before the Senate now.\n  At the outset, the first fellow with whom I spoke about this, the guy \nwhose brainchild it was, along with me, is my friend from \nMassachusetts, John Kerry. As a matter of fact, immediately after my \nfloating this idea on one of the national shows--``Meet The Press,'' or \nwhatever it was--I immediately got a call from Senator Kerry saying he \nhad been thinking along the same lines and could we work together to do \nthis. This is a joint effort, and we are joined by Senator Feinstein, \nwho feels strongly about it, and a number of others.\n  I wish to acknowledge at the front end here how we got to this point. \nI wish to explain the modification I sent to the desk and go into the \ndetails of why I think this is an important and necessary and \nresponsible amendment. Again, remember, this is not coming from a guy \nwho didn't support the war, who won't support the funding; it is coming \nfrom a guy who thinks we are going to have to come up with this $87 \nbillion, but we are going to have to come up with billions more. I wish \nthe President would be as straightforward. This is a downpayment; this \nisn't the end of the road.\n  Now, initially, I had an amendment because I didn't have the detailed \nnumbers from the Joint Tax Committee, the Finance Committee, and from \noutside experts, such as Brookings and Citizens For Fair Taxation and \nthe like, because it takes a while to run these numbers. So, initially, \nwe had put in an amendment that said we would authorize--which is \nconstitutional--or direct the head of the IRS to find this $87 billion \nfrom a specific category of taxpayers. We now have hard numbers. The \nhard numbers are very straightforward.\n  In order to pay now for the $87 billion we are about to appropriate, \nwe are proposing that the tax rate for the wealthiest Americans, which \nhas dropped this year from above 39 percent down to 35 percent--and I \nam not arguing about that--and in order to find $87 billion to pay for \nthis, we would have to go back under our formula to that roughly 1 \npercent of the taxpayers--actually, the top bracket is less than 1 \npercent of the taxpayers--and say to them your tax rate is going to go \nback up in the years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 to 38.2 \npercent. So that is what I sent up to the desk. It was a detail that \nwasn't in my original amendment because we didn't have it from Joint \nTax. We didn't have it laid out. So that is a brief explanation of the \nmodification.\n  Now, let's go back and review the bidding here if we can. First, we \ncan pay for this supplemental several ways. One, we can pay for it, as \nthe President has suggested, by increasing the deficit. If this is \nadded to the projected deficit for 2004, the deficit for 2004 will rise \nto $567 billion for that one year--next year. If we do not add it to \nthe deficit, the projected deficit at this moment would be down, \nobviously, around $480 billion--still a gigantic amount but $87 billion \nless. The reason I am so opposed to doing that is on equitable grounds \nand grounds of economic recovery. On equitable grounds--and I know this \nsounds a little political the way I am going to say this, but it is \nfactually accurate--on equitable grounds, we, the grownups in this \nChamber--and the average age here is probably roughly 50, I would say--\nwe are going to be asking these young pages walking down the aisle to \npay this bill. Literally, we are going to ask them to pay. We are not \ngoing to pay. If we can't do it my way, they pay. The President--I \nquoted him yesterday--in his last State of the Union Address said we \nare not going to pass on these debts and problems--at the end, I will \nactually give an exact quote--basically he said we are not going to \npass these responsibilities to fight terror and to pay for it on to \nother generations. That is exactly what we are doing here.\n\n  For those of you who think that may not be a very compelling argument \nand those of you who voted for the tax cut because you wanted to spur \neconomic recovery--a legitimate argument; I disagree with the way it is \nformulated and voted against it but a legitimate argument--look at what \nis happening now: As the deficit has been projected to be 480, or \nthereabouts--and the Presiding Officer and my friend from Utah and my \ntwo colleagues from California and Massachusetts know more about this \nthan I do--what has happened? Long-term rates have already begun to \nrise. What does the market say? Why are long-term interest rates \nrising? Because of the projected deficits. That is a fact. They are \nalready rising.\n  I respectfully suggest that taking $87 billion out of a 10-year tax \ncut of $1.8 trillion has no impact--none--on economic recovery, \nparticularly since it is taken out over a 6-year period in small \nincrements beginning in 2005. But if you are worried about the impact \non the economy and the ability to sustain a recovery, you better be \nlooking at the debt.\n  I would argue that from a principle of equity, as well as sound \neconomic principles related to the recovery, adding this $87 billion to \nthe already gargantuan projected deficit--and it will be higher, by the \nway, because that does not even count prescription drugs, that does not \ncount the other initiatives the President says we are going to do and \nDemocrats say they want to do, it does not even count those programs \nyet, so we know it is going to be a heck of a lot higher--but to add \n$87 billion on top of that can do nothing but jeopardize a long-term \nrecovery.\n  The second way we can pay for this, which is very popular--and I am \nsort of the skunk at the family picnic on this on my side of the \naisle--is to let the Iraqis pay for it. Some are saying the Iraqis have \nthe second largest oil reserves in the world. Some of my Republican \nfriends are proposing this as well.\n  For example, we have a flooded home. We have a very competent county \nexecutive dealing with this, and he says if we can pay for Iraq, the \nFederal Government can pay for this. That is really compelling. I tell \nyou what, I am\n\n[[Page S12318]]\n\nkind of glad I am not running this year because I am going to oppose \nit. To the average person and the above average person, this just seems \nfair.\n  We hear people saying on the floor: If they had gold reserves of X \namount, we would indemnify ourselves; they have gold in the ground, \nblack gold. That is a very compelling case, except, as my mother would \nsay--God love her, and she is probably listening, so, mom, forgive me \nif I get it wrong--she always used to say when I was young: Joey, don't \nbite your nose off to spite your face. If we do that, we will be, \nfiguratively speaking, biting our nose off to spite our face.\n  Why? There are other countries around the world--in the Arab world, \nthe European world, Russia, other countries--that are owed almost $200 \nbillion by Iraq, some say as high as $300 billion. Some of that is \ndirect loan payments; some is indemnification for the damage done by \nSaddam when he invaded Kuwait, and so on.\n\n  What are we doing? We can either choose the World War I model or the \nWorld War II model for a defeated nation. After World War I, we said: \nGermany, this is all your fault. We want you to have a democracy, but, \nby the way, in the meantime, pay off all these reparations, making it \nvirtually impossible--how many of us in grade school and college saw \nthat one cartoon that was in every single history book: A German lady \nin a babushka carrying a wheelbarrow of deutsche marks to the butcher \nshop.\n  I bet every one of you can remember that. It was in every textbook in \nAmerica. Why? It produced a little guy named Hitler to prey upon all of \nthe anger, all of the prejudice, all the furor of the German people.\n  Who thinks we can possibly establish a democracy in a country which, \nI might add, has no history of any democratic institutions and was \nnever a country until 1919--who thinks we can establish a democracy \nthere saying, by the way, start off, folks, but before you do anything, \nbefore you spend that $35 billion to redo your oil fields, before you \nspend the money to do this or that, pay off the $200 billion, $300 \nbillion in debt?\n  The President has been dead right. The President has been saying and \nthe Secretary of State has been saying we have to convince these other \nnations to forgive that debt and write it off, as we did. Write it off.\n  On top of that, what did the President say at the United Nations? Not \nwell enough, in my view, with all due respect, but what did he say? He \nsaid: United Nations, this is the world's problem. This is your \nproblem. Send money and send troops. Every one of us here are hoping \nthat Powell is very successful with a thing called the donors \nconference that is coming up this month. We are going to be sitting \ndown with other nations of the world and saying: By the way, can you \nguys ante in? We have roughly in the whole region close to 200,000 \ntroops, and we have already spent $78 billion, and we are going to \nspend another $87 billion. Can you kick in some money to rebuild this \ncountry? Oh, and by the way, we want you to forgive the debt you are \nowed. We want you to kick in money. We are not going to indemnify any \nof your money, but, by the way, the $20 billion we put in for \nreconstruction, we have a claim against Iraqi oil.\n  We are all intelligent people in this Chamber. We may be able to \nindemnify this money, but we will have no Iraq to collect it from. \nThere will be nobody to collect it from because if this debt is not \nforgiven and if more people do not get in the game, there is not going \nto be peace in Iraq. It is not going to happen, and that is what I \nmeant when I said, as unpopular as it is, my dear old mom--mom, if you \nare listening, you are right--we are about to bite our nose off to \nspite our face. That is the second way we can do it, and I think it is \na disaster to do it that way.\n  There is a third way we can pay for this $87 billion. We can say a \nvery uncharacteristic thing around here: We are going to pay for it, \nand we are going to pay for it now. We are not going to use our credit \ncard; we are going to do it now.\n  As Don Rumsfeld said, yes, this is a lot of money, but, yes, we have \nthe ability to pay for it, and he is dead right. Old Don, I want to \ntake a little bit of your money to pay for it. You are a 1 percenter, \nand God bless you, let's pay for it.\n  OK, how do we pay for it? We can cut more programs.\n  As some have suggested, we can make college loans more expensive. \nThat saves the Government money. We can do as some have suggested and \ncut across the board the income tax break we gave everybody. But guess \nwhat. Poor folks and middle-class folks are already paying for Iraq. It \nis their kids who are in Iraq. It is their kids in the National Guard. \nIt is their kids in the Regular Army. It is their kids who are already \nthere.\n  Guess who is getting hurt most by this unemployed recovery. Middle-\nclass and poor folks. I think the middle-class folks need a tax break, \nand so I think it would be unequitable and unfair to go back now and \nsay, by the way, you middle-class folks, you pay; you poor folks, you \npay. We have already decided the poor folks cannot get an earned income \ntax credit for their kids, a child tax credit, which is a travesty. But \nnow we are going to raise their taxes slightly or reduce the tax cut?\n  So it seems to me there is a group of people who are as patriotic as \nthe poorest among us, the wealthy people. The thing I do not like about \npolitics is we all have a tendency to slip into--and I can honestly say \nI have never done this in 33 years of holding office--class warfare. \nThe idea that because someone is a multimillionaire they are not as \npatriotic as somebody who is making 25,000 bucks a year is a lie. The \nwealthiest among us are as patriotic as any other group of people in \nAmerica.\n  I come from Delaware, a relatively wealthy State. I tried in two fora \nin my State, and this is literally true, among some of the wealthiest \npeople in my State--in my State we can get them all together pretty \nquickly. I am not being facetious about that. I mean that sincerely. I \nasked the question at one gathering--both were social gatherings. The \nfirst was a group of about 35 or 40 people, and I do not know this for \na fact, but I think all of them were clearly in the top 1 percent tax \nbracket. The way the conversation started was they said to me: You \nknow, Joe, what is going on in Iraq? What about this? What about that? \nIt was a cocktail party at the home of a partner in a major law firm. \nIt was on a Sunday evening.\n  I said: Let me ask you all a question. My friend from California \nknows when two people ask a question and you start to answer it, it \nends up with four people there and then 10 people there, and all of a \nsudden you have a mini-press conference and there are 20 people. That \nis what happened at this cocktail party on someone's patio.\n  I said: Let me ask you this question: would anybody here object if \nthe President, when he addressed the Nation about the $87 billion, had \nsaid--and I want to ask the wealthiest among you, the top 1 percent of \nthe taxpayers in America--give up 1 year of the 10 years of your tax \ncut in order to help prosecute this war against terror and sustain the \npeace in Iraq, would any one of you object to that?\n  Obviously, that is a little peer pressure I put on them, but not a \nsingle person said they would object. Beyond that, it started a \ndiscussion. I just sat there and listened. They said, of course, that \nis the right thing to do. Of course, we should do this. Of course, of \ncourse, of course.\n  Then I tried it again at one of the most upscale country clubs in my \nState. I was playing in a charitable golf tournament, and there was the \nsame thing.\n  I think the President and many of my colleagues underestimate the \nAmerican character. I truly believe they underestimate Americans. I do \nnot know of any wealthy American who, given the realistic options we \nhave to pay for this, would say, hey, look, if I am going to give up 1 \nyear of the $690 billion the 1 percent is going to get, I want that guy \nmaking 25 percent of what I make, I want that guy making 10 percent of \nwhat I make to give up one year, too.\n\n  Do any of my colleagues believe that is what they would say? I do not \nbelieve it. And this is not politics. This is not my playing a game. I \ndo not believe it. This is something that not only is the right thing \nto do, the people whom you are asking to do it believe it is the right \nthing to do.\n  I stated on the floor before and I said at home, I would ask any \nwealthy Delawarean in my State, which we will get\n\n[[Page S12319]]\n\nto the numbers, who makes $400,000 in gross income, to call me at my \noffice and tell me they are not willing to give up $2,100 a year for 6 \nyears of their tax cut, because that is what it comes to. I am inviting \nthem to call me. I promise I will report to my colleagues all those who \ncall me.\n  The point is, these are patriotic Americans. They know we have our \nhands full. They know the deal. So that is the third way we can do \nthis.\n  How does it practically work, and then I am going to yield to my \nfriend from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be delighted to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am listening with great interest. I agree with much of \nwhat the Senator said, but before the Senator from Massachusetts gives \na major speech I would like the opportunity to engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Sure, but first let me make one last point so we have the \nfacts out.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would ask the Senator to make his point and then I \nwould appreciate it if we could do that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would be happy to.\n  Let me be straight about exactly what this amendment would do. People \nwhose tax bracket up until this year was 39.6 percent, having had it \ndrop down to 35 percent--so there is no false advertising here, the \nBiden-Kerry-Feinstein-Chafee, et cetera, amendment would raise, \nbeginning in 2005, their tax bracket back up to 38.2 percent, still a \npercentage point and a half less than it was a year ago but 2 point \nsomething percent higher than it is today. That is what it would do.\n  By the way, I will tell my colleagues who these folks are. People who \npay at the top rate have an average income--well, it is unfair to \naverage. As Samuel Clemens, or rather Mark Twain, said, all \ngeneralizations are false, including this one. So I want to be \ncompletely straight about this. The average income in that top 1 \npercent is $1 million a year. At a minimum, people who would be \naffected by this have to have an income, before standard deductions and \nexemptions, of over $400,000 in gross income. Others will fall into \nthis category if their taxable income after deductions is over \n$312,000. But that is after; that is net. That is taxable income. OK.\n  So we have the picture where people--the way I am told by the Joint \nTax Committee, by Brookings and others, we may find an exception to \nthis, but there is nobody making $400,000 a year gross who does not \nhave standard deductions and exemptions. By the way, this does not \nimpact on their capital gains, which is taxed at a different rate. This \ndoes not impact on the dividend exemptions or change the rate at all. \nThat is still theirs. We do not touch that at all. This is just a \nstraight tax of those who now fall within the 35 percent bracket.\n  So I am told by all the experts--and this is not my expertise. To the \nextent I have one, I think it is more on the Constitution and foreign \npolicy, and I am not suggesting I have one, but it is surely not here. \nI have tried to get the best information from as many sources. So we \nare talking about the incomes of people in the top bracket who are--by \nthe way, if one is in the top bracket now they are in the less than 1 \npercent bracket, they are about .7 of 1 percent of the income earners \nin America. One percent is slightly bigger than those who fall within \nthe 35-percent tax bracket right now. But if you overlap, as Dr. Green \ntells it, if you overlap the two circles, they are almost exactly the \nsame. There is some variation, but I can only go by the numbers \nprovided by the IRS, and the models provided by them, and by our Joint \nTax Committee.\n\n  So the bottom line is this: The people in the top 1 percent--slightly \nmore, by the way, than the people in the 35-percent tax bracket now--\nthose people, over the period of this entire tax cut, will receive \n$688.9 billion in tax reduction from what they were paying before the \ntax cut. What this does is it takes $87 billion of that amount, leaving \nthem with a present and future tax cut of $600 billion, as opposed to \n$688.9 billion.\n  This is to put it in perspective. Fully 80 percent of their fellow \nAmericans, in the first four quintiles--you know how they divide this \nup. They divide it up into the first, second, third, fourth, and the \nfifth is the 1 percent. In other words, all other Americans, the 99 \npercent of the other Americans who pay taxes get a cumulative tax cut, \nin the first--they will get cumulative tax cuts of $599 billion. All \nright? So you have the top 1 percent who will still get $600 billion, \nwhich will be $1 billion more than every other American combined will \nget in a tax cut.\n  Let me be precise. I may have misspoken. That is not true. The first \nfour--than 80 percent of the American people will get.\n  Now, again, this is not an attack on the tax cut. I didn't like the \ntax cut, and I won't talk about that. But what Senator Kerry and I are \ntrying to do takes away less than 5 percent of the $1.8 trillion in tax \ncuts that this tax cut bill provides. Again, it is not an attack on \nthose at the highest income. It still leaves them $600 billion in tax \ncuts.\n  There is a lot more for me to say, but I will yield now to my friend \nfrom Utah for that colloquy.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Delaware not only for his \ncourtesy and friendship, which is reciprocated and, as he has said on \nthe Senate floor, is genuine and real, but I thank him for the clear \nmanner in which he has described this whole situation. I agree \nabsolutely with the overall conclusion that he has come to with respect \nto loans versus grants. I am running this year, and I am going to have \nto defend the grant situation, but I am perfectly willing to do so for \nall the reasons which the Senator from Delaware has outlined.\n  But there are a few comments I would like to make in the spirit of \nour friendship and the seriousness with which the Senator from Delaware \nhas approached this issue--at random. The Senator from Delaware is \noften at random so he can understand.\n  The references to the Marshall plan and the difference between World \nWar I and World War II are accurate, but I would like to just add one \nfactoid.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I want to make it clear I did \nnot reference the Marshall plan. I referenced the philosophy. I think \nwe have overworked the Marshall plan analogy.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I agree with the Senator we have overworked it and I \nwant to back away from it with this fact. The country that received the \nmost money in the Marshall plan was Great Britain. It was not \nrebuilding destroyed countries, destroyed by virtue of our actions in \nthe war. It was rebuilding Europe that was exhausted by the struggle \nthat really began in the First World War and never ended. I think that \nis the appropriate analogy here.\n  I do not view Iraq as a defeated nation. I view Iraq as a victorious \nnation that has won a struggle of almost four decades in length with \nour help.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I agree with that premise. I am \nnot making the case they are a defeated nation.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator used the phrase ``defeated nation.'' I think \nit is, in fact, a victorious nation but an exhausted one by virtue of \nthe 40-year struggle. The grant we are talking about here is essential \nto come back from that 40-year experience.\n  The second random point: I listened to the Senator's comments about \nthe deficit. All I know, both before I came here and in the relatively \nbrief period of time I have been here, is that no matter what figure we \nuse with respect to the deficit in the future, it is wrong. I don't \nknow whether it is too high, and I don't know whether it is too low, \nbut I do know one thing for sure, it is wrong.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield on that point? The Senator will \nagree, though, that whatever it is will be $87 billion higher if we \ndon't pay for it.\n  Mr. BENNETT. No. No. I will not because the deficit is a function of \nthe vitality of the economy. If the economy is stronger than the \ncomputers at CBO are currently saying it is, the deficit could \ndisappear and we could have the whole $87 billion.\n  I am not saying that we will because I don't know.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield on that point, if the Senator \nthinks there is any possibility of the entire deficit disappearing \nthrough economic growth in the next several years, then I think he and \nI should have a talk now because the Senate physician is down the hall \nhere and we ought to go have\n\n[[Page S12320]]\n\na little visit with him. I know he doesn't seriously mean that.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I think the possibility is extremely, extremely small.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I believe in miracles, too. I am a Catholic. I believe in \nmiracles.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I do, however, know that over 50 percent of the \nshortfall in the projected surplus that we were talking about at the \ntime we started, in 2001, is due not to the tax cut and not to \nincreased spending but to the downturn in the economy. If the economy \nshould come back to be as strong as it was before--and there are signs \nthat it is recovering nicely now--that 50 percent could be recovered.\n  So, no, I agree that we will not remove the deficit, but I think it \nis an inaccurate statement to say it will be exactly the $87 billion.\n  We do that around here and it frustrates me as a former businessman. \nIt frustrates me as a legislator. We are constantly taking the latest \nnumbers from CBO and assuming that they are cast in stone. Then 3 \nmonths later, when we get the next set of numbers that completely \ncontradict the earlier ones, we say: Oh, these are the true numbers, \nand we go on and on. I am not arguing with the Senator's general \ndirection, but I wanted to be a little careful in the specificity with \nwhich he outlines this.\n  Let me get to the heart of the issue that I have with the proposal \nthe Senator is making. I hope I can do this without being too arcane, \nand I hope I can do it quickly because I recognize I am on the \nSenator's time and I again thank him for his courtesy.\n  Mr. BIDEN. May I ask, there is no time agreement right now; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. MURKOWSKI). That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. So the Senator is entitled to have it on his time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator. I think his experience at his \ncocktail party is one that would be repeated by every one of us if we \nwere to gather people of that kind of income in any one of our States. \nSo why don't we all join with the Senator from Delaware? Why am I not \nsaying I agree with him?\n  If I may illustrate the reasons with a personal example, not all of \nthe tax returns that are filed and that are in the statistical sample \nthe Senator described represent income to individuals. I do not know \nthe current number. I would have looked it up if I had known I was \ngoing to get in this exchange. But other numbers have said 75 percent, \n80 percent, or some very high figure of percentage of those tax returns \nthat show $400,000 in gross income are, in fact, not income to the \nindividual. Let me give you my personal example to illustrate this.\n  Before I came to the Senate, I was CEO of a company that was an S \ncorporation. S corporations as opposed to C corporations are exactly \nthe same thing except for the way they are taxed. The ``S'' refers to \nthat section of the Tax Code that is appropriate and ``C'' refers to \nthat section of the Tax Code that is appropriate. In an S corporation, \nthe earnings of the company flow through to the shareholders and are \nreported on the shareholders' personal tax returns. Therefore, they \nshow up as income to the individual.\n  I will again use myself as the example. I was the CEO of this \ncompany. I was earning $140,000 a year as the CEO of the company. The \ncompany started to do really very well. It was growing very rapidly. \nSales were more than doubling every year. We were bringing on new \npeople. We were building new buildings. We needed every dime of capital \nwe could put our hands on. Fortunately for us, we were doing this \nduring what the New York Times called ``The Decade of Greed;'' that is, \nwhen the top marginal tax rate was 28 percent.\n  By putting the income of the company on my personal tax return and \nthose of the other shareholders, the company was paying an effective \nrate of 28 percent which meant we got to keep 72 cents out of every \ndollar we earned to finance the growth of that company. We created that \ncompany with internally generated funds. We didn't do it by going to \nthe stock market. We didn't do it by going to the banks. Of course, we \nhad a line of credit at the bank. But it was not part of our capital. \nThat meant one of the last years before I left the company and decided \nto run for the Senate, my compensation from the company was $140,000.\n  Let us go through these numbers.\n  My compensation from the company was $140,000. My share of the \ncompany's profits which was reported on my 1040 was $1 million. As far \nas the IRS was concerned, I was a very rich man who was earning $1.14 \nmillion a year. All I got was $140,000. The rest of it, while reported \non my tax return, was kept in the company to pay for the growth of the \ncompany.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. Isn't it accurate that because it was a subchapter S \ncorporation all of the deductions also flowed through to you? Isn't it \naccurate? All the deductions flowed through you?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Of course. The net amount I reported after the \ndeductions was $1 million. So as far as the IRS was concerned, my \nincome was $1.14 million. Under the Tax Code, the deductions to which \nthe Senator from Delaware referred that go to people in these \ncategories were all wiped out by the $1 million. All of my credits, all \nof my deductions--everything was wiped out.\n  If we were to take the numbers the Senator from Delaware was talking \nabout, and say, OK, you have someone with a $400,000 gross income, and \nthat means his after-tax income is $312,000 because of the standard \ndeduction, if he has a chunk of 401-K income on this from either an S \ncorporation or an LLC corporation, or a partnership, all of those \nstandard deductions go away very quickly as the number goes up.\n\n  The point of this is not to argue one way or the other about how the \ntax structure is; it is to say the Senator is inadvertently targeting a \nlarge number of small businesses where profits and growth money are \nbeing reported on individual returns rather than through corporate \nreturns. The S corporations were made substantially worse after the \nReagan years because of the summit at Andrews Air Force Base, and then \nwhat was done with the Clinton tax increases.\n  There are not as many people using the S corporations as there used \nto be because the advantage is not as great. But there is a still a \nvery substantial amount of small business income that will be hit by \nthe Senator's amendment. We are not just talking about Donald Trump and \nJennifer Lopez. We are not talking about Michael Jordan. We are talking \nabout people who are building businesses for whom $400,000 a year for \nthe income of the business is a demonstration of a struggle. It is not \na demonstration of the kind of opulence you find at the Delaware \ncountry club. It is survival. We didn't get to the point with the \nbusiness I have described where we felt comfortable in cash flow until \nour earnings were well into the $10 million, $12 million, or $15 \nmillion area because of the demand for capital.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We are trying to get this agreement. As a practical \nmatter, this will come out of my time. I think the Senator has made his \npoint.\n  Let me make a macroeconomic point and let some of my other colleagues \nrespond as well. With regard to the small businesses, small business \nowners can still happen to be among the top 1 percent income earners. \nOnly 2 percent of the small business owners fall into that bracket, a \nnumber which includes a lot of people who have passive participation \nwith investment income in small business. These are not hands-on, mom-\nand-pop businesses. If you look at the sole proprietorships, those of \nhands-on owners, less than 2 percent are paying the 35 percent bracket. \nTherefore, 98 percent of the small business owners will not be affected \nby this proposal, as I understand from staff.\n  I will get back to this in our discussion. But I want to yield to my \nfriend from Massachusetts because we are about to enter into a time \nagreement. I didn't realize we were running the time before the \nagreement is made. At any rate, I will reserve the remainder of the \ntime while we are trying to work this out.\n  To respond to my friend, I understand his point. The bottom line is \nno matter how you cut it, this is affecting an incredibly small number \nof people for an incredibly important undertaking and the alternatives \nare worse\n\n[[Page S12321]]\n\nby a long shot, in my view, that any negative impact in any sector in \nany way would come from this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are moments away from offering a \nunanimous consent request. I don't know who is going to get the floor \nnext, but whoever gets the floor, I ask if Senators will allow an \ninterruption for the unanimous consent request. It should be coming in \na matter of a couple of minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, thank you very much. I will proceed until \nsuch time as the unanimous consent request is put into effect.\n  I listened carefully to the comments of the Senator from Delaware, \nand obviously the Senator from Utah. I think the comments of the \nSenator from Utah do not really change the equation at all because the \nreal question here is, Why is America being asked to pay this $87 \nbillion? What is the context within which the average citizen of \nAmerica, the average taxpayer is now being told, Whoops, we have a \nwhole different situation here. We have to pay $87 billion in addition \nto the $79 billion Americans have already invested in the war to date.\n  Most Americans think this is sort of the bill for the war. It is not. \nWe are well over $160 billion or $170 billion already once you add the \n$87 billion, and most people believe it is going to go beyond that.\n  The question is, What is the fair distribution of this burden in the \noverall context of our economy to the average taxpayer of America? Is \nit right for President Bush and for the Republicans to be asking \nAmerica to give an enormous tax cut to the wealthiest of Americans and \nspend the $87 billion, which also adds to the deficit for this year?\n  No one will come to the Senate and say the $500 billion deficit we \nare facing next year is going to be wiped out by growth in the economy \nwhen we are not even adding jobs in the growth to the economy today.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote in \nrelation to the pending Biden amendment occur at 3:15 p.m. today with \nno amendment in order to the amendment prior to the vote, provided the \ndebate before the vote be 30 minutes under the control of the \nRepublican side and the remaining time under the Democratic leader or \nhis designee.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that the Senator allow the consent to be modified, as \nfollows: Senator Biden be recognized for 30 minutes, within the time \nallocated to us; Senator Kennedy for 15 minutes; Senator Kerry for 20 \nminutes; Senator Kohl for 5 minutes; Senator Clinton for 10 minutes; \nSenator Conrad for 15 minutes; Senator Jack Reed for 5 minutes; Senator \nDurbin for 5 minutes; Senator Feinstein for 10 minutes; Senator Johnson \nfor 5 minutes, Senator Carper for 5 minutes; and if there is any time \nremaining, it would be under the control of the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object, I ask that this be \namended, since I have been waiting, so that I follow Senator Kerry for \nmy time.\n  Mr. REID. I think that is appropriate. And Senator Bunning will \nfollow Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. The question we ought to be asking is, What is the right \nthing to do that is in keeping with the values of America? We have the \nworst economy we have had, the worst jobs economy since Herbert Hoover \nwas President of the United States; 3.1 million Americans have lost \ntheir jobs, 2.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost. All across \nAmerica, people are watching outsourcing taking place as jobs are going \nto China, India, and other countries. They are not being replaced. We \njust picked up the newspapers a couple of days ago and saw that 2 \nmillion Americans have lost their health insurance retirement, it has \nbeen blown away for countless numbers of Americans. Health care has \nbeen lost for 2 million Americans. Governors across the country are \nraising taxes and cutting services. Infrastructure investments are \nbeing deferred.\n  What the Republicans and the President are asking is that we take \nanother $87 billion and still keep a tax cut for the wealthiest people \nin our country who are doing the best, who are already the most \ncomfortable, who are perfectly prepared to do their part to sacrifice, \nto contribute, not to grow the deficit--indeed, to relieve some of the \nfinancial pressure of this country, literally, to make things more fair \nin America.\n  What this is about is called fundamental fairness. Fairness. It is \nnot about class warfare. This is not about redistribution. Is it fair \nin America to suggest that you can add to the deficit--which it will \nthis year--to suggest all of the figures of this administration, which \nhave been wrong, can be wiped away on the backs of the average American \nso that the wealthiest people in the country can keep their tax cut? \nThat is the question. It is a pretty simple fundamental question.\n  If others want to come to the Senate and defend the notion, it is \nabsolutely OK to be misled, to have major players in the administration \ntell us, it is only going to cost $50 billion; it will come out of the \nIraqi oil; don't worry about it. And every one of those promises have \nbeen wiped away and left in tatters across this country.\n  Americans are angry about this. What is the Senate going to do? Stand \nhere and defend the proposition that America in its current fiscal \ncondition can support a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans at the \nexpense of common sense and fairness? That is what this vote is about. \nThat is what this choice is about.\n  It also is about the fundamental realities of how we got here. Last \nspring, our fighting men and women swept across the battlefields of \nIraq. There is not anyone in the Senate who is not proud of what they \naccomplished in military terms. Thanks to their courage and their \nskills, Saddam Hussein and his henchmen are scattered and that brutal \nregime is no more.\n  But in the aftermath of that military victory, just as many Members \npredicted, in the absence of building a coalition, in the absence of \ndoing the diplomacy, in the absence of showing patience and maturity, \nin the absence of living up to our highest values and standards about \nhow we take a nation to war, we are now in danger of losing the peace.\n  The clearest symbol of that danger is the target on the backs of \nyoung American men and women in Iraq. Today, soldiers in Baghdad fear \ngetting shot simply going out and getting a drink of water. A squad at \na checkpoint has to worry whether a station wagon coming at them is a \nmobile bomb. And troops moving in convoy take RPGs and improvised \nexplosive devices, and we pick up the papers each day and hear the news \nabout three, two, one more young American life lost because we failed \nto plan to win the peace adequately, we failed to put in place the \ngreatest protection possible for these troops, which is what they are \nowed.\n\n  Now we know Iraq's infrastructure needs to be rebuilt and we face the \nchallenge of forging a new government and giving it legitimacy under \ncircumstances that were entirely predictable and entirely ignored by \nthis administration. We were told by this administration, in their \nconfidence--and, may I add, in their arrogance--that the Iraqis would \nsee us as liberators.\n  They see us as occupiers--again, something many predicted absent the \neffort to try to globalize our effort. They see us as a foreign power \nruling over their country, preventing self-determination, not providing \nit. We were told to expect elections and quick transition to self-\ngovernance. But now we know those elections may be many months away at \nbest.\n  None of this was planned or predicted by the President or his war \ncounsel. Eager to rush to war, the administration played down or, \nworse, ignored the likelihood of resistance. It lowballed the number of \nforces that would be needed to seize the alleged WMD sites, for which \nthe war was fought, to protect the infrastructure, and underestimated \nthe magnitude of the reconstruction task and the ease with which oil \nwould flow for rebuilding. It refused to tell the American people \nupfront the long-term costs of winning the peace.\n  I remember the distinguished former President pro tempore and leader \nof the Democrats, the Senator from West\n\n[[Page S12322]]\n\nVirginia, asking that question penetratingly, repeatedly. Yet those \nfigures given have proven to be false or completely underballed. It \nrefused to tell the American people those long-term costs, and it \nrefused to do the work, to ask the international community to join us \nin this effort.\n  It was bad enough to go it alone in the war, but it is inexcusable \nand incomprehensible that we choose to go it alone in the peace. One of \nthe reasons we are facing $87 billion is that the administration has \nstiff-armed the United Nations and has not been willing to bring other \nnations to this cause through the deftness of their diplomacy, the \nskill of their diplomacy.\n  Last year, President Bush had three decisive opportunities to reduce \nthis $87 billion bill. That first opportunity came when we authorized \nforce. That authorization sent a strong signal about the intentions of \nthe Congress to be united in holding Saddam Hussein accountable. I \nthought, and still believe, that was the right thing to do. It was \nappropriate for the United States to help stand up at the United \nNations and hold those resolutions accountable. It set the stage for \nthe U.N. resolution that finally led Saddam Hussein to let the weapons \ninspectors back into Iraq. That was correct.\n  When I voted to give that authority, I said the arms inspections are \n``absolutely critical in building international support for our \ncase. That's how you make clear to the world we are contemplating war \nnot for war's sake, but because it may be the ultimate weapons \ninspections enforcement mechanism.''\n\n  The Bush administration, impatient to go into battle, stopped the \nclock on the inspections, against the wishes of key members of the \nSecurity Council, and despite the call of many in Congress who had \nvoted to authorize the use of force as the last resort the President \nsaid it would be.\n  Despite his September promise to the United Nations to ``work with \nthe UN Security Council to meet our common challenge,'' President Bush \nrushed ahead on the basis of what we now know to be dubious, \ninaccurate, and perhaps even manipulated intelligence.\n  So the first chance for a true international response that would have \nreduced this bill, that would have brought other countries to \ncontribute was lost.\n  Then there was a second opportunity. After the Iraqi people pulled \ndown the statue of Saddam Hussein in the square in Baghdad, there was a \nmoment when British and American forces had proven our military might \nand the world was prepared to come in and try to assume the \nresponsibility for helping to rebuild Iraq.\n  Once again, Kofi Annan and the United Nations offered their help. \nOnce again, this administration gave them the stiff arm. They said: No, \nthank you; we do not need your help. And we proceeded forward without \nbuilding the kind of coalition that would reduce the risk to our troops \nand without reducing the cost to the American people.\n  Then the third occasion was just the other day, when the President \nwent to the U.N. General Assembly. Other nations again stood ready to \nhelp to provide troops and, hopefully, funds. All President Bush had to \ndo was show a little humility and ask appropriately. Instead of asking, \nhe lectured. Instead of focusing on reconstruction, his speech was a \ncoldly received exercise in the rhetoric of redemption.\n  Kofi Annan offered to help. Again, we did not take them up on that \noffer in a way that was realistic. The President exhibited an attitude \nthat was both self-satisfied and tone deaf simultaneously, once again \nraising the risk for American soldiers by leaving them alone, and once \nagain raising the cost to the American people by leaving America alone.\n  I believe the President could have owned up to some of the \ndifficulties. The President could have signaled or stated a willingness \nto abandon unilateral control over reconstruction and governance. \nInstead, he made America less safe--less safe--in a speech and in \nconduct that pushed other nations away rather than brought them to our \ncause and what should be rightfully the world's cause.\n  So what of this cost of the Iraqi operation?\n  In the fall of 2002, OMB Chief Mitch Daniels told us the costs of \nIraq would be between $50 and $60 billion. It is now already more than \n$100 billion more than that.\n  In January of this year, Secretary Rumsfeld said the same, and he \nadded that ``How much of that would be the U.S. burden, and how much \nwould be other countries', is an open question.''\n  Well, today it is not an open question; it is a closed question. We \nknow the answer: The majority is being paid by the American taxpayers.\n  In March of this year, Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz testified in the \nSenate that Iraq is a ``country that can really finance its own \nreconstruction, and relatively soon.''\n  Did the Secretary mislead us or was the Secretary ignorant?\n\n  Again, in March, Secretary Powell testified in the Senate that ``Iraq \nwill not require the sorts of foreign assistance Afghanistan will \ncontinue to require.''\n  When Larry Lindsey predicted the war may cost $100 billion to $200 \nbillion, he was deemed so far off base by the White House that he was \nfired.\n  Now, a year later, Congress is set to appropriate over $160 billion, \nand the costs are estimated to rise to $350 billion to $400 billion \nover 5 years. Even Larry Lindsey's estimates are now low.\n  With so much so wrong, Americans are looking to the White House for \ndirection and leadership. They want, and they deserve, straight answers \nto straight questions.\n  How long will we be there? How much will it really cost? How many \nAmerican troops will it take? And how long will it be before we do what \ncommon sense dictates and get the world invested in this effort by not \ntreating Iraq as though it is an American prize, a loot of war but, \nrather, treating it as a nation that belongs in the community of \nnations, dealt with properly by the United Nations, as we did in Bosnia \nand Kosovo and Namibia and East Timor and in other parts of the world?\n  So far, the White House, with all of its evasion and explanation, has \nbeen a house of mirrors where nothing is what it seems and almost \neverything is other than what the President promised. But Americans are \nalso looking to us in the Congress for leadership.\n  The President has talked a lot about sacrifice in recent weeks. In an \naddress from the White House, he said of Iraq, ``This will take time \nand require sacrifice.'' In his weekly radio talk, he warned that \n``This campaign requires sacrifice.'' Even in his State of the Union \nAddress, the President issued a call for sacrifice saying: ``We will \nnot deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to \nother Congresses, other presidents, and other generations.'' But that \nis exactly what we are doing if we leave this $87 billion in its \ncurrent form.\n  Also, there can be no doubt that the President has demanded that most \nof this sacrifice will come from the men and women in uniform. More \nthan 300 troops have now already given their lives in Iraq. The Army is \nstretched too thin for its duties in Iraq. And troops who were promised \nthat they would be home long ago remain in Iraq.\n  The President has called on the National Guard and Reserve at \nhistoric rates and put more than 200,000 guardsmen and reservists on \nactive duty. The Pentagon has changed the rules so that a Guard unit's \nactivation date does not start until the troops arrive in Iraq. That is \na bookkeeping sleight of hand that keeps thousands of forces deployed \neven longer than they expected or were promised. And, incredibly, the \nPresident's call for sacrifice even included billing wounded troops for \nthe cost of hospital meals. Fortunately, the Congress rectified that \nproblem in this supplemental. But it is not yet law.\n  Despite all we are asking of the men and women in uniform, the bill \nwe now debate appropriates $87 billion simply by increasing the Federal \ndeficit. It asks no sacrifice of anybody in the United States today who \ncan afford it. This is an off-budget, deficit-spending free ride.\n  The amendment Senator Biden and I and others are offering changes \nthat. It will pay the cost of this bill. It will pay the cost of the \nentire $87 billion by simply repealing--not all, which I think we ought \nto do--a portion of the tax cut for the wealthiest Americans.\n\n  The Biden-Kerry amendment will ask those who can afford to pay this \nburden to do so, and make their contribution, make their sacrifice to \nthe effort to\n\n[[Page S12323]]\n\nwin the peace. It protects the middle class. It meets our obligations \nin Iraq. And it will help ensure that we have the resources necessary \nto accomplish our goals here at home, goals such as making health care \nmore affordable, paying for homeland security, and keeping the \nPresident's promise to leave no child behind.\n  We should not abandon our mission in Iraq, and we understand the \ndownsides of doing so. But we ought to demand that whatever we spend in \nIraq be paid for with shared sacrifice, not deficit dollars.\n  We are already shortchanging critical domestic programs to pay for \nunwise tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. In addition, the Bush \nfiscal record and its trillions in debt demand that we follow the \ncommonsense approach of our amendment.\n  Since President Bush took office, the cumulative 10-year budget \nsurplus has declined by almost $10 trillion. We have gone from the \nlargest budget surplus in American history to the largest deficit in \nAmerican history this year. We have added nearly $1 trillion to the \ndebt inside of a single Presidential term. On top of that, we have \npassed a huge tax cut during wartime for the first time in American \nhistory. And that is the height of irresponsible, reckless budgeting.\n  The Bush administration blames the budget crisis on the Nation's \nresponse to September 11 and on funding for domestic programs, but that \nis a stunning misstatement of fact.\n  The simple facts are that the fiscal policies supported by this \nadministration--tax cuts already passed, tax cuts that have been \nproposed, significant increases in defense spending and money for Iraq, \nand additional interest on the debt--have caused more than half of this \nturnaround. As the debt piles up, the President claims that he bears no \nresponsibility when he, in fact, and his policies are the primary \ncause.\n  Senator Biden and I are making a commonsense proposal. Rather than \nborrowing an additional $87 billion, we want to scale back a small \nportion of the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, for those making \nover $300,000 a year. The average income of those in that top tax \nbracket is $1 million a year. These Americans are not exactly hurting. \nTheir real average after-tax income rose a remarkable 200 percent in \nthe 1980s and 1990s, and their overall share of pretax income has \nnearly doubled over 20 years. That cannot be said of any other income \ngroup in the United States.\n  In the year 2000, the 2.8 million people who made up the top 1 \npercent of the population received more total after-tax income than did \n110 million Americans who make up the bottom 40 percent. Think about \nthat: The top 1 percent of Americans earned more income than the bottom \n40 percent, and that is after taxes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, under the time allocated, we have some \nextra time. So on behalf of Senator Biden, I yield 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is simply not unfair to ask those earning the most, \nthose who are the most fortunate, those who are the most talented, the \nhard-working Americans who are earning more than $300,000, not as a \nmatter of any kind of targeting except for the fact they are the best \noff and have the greatest ability, to make this sacrifice without a \nnegative impact on their lifestyle, on their choices, on their quality \nof life. This is a time for sacrifice. I believe it is appropriate for \nus to ask that in order to promote a free Iraq, in order to reduce the \nburden being placed on future generations of Americans, in order to \nreduce the burden placed on the middle class today, in order to have \nthe least negative impact on our economy, the least negative impact on \nlong-term interest rates, the least crowding out of borrowing by adding \nto the debt and crowding out private borrowing in the marketplace by \npublic borrowing, the least negative impact on perceptions, the best \nway for America to deal with this problem of misinformation, this \nproblem of promises broken is to turn to those the President seeks most \nto give the biggest breaks to most frequently and ask them to share the \nburden.\n  I hope my colleagues will do that, recognizing the sacrifice being \nmade on a daily basis by 130,000 of our troops who live and die by what \nwe do in the Senate and the House, in the Congress in Washington.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I meant to state earlier--and I know my colleague from \nCalifornia is about to speak--that the Senator from California was way \nahead of me and way ahead of my friend from Massachusetts in one very \nimportant respect. She and Senator Chafee, long before I made this \nproposal, suggested that, quite frankly, the entire top 1 percent of \nthe tax break be rolled back, not just $87 billion, to pay for this and \nfor other things to reduce the deficit. It was my intention to speak to \nthat. Then I entered into what was an exchange with my friend from \nUtah, and I did not. I want to make clear what a central role she and \nSenator Chafee have played in making the fundamental point that all \nAmericans should participate in making sure we win the peace and not \nsaddle the next generation. That is unconscionable.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware. I \nappreciate those words. Both Senator Chafee and I felt very strongly \nthat this rate rollback that affects the top 1 percent is really the \nright thing to do at this time.\n  I particularly compliment the Senator from Delaware on the way he \nworked out this bill, because essentially this is a rollback of the \naccelerated rate cut that the top 1 percent received in May 2003. It \nrolls back the acceleration just enough to pay the $87 billion cost of \nthis supplemental. So it becomes a very reasonable way to pay for a \npart of this war which, to date, including this supplemental, will cost \nthe American people more than $150 billion.\n  This is a big day in the Senate. As many of us have pointed out this \nweek at the Appropriations Committee hearing on the supplemental, there \nare questions in the $21 billion reconstruction portion of the \nsupplemental request. Senator Byrd has twice tried to divide the \npackage--once in the Appropriations Committee, once here on the floor. \nWe have not been successful in being able to do that.\n  At the same time, we also recognize the seriousness of the need that \nthe Iraqi people and their transportation and water infrastructure face \nafter decades of neglect. We certainly recognize the needs that our men \nand women have in Iraq.\n  The fact is, we don't have the money to pay for improvements in our \nown infrastructure. Owing to a lack of money, just a few hours ago I \ndecided against offering an amendment to this supplemental that would \nhave invested substantial moneys in our domestic infrastructure, a plan \nthat would have enhanced the safety, security, and efficiency of our \nhighway, transit, aviation, rail, port, environmental, and public \nbuildings infrastructure.\n  The reality is that there is no money to fund necessary improvements \nhere at home. The reality is, those of us on this side of the aisle \nhave become deficit hawks, whereas a few years ago it was the other \nside of the aisle. So today we have greatly enhanced spending for \npreparedness, for homeland security, and for the military.\n  How is it we can be expected to approve this supplemental without \nasking the most obvious question: How are we going to pay for it?\n  I have joined with Senators Biden, Kerry, Corzine, and others in \nsupporting this legislation because it will provide the necessary \nfinancial footing to appropriately execute our obligations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan as contained in this supplemental. In 1998, following \nnearly 30 years of deficits and a seventeenfold increase in the Federal \ndebt, from $365.8 billion to $6.4 trillion, bipartisan cooperation \nbrought the budget back into balance again. In 1998, we had the first \nsurplus in a long time. Some of the funds which would have gone to pay \ninterest on the debt were instead spent actually paying down the debt, \nand we were all delighted.\n\n[[Page S12324]]\n\n  Now deficits and interest costs are growing once again. Net interest \npayments on Federal debt will increase sharply, from approximately $170 \nbillion in 2003 to more than $300 billion by 2012. And we face a host \nof new challenges: the war on terror, the war in Iraq, the threat of \nNorth Korea. This has necessarily led to a shift in Government spending \ntoward improving our defense and homeland security capabilities. Yet \nmany of the challenges predating September 11 are still with us: \nimproving education, updating infrastructure, preparing for the \nretirement of the baby boom generation, which will all severely strain \nthe Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n  The CBO predicts that the Federal deficit for fiscal year 2004 will \ntop $500 billion.\n  We might dispute the actual amount, but let there be no doubt, it is \ngoing to happen. We are going to have the largest deficit in our \nhistory this year. A portion of every dollar we spend, from this day \nforward until the end of September 2004, will be borrowed money--money \nour children and grandchildren will have to repay.\n  It is no secret that if citizens wish to receive services or \nundertake activities as a Nation, they have the right to levy a tax \nupon themselves to achieve these ends. We have somehow lost this sense \nof obligation and we have concluded that providing for our national \ndefense, or for the education of our children, requires no more than \ncharging the costs to a Government credit card. This must stop.\n  In fact, as this supplemental request is currently structured, our \nchildren and our grandchildren will pay $3.60 for every dollar we \nborrow. This supplemental is not a request for $87 billion. It actually \ntotals $313 billion if you include the interest--$313 billion. It is \npenny wise and pound foolish to do this the way we are doing it, by not \npaying for it.\n  The President of the United States, in January of this year at his \nState of the Union, said the following words, and we from both sides of \nthe aisle rose in acclaim to these words:\n\n       This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will \n     not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other \n     Congresses, to other Presidents, and to other generations. We \n     will confront them with focus and clarity and courage.\n\n  Well, this is one challenge we are passing on to other Congresses and \nto other generations. We need not do it. This is a well thought out \nproposal to temporarily rollback a small portion of the accelerated tax \ncut for the top 1 percent--the wealthiest of all Americans.\n  As has been well stated, everyone who falls within this 1 percent \nmakes more than $310,000 a year in taxable income, which typically \nmeans that they are making more than $420,000 a year in gross income.\n  We have more income taxpayers in California than any other State. \nThirteen million out of 34 million people are income taxpayers. In \nCalifornia, this amendment will affect less than 250,000 families \npaying these taxes. These families are all in the top 1 percent they \nare the wealthiest Californians. Not one of them, at any time, has ever \ncome up to me and said: Senator, we want a tax cut. But I have had \nseveral come up to me and say: I didn't realize how much money I would \nreceive from the 2001 tax cut. And they have added that it was not \nreally necessary to do it.\n  We now have an opportunity, by scaling back a small portion of the \naccelerated cut associated with the May 2003 tax package, to pay for \nthis $87 billion supplemental. It makes good sense. Think of what it \nsaves for the future in terms of interest costs.\n  So what we are proposing generates $87 billion. It is a first step \ntoward putting our fiscal house in order. It pays for the President's \nsupplemental spending request. It doesn't revoke the 2001 reduction in \nthe top income tax rate, nor would it affect any other element of the \n2001 tax package. It would merely temporarily raise the marginal income \ntax rate of the richest in our society. These people could take pride \nin knowing that this supplemental would not create debt that would be \npassed on to their grandchildren, to your grandchildren, or to my \ngrandchildren.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to raise a few points on the war \non terror and offer my support for the President's supplemental \nrequest.\n  First, I am compelled to address the latest round of attacks against \nthe President's request to fund our Armed Forces and rebuilding efforts \nin both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We are at war. We may not have tens of thousands of soldiers storming \nthe beaches of Normandy. There are no forces with tanks positioned \nagainst a potential Soviet advance into Europe.\n  But let there be no misunderstanding. The war against terror is every \nbit as important as our fight against fascism in World War II. Or our \nstruggle against the spread of communism during the cold war.\n  I have full confidence that Kentuckians and the American people \nrealize this. But sometimes I wonder if some of my colleagues do, \nbecause appeasement in this war is not an option.\n  Over the past decade, we have seen the bombing of the World Trade \nCenter in 1993, 19 American soldiers dead in the bombing of the Kohbar \nTowers, and two U.S. Embassies in Africa blown up in 1996, and the \nbombing of the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen in 2000.\n  And then, instead of facing the threat of Islamic radicalism, we \nvirtually looked the other way, and sent American forces as \npeacekeepers elsewhere into places like Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo.\n  We still have thousands of American peacekeepers in Bosnia and \nKosovo. And these roles should be played by European forces who refuse \nto get serious about cleaning up their own backyard.\n  During the 1990s, the Western world was riding high as the cold war \nended. Millions of people around the world found their first taste of \nfreedom. Anti-American rhetoric was a mere fraction of what it is \ntoday. The global economy was humming along quite nicely.\n  However, some in the world digressed as we progressed. The Taliban \ncame to power in Afghanistan with its brutal regime over the Afghan \npeople. Afghan girls were kept out of school.\n  The regime executed political and religious dissidents. And al-Qaida \nestablished training camps freely under the Taliban government.\n  Saddam Hussein never accounted for his weapons of mass destruction \nprograms. He kicked out the UN weapons inspectors. He defied UN \nresolutions. He made payments to families of suicide bombers. Mass \ngraves were filled with bodies. He was a destabilizing threat.\n  And we let our guard down.\n  We all know what happened next--\n9/11. And that day changed everything. President Bush and Members of \nCongress from both parties vowed never again to let our guard down. We \nvowed to protect the American people at all costs. And the war on \nterror began.\n  Difficult times require difficult decisions, but supporting this bill \nshouldn't be a difficult decision.\n  Let's show our resolve with our commitment to finish this war on \nterror. Passing this supplemental will help get us closer.\n  We cannot pull back out of Iraq now, and should a vote come up in the \nSenate to pull our support out of Iraq, it would fail overwhelmingly.\n  Contrary to what opponents say, the war in Iraq is neither a \n``fraud,'' a ``quagmire,'' nor a ``miserable failure.''\n  This would suggest that our troops sent to liberate Iraq and fight \nterrorism have died in vain. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  From watching the news, one would think the Iraqis want us out of \ntheir country. But an overwhelming majority of Iraqis support our \ninvolvement there. Our freedom is contagious and we helped liberate \nthem.\n  Much progress has been made in relatively little time. American \ntroops stayed in Germany for 4 years and Japan for 7. We are still in \nBosnia and Kosovo. We can't expect democracy overnight.\n  Saddam invested in palaces and terror and not his economic \ninfrastructure. Many Iraqis had to wait until Saddam was gone to find \ntheir loved ones in one of his mass graves.\n  It is now time to ensure that the days of mass graves in Iraq ends.\n  Our military forces deserve quick Congressional action on this bill.\n  I have been following the 101st Airborne in Iraq. They are based at \nFort\n\n[[Page S12325]]\n\nCampbell, KY. Just this week, the commanding general of the 101st, \nGeneral Petraeus, told me that over in Iraq ``money is ammunition. It's \nthe key to all we are doing.''\n  The 101st is doing some great work in northern Iraq. Besides killing \nSaddam's two sons and accepting the surrender of Saddam's Defense \nMinister, the 101st has worked on over 3,200 projects in the rebuilding \nof Iraq. These range from repairing schools to repairing oil \nrefineries. They are doing truly remarkable work along with all our \nforces.\n  Some in Congress believe we should make the rebuilding funds a loan \nand not a grant. I oppose this approach.\n  While Iraq certainly has the resources to become a wealthy country, \nits revenue from oil should be used to invest in its own future, not to \npay off old debts incurred under Saddam or be burdened with the debts \nof a loan as it tries to transition to a free economy.\n  And besides, there is no established Iraq government to transfer a \nloan to.\n  I find great irony in the arguments of some who oppose the war. Many \nargued this war was all about the President's desire for oil.\n  Now many of these same people say we should use Iraqi oil to repay \nour Government. And President Bush is leading the charge on allowing \nIraqis to keep their oil revenues for themselves.\n  Planning for an Iraqi oil fund is now in the works. It will give \nIraqis a stake in the future of their country for the first time. Funds \nwould go to public goods, such as national defense, education, and \ninfrastructure.\n  This is the type of approach Iraq needs. We need to give the Iraqi \npeople a hand up and not keep their heads down with debt.\n  If we don't act swiftly on this bill and terrorism prevails in this \nwar, then we risk having to fight this war on America's turf. And that \nis why it is so vital to defeat the enemy on its turf as opposed to \nallowing them to regroup and hit us at home as they did on 9/11.\n  I don't like getting casualty notifications on soldiers, especially \nsoldiers in my State, and I don't like it for anybody's state. No \nSenator likes seeing them. It is difficult.\n  We all feel for the families and friends of the brave soldiers who \nhave died in Iraq and Afghanistan. I know what it is like for those \nwith loved ones still there. My wife and I felt the same way when our \nson Bill served in Operation Desert Storm and later in Afghanistan.\n  But we must remember that our cause is just and that we are on the \nright side of history.\n  We must remember that the war on terror may continue for some time. I \nam going to repeat that because I want the American people to \nunderstand that the war on terror may continue for some time. I \nacknowledge that this is a difficult point for many Americans to grasp. \nIndeed, it is difficult for many of us.\n  This is why it is time for us to move swiftly on this bill to protect \nour troops and help rebuild both countries. This bill is an investment \nin not just Iraq and Afghanistan, but it is an investment in our \nsecurity, freedom, and future.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to speak in \nfavor of the Biden amendment that is before the Senate, which offsets \nthe extraordinary expenses--$87 billion--we are being asked to consider \nin this supplemental appropriations act.\n  Before I get into that discussion, however, it is probably useful for \nall of us to, once again, realize what $87 billion really is. It is \nvery difficult to get our hands around such a sizable number. It is \nonly when we look at it in comparison to other important federal \nprograms, to other key economic indicators, that we can really develop \na better understanding of how much money this really is.\n  Mr. President, $87 billion is more than the combined budget deficits \nof all the 50 States in 2004. Even in the greatest fiscal crisis since \nthe Great Depression, the deficits of all 50 states were less than this \nsum.\n  Eighty-seven billion is 87 times what the Federal Government usually \nspends annually on afterschool programs. That is right, what we usually \nspend, because this year the Administration proposes cutting that by \nnearly $400 billion.\n  We have fought to try and get it back to just $1 billion for the \nafterschool programs that are so essential to assisting children \ndevelop the academic tools, personal confidence, and social skills \nnecessary for personal success and accomplishment in this country. Yet \nstill this Administration wants to slash this funding.\n  Again, this $87 billion is 87 times what we spend nationwide on \nafterschool programs.\n  It is 2 years' worth of unemployment benefits for the millions of \npeople who have lost their jobs on this Administration's watch. Every \ncouple of months, we have to fight tooth and nail to extend these \ntemporary benefits for Americans who cannot find work. And its always a \nfight.\n  These are not unmotivated citizens looking for a check they are \nhardworking Americans who can't find a job in this slack economy. If we \nhelp get them through this extraordinarily difficult time, they'll be \nback contributing to the unemployment insurance system in a very short \ntime period.\n  This $87 billion is enough to pay each of the 3.3 million people who \nhave lost their jobs in the past 3 years more than $26,000.\n  It is seven times what the President proposed to spend on education \nfor low-income schools. Make no mistake about it: This $87 billion is \nseven times the amount that this institution, the House of \nRepresentatives, and the President are allocating for the low-income \nschools in this country. It is seven times the amount we are spending \nfor the education of low-income children in this country.\n  It is nine times what this Federal Government spends each year on \nspecial education for those several million children, close to about 4 \nmillion, who used to be kept in closets or kept away from the public \nschool system. We don't do that anymore, we don't relegate Americans to \nlives of depravation, neglect, and isolation. For more than 25 years, \nwe have made steady progress, with section 504 of the Education Act and \nthen eventually the special education programs, the IDEA, some 25 years \nago. We have made remarkable progress.\n  What we are now looking now is that so many of these children \ngraduate from high school, go on to college, and enter the workforce. \nThey have a sense of value of their own self worth, a sense of dignity, \nand they now contribute to the productivity of this nation. And what a \ndifference it makes to their parents, and their communities, and their \ncountry. Yet in one stroke of the pen, we are about to send nine as \nmuch money to Iraq as we invest in special education each year.\n  This $87 billion is also eight times what the Government spends each \nyear on the Pell grants to provide middle- and low-income students the \nopportunity to go to college. The average income of families needing \nthis assistance is $15,200. And there are more than 4,800,000 young \npeople nationwide relying on this badly needed grant help.\n  We began the Pell Grant program at a time when we as a nation to our \nyoung people that if they have ability and they can gain entrance into \nthe colleges where they are applying, we will help devise a package of \ngrants, loans, and work study programs in conjunction with their own \nsummer employment and contributions from their family, so that they can \nachieve their highest aspirations.\n  That was an incredibly important choice for the economic and social \nwell-being of this country. It is important in terms of ensuring that \nwe are going to have well-qualified people in the military. It is \nimportant in terms of our institutions and democracy.\n  Yet this $87 billion is eight times what we are allocating for \nmiddle-income and low-income families to send their children to school. \nDo my colleagues understand that? It is eight times that amount, and we \nhad to battle this year, a fight which we lost, to bring the Pell \ngrants up to respond to the increase in tuitions that are taking place \nacross this country. We wanted $2.2 billion, but we lost that $2.2 \nbillion in the Senate. This Senate didn't have the money to help more \nfamilies send their kids to college this year, and now we know why.\n\n  This $87 billion is eight times the total Pell grants. That is what \nwe are\n\n[[Page S12326]]\n\ntalking about. It is larger than the total economy of 166 nations. So \nthis is a major allocation of resources that is going to bind our hands \nfor years to come.\n  What does the Biden amendment do? The Biden amendment says we are \ngoing to pay for this. We are not just going to allocate these \nresources and add it to the debt of this country, which means our \nchildren and our grandchildren are going to have to pay this some time \nin the future.\n  We passed a very generous tax reduction program for the top 1 percent \nof the taxpayers in this country. Now listen to this: Between 2003 and \n2010, the top 1 percent of the taxpayers, which have an average income \nin excess of $1 million, are going to get $690 billion in tax relief. \nDo we understand that?\n  With the tax reductions that this Congress has passed over the period \nof the last 2 years, the top 1 percent is going to get $690 billion. \nThose are individuals who are making $1 million or more. That is going \nto be their savings over the next 7 years, $690 billion. All the Biden \namendment says is rather than $690, let's make it $600 billion, in \norder to make a down payment on paying for the war.\n  Shared sacrifice, now that is a pretty good American idea. Abraham \nLincoln believed in it when he call for an increase in the tax for the \nwealthiest individuals at the time of the Civil War. We did exactly the \nsame thing at the time of the Spanish-American War. Shared sacrifices \nacross the board, by those who had the highest income. We did it in \nWorld War I. We did it in World War II. Why are we not doing it with \nthis?\n  That is all this amendment is really about, shared sacrifice. To the \nwealthiest 1 percent of individuals, we are saying when we have \nAmerican servicemen who are risking their lives every day families \nbeing disrupted in terms of the National Guard and the Reserves--you \ncan give up some portion of your $690 billion tax cut. I met with many \nfrom Massachusetts' servicemen who have come back from Iraq and \nAfghanistan to find their jobs in jeopardy gone because of the state of \nthe economy. Families are separated for a much longer time than they \never expected.\n  In our State, there are 11 families who have lost a loved one and \nscores of families with grievously wounded relatives and friends. Why \ncan we not say that we are going to have some shared sacrifice? Instead \nof the $690 billion, we will make it just under $600 billion. That is \nwhat this amendment is about.\n  Finally, it seems to me a powerful enough argument, but listen, when \nwe enacted this tax cut, the administration officials, like Secretary \nRumsfeld, were saying, ``I do not believe the United States has the \nresponsibility for reconstruction.'' That was at the time we were \npassing the tax cut.\n  We enacted this tax cut when the USAID Administrator Natsios was \ntelling the American people the total U.S. portion of construction \ncosts would be $1.7 billion and there are no plans for further on \nfunding after this.\n  This is $87 billion on top of the $78 billion that we have already \nput up to fund this effort in Iraq. What happened to $1.7 billion? We \nenacted this tax cut when Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz \nwas informing the Congress, that we are ``dealing with a country that \ncan really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon.'' Do not \nworry about it the cost was what we heard.\n  As a result of the administration's failure to plan for the true \ncosts of the Iraq operation and its failure to obtain substantial \ninternational support, we are now faced with a staggering \nreconstruction of $20 billion for Iraq which may be the only first \ninstallment. This is only the first installment.\n  Before the Armed Services Committee, Ambassador Bremer said he \nexpects to be back again. When is it going to end? Ambassador Bremer is \nnow suggesting the total reconstruction costs may ultimately reach $60 \nbillion. Those are the World Bank estimates. Because of the \nadministration's go-it-alone on Iraq, the costs of that mistake have \nclimbed to over $120 billion.\n  Clearly, the circumstances have changed. The administration has \ngrossly underestimated the costs now coming due.\n  President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld, and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz \nwanted to go to war in the worst way, and they did.\n  Now the bill is coming due. The Biden amendment is the right way for \nCongress and the country to pay the bill, and I urge my colleagues to \napprove this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address the Biden amendment \nand make comments regarding it. I rise in opposition to that amendment \nand I wanted to indicate why.\n  First, I want to indicate how we got to the point we are today. There \nwere a number of people who came forward to say this is a huge bill--\nand it is. This is too much. I think we should examine that issue. I \nhope nobody says we should not be paying, because we have started down \nthis road sometime back and it was the Congress that started down this \nroad, not the administration. It was the Congress that started down \nthis road. I think we now need to see this on through or we could leave \nthe situation that we in the Congress started in a worse position than \nit was when we got into this in the first place.\n  This is what I want to point out. Congress passed the Iraq Liberation \nAct in 1998. This was the vote in the House of Representatives: 360 to \n38. The Senate, by unanimous consent, passed this bill, the Iraq \nLiberation Act.\n  What did it call for? It called for regime change in Iraq. This was \nsigned into law by President Clinton. We allocated, authorized, and \nappropriated $100 million to spend on this effort of regime change in \nIraq. That was to get Saddam Hussein out of Iraq.\n  He was supporting terrorists, he had used weapons of mass \ndestruction, he wreaked terrorism upon his own people, and he was \ncosting us billions of dollars a year in containment because we had \nsoldiers and airmen stationed in Saudi Arabia, and we were doing \nregular bombings into Iraq. We were conducting no-fly zones in the \nnorth and in the south. We built airbases in Saudi Arabia to be able to \nmove this on forward.\n  This was an untenable situation. It was bad for the Iraqi people, bad \nfor us, and bad for the region. All the countries in the region had \nsome difficulty or problem, either being attacked, as Kuwait was, \nlaunched into, as Saudi Arabia was, threatened, as Jordan had been, at \nwar as Iran. These are the countries, other than Turkey and Syria, that \nsurround Iraq. Most of the countries in the region were saying \nsomething needed to be done, but they weren't willing to step forward \nunless the United States was serious. This was part of our statement \nthat we were serious.\n  President Bush took this forward after 9/11 when the whole world \nchanged for the United States. We decided after 9/11 that we would no \nlonger wait for the terrorists to gather up steam and build up forces \nagainst us and then launch. We were going to go to the terrorists and \ndisrupt them first, rather than wait until they came to our soil so \ntragically. Thus ensued the war on terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  In Iraq, we had a country that had in the past used chemical weapons \nagainst its own people and against the Iranians. That is the fact and \nthat is what we knew and this is where it started, and it started with \nthe Congress.\n  Now to the issue today of the supplemental and how do we pay for it. \nI think it would be a terrible mistake for us at this time to raise \ntaxes on the American people, just at the time when we are starting to \nget the economy recovered and moving again.\n  Finally, this last quarter we had our best quarter in 2 years, with \n3-percent GDP growth. The Gross Domestic Product grew by 3 percent this \nlast quarter. We are finally getting some growth and that growth has to \noccur and has to build up for us to create jobs. There is a lag between \nthat growth and creating jobs. If we go right now and say to the \nAmerican people that we are going to raise taxes on you at this point \nin time, you are going to threaten the very early stages of growth and \nthe creation of jobs which is starting to take place. That is the wrong \nmessage to send.\n\n  The thing we need to do is keep the growth occurring in this country. \nYou do that by low interest rates and by\n\n[[Page S12327]]\n\nlowering taxes. Those are the two tools that are being displayed and \nused now, and they are working to start the economic recovery. If you \ngrow taxes at this point in time, you send the wrong message.\n  We do have a growing Federal deficit. What should we be doing to \naddress that? I think we should address that issue of the Federal \ndeficit. It is important. It is an issue. It is something that needs to \nbe addressed.\n  I want to put forward an idea that we have 28 cosponsors on now. I \nwant to put it forward in the context of how we balanced the budget in \nthe past. We were able to balance the budget for several years in a \nrow. It is the Congress that appropriates the money and allocates the \nspending. It is the Congress that gets the budget either in surplus or \ndeficit, and it was the Congress that balanced the budget previously.\n  How did we do it? There were two things. There was a strong growth in \nthe overall economy producing receipts coming into the Federal \nGovernment and there was a slowing of the growth in Federal spending. \nWe restrained the growth of Federal spending so the growth in the \neconomy and the receipts it produced were more than the growth in the \nspending of the Federal Government, and we were able to get our way to \na position where we had a balanced budget for several years in a row, \nindeed pushing forward strong surpluses.\n  That is the way we will balance the budget again. Getting the economy \ngrowing and restraining the growth in Federal spending.\n  How do we restrain the growth in Federal spending? The Commission on \nAccounting and Review of Federal Agencies--CARFA, for short. The model \nfor it is the BRAC procedure. With the BRAC procedure, we looked at the \ntotality of the military bases we had. We said we had too many military \nbases; we should cut back those military bases, consolidate them, and \nuse whatever we can save if we can save among the bases we keep. It is \ncalled the BRAC process.\n  How does that work? We had a commission. The commission met, they \ndiscussed it, and said we should eliminate these 50 bases. Then a bill \nwas introduced in the Congress with no amendments, and you gave each \nHouse one vote up or down, whether they agree or disagree. By that \nmeans we were able to eliminate and consolidate bases.\n  I say let's do the same thing with domestic discretionary programs. \nBy that I am saying not for the military; we already have a procedure \nthere. Not for entitlement programs. Let's move forward that way, and \nthat is a way we can address this issue. That is how we will actually \nget back to a balanced budget, not by raising taxes.\n  As to Iraqi spending, I want to discuss that. I think we should \nreview and reduce some of the spending in this area that has been \nproposed. I have gone through in some detail, not the full proposal yet \nbut most of it. I think there are areas we should not be paying for. \nMemorials to human rights abuses--clearly those are things that would \nbe good to do. But should we, the American people, the American \ntaxpayer, be paying for that? Is that central to redeveloping Iraq? I \ndon't think it is, particularly at this time.\n\n  Should we be paying $50,000 per garbage truck? I don't think so, not \nin a part of the world that maybe it would be good to have, but there \nis probably garbage being collected in old pickup trucks. That is the \nway we used to do it in my hometown many years ago. There is nothing \nwrong with that, maybe, at the current stage of development. Maybe \nlater you would use something better. But I think we should take some \nof these areas and say, let's pull those down and pull those out and \nlet's reallocate some into more policing, which is critically important \nin Iraq, for us to get our troops garrisoned and less subject to \nexposure. Put it in the Iraq development bank, where we can see the \nIraqi people growing their own money and we will be saving some of the \nmoney for our deficit purposes here, working to reduce that. I will be \nworking with a group of people to put such a proposal together and put \nit in front of my colleagues.\n  I think that is an important part the job of this body, to review \nwhat the President has put forward and see where we agree and let's \npass that and other areas where we would change it.\n  I do not think it is an option for us not to pass the supplemental. \nWe need the supplemental for the troops. We need the supplemental to \ndevelop Iraq. It is not an option for us to fail in Iraq. We must \nsucceed. Indeed, Iraq and its success is central to us bringing forward \na reduction in the swamp area where terrorism has bred and where it has \nstewed and where it has grown, in an area we have seen terrorism coming \nforth and attacking us. This is an area we have to go out and change. \nWe change it by bringing forth our ideas and our models of democracy, \nof an open society, and of a free economy. This Iraq is going to be an \narea where we will have to concentrate and focus, deliver that, and \nhopefully that will affect much of the rest of the region. There is \nsome indication that is already happening.\n\n  So you drain the swamp away, and drain it away with our set of ideas.\n  Failure in Iraq is not an option. We must succeed in Iraq by moving \nforward with our model on the war on terrorism, which is we take the \nwar there rather than letting them gather steam and come at us and kill \nour people here.\n  I think there are legitimate ways to address this issue. I think we \nought to look at the issues of loans versus total grants. This is a \nlarge-scale, oil-based country that wants those production wells going \nagain. I think there is going to be oil produced and a substantial \namount of income.\n  I think we ought to look at the overall proposal. There are places \nwhere we should adjust. But overall, we are going to need to pass this \nsupplemental. For us to raise taxes at a time when we are just getting \nthe economy going would be the wrong way for us to go as a government, \nas a society, and for this country.\n  We have to allow this growth to continue taking place. The key here \nwould be instead of reducing our overall spending to look for places we \ncan save within this overall spending bill.\n  We are going to have a spirited debate. As we go out for a week and \ndo townhall meetings across the country--and I will be doing that in my \nState--I look forward to gathering a lot of input from individuals. I \nthink that will be helpful for us as we move forward.\n  But I don't want us to send an improper signal. Failure in Iraq is \nnot an option. We cannot fail. We need to do this supplemental, but I \nthink we can make some changes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise today to voice my support for the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Delaware. His amendment allows us to fully offset the $87 \nbillion cost of the supplemental before us by increasing slightly the \ntop tax rate in the years 2005 to 2010. This top tax rate--which is \npaid only by the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers--was cut \ndramatically in the two tax cut bills passed since President Bush took \noffice.\n  There is broad consensus for the $67 billion in this request for \nmilitary and defense spending. And even those of us who voted yesterday \nto cut $15 billion in reconstruction funding did so to make the point \nthat we have lingering questions about the nature of this funding and \nwho will pay for it. However, our support for funding our obligations \nin Iraq doesn't mean that we support adding to the exploding deficits \nour Nation is now facing. The Biden amendment does not question whether \nwe should fund the war--it addresses how we finance our necessary \nobligations.\n  The President has proposed paying for the entire $87 billion with \ndebt. In a time when our deficit is projected to top half a trillion \ndollars a year, this choice is unsupportable.\n  Our ballooning government debt sucks capital from a private sector \nstruggling to recover lost manufacturing jobs. The debt places upward \npressure on interest rates, wreaking havoc on the family budgets of \nthose carrying home loans or consumer debt. The billions we pay in debt \nservice each year is billions that does not go to our schools, our \nroads, or our growing homeland security needs. And a crippling debt is \na terrible legacy for future generations--generations that had no say \nin our current policies in Iraq.\n  Financing this war with debt is a costly and unwise choice. The Biden\n\n[[Page S12328]]\n\namendment offers another way to pay for what we have an obligation to \ndo.\n  On September 7, the President said in a speech to the Nation that the \nwar and reconstruction of Iraq would require ``time and sacrifice.'' \nFor months, we have asked the young men and women of the Armed Forces \nto make the ultimate sacrifice: to fight--and perhaps die--for this \ncountry. Senator Biden's amendment asks another group--the wealthiest 1 \npercent of all Americans to also sacrifice--to accept a small increase \nin a tax rate that was greatly decreased by the Bush tax cuts.\n  The Senator's amendment offsets the cost of the President's request \nby asking the top 1 percent of taxpayers, those in the 35 percent \nbracket, to forego approximately $90 billion of the $690 billion in tax \ncuts they were granted in the two tax bills we have passed since \nPresident Bush took office. A taxpayer in the top 1 percent has an \naverage income of $1 million a year. Asking for some financial \nsacrifice from these taxpayers seems the least onerous of the options \nfor financing this war.\n  Whatever we decide to do with this spending request, we must pay for \nit now. Offsetting the cost of this supplemental is the right thing to \ndo. It asks those who have benefited the most from our thriving economy \nto help keep that economy healthy by reducing our growing debt burden. \nIt relieves future generations of the staggering bill for a policy they \nhad no part in setting. And it sends a signal to our Armed Forces that, \nwhen the President calls for sacrifice, he is not only calling on them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Biden amendment, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from \nWisconsin for a very straightforward and profoundly important summary \nof the reasons why we should in a bipartisan manner support the Biden \namendment. The Senator from Wisconsin is an expert on the economy, on \ncreating jobs, and on building businesses as well as public policy. He \nhas the understanding that we have to look beyond the horizon if we are \nto be leaders to build a better America and a safer world for our \nchildren. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  I, too, urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport the Biden amendment. This is an issue of great importance we \nare debating. It is not only essential that we support our troops--\nwhich we all do and feel strongly about--in a fiscally responsible \nmanner so these young men and women who are fighting and dying in Iraq \nwill be able to return to a country with a growing economy which is \ncreating jobs and a responsible government.\n  At the end of the day, as the Senator from Wisconsin just said, we \nare funding this war from our children's inheritance. It is wrong. I \ndon't care what else you could say about it. That is fundamentally \nwrong. We have a chance to act responsibly. Unfortunately, the words \n``fiscal responsibility'' and ``fiscal discipline'' apparently are not \nfound in the current administration's dictionary. There is nothing \nresponsible or fair about the decisions we are being asked to make.\n  This administration hasn't really asked for sacrifice from anybody. \nBut there are people who are sacrificing. First and foremost, our men \nand women in uniform, our active duty, our Reserve, our Guard, people \nwho have now been deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan in our war against \nterror, people who have left their families and have been uprooted from \ntheir jobs, they are all sacrificing. And I am grateful and proud of \nthe work and services they provide.\n  But this President's budget also asks other Americans to sacrifice. \nIt asks children and afterschool programs to sacrifice. It asks people \nwho need job training and additional skills to be employable in this \njobless economy to sacrifice. It asks people who need help with their \nheating and cooling bills to sacrifice. It asks those who need child \ncare services to sacrifice. It asks so many Americans to sacrifice. Yet \nit does nothing to remove the burden from those people or our children.\n  Amazingly enough, those of us who can afford to sacrifice for our \nnational and international goals are not asked to sacrifice at all. In \nfact, it is just the opposite. We are given more and more and more tax \ncuts.\n  What is the administration's policy except to further burden hard-\nworking, middle-class Americans and future generations and not do \nanything to try to in a fiscally responsible way address our needs?\n  Think about it. Just a few years ago we were in the midst of the \nlongest string of budget surpluses since the 1920s. We were paying down \nour debt, we had historically low numbers of unemployed people, and we \nlifted millions of people out of poverty. President Bush said just 2 \nyears ago the country would be virtually debt free by 2008. He said \nthere would only be $36 billion of remaining debt.\n  As we have seen in so many instances, the rhetoric does not match the \nreality. Today it is projected that our publicly held debt--and some \nmay not want to hear, but the fact is by 2008 it will reach $6.2 \ntrillion. We have done a tremendous reversal. Who will pay for it? The \nyoung people in this gallery who watch the proceedings in the Senate. \nThey are the ones who will get the due bill for our profligacy, our \nrefusal to act responsibly. The administration is denying the absolute \nreality that we are not paying as we go for a commitment on which we \nhave to follow through.\n  Here we are with a request for $87 billion. I was pleased to hear my \ncolleague from Kansas on the other side of the aisle say they join in \nlooking at some of the specifics because some of the specifics are \noutrageous. We now know from people coming back from Iraq that a lot of \nwhat the administration says they want to spend money on we can buy \nmore cheaply than the no-bid contracts the administration favors with \ntheir friends. I was delighted to hear the Senator from Kansas say \nlet's look at the specifics. But that still does not get us where we \nneed to go in paying for this.\n  There will be a big debate about how to pay for this. We can start by \npassing the Biden amendment, by being responsible. I also add, this is \ngood for the economy. All this talk about the increase in the GDP on a \nmonthly basis--look at the numbers carefully. A lot of it is driven by \ndeficit spending and spending in Iraq.\n  Nobody is arguing that is not a good thing that we are having to do \nwhat we said we would do and following on, but be honest and look at \nthe numbers below the surface. As the Senator from Wisconsin said \ncorrectly, we are going to stall this economy dead in its tracks if it \never gets off the dime, if it ever begins to create jobs, because we \ncannot sustain private capital when we have so many demands growing \nfrom the Government. Furthermore, we are becoming even more dependent \non foreign currencies, on foreign investors. I don't think that is good \nfor our long-time security either.\n  Instead of just pushing our country deeper in debt, let's think about \nour children, think about those young men and women serving this very \nmoment in Iraq, and make sure we pay by asking those in the upper 1 \npercent of the income level in this country to do our fair share to \nmake a sacrifice. It is a pittance when you think about it. What are we \nsacrificing? Instead of $690 billion in tax cuts, we give $600 billion \nin tax cuts. Do the right thing. It is good for our commitment in Iraq, \ngood for our economy, and the very fairest thing we can do for our \nchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor to the Biden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I follow up on the comments of the Senator \nfrom New York with respect to sacrifice. Our State is a small State. We \nonly have about 800,000 people. We have reservists who serve in all the \nbranches of our military. We have the Delaware National Guard unit. \nWhen I was Governor, I was privileged to be their commander in chief. I \nknow many of them personally, as well as their families.\n  When guard and reservists are called to be deployed to active duty, \nusually our Governor is there to send them off and tries to be there to \nreceive them when they come home. Similarly, when it is a unit of \nanother branch of the\n\n[[Page S12329]]\n\nservice--Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines--we like to be there to welcome \nthem home, too.\n  I will mention two units, one Marine Reserve unit, the second a unit \nof the Delaware National Guard, folks who fly and maintain the C-130 \ncargo aircraft, part of the air bridge between this country and other \nparts around the world.\n  About 2 weeks ago, I was invited to be part of a welcome home \nceremony for a number of Marine reservists. They had been called to \nactive duty. They served in Iraq. They were able to come home to their \nfamilies. They came home largely to their spouses--mostly to wives--\nthey came home to their children, came home to brothers and sisters, \nmoms and dads in many cases, they came home to their neighbors, and \nthey came home to their jobs. I don't think it is overstating it to say \nthey are thrilled to be home--proud of their service, thrilled to be \nhome.\n  I had another unit in the Delaware National Air Guard 166. The people \nwho fly and maintain the C-130 cargo aircraft were activated earlier \nthis year and spent 4 months on active duty and then were released to \ncome home to a great homecoming ceremony, a lot of joy. Then they were \nreactivated roughly a month ago and headed back on the other side of \nthe world. I am not sure when they are coming home.\n  They missed the return of their children to school, will probably not \nbe around to take the kids out to trick or treat this year. When their \nfamilies sit around and eat at the Thanksgiving table and carve up the \nturkey, they probably won't be there. When presents are opened around \nChristmastime, God only knows where they will be. Those families know \nwhat it means to sacrifice, not just the ones who are overseas--whether \nthey are Delaware National Guard, any National Guard, any Reserve unit, \nor anyone on active duty.\n  It is one thing to ask the sacrifice of those who serve. As one who \nonce served, that is your job description. You are expected to be \nprepared to go and serve when needed. It is always toughest on those \nwho stay behind because they give up their loved one, they give up \nsomeone who is helping to hold the family together in many cases; in \nsome cases they give up a breadwinner who has gone off to earn a far \nlower salary. They know what sacrifice is.\n  What the Biden amendment says is, for those who are blessed with \ngreat financial well-being, whose income exceeds $300,000 per year \nadjusted gross income, maybe we can do something, too. We may not have \na child, a son or a daughter; we may not have a brother or sister. And \nI know Senator Johnson has a son who I believe still serves over there, \nbut for the most part we do not. For the most part, people with those \nincomes do not. But we have the ability to do something to help out in \nthis case. I don't think it is asking too much for those who happen to \nmake that kind of income to be willing to defer maybe $2,000 a year to \nhelp make sure that our children and our grandchildren do not inherit \nan even greater mountain of debt.\n  Let me close with one comment. Sometimes you talk to people about the \namount of debt and the numbers are almost numbing. Let me leave you \nwith this number: Today, on this day of October 2, we will make an \ninterest payment on our national debt--imagine a credit card--an \ninterest payment on our national debt. The interest payment is $882 \nmillion.\n  We can bemoan that fact and say that is terrible, why don't we do \nsomething about it, or we can, with our vote today, do something about \nit and make sure we do not add further to that debt.\n  A fellow who used to be the British Chancellor of the Exchequer had a \ntheory of holes. That theory was as follows: When you find yourself in \na hole, stop digging.\n  We are in a hole, and it is time to stop digging.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Biden amendment. \nThere is no question we will support our troops. My colleague from \nDelaware mentioned my own son Brooks, who has recently returned from \nfighting in Iraq, in Baghdad; outside of Kandahar, Afghanistan prior to \nthat; and Kosovo and Bosnia prior to that. So I have a full \nappreciation, as do my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this \nChamber, that our fighting men and women deserve all the resources they \nneed, and we will do all it takes to make sure they have those \nresources.\n  But there is the larger question of the $87 billion, particularly I \nthink the $20.3 billion component for so-called rebuilding in Iraq, \nalthough when we say ``rebuilding,'' keep in mind that the President is \nnot talking about rebuilding things that were damaged in the war; the \nPresident is talking about creating schools, whole new cities, whole \nnew water and telecommunications systems that have never existed in all \nof Iraq's history.\n  But the fundamental question we have here at this moment is, How will \nthis be paid for?\n  There have been essentially--until the Biden amendment--two \nstrategies. One is that Iraq borrow the money and build it themselves. \nThey sit atop the world's largest supply of oil, literally a mountain \nof gold. Granted, they do not have the technology to pump that oil \nquickly at this point in their history, but it is there and could be \ncollateralized.\n  Second is the President's recommendation, where, rather than Iraq \nborrowing to pay for the $87 billion, we borrow it to pay for the $87 \nbillion, because we do not have $87 billion either. We do not have $87 \nbillion in cash lying around. In fact, we have gone from record budget \nsurpluses only 2 years ago to, under the guidance of this President, an \nannual deficit now approaching $500 billion a year. It is a \nbreathtaking record deficit that we face. So we do not have any surplus \nmoney to be used anywhere, including in Iraq.\n  The President says: Well, we do not want Iraqis to have to borrow \nbecause that might raise their debt service cost, despite the fact they \nhave the world's largest pool of oil. Instead, let's borrow it out of \nour Social Security trust fund. That is the President's strategy. I \nthink it is a terrible strategy. We have been doing too much of that as \nit is. To borrow still more, and drive our deficit still deeper, to put \nSocial Security in still greater jeopardy in the outyears is, to me, \nnot an acceptable strategy.\n  Senator Biden has suggested there is a third way. If the President \nsimply will not accept the fact that Iraq ought to borrow this money \nthemselves, then at least let's not borrow it out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund from the United States; let's allow those who have \nbenefited the greatest by the growth of the United States economy--\nthose 1 percent of Americans who earn over $300,000 a year--to have a \ntemporary freeze in the tax reductions over the course of 5 years that \nwould pay the $87 billion.\n  It troubles me that this President and some of our colleagues--who \nare constantly lecturing us about how there is not enough money for our \nown schools, for our own highways, for our own health care, for our own \nveterans, for our own job creation--are the very first ones to come to \nthis body and tell us how badly we need to spend that same amount of \nmoney in Iraq, and borrow it out of the Social Security trust fund \nwhile we are at it. It is not acceptable to me.\n\n  I have to wonder about those kinds of priorities when we have such \ngreat unmet needs here and when, Heaven knows, we are also facing \nstupendous budget deficits. So it does seem to me that Senator Biden is \ncorrect in saying, let's not go down the borrowing route ourselves, \nlet's pay for this, if it needs to be paid for. And, frankly, there are \nmany components of that $20 billion piece which I am dubious about, but \nif we are going to pay for any of this, let's pay for it by making sure \nthat ordinary Americans are not hit once again.\n  As was noted earlier, our troops and their families are making \nimmense sacrifices, for many the ultimate sacrifice. But there are \nother people who are making sacrifices as well--in terms of crowded \nclassrooms, in terms of schools that are not being repaired, in terms \nof technology that we cannot afford in our schools, in terms of those \nwho have no access to health care, in terms of rural hospitals that are \nclosing, in terms of veterans who have no access to the VA, and in \nterms of those who have lost their jobs and see no jobs in the near \nfuture. All of those people are sacrificing as well.\n\n[[Page S12330]]\n\n  If there is going to be sacrifice, let it be by the 1 percent rather \nthan borrowing this money.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time is \navailable to the Senator from Delaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute, if I may--I know it is \nout of order. Our friend from Maryland has asked for 1 minute. I would \nbe delighted to yield that to him, and then I would ask, after that, to \nyield 1 minute to my friend from Florida. And then I think, in the \norder, Senator Reed is in the queue for 5 minutes, and then the Senator \nfrom Illinois, and then the Senator from North Dakota. I ask unanimous \nconsent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to pick up on a point that the \nSenator from South Dakota just made, and that is the question of \nsacrifice. The people in this country who are making sacrifices in this \nwar in Iraq are the working people and the men and women in our armed \nservices.\n  The men and women who are losing their lives and suffering casualties \ncome overwhelmingly from working families in America. Overwhelmingly \nthey are the ones who are unable to meet their families' needs, and \ntheir own needs, because our national priorities have disastrously \nchanged and the impact has fallen on particularly crucial programs: \neducation, health care, job training--you can go right down the list.\n  The deficits we are running, the huge national debt that is being run \nup will come down on the shoulders of working families in this country.\n  If you want to talk about sacrifice, pass the Biden amendment.\n  It is time for the privileged in this country to make sacrifices, \ntoo. It is not their men and women who are in Iraq. It is not their \nprograms that are being hit. They are not shouldering the debt.\n  They, too, should be making a sacrifice on behalf of this national \neffort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this Nation's fiscal policy is \ncareening off the road into bankruptcy. And that means, if we are \nhaving to go out and borrow money--by the way, borrowing it from places \nsuch as Saudi Arabia and the Chinese--in order to pay our bills, that \nmeans we are not able to spend money going into education and health \ncare and Social Security.\n  You have to get some relief somewhere. This is a good place. Stop the \ntax cuts that are supposed to be going into effect for the wealthiest, \nand let that $87 billion pay for these expenses that are incurred in \nIraq.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Biden amendment is very straightforward. \nIt says we will pay for the $87 billion by repealing the tax advantages \nfor those who have the upper 1 percent in income in the United States.\n  In my view, this is not an issue of taxes or payments; this is a \nsimple issue of responsibility. It is irresponsible for us to borrow \nmoney from Social Security, borrow money from Medicare, borrow money \nfrom education spending, borrow money from the Veterans' Administration \nto give to the Iraqi people. We can, in fact, pay for it. We can pay \nfor it by supporting the Biden amendment.\n  My colleague from Maryland spoke about the sacrifice of these \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, airwomen, and marines who are over in Iraq. \nJust ask yourself: What happens 5 years from now when those young \nAmericans go to the Veterans' Administration and they are told they \ncannot be accommodated because we do not have enough money, that we \nborrowed so much money that our economy is in disarray, and that our \nprograms that support American people have been devastated?\n  We have a situation in which our deficits are growing out of \nproportion, the national debt is rising. In January of 2001, the CBO \nestimated that the national debt in 2008 would be $36 billion. In fact, \nthe President at that time was talking about paying off all of our \ndebt, and now, in August of 2003, CBO projects a debt of $6.2 trillion \nin 2008. Deficits are expanding dramatically. Again and again they go \nup and up and up. Now we are talking about a $535 billion deficit.\n  This has an effect. It is not free money. The effect is in many \ndimensions. One dimension is that ultimately it will drive up interest \nrates. That is not my view. That is the view of Alan Greenspan, in his \nwords:\n\n       There is no question that as deficits go up, contrary to \n     what some have said, it does affect long-term interest rates. \n     It does have a negative impact on the economy, unless \n     attended.\n\n  This is one way we can attend to the deficit. Or the words of the CBO \nDirector:\n\n       To the extent that going forward we run large sustained \n     deficits in the face of full employment, it will in fact \n     crowd out capital accumulation and otherwise slow economic \n     growth.\n\n  We are today, by spending and not raising the revenues to support \nthat spending, contributing to this out-of-control deficit spiral that \nwill affect our economy.\n  There is another consequence that goes to responsibility. How can we \nbe a world leader, how can we sustain our efforts in Iraq, in \nAfghanistan, across the globe, if our economy becomes unraveled, as it \nis becoming?\n  Of course, there is an immediate issue. We are losing employment left \nand right, particularly manufacturing employment. How do we sustain \nmanufacturing in the United States? What happens when their interest \nrates go up, when they have to pay more money to borrow? That is \nanother invitation to take their work and send it overseas. What \nhappens when their health care costs go up? And they will, unless we do \nmore to support the Medicare system, the Medicaid system, and general \nhealth insurance throughout the United States, another pressure.\n  This is all irresponsible. We have huge problems. We have much to do \nto deal with those problems. But we can begin today and simply say, \nrather than giving the Iraqi people $87 billion from Social Security, \nfrom health care, from education, we can ask the top 1 percent of \nAmericans, who have done extraordinarily well, to forgo a tax break so \nthat we can pay for this.\n  It is responsible. This vote today is not about taxes. It is not \nabout our approach to Iraq. It is not about supporting the troops. It \nis about whether we will be responsible today and in the future. I urge \nthat we go forth and be responsible.\n  My colleague from Maryland also pointed out the sacrifice. We all \nknow our forces are doing a magnificent job. They are truly \nsacrificing, and we are going to support them. But their sacrifice must \nbe met not only with our sacrifice but with some wisdom, the ability to \nlook ahead, the ability to see what is coming. What is coming is an \neconomic deterioration of this country unless we can get our hands on \nthis deficit.\n  This is the first step. It is a modest step, but it is a first step. \nWhat better rationale, to ask the people of America to contribute their \nhard-earned dollars and support our troops, support our foreign policy, \nsupport an effort to root out dangers to this country? In fact, in \ntimes of war, the American people have always responded, and other \nCongresses and other administrations have responded when we have asked \nthem for increased sacrifices and increased taxes.\n  None of the Biden proposal will affect the middle class, the working \nclass. It is responsible. To vote against this amendment would be \nirresponsible. I urge its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you study the sweep of history in the \nUnited States and the history of the Presidency, you understand that at \ntimes of crisis the President has an opportunity to rally the American \npeople, to summon them to a higher calling and a greater commitment \nthan\n\n[[Page S12331]]\n\nthey might otherwise reach. Time and again, each President faced with a \nnational challenge has tried his best to do just that.\n  In this situation, after 9/11, President Bush came to us and summoned \nthe American people to be unified. It was demonstrated in the Senate \nwith a bipartisan resolution supporting our effort in the war on \nterrorism, an overwhelming vote supporting the President. He summoned \nus to humility. Many of us joined with the President at the National \nCathedral in a day of prayer to recall just what had happened to so \nmany innocent people and to once again remind ourselves of our \ndependence on our values and our principles and on God Himself.\n  He also summoned us to courage and the courage that America has to \ndisplay every day in confronting the war on terrorism.\n  President Bush also has summoned us to sacrifice. But he has not \nsummoned all of us to sacrifice. He has summoned the men and women in \nuniform to sacrifice because they literally put their lives on the line \nevery single day in this war on terrorism, in the invasion of Iraq and \nin peacekeeping afterwards. He has asked these men and women to \nunderstand the oath they took to our country and to step forward \nproudly and defend our flag and our values. That call to sacrifice has \nbeen answered affirmatively over and over again while hundreds have \nbeen killed in Iraq and literally hundreds and perhaps thousands have \nbeen seriously injured.\n  When it comes to sacrifice otherwise, the President asks little or \nnothing of the rest of America. I believe if President Bush had come to \nAmerica and said, I need a spirit of sacrifice from everyone--rich and \npoor alike, not just those in uniform but every single person--there \nwould have been an overwhelmingly positive response. But no, instead of \nasking for sacrifice, the President said to the wealthiest in America, \nto those who are well off and have little discomfort in their lives: We \nask nothing. In fact, we will give you something. We will give you a \ntax cut. We will give you money--not a sacrifice asked of the wealthy \nand well off but, frankly, to give them more comfort and luxury in \ntheir life. That is hardly what the President should have done in \nrallying America to face this crisis.\n  Here we stand today, facing the amendment of the Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Biden, which asks us to look in honest terms at the $87 \nbillion the President has asked for, for Iraq: $68 billion for the \ntroops, another $20 billion for the reconstruction.\n  We know President Bush and his administration have had no plan when \nit comes to revitalizing the American economy. This President has lost \nmore American jobs on his watch than any President in 70 years. He has \nlost more jobs than any President since Herbert Hoover in the Great \nDepression. Frankly, that is a stain on his performance as President \nand reflects the fact that all of the tax cuts he has proposed have not \nrevitalized this economy, have not moved us forward and, in fact, have \ncost us jobs.\n  It is clear, as well, this administration had no plan when it came to \nrebuilding Iraq. A few months ago, some of the leaders in this \nadministration were coming forward and telling us we would not even \nneed to be here today to ask for $87 billion. Secretary Rumsfeld said: \nI don't expect that we are going to need to ask the taxpayers for \nmoney; look at all the oil revenue in Iraq. The same thing was said by \nVice President Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz. All of the men behind the \nstrategy to attack Iraq told us over and over again it was painless, it \nwouldn't cost us.\n\n  We are here today knowing it will cost us. The President told us in \nhis speech to the American people just a few weeks ago: $87 billion is \nthe cost. This administration had no plan to deal with it and no plan \nto pay for it.\n  How will we face this? We will face this as we faced the Vietnam war, \na war which was financed by deficits. Instead of cutting spending or \nraising taxes to pay for the cost of Iraq, we are going to see the \nnational debt increased. We are going to see the funds available for \nour schools, for health care, for Social Security cut because we have \ndecided we are not going to ask anyone to sacrifice to pay this $87 \nbillion.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to stand up and do the right \nthing, to ask the wealthiest in America to pay their fair share, to say \nto them: We are not going to give you a tax break that has been \npromised so the money will be there to pay for this war. It is the \nresponsible thing to do. Instead of pushing this burden on the men and \nwomen in uniform fighting today and on our children tomorrow with an \nincreased national debt, we are going to stand for the premise that we \nshould pay for the defense of America; we should pay for the cost of \nreconstruction in Iraq.\n  I support the Biden amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I, too, rise to stand in support of the \nBiden amendment. The concept of shared sacrifice is fundamental to the \nAmerican life--something all of our predecessors on this floor and the \npeople of America through history have understood. In times of war, we \nhave understood we all have to participate.\n  It should be no different this time. It is clearly a time when we \nhave not asked for our society to stand up and accept the \nresponsibility--financial responsibility--of standing with those men \nand women who are sacrificing their lives for us. Instead of actually \nhusbanding our resources so we can carry on that struggle and stand \nwith our men and women in uniform, we are actually undermining that by \nputting our financial condition into real jeopardy, both now and for a \nlong time into the future.\n  In guns-and-butter policy, one that is totally discredited throughout \nany kind of analysis, whether in the private sector or academia--and it \nshould be here on the floor--we are now facing $535 billion budget \ndeficits in the coming fiscal year, with budget deficits of that \ndimension long into the future, borrowing against the retirement \nsecurity of our seniors and our Social Security trust fund, using the \npayroll taxes people are reportedly putting into Social Security to \nprotect their retirement to fund tax cuts, at the same time we are \nactually at war to protect the American people.\n  It is time for us to husband our resources and make sure we don't \nsacrifice everything on the homefront, whether it is economic security, \nretirement security, homeland security; all of these issues are short \nof funding. We hear about it and we cut it back. We make sure we are \nvery precise there, and then we are not willing, for those who are \nbenefiting most in society, who have actually enjoyed the American \nprosperity the most, to sacrifice marginal amounts to be able to fund \nan initiative that is proper to protect our troops and take the \nresponsibility for a broken economy, a broken society that, in many \nways, is a responsibility we have had because we entered into this.\n  I think it is absolutely essential, and I think many of the people \nwho benefit from the reduced tax rates we are talking about not going \nahead and executing will benefit more because we will have a sounder \neconomy, and we will create greater wealth in the economy, and they \nwill welcome the idea that they are actually able to share in some of \nthese burdens as we go forward. As a matter of fact, I know that at a \npersonal level, from conversations I have had across this country, \nthere is a desire to be asked to help.\n  It is really a major mistake, a major shortfall, on our sense of \nresponsibility to the Nation if we don't call for making sure we \nprovide funding for this initiative--this $87 billion the President has \nasked for. I stand strongly in favor of the Biden amendment. I \nencourage colleagues to as well. This Nation believes in shared \nsacrifice. We should show it by supporting this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to start by putting in perspective \nwhere we are in the fiscal condition of the country as we consider this \nrequest from the President for $87 billion for Iraq.\n  I think it is important for us first to recognize we already face \nnext year a record budget deficit of $535 billion. But that really \nunderstates the seriousness of the problem because, on top of that, \nunder the President's proposal, we will also be taking $160 billion of\n\n[[Page S12332]]\n\nSocial Security trust fund money to pay for other things. That gives a \ntotal operating deficit for next year approaching $700 billion.\n  Some have said, well, it is really relatively small as a share of our \ngross domestic product. That is not correct. Fairly measured, the \noperating deficit next year is the biggest we have had since World War \nII. If we look at the Social Security trust fund, if we back that out \nand we treat it the same way in 1983, what we see is the deficit as a \npercentage of GDP is the biggest it has been since World War II. This \nis a huge deficit, however measured.\n  The President has told us these deficits will be small and short \nterm. Wrong again. They are not small; they are huge by any terms, \ndollar terms or GDP terms. Beyond that, they are long lasting. In fact, \naccording to the President's own analysis, they go on and on and on, \nand they get worse as the baby boom generation begins to retire. Just \nover the next decade, we see an ocean of red ink. According to \nCongressional Budget Office numbers, if we just add in proposals to \nextend the tax cuts, to add a prescription drug benefit, and to provide \nAMT reform, there will be deficits of $600 billion, $700 billion, as \nfar as the eye can see.\n  We have a problem of spending and of revenue. The revenue as a \npercentage of gross domestic product next year will be the lowest since \n1950. That is a revenue crisis, as well as a spending problem. If we \nlook at the spending side of the equation, we can see the increases in \ndiscretionary spending over the baseline have occurred overwhelmingly \nin just three areas: defense, homeland security, and rebuilding New \nYork and providing airline relief. In 2003, ninety-two percent of the \nincreased spending is in those areas. I might add those are areas that \nall of us, on a bipartisan basis, supported.\n  The President of the United States told us 2 years ago he would \nvirtually pay off the debt. He said by 2008 there would be virtually no \npublicly held debt left. Now what we see is, instead of the debt being \nvirtually eliminated, we see it skyrocketing. The gross debt of the \nUnited States, we estimate, will be $6.8 trillion by the end of this \nyear. In 10 years, we estimate it will be approaching $15 trillion--all \nat the worst possible time. It is the worst possible time because the \nbaby boom generation is going to begin retiring in 2008.\n  On this chart, the green bar is the Social Security trust fund, the \nblue bar is the Medicare trust fund, and the red bar is the cost of the \ntax cuts--those that have already passed and those that are proposed by \nthe President. What this shows is, at the very time the Social Security \nand Medicare trust funds go cash negative--at that very time, the costs \nof the President's tax cuts explode, driving us deeper and deeper into \ndeficit and debt.\n  You don't have to take my word for it, or the Congressional Budget \nOffice's word for it. You can take the President's word for it. Here is \nthe calculation from his budget of what would happen if we followed his \nproposals, his tax cuts, his spending. What it shows is we never get \nout of deficit and that the deficits explode. This is as a percentage \nof gross domestic product--which he prefers to refer to now to try to \nunderstate the magnitude of the problem.\n  Look at what his own analysis shows. It shows these are the good \ntimes, even though there are record deficits--the biggest we have ever \nhad in dollar terms, and as a percentage of GDP since World War II. But \nit is going to get much worse.\n  The Congressional Budget Office warned us, as the New York Times \nreported it on September 14:\n\n       This course prompted the Congressional Budget Office to \n     issue an unusual warning in its forecast last month: If \n     Congressional Republicans and the administration get their \n     wish and extend all the tax cuts now scheduled to expire, and \n     if they pass a limited prescription drug benefit for Medicare \n     and keep spending at its current level, the deficit by 2013 \n     will have built up to $6.2 trillion. Once the baby boomers \n     begin retiring at the end of this decade, the office said, \n     that course will lead either to drastically higher taxes, \n     severe spending cuts or ``unsustainable levels of debt.''\n\n  Just this week, the Committee for Economic Development, major \nbusiness leaders in the country, the Concord Coalition, and the Center \non Budget and Policy Priorities warned of the dangers of the current \nfiscal course. They said:\n\n       To get a sense of the magnitude of the deficits the nation \n     is likely to face without a change in policies, consider that \n     even with the full economic recovery that CBO forecasts and a \n     decade of economic growth, balancing the budget by the end of \n     the coming decade (i.e., in 2013) would entail such radical \n     steps as: raising individual and corporate income taxes by 27 \n     percent; or eliminating Medicare entirely; or cutting Social \n     Security benefits by 60 percent; or shutting down three-\n     fourths of the Defense Department; or cutting all \n     expenditures, other than Social Security, Medicare, defense, \n     homeland security, and interest payments on the debt--\n     including expenditures for education, transportation, \n     housing, the environment, law enforcement, national parks, \n     research on diseases, and the rest--by 40 percent. Beyond the \n     next decade, the tradeoffs become even more difficult.\n\n  When we look now to what the President is proposing in this $87 \nbillion, and we look back at what we were told--remember when Larry \nLindsey, the President's chief economic adviser, said it would cost \n$100 billion to $200 billion for our involvement in Iraq, and he was \nchastised by this administration? The head of the Office of Management \nand Budget said he was way off. He wasn't way off. He was right on. We \nare already at $140 billion for this Iraqi undertaking.\n  The administration has been wrong, wrong, wrong. They have been wrong \nrepeatedly. They are wrong about the deficits. They said there wouldn't \nbe any. Then they said they were going to be small. Then they said they \nwere small as a percentage of gross domestic product. They were wrong \non each count.\n  Then they told us: Iraq won't cost much. Here is what Ari Fleischer, \nthe President's chief spokesman, said on February 18 of this year:\n\n       And Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, is a rather wealthy country. \n     Iraq has tremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi \n     people. And so there are a variety of means that Iraq has to \n     be able to shoulder much of the burden for their own \n     reconstruction.\n\n  What happened? The administration told us Iraq was going to be able \nto pay, they were going to be able to cover much of the cost of their \nown reconstruction. Now that proves to be wrong as well.\n  This administration repeatedly told us the cost of Iraqi \nreconstruction could be largely borne by Iraq. Here is what the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense said before the House Appropriations Subcommittee \non Defense in March of this year:\n\n       The oil revenues of Iraq could bring between $50 and $100 \n     billion over the course of the next 2 or 3 years . . . We're \n     dealing with a country that can really finance its own \n     reconstruction, and relatively soon.\n\n  Wrong again. And just months later they are asking for $20 billion, \nand that is just a downpayment. Make no mistake, they are going to be \nhere asking for more, and they are going to be here asking for more \nsoon because they have already acknowledged they need another $40 \nbillion or $50 billion for Iraqi reconstruction. They say they are \ngoing to get it from somewhere else. Where else? When we ask them, they \nsay they have a big donors conference coming up. Do you know how much \nhas been pledged? $1.5 billion. Where is the other $40 billion or $50 \nbillion going to come from? They are going to be right back here asking \nfor more.\n  They misled this Congress. They misled the American people. They did \nit repeatedly on issue after issue.\n  Here is what their USAID Administrator, Mr. Natsios, said on April 23 \nof this year:\n\n       That's correct. $1.7 billion is the limit of reconstruction \n     for Iraq. . . . In terms of the American taxpayer \n     contribution, that is it for the U.S. The rest of the \n     rebuilding of Iraq will be done by other countries and Iraqi \n     oil revenues.\n\n  Wrong again. Wrong, wrong, wrong, and not just by a little bit; these \nfolks have been wrong by a lot. Whether it was talking about the \ndeficit or talking about the war with Iraq or the reconstruction of \nIraq, this is a record of being wrong; wrong on major point after major \npoint, over and over.\n\n  They say to us now:\n\n       What we're focused on in the $20 billion is the urgent and \n     essential things.\n\n  The $20 billion is the urgent and essential things. Really? Let's \nlook. In this plan, there is $6,000 per radio/telephone. It costs for a \nsatellite phone in this country $495. It costs for a walkie-talkie $55. \nWhy when we go to Iraq all of a sudden phones cost $6,000? A satellite \nphone, where one can call anywhere in the world, costs less than $500,\n\n[[Page S12333]]\n\nand this administration is coming before this body and saying they need \n$6,000 per phone.\n  They want $33,000 per pickup truck. We have a lot of pickup trucks in \nour State. We have more pickup trucks being sold than any other kind of \nautomobiles. The average cost of an award winning American truck is \n$15,400, and they want us to spend $33,000 per truck in Iraq.\n  They want us to pay $50,000 per prison bed. In this country, it costs \n$14,000 to build a prison bed. I don't know who did these calculations, \nbut they seem an awful lot more eager to spend money in Iraq than they \nare to spend money in this country. It goes on and on.\n  They want $10,000 a month for business school in Iraq. In our \ncountry, it costs $4,000 a month for the best business schools, and we \nare going to be telling the American taxpayers they should spend \n$10,000 per month for business school? Who put these numbers together? \nWho came up with this plan?\n  The one that maybe is most incredible of all is the witness \nprotection program. They want $200,000 per family member. For a family \nof five, that is $1 million, and $100 million to protect 100 families. \nIn our country, the witness protection program costs $10,000 per \nwitness. In Iraq, this is going to cost $1 million for a family of \nfive. We don't have a witness protection program like that in this \ncountry. We have nothing like it. This is 20 times as much in Iraq.\n  They want $333 for 30 half-days of computer training. It costs $200 \nin this country.\n  This doesn't stand much scrutiny. This whole plan doesn't stand much \nscrutiny, and it is time for us to ask the tough questions. Clearly, \nthis administration has not asked the tough questions.\n  I just found out they have $3 billion for water projects in Iraq, \nwhen they proposed in our country cutting water projects by 40 percent. \nThey cut the water projects in America 40 percent and put in $3 billion \nfor water projects in Iraq. I don't think the American people had any \nidea they were signing up to pay for a ZIP Code in Iraq or to have a \nwitness protection program that costs $1 million a family or that they \nwere going to be building $3 billion worth of water projects in Iraq. \nThat wasn't the deal they signed onto. That is the deal this \nadministration wants us to take, and all of this in the midst of the \nbiggest deficits in our history, when we are having to borrow every \ndime. It does not make any sense. The very least we should do is pay \nfor these costs and not put it on the charge card one more time. That \nis why the Biden amendment should be supported. He is asking the \nwealthiest among us to pay it.\n  This is not a matter of what some people claim of going after the \nrich. Look, my wife and I are in this category. We pay additional taxes \nunder this amendment. I am voting it because it is the right thing to \ndo. We should not be increasing the deficit of the United States.\n  We should not be putting it on the charge card when we already have \nrecord deficits. We ought to pony up and pay for the decisions we have \nmade. Paying for this would just be a beginning. We would still have \nrecord deficits, by far the biggest in our history. We ought to support \nthis amendment as a sign that we are getting serious about facing up to \nour fiscal challenges in this country. We also ought to adopt a series \nof amendments to cut the waste out of this proposal by the \nadministration.\n  If this measure is not adopted, we ought to support other amendments \nto pay for these initiatives and other amendments to scrub this whole \nproposal for the fat and the waste that is so clearly included. It is \nintolerable to say to the American taxpayer, pay these costs, all of it \nwith borrowed money, all of it to be paid by future generations of \nAmericans. That is not the way we have conducted ourselves in the past, \nand it ought not to be the way we conduct ourselves now and in the \nfuture.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Biden amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is my understanding that we have 6 minutes 20 \nseconds remaining on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes twenty seconds, correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I might consume of that \namount.\n  There are three big problems with Senator Biden's amendment. One is \nsubstantive and two are procedural. Before I go into the problems with \nSenator Biden's amendment, I will say that I agree with everybody's \nconcern, including his, about the size of the package and the concern \nthat we should have about the Federal deficit. Hopefully, as the \neconomy grows--and the last figures indicate it is growing now at 3.4 \npercent--Federal revenues will return then to their average levels of \n18 to 19 percent of the gross domestic product, which is an average of \nover the last 60 years, and we will close the gap.\n  I also point to the fact that there are really two sides to the \nFederal ledger. One is the revenue side; that is, what comes in from \nthe taxes paid by our factory workers, office workers, and farmers from \nacross the America. The other side of the ledger is the spending side \nof the ledger, the appropriations bills by the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle, as Senator Biden's \namendment shows, are zeroing in exclusively on the tax side. They look \nonly to the taxpayers to put our fiscal house in order. I agree with \nthe goal of reducing the deficit. I disagree that it is appropriate to \nlook at only one side as if what is wrong with America and what is the \ncause of the deficit is that American taxpayers are undertaxed and that \nin no way Congress overspends. Indeed, the Finance Committee approved a \nbill yesterday that included $55 billion in revenue offsets. So \nRepublicans have been willing to exercise fiscal discipline, especially \nwhen it comes to closing corporate loopholes and curtailing tax \nshelters.\n\n  I ask the full Senate, who was the last Democrat to propose any \nsavings on the spending side of the ledger? I do not recall a single \nspending cut being proposed by those on the other side of the aisle. \nMaybe back in the mid-1990s, but we would have to go back many years.\n  All I see, and Senator Santorum makes this clear with his spendometer \nchart, is spending increases. So if those on the other side want to \nclaim to be fiscal disciplinarians, let us see entries on the spending \nside of the ledger in order for there to be credibility. We cannot just \ngo to the American people and ask for more tax money.\n  Let me also say that I am concerned about the degree to which \ntaxpayers are financing reconstruction in Iraq on a blank check basis. \nI first raised this concern almost a year ago. We ought to be very \ncareful about the structure of this aid package. Maybe it should be a \nloan or have some equity interest for the taxpayers.\n  Now I would like to turn to Senator Biden's amendment. Let us go to \nthe substantive problems first. Senator Biden is seeking to offset the \nPresident's $87 billion request with a tax increase. For 2001, the top \nrate was reduced to 38.6. For 2003, the top rate was reduced to 35 \npercent. Senator Biden's amendment would raise the top rate to 38.2 \npercent. The premise of Senator Biden's position seems to be that \ntaxpayers in the top bracket are solely Park Avenue millionaires, \nclipping coupons and enjoying life. Well, the facts show quite \ndifferently.\n  According to the Treasury Department, about 80 percent of the \nbenefits of the top rate go to small businessowners, people who create \n80 percent of the new jobs in America. For the first time in many \nyears, because of our tax bills, we have that top rate down to 35 \npercent, which is the very same as Fortune 500 companies. Senator \nBiden's amendment would restore a 10-percent penalty against small \nbusiness, 38.2 percent, as opposed to 35 percent now for small \nbusiness, the same as corporations.\n  I do not quarrel with the notion that taxpayers in the top bracket \nmake incomes starting in the range of around $350,000 to $400,000. A \nlot of these successful small businessowners make those figures. But \nkeep in mind that figure represents the total net income of those small \nbusinesses. Successful small businesses are those that purchase the \nequipment and hire those\n\n[[Page S12334]]\n\nnew workers that I referred to as 80 percent of the new jobs.\n  I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle who are eager to \nraise taxes--they are reluctant to cut spending and eager to increase \nspending--to focus on the negative effects of their policy on small \nbusiness. Small business creates many jobs. Why at this time, with high \nunemployment, would we want to raise taxes on the folks who create 80 \npercent of the new jobs?\n  Just yesterday, the Finance Committee, on a 19-2 vote, reported a \nbill designed to cut the top marginal rate for small business \nmanufacturers to 32 percent. Senator Biden's amendment would go the \nother way and hammer our small business manufacturers.\n  Now, let's discuss the two procedural problems.\n  The first procedural problem is also constitutional. Under the \nConstitution, revenue measures must originate in the House. Senator \nBiden's amendment is a tax increase. It is a clear case of a revenue \nmeasure. The Ways and Means Committee has indicated the House will \nexercise its Constitutional prerogative and ``blue slip'' this bill if \nit contains Senator Biden's amendment. A blue slip kills this bill. We \ngo back to square one. A vote for the Biden amendment is a vote to stop \naid to our troops. It is a vote to stop aid to the Iraqi people at a \ncritical time.\n  Let me repeat that point. A vote for the Biden amendment is a vote \nagainst aid to our troops. A vote for the Biden amendment is a vote \nagainst assistance to the Iraqi people.\n  From my own perspective, as chairman of the Finance Committee, I have \nto warn members of our committee that the Biden amendment raises a \nfundamental tax issue on an unrelated bill. The Biden amendment treads \non Finance Committee's jurisdiction. Every Finance Committee member \nshould oppose Senator Biden's amendment on that basis alone. But, most \nimportantly, this amendment is a reckless attack on our economic \nrecovery and I strongly urge its defeat.\n  I ask Senators to defeat the Biden amendment and not increase taxes \non small business.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this amendment is not about whether \nor not we ought to appropriate the funds that President Bush has \nrequested for our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rather, this \namendment addresses the question of whether this Congress is willing to \npay the bill or whether we will pass it on to future generations. I am \nunwilling to tell the children in West Virginia that I believe they \nshould pay this bill when they grow up when there is a reasonable \nalternative.\n  If we do not offset the $87 billion cost of this emergency \nsupplemental request, then it will be added to our Nation's deficit. \nAlready, without this spending, the Federal deficit for fiscal year \n2004 is projected to be $480 billion. That number is staggering. Prior \nto this administration, the largest deficit this government ever had in \na single year was $290 billion. So already, we know that our deficit \nwill be higher than ever before, by a lot. Without this amendment, we \nwould add another $87 billion to this deficit. Our deficit would hit \n$567 billion--almost twice the size of the previous record deficit.\n  These are not just numbers. Such enormous deficits have consequences. \nOur children will have to pay these bills. Instead of investing in \neducation or roads or military preparedness for their own generation, \nthey will still be paying the bills for our generation. Already we have \nsaddled future generations with almost $7 trillion in debt. We \nabsolutely must not add to that debt when this amendment offers an \nalternative.\n  We also know that such large deficits will have an impact for our own \ngeneration. As Federal debt increases, it will put pressure on long \nterm interest rates, which will hurt every middle class family trying \nto pay their mortgage. And I am certain that in the coming weeks my \ncolleagues will say that we have to cut spending on education, health \ncare, infrastructure, unemployment compensation, and other critical \ndomestic priorities in order to reduce the deficit. Make no mistake: \nadding to the deficit today, will increase pressure to squeeze out \nspending that benefits low and middle income Americans at a time when \nthey are already struggling.\n  Increasing the burden on low and middle income Americans would be \nspectacularly unfair. As I travel around West Virginia, I talk to many \nfamilies who have children serving in the armed forces in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. Thousands of West Virginians have been called up to serve \nin the National Guard or Reserves. They are not millionaires. They are \npatriotic West Virginians with modest incomes, and they are already \nsacrificing things more valuable than money to make our military \nefforts a success.\n  So let me discuss for a moment what sacrifice this amendment asks \nfor. This amendment says that those with incomes greater than $311,950 \nshould pay a top income tax rate of 38.2 percent in the years 2005 \nthrough 2010. Even with this change, the top income tax rate will be \nlower than it was when President Bush took office. In fact, of the $690 \nbillion in tax cuts that this President has signed into law that are \ntargeted at the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, $600 billion in tax \ncuts would still be in place. Under this amendment, a person making $1 \nmillion per year would still get a tax cut of more than $20,000 \ncompared to what he or she would have paid in 2000, prior to this \nPresident's tax cuts taking effect. It is not asking for an undue \nsacrifice to ask a millionaire to settle for a $20,000 tax cut. I wish \nthere were more people in West Virginia that would see this $20,000 tax \ncut, but of course, only the wealthiest fraction of taxpayers, less \nthan 1 percent, would be affected by this amendment.\n  I will be supporting this amendment because I cannot explain to \nchildren in West Virginia that giving a millionaire a tax cut greater \nthan $20,000 was more important to me than their future. I hope that my \ncolleagues will think carefully about this stark choice, and join me in \nsupporting Senator Biden's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the majority has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think I have some time. If the majority \nwants more time, that is fine by me. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I want to take a minute or so to respond to my friend, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, while he is in the Chamber.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Sure, without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the author of this amendment has \napproximately 25 minutes remaining. We have been informed that there is \ngoing to be an effort by the majority to have a vote at 3:45 rather \nthan 3:15, which is fine with us. I have also been told that the \nchairman of the Budget Committee wants to speak for up to 5 minutes. So \nif there is no objection to that, could we have 5 minutes additional on \neach side?\n  Mr. NICKLES. If I might modify the request of the Senator, I ask \nunanimous consent that the vote occur at 3:45 with 15 minutes allotted \nto each side.\n  Now, I was not aware that originally Senator Biden, in his eloquent \nnegotiations, already had a 2-hour advantage over this side. There \nmight be a few additional remarks this Senator wants to make which will \ntake a little more than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask if we could further modify the request of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma by having Senator Biden have the last 10 minutes prior to \nthe vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Ten? I will further modify that. I will certainly accede \nto that. If he has only spoken for 2 hours, we look forward to an \nadditional 10 minutes for the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume. Senator Grassley is leaving. I wanted to grab him.\n  I do enjoy the sarcasm of my friend from Oklahoma, who speaks on this \nfloor about 40 times as much as I do, if he goes and checks the Record. \nAlways elucidating, if I might add, always elucidating.\n  I say to my friend, the chairman of the Finance Committee, I \nunderstand\n\n[[Page S12335]]\n\nthe points he is making. But he is aware, in terms of small businesses, \nthat a small business owner would still have to be in the top 1-percent \nincome bracket, the 35-percent bracket, to be affected? And, of all the \nsmall businesses in America, only 2 percent fall in that bracket? Only \n2 percent of the 100 percent of the small businesses in America fall in \nthe bracket.\n  To further make a point, I understand his point that this is the \nengine of our economy, small businesses. There is no question about \nthat. There is no question, though, as well--let's say a small business \nowner is making $400,000 in gross income. The effect of the additional \ntax he would pay from the tax reduction he has gotten down to now would \nbe $2,140 a year. Is my friend suggesting we are going to constrain and \nstrangle business in America when 2 percent of the small businesses, \nroughly 5,000, who make $400,000 gross income and above, are going to \nhave to pay $2,100 a year more, that that is going to constrain the \ngrowth of small business? Is that what he is saying? Is that going to \nprevent them from being able to invest or to be able to grow?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am saying it is unfair to tax small business that is \nnot incorporated at a higher rate than the tax on Fortune 500s, No. 1.\n  Number 2, this may only be 2 percent of the employers, but they are \nthe people who create the jobs.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I couldn't agree more.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have worked at packing plants; I worked at the \nWaterloo Register Company. I never had one poor person provide the job \nfor me. I always had somebody who makes a lot more money than I do \nprovide the jobs for me. We don't want to choke that off in America.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my colleague for his response. He is always \ncourteous. I just respectfully suggest that taking 2 percent of the \nsmall businesses in America, having them have to pay slightly more than \nthey would have paid with this tax cut that is in place now--which, \nagain, if they are making $400,000 in gross income, that means about \n$2,100 more they will pay--is a heck of a lot more preferable than \nasking middle-class taxpayers and asking small businessmen who make \n$50,000 a year, and mechanics who make $35,000 a year, and \nschoolteachers who make $40,000 a year, to have to pay more.\n  I find it fascinating that for those who do not like my proposal to \ndeal with the top 1 percent, I have not heard any alternative offered. \nAre they suggesting we should repeal part of the tax cut or delay part \nof the tax cut for everybody? No, they make no alternative offer. The \nalternative offer they make is we are going to add it to the deficit, \nso the pages can pay. I am going to start calling this the page-pay \nbill. The pages will pay.\n  I see my friend from Oklahoma, whom I always enjoy hearing, and he \nwas seeking the floor earlier, so I reserve the remainder of my time \nand await the eloquent words of my friend from Oklahoma as to why this \nis not a good idea. I am sure he has very many ideas as to why this is \nnot a good idea.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have just caught a portion of this debate, but I want \nto make a couple of comments. My very good friend from Delaware said, \nWhy is this amendment a bad idea? This amendment is a bad idea because \nit is unconstitutional.\n  We all take an oath at the beginning of the year to uphold the \nConstitution. I know all of our colleagues are aware of article I, \nsection 7 of the Constitution that says all bills raising revenue shall \noriginate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose \nor concur with amendments as on other bills.\n  The House originates tax bills. The amendment of our colleague from \nDelaware tries to turn an appropriations bill into a tax bill, a tax \nbill that did not go through the Ways and Means Committee. It certainly \ndidn't go through the Finance Committee. I am on the Finance Committee. \nSo it is unconstitutional.\n  If this amendment passes, the House will blue-slip it. For people who \ndo not know what a blue slip is, they kill the bill. They will not even \nconsider it. They will not even look at it. It is a great tradition in \nthe House because we have tried it on occasion. Every time it happens, \nevery time somebody tries to slip in a little revenue provision in the \nbill, no matter how insignificant in comparison to the overall bill, \nthe House loves to blue-slip it and remind the Senate that the \nConstitution gives them and them only the right to originate revenue \nbills.\n  Our forefathers put it in the Constitution. We are sworn to uphold \nthe Constitution. This is a killer amendment. It does not belong in \nthis bill.\n  If our colleague wants to raise income taxes by 10 percent on the \nupper income brackets, he can do so. He can introduce a bill. He may or \nmay not get a hearing before the Finance Committee. I hope not, but he \nmight. He may or may not get a markup in the Finance Committee. I hope \nnot, but he might. He might take a bill that is going through the \nFinance Committee and offer it as an amendment and be successful. I \nhope not, but he might. Those are all legal, constitutional avenues of \nraising taxes.\n  This is not. You don't raise taxes on a spending bill that is going \nthrough the Senate unless the House has a revenue provision. If the \nHouse has a revenue provision, then it certainly can be done. So that \nis one reason. Let's not kill this bill.\n  I have heard a lot of people say they support the bill. They want to \npass the money, they want to assist the troops, they even want to \nassist the Iraqi people--it is hard to say the Iraqi government; they \ndon't have a government yet, but we are trying to establish a \ngovernment and I compliment Ambassador Bremer and the President. This \nis an enormous effort the United States is undertaking. It is \nchallenging; it is expensive. It is expensive in dollars and it is also \nexpensive in blood. We have lost American lives. We have thousands of \nAmericans who are spending their time right now in Iraq, in Baghdad, \naway from their families, making a significant sacrifice. Now we are \ntrying to say are we going to help them or are we not.\n  This amendment which purports to say we want to pay for it, but we \nare only going to have the upper 1 percent pay for it, I don't think is \ngood tax policy. I don't think you can say we just want to sock it to \nthe upper income people.\n  I heard earlier statements by speakers saying if we do not do this, \nthe deficit is just getting really bad. I happen to be concerned about \nthe deficit, too. But I might note we just passed a couple of \nappropriations bills and I tallied up the number of amendments to \nincrease spending on those appropriations bills and I didn't hear very \nmuch on the other side about concern for deficit. One of the last \nappropriations bills we passed was the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, \nand there were amendments, primarily supported by colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, that we defeated using budget points of order, \nthat would have increased spending over a 1-year period, next year, \n$26.4 billion, and over a 10-year period $386.8 billion. That was just \non the Labor-HHS bill alone. No one was saying the deficit concerns us.\n  Then on another bill, just to give another example on the Homeland \nSecurity bill, Senator Cochran's bill, Senator Cochran made points of \norder against amendments to increase spending by $17.4 billion in 2004 \nalone, and a total of $254.1 billion over a 10-year period of time.\n  I did not hear people say then, we are concerned about the deficit. \nIn other words, they are quite willing to spend more money and bust the \nbudget over the President's request and over what was agreed upon by \nboth the House and the Senate. There was no concern about deficits when \nwe were trying to increase spending in those areas.\n  Now we have a spending bill before us. This bill is outside the \nbudget. It is requested as an emergency by the President of the United \nStates. It passed the Appropriations Committee as an emergency. I am \nnot saying it is perfect. I will tell you that I doubt it is\n\n[[Page S12336]]\n\nperfect. I expect it might be improved. It probably will be improved as \nwe consider it on the floor. But to say we are now going to basically \nviolate the Constitution and have a tax amendment that would really, in \neffect, kill the bill, I don't want to do that. Nor do I want to \nincrease income tax rates on the upper 1 or 2 percent of American \ntaxpayers. That is a 10-percent increase.\n  I heard people say that is just delaying it. It is a 10-percent \nincrease. It would take the maximum rate from 35 percent to 38.2 \npercent. I might mention 35 percent. When Bill Clinton was President, \nthe maximum rate was 31. When he was elected, it was 31 percent. After \nhe passed some tax increases, it went up to 39.6. All these great tax \ncuts that we have done moved the tax rate down to 35 percent.\n  President Clinton and Congress at that time reduced the rate of his \nincrease on the upper income by about half. If my math is correct, 35 \npercent is more than a third. That doesn't include what States charge. \nIf you add State taxes on top of it, you realize some people are paying \nmore than 40-some-odd percent of their income to government. In other \nwords, government is coming closer to taking half of what they make. I \ndisagree with that because I think that suffocates people's initiative \nand their willingness to build, grow, and expand.\n  As mentioned by the chairman of the Finance Committee, 80 percent of \nthe benefits on the top income tax rates are really held by small \nbusiness and sole proprietorships, S corporations, and farms. We would \nbe hitting the very people who are creating the jobs. If we want to \nhave economic growth in this country, the last thing we need to do is \nsay, if you are only a small business, we will sock it to you with a \n10-percent increase. I think that makes no sense whatsoever.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment primarily on \nconstitutional grounds. If this amendment is agreed to, this amendment \nwill be blue-slipped. It would kill the bill, and there would be no \nassistance coming out of the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues not to make that mistake--not to pass a tax \npolicy without consideration certainly of those on the Ways and Means \nCommittee and on the Finance Committee as is the normal order, the way \nwe are supposed to legislate on appropriations matters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand the vote is to take place at \n3:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask between now and the time the vote is called, if we \nare in a quorum call, the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: How much time \nremains under the control of the Senator from Delaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair. Second inquiry: And how much time does \nthe majority have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. And last inquiry: And the vote is set for?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is set for 3:45.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair very much.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I \nexpect to consume the remainder of my time now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I expected to--and I did hear--a vigorous \ndefense of the tax cuts today. And I expected to hear that anyone who \nsupports my proposal to pay for this $87 billion supplemental is \nsomeone who is hostile to wealth and success. I did not hear much of \nthat. I heard a little bit of that. And I expected to hear that I am \nreally putting regular folks into the category with Park Avenue wealthy \npeople. I expected to hear that.\n  Well, think of it this way: If someone today came to the floor and \nproposed a $600 billion tax cut for the top 1 percent of the American \ntaxpayers--assume the tax cut had not passed. Just picture this: \nSomeone walked on the floor today, as we are about to vote on an $87 \nbillion supplemental, and said: I propose a $600 billion tax cut \nbetween now and the year 2010 for the top 1 percent of the American \ntaxpayers--and did it, again, at this moment, when we will have a $500-\nplus billion deficit for next year, and expanding national security \ndemands, not decreasing national security demands, well beyond Iraq, \nand expanding homeland security needs, not diminishing homeland \nsecurity needs, and while the House of Representatives and the Senate \nare in conference about to report back, I assume, a multibillion-dollar \nrelief bill as we need for prescription drugs.\n  If someone came forward today and said, I have an idea; let's \ndiminish the tax burden of the top 1 percent of the U.S. taxpayers--\nthat is, people making an average of $1 million a year--let's reduce \ntheir taxes by $600 billion, what do you think would happen? Would \nanyone seriously on this floor say, that is a good idea now, that is a \ngreat idea, let's go ahead and do that?\n  How about if they came to the floor and said, Let's not make it $600 \nbillion, let's cut their taxes $689.1 billion, roughly. Would anybody \nhere vote for that today? Would anybody honestly vote for that today?\n  Today we hear that $600 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy is not \nenough. Why do I say that? My proposal only says, instead of giving the \nwealthiest Americans, that is people making a gross income of about \n$400,000 a year, a net income after all the deductions and everything \nof about $312,000 a year, you don't even get into this game unless you \nfall in that category, and people who are making $1 million a year on \naverage, all I am saying is, give them $600 billion, not $690 billion, \nand don't even touch them until 2005. Have them pay this out in \nadditional taxes, instead of getting 690 get 6 over a 6-year period, \nbeginning in 2005 basically. That is all I am saying.\n  Today we are told by those who oppose this that, no, we can't afford \nto do anything except give them a $688.9 billion limit or the sky will \nfall, small business will shutter their windows, and the recovery of \ncapitalism, as we know it, will grind to a halt.\n  Give me a break. I have yet to hear a single economist--this has been \nfloating around now out there, this idea of mine, for the past couple \nweeks--say this is going to have any impact on the recovery. In fact, \nthe opposite is going to happen. If we add another $87 billion to the \ndeficit, interest rates will go higher. That is going to short circuit \na recovery, not paying out over a 6-year period an additional $87 \nbillion that is not going into their pockets.\n  Again, I keep coming back to this point. Even wealthy Americans don't \noppose this. A Wall Street Journal poll asked the question, If Congress \napproves President Bush's request for $87 billion in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, how would you prefer that Congress pay for it? Scrap the \nMedicare drug benefits bill?\n  Seven percent of Americans, obviously those with Medicare benefits \nand drug coverage, said, yes, that is a good idea; pay for it by not \npassing the prescription drug proposal. Twelve percent said to borrow \nthe money. Add to the deficit; go out and borrow it. Make the pages \npay. Borrow for it. Twelve percent said that. Twenty-five percent said \nsome other way or they were not sure. A full 56 percent said, cancel, \nnot 13 percent of the tax cut for the wealthiest--I think that is the \nnumber--but cancel all of the tax cut for\n\n[[Page S12337]]\n\nthe wealthiest Americans. They want to take it all away.\n  I am not doing that. I am saying, keep $600 billion. Just don't take \n$688.9 billion.\n  Look, I have been here a long while. It is fascinating to me. I keep \ngetting the same lesson taught to me. The American people are always \nway ahead of us. The $87 billion in additional revenue we are seeking \nwith this amendment is less than eight-tenths of 1 percent of our $11 \ntrillion economy.\n  I challenge any of my colleagues to tell me they honestly believe \nthis is going to slow up this jobless recovery. It won't even have any \naffect until the recovery is a year and a half underway. Fewer than 1 \npercent of the wealthiest Americans will even be affected by this \nchange. Keep in mind, this is like my saying to my grandchildren--I \nhave three granddaughters--we are going to go to the ice cream store \nand, look, pop only has 12 bucks with him. I can only afford three \ndouble-dip ice cream cones. I can't afford three triple-dip ice cream \ncones. So you are only going to get two dips instead of three. It is \nnot like saying: Look, kids, I was going to feed you tonight but you \nare not going to get to eat. We were going to have hamburgers and \nfrench fries and a salad, but all I am going to give you is a salad. Or \nyou can't eat at all. We are not taking away anything. We are just not \ngiving as much.\n\n  Again, small business, fewer than 2 percent of small businesses, that \nis, sole proprietors, the real mom-and-pop small businesses, will even \nbe affected by this. Ninety-eight percent will not be affected.\n  This is a small, tiny nick in a huge tax cut. It asks for a \ncontribution from those who have the clearest ability to contribute--\nnot because we want to punish them. This isn't about being punitive. It \nis because they have the clearest capability.\n  Again, take my granddaughters out. Assume my son was not doing better \nthan I am--he is but assume he isn't--and the kids want an ice cream \ncone. Why shouldn't pop pay? I have the money to pay for it. It is not \ngoing to affect me at all. But if all he had in his whole pocket was 10 \nbucks for the week, why should he pay when I have 300 bucks in my \npocket? This just isn't fair.\n  Again, I repeat, I don't know any wealthy Americans making $1 million \na year who say, look, I don't want to do this. It is going to hurt me. \nI am not going to be able to make it. This is going to put a crimp in \nmy style.\n  Again, let me give you a number. If you have an income of $400,000 a \nyear--remember, the average income of the people in this bracket is \nalmost a million dollars, 980-some-thousand dollars a year. Let's just \nput that in perspective. If, in fact, you are making $400,000 a year \nand your tax rate is going to go, from 2005 to 2010, back up from 35 to \n38.2, what is the effect on your pocket? You pay the difference between \n312, which gets you into the category, and 400, at a higher rate. That \nis $68,000, roughly. You have to get to 380-something. How much more \ntaxes does it mean that you pay? Roughly, $2,100 more a year.\n  Are you telling me the people making $400,000 a year are not willing \nto kick in $2,100 a year for 5 years beginning in the year 2005--or for \n6 years beginning in 2005 to win the peace in Iraq? Boy, do we \nunderestimate these folks. These are loyal, patriotic Americans. They \nwould be ready to do a lot more if we needed them to do it. But $2,100, \nif you make a million dollars? I asked my staff to do a back-of-the-\nenvelope calculation. Let's say the poor guy who has no deductions--\n``poor'' guy--the rookie who signs a contract for $1.150 million. Guess \nwhat. After standard deductions because of the loopholes and the other \nthings the wealthiest among us in this country have, he has a real \ntaxable income of a million dollars. How much more is he going to have \nto pay? Roughly $22,000. That is going to kill him, right? Does that \nmean you don't have a gold-plated toilet seat? What does it mean?\n  Again, I am not hearing any of these wealthy folks complain. I am \nhearing everybody complain in their name, but I don't hear any of them \ncomplain. Let me tell you, I have been doing this a long time. Few \ntimes have I ever stood on the floor, with CNN watching, saying if \nthere is anybody who is making over $400,000 a year who is not willing \nto pay $2,100 more to win the war, call me. No one is calling me. I \ndon't get this.\n  I don't think these folks who will be affected by this tax change \nwill begrudge one nickel of this $87 billion. So I say to my \ncolleagues, if we don't do this now, pay for this installment in the \nwar now, taking a small part of the tax cut, when we have a national \nsecurity emergency supplemental request from the President, when the \ndeficit is skyrocketing to over half a trillion dollars a year, are \nthere no circumstances ever when it will be right to reconsider less \nthan 5 percent of the biggest tax cut in history?\n  My time is almost up. It seems to me we are at a place where \nresponsibility dictates that we be rational and not ideological, we pay \nnow instead of just putting this on the tab for the pages on the Senate \nfloor, that we don't ask our children to pay for our security, and we \npay for our security and our children's security.\n  This, to me, is the most inexplicable opposition to anything I have \never been involved with on the floor of the Senate.\n  I believe my time has expired. I urge my colleagues to vote for the \nBiden-Kerry amendment. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, for the reasons previously stated on this \nside, I move to table Senator Biden's amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 57, nays 42, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 373 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--42\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Graham (FL)\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1802\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Coleman], for himself, Mr. \n     Byrd, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Corzine, Ms. Collins, Mr. Graham of \n     South Carolina, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Sununu, and Mr. Allen \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1802.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To fund travel within the United States for members of the \nArmed Forces on rest and recuperation leave from a deployment overseas \n  in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom)\n\n       On page 22, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S12338]]\n\n       Sec. 316. (a) In addition to other purposes for which funds \n     in the Iraq Freedom Fund are available, such funds shall also \n     be available for reimbursing a member of the Armed Forces for \n     the cost of air fare incurred by the member for any travel by \n     the member within the United States that is commenced during \n     fiscal year 2003 or fiscal year 2004 and is completed during \n     either such fiscal year while the member is on rest and \n     recuperation leave from deployment overseas in support of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, but \n     only for one round trip by air between two locations within \n     the United States.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the commercial airline \n     industry should, to the maximum extent practicable, charge \n     members of the Armed Forces on rest and recuperation leave as \n     described in subsection (a) and their families specially \n     discounted, lowest available fares for air travel in \n     connection with such leave and that any restrictions and \n     limitations imposed by the airlines in connection with the \n     air fares charged for such travel should be minimal.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold for a minute?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Leahy be \nrecognized following the disposition of the Coleman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd be \nadded as a cosponsor to Senator Coleman's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, the Pentagon has rolled out a program to \nbring home troops who have served in Iraq for over a year. It is a good \nprogram. Under the Rest and Recuperation Leave Program, these service \nmen and women will get a much deserved 2 weeks of R with their \nfamilies. Unfortunately, the program only provides for transportation \nto places such as Baltimore, Atlanta, Dallas, or Los Angeles. From \nthese cities, our service men and women are expected to pay their own \nway home at same-day rates.\n  Chad Krandall and Dave Schmaltz, cousins and Minnesota National Guard \nmembers from Gwinner, MN were told the price of a same-day ticket from \nBaltimore to Minneapolis-St. Paul would be $1,200 each. Steven Bazaard, \nanother Guard member from Minnesota, was faced with a similarly high \nbill if he was to make it all the way home to see his wife Sherry \nBillups in Blackduck, MN. Isaac Girling, a member of the 142nd \nBattalion in Iraq, will have to pay the same exorbitant fee when he \ncomes home next week to Stillwater, MN to see his newborn son for the \nfirst time.\n  I don't have anything against Baltimore, Atlanta, Dallas, or Los \nAngeles. But to be perfectly frank, these cities can't really hold a \ncandle to Blackduck or Gwinner, and they are a long way away and \nexpensive to travel to.\n  This R program is a good start, but it doesn't go far enough to \nsupport our troops. These are families which have already made do for a \nyear without their loved ones, and the toll has been both emotional and \nfinancial. To ask them to pay same-day airfare to see their loved ones \nis simply unfair.\n  If we acknowledge that troops who have been in Iraq for a year \ndeserve a 2-week vacation like anyone else, we ought to make sure they \nget all the way home. That is what we are talking about here--making \nsure our service men and women who have performed so admirably, have \nsacrificed so much in defense of their country and in defense of \nfreedom, get all the way home.\n  I have introduced, along with the distinguished chairman, Senator \nStevens, and my friend and fellow Senator from Minnesota, Senator \nDayton, an amendment to fix this unintended consequence of the R \nprogram. We have broad bipartisan support, including Senators Byrd, \nDayton, Alexander, Chambliss, Collins, Conrad, Corzine, Craig, DeWine, \nDomenici, Dorgan, Ensign, Enzi, Graham of South Carolina, Gregg, \nJohnson, Kennedy, Murkowski, Santorum, Sununu, Stevens, and Allen.\n  The chairman and his staff on the Appropriations Committee have been \nvery gracious in working with me to craft a good amendment to make sure \nour troops and their families do not have to pay these high rates.\n  This amendment will not have any budgetary consequence. It will \nsimply make sure existing funds are used for this essential program to \nboost troop morale and to reunite families separated by this \nengagement. This amendment is the right thing to do.\n  I notice my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Dayton is here. I yield the floor at this time to Senator \nDayton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Coleman, who joined with great minds which think in the same \ndirection. We introduced this legislation on the same day. I am proud \nto be joining with Senator Coleman in the Coleman-Dayton amendment to \nprovide for transportation to homes and places of origin for our \ntroops, many of whom, in the case of Minnesota, have just had their \ntours of duty in the Iraqi theater extended by 6 months. In the case of \nthe 142nd Battalion, it covers northwestern Minnesota and North Dakota. \nAs a result of this extension and this deployment and administrative \nmatters, many of them will not see their families for up to 18 months. \nTo drop them off at the Baltimore airport and tell them they are going \nto be on their own at that point and at their own expense to try to get \nback and see their families for their one opportunity in nearly 18 \nmonths I think would be shameful. I think the American people are more \ngenerous than this. I think under these circumstances it is the least \nwe can do.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his leadership on this matter, \nand I am glad to sponsor it with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I say to my friend and colleague, Senator \nDayton, that the two folks from Minnesota understand it is really good \nto get home--and also the folks from Alaska and Idaho. This amendment \ndoes that.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to commend both Senators from \nMinnesota for sponsoring this amendment. If they have no objection, I \nask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I express my support for this amendment--\nwhich is very similar to an amendment I had filed earlier--to pay for \nthe travel home of U.S. troops currently serving in the Iraqi theater \nof operations. I am pleased to join in cosponsoring the amendment.\n  The Department of Defense recently announced that it would grant \nsoldiers on 12-month deployments as a part of Operation Iraqi Freedom \n15 days of rest and recuperation leave. About 270 soldiers a day are \nnow arriving in the United States to begin their leave period. At the \npresent time, these troops are required to pay their own way home from \ntheir port of debarkation--right now, Baltimore-Washington \nInternational Airport. It says something about the priorities of the \nDepartment of Defense that while they are asking Congress for another \n$87 billion for war and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, they \nare also making soldiers on leave pay for their transportation home and \nback.\n  Many of these soldiers are members of the Reserves and National \nGuard. Many of those citizen soldiers have recently learned that, \nbecause the administration has been unable to mobilize sufficient \ninternational support to ease the burden on American troops, they will \nbe required to spend a full 12 months in Iraq. This is in addition to \nthe 2 to 3 months they spent away from home training for their mission. \nDespite the shifting dates for their return home, our American service \nmen and women have served with courage and distinction in terrible \nconditions.\n  Soldiers from the 142d Combat Engineering Battalion, a North Dakota \nNational Guard unit, have already begun coming home on leave. The first \nsoldiers chosen for leave were very concerned that they might have to \npay well over $1,000 to buy a ticket home from Baltimore. I was very \npleased that Northwest Airlines, the main provider of air travel to \nNorth Dakota, was able to respond to my request to offer reasonable \npriced tickets to these brave soldiers.\n  But this should be only a temporary measure. I urge the Senate to now \nclear the way for full government funding of the travel expenses for \nour\n\n[[Page S12339]]\n\ntroops on leave, including those that will take leave before we are \nable to complete our legislation, by adopting this amendment. In \nworking on this amendment, I wanted to be sure we avoided creating an \nunfair disparity between soldiers. We will not likely conclude action \non this supplemental until the tail end of October, and by that time \nseveral thousand soldiers will have already paid for their own travel \nhome. It seemed unfair to me that these soldiers should be forced to \npay their own way while those who traveled later would go at government \nexpense.\n  Our troops in Iraq have been serving under difficult conditions, and \nthey deserve our full support. I greatly appreciate Chairman Stevens' \nwillingness to include this important issue in the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I am happy that we were able to work together to \nprovide for the travel expenses of our brave soldiers serving in Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1802) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVermont is recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend, the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1803\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] for himself, Mr. \n     Daschle, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 1803.\n\n (Purpose: To place the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq under \n the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of \n                                 State)\n\n       On page 25, line 21, before the colon, insert the \n     following:\n       : Provided further, That beginning not later than 60 days \n     after enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the \n     Coalition Provisional Authority shall report to and be under \n     the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the \n     Secretary of State.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. That is \nwhy I didn't follow the usual procedure where amendments are simply \ndeemed read. This was a short enough one that I wanted it read.\n  It does what many of us feel we should have done 5 months ago when we \nappropriated the first $2.5 billion in foreign aid for Iraq. At the \ntime we gave that very substantial amount of foreign aid to Iraq, many \nof us urged the Secretary of State--not the Secretary of Defense--\nshould have authority over the reconstruction program.\n  No matter who is Secretary of State, no matter who is Secretary of \nDefense, when you are going to give enormous amounts of foreign aid for \nreconstruction, the aid should be under the Department of State. After \nall, foreign aid is the responsibility of the State Department. Also, \nit is the responsibility of USAID. That is what they know how to do. \nThat is what their people are trained to do.\n\n  It is not what the Pentagon does, nor, for that matter, is it what \nthe Pentagon should be doing. The Pentagon is trained in military \ncombat. In fact, our forces, the men and women in the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, and Marine Corps, are the best trained, the best equipped, best \nmotivated of any military in the world. Obviously, they showed they can \neasily defeat other military forces as they did in Iraq.\n  While they are trained for war, the State Department is trained to \nwork to rebuild. In this case, as superb as the military role was, \ntheir leadership disregarded the preparatory work the State Department \nand USAID had done in planning for after the war. The problems they now \nface reflect that.\n  I am concerned we are putting our men and women in the military in an \nimpossible situation. They are being asked not only to provide \nsecurity, but to also oversee the reconstruction.\n  I have a lot of respect for Ambassador Bremer. I have known him and \nworked with him on terrorism and other matters over the years. He did a \ngood job last week when he testified before the Appropriations \nCommittee. Like a lawyer arguing the brief for his client, he argued \nwell. But Ambassador Bremer's office, which is located in the Pentagon, \nuntil very recently was not capable of responding to our questions. The \nquestions we were asking were not how many divisions might move here or \nhow many tanks, airplanes, helicopters, men and women under arms can \nmove, but, rather, how can we do a better job of getting water, and \nelectricity, and other aid to the Iraqi people?\n  We saw the reconstruction plan, apparently a Pentagon plan, an 8-page \ndocument. When it came out a couple months ago, none of us on this side \nof aisle received it.\n  Now that we have seen it, I understand why they didn't want everyone \nto have it. It is embarrassingly illustrative of the administration's \npostwar strategy. There was no postwar strategy. All the strategy led \nup to winning in Iraq. Everyone knew how that would come out. Of course \nwe would defeat the broken Iraqi army. Everyone knew we were going to \nwin. This was not World War II. But, amazingly enough, there was no \nstrategy for what happened after we won.\n  I am not among those who believe everything we have done in Iraq has \nbeen a failure. There has been progress. For one thing, I am glad \nSaddam Hussein is not here. He was a murderous tyrant. Members of the \nadministration now talk about the murderous conduct of Saddam Hussein \nwhen he used chemical weapons against the Kurds--something many Members \nwere outraged about at the time--and they seem to forget the \nadministration they served at that time turned a blind eye to that and \ncontinued to give aid to Saddam Hussein.\n  Having said that, now I think everyone, whether those in the Congress \nor the administration who supported Saddam Hussein over the years, we \nall agree--all Republicans, all Democrats agree--he was a tyrant and it \nis good he is gone. That is progress.\n  We have begun to train a new army and police force and so on. That is \nprogress. But we were told this spring that the amount of money for the \naid program would be very small. Now we are asked to increase our aid \nprogram ten fold, with virtually no controls on how the money will be \nspent.\n  So, we got into the war, we had no plan for what we would do \nafterwards, we have real problems now, and now they want a blank check \nto take care of it. We will pay $33,000 each for pickup trucks that \nsell for $14,000 here, and we will pay $6,000 for telephones you can \nbuy in the neighboring country of Jordan for $500 or $600. We will pay \n$50,000 a bed for a prison although that is far more than we would in \nthe United States. We will repair their power infrastructure although \nwe do not have money to do the same in the United States. We will build \na whole lot of new schoolhouses although we do not have the money to \nfix our dilapidated schools. We will build state-of-the-art hospitals \neven though we do not have the money for new health clinics in parts of \nthe United States. And we are told: Just give us the money and trust \nus; we know what to do.\n  In my State, we do not sign blank checks. I am sure we will give \nmoney for foreign aid even though we do not have the money to do the \nsame things in the United States.\n  Simply spending more money does not get us back on track. We need a \nreal plan, and we need the right agency in charge. That is why this \namendment is so short. It is one sentence. It simply puts the Coalition \nProvisional Authority--and I assume that will be Ambassador Bremer \nalthough I am not doing this on an ad hominem basis--simply put the \ncoalition provisional authority, Ambassador Bremer, who has been \nworking around the clock to carry out our interests there, under the \nforeign policy guidance and direction of the Secretary of State. It \nwould provide 60 days after enactment to give the State Department time \nto put in place the people it needs.\n  Does that mean the Department of Defense no longer has any role in \nreconstruction? Of course not. They obviously will be consulted on a \ncontinuous basis. Everyone knows nothing can be\n\n[[Page S12340]]\n\nbuilt unless there is security to prevent attacks on contractors and \naid workers and to prevent sabotage to the projects themselves. We are \nfortunate to have a superb military there to provide that kind of \nsecurity. But that is what the Defense Department should be doing, \nproviding the security but not trying to oversee foreign aid projects. \nThat is not what they are trained to do.\n\n  It is unfair to our men and women in the military to ask them to do \nthat. It was a mistake in the first place when we asked them to do it. \nWe should not repeat that. Let us not ask the Department of Defense to \nsuddenly become the State Department, AID, and the general dispenser of \nforeign aid. They are so well trained to do the things they do. Let \nthose who are trained to handle foreign aid and the projects of \nreconstruction be there.\n  It is also worth noting, when you look at the civil affairs units in \nthe Defense Department, almost all of them are composed of National \nGuard and Reserve units. Ironically, to the extent you are going to use \nthe military for the nation building we are doing in Iraq--we are doing \nnation building in Afghanistan, and Lord knows where else--these are \nthe men and women in uniform who are best equipped for the nation \nbuilding we are doing in Iraq.\n  So we either have to keep these National Guard and Reserve forces in \nIraq indefinitely--and I think the majority of the Members of both \nparties here do not want to see that happen--or we have to get the \nState Department and USAID more involved in doing nation building. I \nfavor the latter approach. That is what my amendment would do.\n  I do not think we should continue to rely on these National Guard and \nReserve units to do the long-term development work that should be done \nby others. Let that be done by the Department of State and AID, and let \nthe Department of Defense provide the security for those who are doing \nthe reconstruction in Iraq.\n  Some might ask if the Secretary of State wants that authority, given \nwhat a thankless job it is becoming in Iraq. I do not know. If he gets \nthe authority, I will offer him not congratulations but condolences.\n  I see my dear friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I answer my colleague's very \ninsightful question as to what the Secretary of State has in mind.\n  I have just been in consultation with his office, upon learning of my \ndistinguished colleague's amendment. Very shortly there will be a \nwritten communication coming to the leadership of the Senate \nexpressing, without any equivocation, that he feels strongly that the \nDepartment of State, at this time, should not be given the \nresponsibility. But there will come a time, I say to my distinguished \ncolleague--an appropriate time, and perhaps without further \ninterruption to your opening remarks--I could engage the Senator in a \ncolloquy to discuss perhaps an alternative measure at some future time.\n  Basically, it would be after the Iraqi Government is in place and the \nUnited States would, at that time, indicate an individual to become the \nU.S. Ambassador, at which time there could be an orderly transition \nfrom the Department of Defense to the Department of State.\n  My concern, I say to my friend, is that it has taken Ambassador \nBremer some 3 months now to gain the momentum he has. We have a \ncritical issue before this body at the very moment of whether or not \nthe additional funds will hopefully immediately be forthcoming. That \ndecision will be finally made next week. I strongly support it, to \ncontinue that momentum. A shift at this time would result in loss of \nmomentum.\n  I conclude my few remarks at this moment by saying, throughout the \ntestimony and private discussions with Ambassador Bremer, which I am \nsure my colleague from Vermont has had, he has constantly said that the \ndanger to the coalition forces--that danger being indelibly impressed \non us every day with the announcement of a loss or an injury to members \nof the uniformed services, and indeed others--David Kay is, at this \nmoment, before committees of the Congress. In conversations with me, he \nhas expressed the danger to his operation daily by their transit down \nthese motorways and otherwise.\n  The direct correlation of reducing the danger to our troops, to the \nIraqi special survey group headed by David Kay, and to others \nperforming NGO operations--this whole panoply of people--there is a \ndirect correlation between the speed and the momentum that the Bremer \noperation has brought up to replace the infrastructure and the \nlessening of the personal risks to individuals.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Virginia is not \nonly one of the best friends I have in this place, and has been for the \nyears that we have served together, but I also know he is one of the \nhardest working Members of the Senate.\n  As I mentioned earlier in my opening statement, I am not suggesting \nfor a minute that Ambassador Bremer, for whom I have high regard, be \nreplaced. I am simply saying that it is not a question of whether the \nSecretary of State should take this now or later; the fact is, this is \nhis job. He should have been doing it from the beginning. We are not \nchanging horses in midstream.\n  Incidentally, speaking of Mr. Kay and others, I also stated, prior to \nthe Senator from Virginia coming to the floor, that, of course, the \nmilitary would have to stay and provide the security so these people \ncan continue to work. I am just saying, insofar as we are doing nation \nbuilding, let it be done by the State Department, as we always have, \nand not think that somehow we can go solely as a military authority and \nthen have this country suddenly, one day, become a democratic nation, \nand only then will we bring in the State Department to give aid.\n  I have looked at the plan. The plan said it was to give the Iraqi \npeople the opportunity to realize President Bush's vision. We may want \nto ask them if that is exactly the vision they want. But be that as it \nmay, this is not changing horses in midstream. We are getting on the \nright horse, in fact, the horse that has taken us across the stream for \nthe last 50 years.\n  Every major postwar reconstruction effort since the Marshall plan has \nbeen under the auspices of the Secretary of State, not the Secretary of \nDefense: Afghanistan, Kosovo, East Timor, Bosnia, Cambodia. Even during \nthe middle of the Vietnam war, economic aid was handled by AID.\n  I am thinking of an article on July 24, referring to an assessment by \noutside experts, commissioned by the Pentagon, who warned that the \nwindow of opportunity for postwar success is closing. The Philadelphia \nInquirer reported that: After initial deals for reconstruction stalled, \nit was time for plan B but there was no plan B.\n  I would hope the plan B that was written on July 23 is not it. I have \na plan B. It is called the Secretary of State. Put the Department of \nState in charge of the reconstruction. Not the military part, of \ncourse. The military is going to be there for some substantial period \nof time--we know this--but allow them to do the things they are good \nat. They are not trained, nor should they be, to become a governing \npower, to become nation builders.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could probe my colleague, as I read \nthis, it states very clearly:\n\n       Provided further, That beginning not later than 60 days \n     after enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the \n     Coalition Provisional Authority shall report to and be under \n     the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the \n     Secretary of State.\n\n  As I indicated, the Secretary is very much opposed to this amendment. \nWe will very shortly have that evidence before the Senate. But it is \nclear from the reading of this that the $21 billion which is before \nthis body right now as a part of the 87--and it remains a part; that \nissue has been addressed--would now be transferred to the Department of \nState for, frankly, writing all the checks, working on the allocation \nof priorities, the coordination with the military structure under the \nSecretary of Defense and General Abizaid, the CENTCOM commander. The \nwhole thing is lifted and put under the State Department in 60 days \nafter this, should it be enacted. Am I not correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, the Senator is not correct. The implication is that \nsomehow my amendment would put everything under the State Department. \nWe are being asked to provide over $80 billion. Roughly three-quarters \nof that goes to the Department of Defense. Nobody is asking anybody but \nthe Department of Defense to handle it. We are\n\n[[Page S12341]]\n\nsaying the $20 million of foreign aid--one of the largest foreign aid \npackages I have ever seen--the $20 billion of foreign aid that is brand \nnew would be overseen by the State Department. We want to make sure \nthat the Iraqis do not feel this is a long-term military operation.\n  People should know, my amendment doesn't stop the President from \nallocating and reallocating reconstruction funds to any agency, \nincluding Defense, but State would have oversight of that. It doesn't \nshut down the Coalition Provisional Authority. It doesn't require big \nchanges there.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator be more explicit?\n  Mr. LEAHY. As I have said before, I am glad Ambassador Bremer is \nthere. It doesn't micromanage the reconstruction effort. It doesn't \ncreate a disruption of any of the programs that are there. But it does \nsay when we want to ask how these aid programs and reconstruction \nprograms are going, we ask the questions of our State Department, the \nDepartment that has had this responsibility and expertise, and the \nDepartment that has always done this from the days of the Marshall plan \non.\n  My friends keep saying, this is just like the Marshall plan. Well, \nthere are some big differences. One, the Marshall plan didn't ask us to \npick up the whole tab as this does. That was a dollar-for-dollar match. \nSome of it was in loans. It wasn't done immediately after the war. It \ntook many hearings, hundreds of witnesses. And then working with the \nPresident, there was a congressional oversight committee that actually \nhad input from both parties, both Republicans and Democrats, unlike the \nsituation here with the 8 page plan that we were given two months late.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator would enable me to bring to \nthe attention of the Senate a communication at this point in time from \nthe Department of State, it might be helpful. As I read the amendment, \nit is clear to me that Bremer would now report to the Secretary of \nState.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is true.\n  Mr. WARNER. There is no provision that he continues a direct chain to \nthe Secretary of Defense. That structure, from Bremer right on down \nthrough his organization, would now be reporting to the Secretary of \nState. Am I correct in that?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, but it does not shut down or require changes in the \ncentral command. It doesn't require any military to report to the \nSecretary of State.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator has made that eminently clear. I think right \nnow we are looking at the coalition operation under Bremer now being \ntransferred in its entirety and reporting to the Secretary of State. \nThat organization, under Bremer at the present time, composes, indeed, \ncontributions of a number of personnel from the Departments of State \nand Defense. It is sort of a coalition within itself of our Federal \ndepartments and agencies. Our coalition partners, primarily Great \nBritain, are integral participants.\n\n  How would they feel if suddenly they awakened and determined that no \nlonger does their deputy to Bremer from Great Britain report to the \nSecretary of State? This is a very significant and major change that \nour distinguished colleague is proposing.\n  In response, the Department of State, through its Assistant Secretary \nof Legislative Affairs, addressed our colleagues in the Senate by \nsaying the following:\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Senator Leahy's \n     proposed amendment to the FY 2004 Supplemental that would \n     transfer control of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) \n     from the Department of Defense to the Department of State. \n     While we appreciate Senator Leahy's confidence in the State \n     Department, we are opposed to the amendment.\n\n  That is very clear and unequivocal.\n\n       The decision to establish control of Iraq's reconstruction \n     through the Department of Defense was made because military \n     operations were and are ongoing in Iraq. The immediate \n     objective was to establish a secure and safe environment in \n     Iraq. Restoring basic services and creating conditions for \n     economic growth could not take place until this environment \n     was established.\n\n  For unity of effort and command, it was judged--and this judgment was \nfrom the President on down--\n\n     the Department of Defense would be the most appropriate \n     department in which to place CPA. The State Department fully \n     expects to resume control of traditional development efforts \n     in Iraq once the security situation is fully stabilized and \n     an elected government is in place.\n       Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on Senator \n     Leahy's amendment. We will be pleased to provide any \n     additional information you might require.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    U. S. Department of State,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McConnell: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     comment on Senator Leahy's proposed amendment to the FY 2004 \n     Supplemental that would transfer control of the Coalition \n     Provisional Authority (CPA) from the Department of Defense to \n     the Department of State. While we appreciate Senator Leahy's \n     confidence in the State Department, we are opposed to the \n     amendment.\n       The decision to establish control of Iraq's reconstruction \n     through the Department of Defense was made because military \n     operations were and are ongoing in Iraq.

We will be pleased to provide any \n     additional information you might require.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Paul V. Kelly,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also see what the National Security \nAdviser said, and I quote:\n\n       The President must remember that the military is a special \n     instrument. It is lethal, and it is meant to be. It is not a \n     civilian police force. It is not a political referee. And it \n     is most certainly not designed to build a civilian society.\n\n  Dr. Rice said that.\n  The Washington Post reports that the diplomats on Ambassador Bremer's \nstaff in Baghdad report directly to him, not to Washington, which is \ntrue. The Secretary of State, Colin Powell, has told the press he has \nto rely on newspapers and the diplomatic reports of other nations to \nkeep abreast of developments in Iraq. Maybe they don't like the job, \nbut that is what the State Department is designed to do. I have had \ntimes when somebody said I had to sit in this hearing for 4 hours \nbecause I was either chairman or ranking member of the committee, and I \nsaid, I don't want to, I would rather go to Vermont, or I would rather \ngo hunting on my farm, or do other things. But you know what? It is my \njob, it is a job I was elected to do, and I have done it.\n  I am sorry if the State Department feels they don't need to do their \njob. Maybe they have too many people. Maybe we are spending money we \ndon't need to there. I mean, this is what they do in Afghanistan. This \nis the role they have played in every post-war situation since the \nMarshall plan.\n  I ask, what is so different about Iraq? Suddenly, we are breaking 50 \nyears of precedent and they don't want to do what they are supposed to \ndo. I am worried, why don't they want to do their job? Are they \nconcerned that they could not do it better than it is being done now? I \nwould hope they could, or else we are spending an awful lot of money at \nthe State Department that we don't need to spend.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in response to my colleague, the Marshall \nplan is, in clear terms, a precedent for what the policy decisions of \nour country are, as embraced in the request for this $21 billion and in \nthe future. But there is a clear distinction. The Marshall plan came in \nyears after the fighting had stopped. As you and I are now in this \ncolloquy on the floor of the Senate, that fighting is going on right \nnow--hundreds of thousands of coalition forces--over a hundred \nthousand--and many civilians are subjected to the constant threat by \nthis polyglot of former Baathists, former associates of Saddam Hussein, \nterrorists are moving in.\n  This is a tough situation and there is daily communication between \nAmbassador Bremer and the military. They have worked side by side. In \nfact, you visited there, as I have. Their offices are just across the \nhall from one another.\n\n[[Page S12342]]\n\n  (Mr. CORNYN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I may respond on that, as I have stated over and over \nagain--and I will state it again for my good friend, who I refer to as \n``my Senator'' when I am away from Vermont because I live part of the \ntime in his beautiful Commonwealth. We are not asking the military to \nnot do the job they do, and do well; we are not asking that they stop \nproviding security or to not continue to hunt for Saddam Hussein or \nthose connected with him. What I am saying is that they ought to be \nfreed up to do that job. But they should not be doing the nation \nbuilding the administration wants, which is our President's vision for \nIraq. Let's give that job back to the people who are trained to do it.\n  I know the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee \ndoes not want to see our military there forever as an occupying force. \nHe and I totally agree on that. He and I totally agree that our \nmilitary is the finest in the world, and they have done extraordinarily \nwell there. I think we have them stretched pretty thin in a lot of \nareas.\n  I am saying, let the military do the military work; let the State \nDepartment do the foreign aid work; and if the State Department is \nunwilling to do the kinds of things they are trained for, which they \ntell us year after year they need hundreds of millions of dollars more \nto do, then maybe we don't need them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might address the comment about \nletting the State Department do its traditional responsibilities, I am \nreferring to testimony before the House of Representatives on September \n30, when the Deputy Secretary of State, Secretary Armitage, appeared. \nHe made the following observations. He said that Ambassador Bremer and \nSecretary Powell speak to each other on the phone occasionally but they \ne-mail each other if not every day, pretty close to that.\n  He was asked what the role is in postwar Iraq. He said: We have 42 \nofficers there now--42 State Department officers. I don't want to make \nlight of it. Both Ambassador Bremer and his second, Clay McManaway, are \nboth State officers. The guy who is running the show with the railroad \nis Pat Kennedy, one of the administration officers. So the State \nDepartment is heavily involved at the current time. The other officers \nfrom the Department of State are spread out not only in I but we have \nMike Felia down in the southeastern region working with the Shia. We \nhave others with the Kurds.\n  Ambassador Bremer has asked us to come forward with another \napproximately 60 officers and that we will be able to fill many more of \nthese provinces with State Department officers, the high majority of \nwhich will be there with three or four language-speaking capabilities.\n  I say to my colleague, there is the closest of relationships with the \nSecretaries of State and Defense and directly between the Secretary of \nState and Ambassador Bremer. As he points out very clearly here, Deputy \nSecretary of State Armitage and the principal deputy to Ambassador \nBremer are now officers on loan from the Secretary of State to the CPA. \nI urge my colleagues who are following this debate to think for \nthemselves about the consequences of the loss of reconstruction that \nthis would entail. You cannot make the shift in that point of time, \nand, to me, it would bring a greater threat personally and endangerment \nto the life and limb of not only the coalition forces in uniform but \nthousands of civilians who are working in various capacities to bring \nabout the goals of peace and turning over this nation to the Iraqi \npeople.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am getting the impression that my \ndistinguished friend, the senior Senator from Virginia, is not in \nagreement with my amendment and would like to keep the status quo, at \nleast for now.\n  I respond that the current structure has not worked well. Between the \ntwo of us, we have a half century of listening to people testify. The \nPentagon has said over and over again--certainly in a lot of the \nhearings I have had and I am sure that the Senator from Virginia has \nhad--that they are not a foreign aid agency. The Pentagon is not a \nforeign aid agency.\n  I think the experience of the past 5 months in Iraq confirms that. \nThey came in there without a plan, a postwar plan. I believe they \nmiscalculated terribly and they put our soldiers in a vulnerable \nposition.\n  I yield to nobody in this body in my admiration of the men and women \nwho are in Iraq, the members of our military, but the administration \nput them in an untenable position. They have to maintain order, fight \nterrorists, build schools and sewer systems, and do all that \nsimultaneously. Let the military and the Secretary of Defense focus on \nfighting the war and leave foreign aid to the agencies with the \nexpertise.\n  Just this week, one of our national news magazines said:\n\n       On the ground, the Coalition Provisional Authority, charged \n     with actually running Iraq until the Iraqis can take over, is \n     the source of increasing ridicule . . . So there they are, \n     sitting in their palace: 800 people, 17 of whom speak Arabic, \n     one is an expert on Iraq. Living in this cocoon. Writing \n     papers. ``It's absurd,'' says one dissident Pentagon \n     official. He exaggerates, but not by much. Most of the senior \n     civilian staff are not technical experts. . . .\n\n  Time magazine says Joe Fillmore, a contract translator with the 4th \nInfantry Division in Tikrit, agrees that resentment is deep. ``Things \nmay look better on the surface,'' he says, ``but there is growing \nfrustration with the occupation. The town is dividing into two parts: \nthose who hate us, and those who don't mind us, but want us to go.''\n  Whether one was for or against war, we are now there. But when we are \nasked to buy enormously expensive items, to spend more money to build a \nhospital in Iraq than we would spend on a hospital in Vermont, when we \nare asked to spend more money on telecommunications in Iraq than we are \nwilling to spend in many states in the United States, when we are asked \nto spend more money on the electrical infrastructure in Iraq than we \nare willing to spend here, when we are asked to spend more money to put \npeople back to work in Iraq than we are willing to spend in the United \nStates, when we are asked to spend more money for police and security \nand prisons in Iraq than we are willing to spend where it is needed in \nthe United States, when we are asked to spend more money for vehicles \nin Iraq than we spend for vehicles in the United States, I think it is \nfair we ask is this right? Is this necessary? Maybe it is time to put \nthe right people in charge.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might again bring to my colleague's \nattention the momentum that is presently in the CPA and its \nachievements. CPA is providing funds through military commanders--I \nwant to point that out--military commanders in the field, coalition \nmilitary commanders to fund projects at the village and municipal \nlevel. Approximately $24 million has been spent on over 6,200 projects \nto date.\n  Health projects: Saddam Hussein budgeted $13 million for health care \nin 2002, approximately 50 cents per person. For the second half of \n2003, CPA allocated $211 million--I repeat, $211 million--a 3,200 \npercent increase in health care.\n  On April 9, only 30 percent of Iraqi hospitals were functioning. CPA \nis bringing the health care system back to life. Now all 240 hospitals \nin Iraq are up and running. The CPA has wiped away the old corrupt \nsystem for distributing medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. In the \npast 90 days, 9,000 tons of medical supplies have been delivered, an \nincrease of 700 percent. Because of the CPA, Iraqi children have \nreceived 22 million doses of vaccine to cover over 4 million children \nand nearly a million pregnant women.\n  Education: Saddam starved the country's schools of cash for more than \n20 years. Children were taught pro-regime slogans in classrooms little \nbetter than livestock sheds. Enrollment in some areas had dropped to 50 \npercent of eligible children.\n  CPA is refurbishing more than 1,000 schools. The schools will have \nnew plumbing instead of raw sewage in the playgrounds, fresh paint, \nblackboards, pencils, and teaching equipment.\n  Justice system: Nationwide, 90 percent of the courts are up and \nrunning. Criminal courts in Baghdad reopened in May. A central criminal \ncourt made up of specially vetted judges and prosecutors has been \nestablished to try cases in public. The first trial was held August 25.\n  I could go on and on. I ask unanimous consent to print these success \nstories in the Record.\n\n[[Page S12343]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Coalition Provisional Authority]\n\n                          Iraq Success Stories\n\n     Reconstruction Projects\n       CPA is providing funds through military commanders in the \n     field to fund projects at the village and municipal level. \n     Approximately $24 million has been spent on over 6,200 \n     projects to date.\n     Health Projects\n       Saddam Hussein budgeted $13 million for healthcare in 2002, \n     approximately 50 cents per person.

In the \n     past 90 days 9000 tons of medical supplies have been \n     delivered; an increase of 700%.\n       Because of the CPA, Iraqi children have received 22.3 \n     million doses of vaccine to cover over 4 million children and \n     nearly a million pregnant women.\n     Education\n       Saddam starved the country's schools of cash for more than \n     20 years. Children were taught pro-regime slogans in \n     classrooms little better than livestock sheds. Enrollment in \n     some areas had dropped to 50% of eligible children.\n       The CPA is refurbishing more than 1000 schools. The schools \n     will have new plumbing instead of raw sewage in the \n     playgrounds, fresh paint, blackboards, pencils, and teaching \n     equipment.\n     Justice System\n       Nationwide, 90% of courts are up and running. Criminal \n     courts in Baghdad re-opened in May.\n       A Central Criminal Court made up of specially vetted judges \n     and prosecutors, has been established to try cases in public. \n     The first trial was held on August 25th.\n       Odious legal provisions inconsistent with fundamental human \n     rights have been suspended. Criminal defendants now have the \n     right to defense counsel at all stages of proceedings, the \n     right against self-incrimination, the right to be informed of \n     these rights, and the exclusion of evidence obtained by \n     torture.\n       Eight Supreme Court Justices wrongfully removed by Saddam \n     Hussein have been reinstated.\n       Judge Dara Noor al-Din, who was imprisoned for holding one \n     of Saddam's decrees unconstitutional, is now a member of the \n     Governing Council, in addition to his judicial duties. He was \n     never a Ba'athist.\n       Judge Medhat Mahmood, was never a Ba'athist, has been named \n     Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. There is enormous momentum.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when I hear this glowing description, I \nwonder why the administration is asking for another $20 billion. I wish \nmost of the States in the United States were doing as well as what the \nSenator from Virginia has described.\n  If they are doing that well, maybe we should give the $20 billion to \nStates in the United States that are not doing nearly as well and could \nprobably use the money.\n  I am glad to hear the hospitals are all operating again. Obviously, \nfrom a humanitarian point of view that is important progress. I hope \nthe Iraqis realize they can go to any hospital they want now and they \nwill receive the help they need. If that is true, why do we need to \nspend another $150 million for another hospital? Rural hospitals \nthroughout the 50 States of the United States cannot say that. I know a \nlot of places in the 50 States in the United States about which we \ncannot give the kind of glowing report the Senator from Virginia has \ngiven about Iraq.\n  Keep in mind, I am not asking for somebody to walk in there tomorrow \nand take over. But I would hope that within the next two months, with \nthe 800 people in the palace over there, we might find more than 17 who \ncan speak Arabic. That, I think, would be the kind of expertise the \nState Department could bring.\n  I hope we will have more than one expert on Iraq, and I hope we will \ntell the Iraqi people that we are as interested in them building their \ncountry following their vision and not, in almost a condescending way, \nsaying we want them to have the opportunity to build a country that \nfits the vision our President has for them. After all, we are talking \nabout a civilization that goes back long before this country was even \ndiscovered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I recognize that important bit of history. \nAs I say to my friend of a quarter of century, we have had the \nprivilege of serving here--and I see the distinguished acting minority \nleader on the floor--it would be the intention of the Senator from \nVirginia to move to table, but I first would like to hear an expression \nperhaps from others who might like to address the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Virginia will yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have the floor.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Vermont will yield, I don't know how \nmuch more time the Senator from Vermont has. We have a couple other \nSenators who wish to speak. Certainly Senator Leahy has no desire to \nride this out. We have a number of amendments lined up and ready to go \nas soon as this is finished. The Senator from Vermont is the best \nperson to answer that question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I respond to the distinguished Senator from \nNevada, we have had a good colloquy with the distinguished senior \nSenator from Virginia, which is not unexpected because the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia is one of the most knowledgeable \nMembers of the Senate, as well as being a dear and close friend. I \nthink we have probably proved, for those who are watching, the \nedification of having both sides here.\n  The Senator from Virginia, though I control the floor--I have yielded \nto him whenever he wanted.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, every courtesy has been extended, and I \nmight add that I am in consultation with the distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee on this matter, who likewise is presently \non the Senate floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have had time to say what I am going to say. I am also \napparently having incipient laryngitis, which is probably as crippling \nan illness as any Member of the Senate could have.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not detect it. I think the Senator is \nstanding there with full vigor. I believe we have pretty well covered \nthe major issues.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Full vigor everywhere except for my tonsils, I would say \nto my friend from Virginia.\n  The Senator from Virginia has the right to move to table, but this is \nan important issue, and I would hope that he would show his usual \ncourtesy and withhold until people have had a chance to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Before the Senator leaves, Mr. President, could we \nexplore a time agreement on the amendment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask the Senator from Alaska, could I yield to the \nSenator from Nevada for that purpose? Whatever is agreeable, I am \nperfectly willing to do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have a Senator's agreement that we are \ngoing from side to side. We have another amendment ready to go. We \nwould be happy to proceed. The Senator from Colorado wants to speak for \n10 minutes on the bill itself, but I should think we could get a time \nagreement.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, after having consultation with the \ninterested Senators, I make the following unanimous consent request: I \nask unanimous consent that the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard, have \n15 minutes; the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, have 2 minutes; \nSenator Leahy have 5 minutes; the distinguished minority leader have 10 \nminutes; Senator Biden have 10 minutes; and there be 25 minutes under \nmy control to be allocated to interested Senators on this side, if any, \nand that there be a vote in relation to the Leahy amendment, with no \namendments being in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand our side is going to move to \ntable the Leahy amendment, and I do support tabling the Leahy \namendment. From what I have been able to observe,\n\n[[Page S12344]]\n\nI think things are going well in Iraq. Certainly, I have no qualms with \nthe way the State Department and the Defense Department are working \ntogether. I do not think we ought to upset the apple cart when things \nare moving in the right direction.\n  I want to take a few moments to talk about the President's \nsupplemental request in total. I ask my colleagues for quick action on \nthe underlying bill. The reasons for quick action are simple. If we \nwant to see a reduction in the number of soldiers in Iraq, we need to \nfully fund this request. If we want to improve the security in Iraq, we \nmust approve this request. If we want a Democratic Iraq, governed by \nIraqis, we must approve this request.\n  No one in this body on either side of the aisle would deny we need \nadditional operational and procurement funds for our military. We all \nknow that. Yet there is a great controversy over the reconstruction \nfunds which in the long-term could be just as important to the safety \nof the troops as the additional operation and procurement funds.\n  Our troops will benefit from the additional operational funds that \nare requested in the $87 billion. My view is that if we want to see our \nforces out of Iraq quickly, we need to have those operational funds \nbecause they are essential to moving ahead with Iraq becoming self-\nsufficient, with Iraq being able to defend itself and being able to \nassume the responsibilities the U.S. military right now is assuming.\n\n  My point is that not only are the Iraqis beneficiaries, but our \nsoldiers over in Iraq are beneficiaries, and they are beneficiaries for \nthe reason it is going to be an opportunity for them to move out \nquicker and get home quicker. That is what we all want to see. Our \nability to protect the men and women of the U.S. military is at stake.\n  Since the beginning of hostilities last February, there have been 19 \nsoldiers from Colorado's Fort Carson and five other Coloradans who have \ndied in Iraq. These men and women have paid the ultimate sacrifice in \npursuit of the freedoms we often take for granted. I would be \ndishonoring the sacrifice these brave Americans have made and failing \nto protect those who continue to serve in Iraq if I did not support \nboth the military funding portion of the supplemental and the \nreconstruction funding.\n  While the $20 billion in reconstruction funds will not end the \nguerilla attacks on our troops, it will make a difference. Iraq is a \ndangerous country, and as long as American troops are on the ground \nthere, they will be at risk, as any American who may be in that \ncountry. However, the fact remains that the more we repair the old \nwounds of the Hussein regime, the safer our troops will be in Iraq. \nSpecifically, the money we spend on upgrading the water of Iraq and \nsanitation services, the oil infrastructure rehabilitation, and the \nhealthcare and education of the Iraqi people will have a direct impact \non the safety of our troops.\n  Improving the social conditions of the Iraqi people will reduce \nhostility and ease the sense of desperation many Iraqis have felt since \nthe fall of Saddam Hussein. Moreover, this funding will give Iraqis \nhope and demonstrate our commitment to not only rid Iraq of terrorists, \nbut also improve the lives of ordinary Iraqis.\n  Freedom cannot be bought on the cheap. And, as Paul Bremer testified \nlast week, the Coalition Provisional Authority's seven-step program \ntowards Iraqi self-governance hinges on the basic needs of the Iraqis \nbeing fulfilled. Without it, democracy will fail. This cannot be \nallowed to happen.\n  Think back about what has been mentioned before about reconstruction \nafter World War II and how we all realized after World War I that we \nhad troops who were waiting to go home, everybody was excited to go \nhome, but nobody stayed around to help stabilize the countries we \ndefeated during World War I. Consequently, events evolved and we were \ninto World War II. I think we learned our lesson, and that is that \nthere needs to be a reconstruction period. So we had the Marshall plan \nput into effect. I think we need to not forget that lesson today if we \nwant to see Iraq be a permanent democracy in the Middle East.\n  Perhaps of most importance to our troops in Iraq is the efforts to \nreconstitute the Iraqi Army and expand the civil police force. The \nmoney in the supplemental would help establish 27 battalions for the \nIraqi Army and a police force of about 80,000 in the next 12 to 18 \nmonths.\n  Let me stress how important these efforts are. To have Iraqi patrols \npolicing their own people will allow a safer environment for our \nsoldiers and show the Iraqi people that we are not occupiers, and that \nIraq is their country and their responsibility. In fact, the commander \nof Central Command, General Abizaid, testified before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee that the most important part of the supplemental is \nthese security funds. I quote General Abizaid:\n\n       . . . we can speed up the training of the Iraqi Army--\n     instead of taking 2 years, take 1, and we can't do that \n     without more money.\n\n  The general goes on to state:\n\n       . . . every month that goes by where we don't start those \n     security projects is a month longer before those guys go out \n     and potentially can relieve our troops of some of their \n     duties.\n\n  If the combatant commander with responsibility for Iraq believes \nreconstruction efforts and the security of American soldiers is linked, \nwe should certainly heed his advice.\n  I think the additional point has been made in many hours of testimony \nbefore the Armed Services Committee that our intelligence will improve \ndramatically the more we are able to incorporate the Iraqi police force \nand their assistance in maintaining domestic stability in Iraq.\n  The issue has been also broached about making the reconstruction \nfunds a loan to the already impoverished nation. I object to this idea \nfor two important reasons. First, there are those in the United States, \nand many more abroad, who protested the idea of going to war with Iraq. \nA large majority of these critics believed this was a war for oil. They \nbelieved our insatiable need for fuel was driving us toward an \noccupation of Iraq so we could control its oil fields. I am not going \nto outline why this assumption was flawed in the first place, because \nyou only have to look at the U.N. mandates the Hussein regime ignored \nand the mass graves of his murdered people. This is an absurd notion \nbut not one we can afford to ignore.\n\n  However, if we ask for a loan, where will Iraq come up with the \nmoney? Nineteen billion is what has been estimated in their oil fields \nwhen they get up in production, and when they have a $20 billion loan, \nthat doesn't even service the interest on that loan. How will it look \nfor the United States when we ask the Iraqis to pump their crude to pay \nus back for the money we loaned them? Perception is important for us in \nthe Middle East and we cannot afford to have an ``oil motive'' attached \nto our efforts to bring democracy to the region.\n  Another concern would be the example set for the other countries of \nthe world that might contribute to the reconstruction effort. Iraq \nalready owes $200 billion to Russia and France and Germany and others. \nAre we to ask them to forgive their debt and then demand payment for \nour generosity?\n  Our negotiators need leverage when they ask for reconstruction funds \nfrom the rest of the world. Our leverage would be nullified if the \nproposed grant to Iraq changes to a loan. Again, perception of asking \nfor help for a burgeoning democracy in the Middle East would be muddied \nif we have an IOU in our back pocket.\n  A few weeks ago the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Myers, \ntestified before the Armed Services Committee and remarked that our \nbattle in Afghanistan and Iraq is a battle of wills. He stated:\n\n       We are going to win as long as we have the continuing will \n     of the American people, and for that matter, freedom loving \n     people everywhere.\n\n  This supplemental request is a measure of our will, a measure of our \ncommitment to the Iraqi people. Terrorist organizations such as al-\nQaida and state sponsors of terrorism like the former Hussein regime \nhave doubted America's commitment in the past. Are we prepared to risk \nadditional attacks against our troops if we fail to assist in the \nreconstruction of Iraq? Are we prepared to say to the people of Iraq \nthey are on their own? Are we prepared to stay the course?\n  We must act quickly, we must act decisively, and we must pass this \nfunding as requested by the President. The\n\n[[Page S12345]]\n\nUnited States must continue to show leadership in the world as we have \nsince our inception. We must not allow our support of democracy and \nfreedom to be compromised.\n  Last year, more than three-quarters of this body voted to support \ngoing to war with Iraq with the understanding we would not stop until \nwe were victorious. We are not finished yet. More needs to be done. I \nask my colleagues for quick approval of the supplemental funds for the \nsake of the security of the Iraqi people and the safety of our troops \non the ground.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1802\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This afternoon the Senate is taking action to solve a \nproblem for our soldiers serving in Iraq. Senator Coleman, myself, \nSenator Stevens, and others have offered an amendment that deals with \nthe cost of travel soldiers experience when they are going on a 15-day \nleave from the country of Iraq.\n  The life of a soldier is a heavy burden--in harm's way, away from \nhome for long periods of time. It is also a heavy burden for their \nfamilies. The decision by the Pentagon to provide a 15-day leave for \nthose soldiers who are serving in Iraq to be able to come home to visit \ntheir families is a wonderful decision. It is the right thing to do.\n  But there has been a bureaucratic snag in this with respect to some \nrules that have said the soldiers on this leave will be dropped off at \nsome central points in the U.S.--Baltimore, BWI Airport, Los Angeles--\nand then they must buy their own airplane ticket back to their home \nbase. That is not right nor is it fair.\n  The amendment today says to those soldiers your travel will be \ncovered, leaving Iraq to this country, all the way back to your home \nbase. That is the right thing to do.\n  This amendment will be welcome news to the soldiers and welcome news \nto their families. This amendment is one small way for this country to \ncontinue to say thank you to those who serve our country.\n  Once again, I don't think it was ever intended that a soldier, asked \nto serve in the country of Iraq and then given a 15-day leave, should \nhave to pay for part of the travel to get back home. Many of these \nsoldiers can't afford it. They are living on soldier pay. They and \ntheir families very much look forward to these 15 days that will \nreunite them once again, and they ought not have to be burdened by \nhaving to buy an airplane ticket from Baltimore or Los Angeles. After \nall, that wasn't their point of departure. They left home to serve this \ncountry in Iraq and this country ought to say to them, for this \nfurlough, for this opportunity to go back to your family, we will pay \nfor the ticket back to your home.\n  That is the obligation of this country. This Congress on a bipartisan \nbasis this afternoon said to those soldiers, Thank you. We are pleased \nto fix this problem--a solution that I believe is going to be very \nwelcome news to the U.S. soldiers and their families.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time running on the quorum call be counted \nequally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Leahy \namendment.\n  The amendment is very straightforward. It puts the State Department \nin charge of reconstruction of Iraq. It says that we ought to relieve \nour military of the burden of running this nationbuilding program, and \nwe ought to put it in the hands of the U.S. Government agency that has \nsuccessfully run such programs for decades.\n  The President recognized the wisdom of such a decision last fall when \nhe directed the State Department to conduct its year-long study called \n``The Future of Iraq.'' The study apparently cost $5 million. It \nconvened countless meetings with independent experts on Iraq and on \npost-conflict reconstruction. And, unfortunately, the study's findings \nwere completely ignored.\n  According to a remarkable story in this week's Newsweek, when it came \ntime to send the reconstruction team into Iraq, Secretary Rumsfeld \nordered the State Department expert who had spent the previous year \npreparing the United States Government for post-Saddam Iraq to stay \nhome. Apparently, his absence meant something. Another member of the \nreconstruction team who did go to Iraq came home about a month later \nand wrote a remarkable article for the Washington Post. He offered a \nseries of stories about his time in Iraq to demonstrate ``how flawed \npolicy and incompetent administration have marred the follow-up to the \nbrilliant military campaign to destroy Saddam Hussein's regime.''\n  Unfortunately, the civilian leadership continues to rely on overly \nrosey scenarios and unrealistic plans while the risk to our troops \ngrows.\n  Last week, we were presented a plan by Ambassador Bremer that was \nsupposed to set everything right in the reconstruction effort. His plan \nlays out five security goals--which are to be completed by October. Let \nme walk through just three of them.\n  The Bremer plan will ``locate, secure, and eliminate WMD \ncapability.'' Yet, today the lead man on the search for weapons of mass \ndestruction was to brief Congress on his efforts to date. According to \npress reports, he will report that he has not found any unconventional \nweapons.\n  The Bremer plan will also ``eliminate munitions caches, unexploded \nordinance and excess military equipment.'' Yet the New York Times \nreported last weekend that 650,000 tons of ammunition remains at \nthousands of sites used by the former Iraqi security forces, and that \nmuch of it has not been secured and will take years to destroy.\n  The Bremer plan will also ``defeat internal armed threats'' by \nOctober. Just today in Iraq, our commanding general on the ground in \nIraq, said that our troops are facing increasingly sophisticated \nattacks and it would take years before Iraq could maintain internal \nsecurity without backup.\n  The Leahy amendment simply says that we have had enough of \nunrealistic plans and inexperienced planners. It says we are not \ncomfortable that our troops--overstretched and at risk--are being \nforced to lead the nationbuilding effort in Iraq. It says what every \nindependent assessment of our Iraq effort has urged us to do: put the \nexperienced reconstruction experts at the State Department--not our \nmilitary--in charge of nationbuilding.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Leahy amendment, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am informed it will now be possible to \nyield back all the time on the Leahy amendment. The distinguished \nSenator from Vermont is here in the Chamber.\n  I yield any remaining time on our side on the Leahy amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield our time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the Leahy amendment and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to note the absence of a \nquorum so that we can just finalize some comments before we make an \nannouncement about the remainder of the evening.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it would be my purpose to try to see if \nwe could have a specific time on this vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Six o'clock.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Six o'clock?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this vote that has just \nbeen ordered occur at 6 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in just a minute we will start the vote \non the\n\n[[Page S12346]]\n\nLeahy amendment, but I want the Senate to be on notice following this \namendment there will be a vote on a Federal judge. That will be \nannounced during the period right after this vote.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent following the \nscheduled vote, the Senate immediately proceed to executive session and \nto consecutive votes on the following nominations on today's Executive \nCalendar: Calendar Nos. 382, 383, 385, and 386.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees prior to each vote; \nfurther, that following the votes, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I take just a moment to \nthank the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I \nknow how strongly he feels--and I understand the reasons he feels this \nway because I share them--that these are very important matters that \nshould not be relegated necessarily to voice votes. But he has, once \nagain, demonstrated a real appreciation of Senators' schedules and his \nunderstanding of the need for other Senators to offer amendments on \nthis very critical bill we are dealing with. And in order to \naccommodate Senators who have amendments to offer, once again, he has \nagreed with my request that we do a rollcall on the first vote and then \nvoice votes on the other ones.\n\n  So I just want to publicly acknowledge his cooperation and his \nassistance on this matter and thank him since he is currently in the \nChamber. But I appreciate that.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with the indulgence of the two leaders, I \nappreciate very much what the Democratic leader has said. He and I, and \nthe distinguished majority leader, and Senator Hatch, and others, want \nto move judges whenever we have consensus. And I think we have shown we \nhave.\n  In the 17 months we were in charge of the Senate, when we were the \nmajority, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees to the Federal \njudiciary. In the 16 months the Republicans have been in control, this \nwill make another 64 we have confirmed. So it is around 164 between the \n2 parties. It is a record that has not been matched for years and years \nand years.\n  But I am happy to accommodate the two leaders. I know the problems \nthe two leaders have. I would not wish them on anybody else. The two \nleaders have been trying to schedule things, so I am happy to try to \naccommodate them and all Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just for clarification, we will have the \nvote on the Leahy amendment now, followed by a rollcall vote on one of \nthe judicial nominees, followed by a voice vote on the next three \njudicial nominees.\n  In the meantime, we will be discussing the schedule for later this \nevening. Amendments will be in order tonight. They will be laid down. \nWe will talk about the voting schedule here shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, before we go to the vote, I know our \ncolleagues will be coming to the floor to vote on these two matters.\n  The distinguished majority leader and I have been talking about the \nschedule tomorrow. And without in any way preempting him and the \ndecisions he will make about the schedule, there is a possibility that \nwe will not be in session tomorrow but that we will have a window for \nSenators to offer amendments.\n  The only reason I say that now is if Senators would contemplate the \noffering of an amendment tomorrow, I would like them, at least on the \nDemocratic side, to consult with Senator Reid and myself during these \nvotes so that we have an understanding of how many of those amendments \nmight be offered. We would only have about a 2-hour window. But if \nSenators are interested, during these votes I hope they will come to \neither Senator Reid or myself to discuss the queuing of those \namendments and whether or not we will have an opportunity to consider \nthem all.\n  So I hope we will use the time available to us for discussion of \nthat. And we will have more to say about that sequencing once those \nvotes have been completed.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1803\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1803. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch. \nThis is an excellent nominee for the Southern District Court of \nCalifornia, William Hayes.\n  I want to emphasize the excellent process that we have in place to \nselect District Court nominees in California.\n  In a truly bipartisan fashion, the White House Counsel, Senator \nFeinstein and I worked together to create four judicial advisory \ncommittees for\n\n[[Page S12347]]\n\nthe State of California, one in each Federal judicial district in the \nState.\n  Each committee has a membership of six individuals: three appointed \nby the White House and three appointed jointly by Senator Feinstein and \nme. Each member's vote counts equally, and a majority is necessary for \nrecommendation of a candidate.\n  Mr. Hayes was reviewed by the Southern District Committee and \nstrongly recommended for this position. I continue to support this \nbipartisan selection process and the high quality nominees it has \nproduced.\n  Mr. Hayes had extensive civil experience as a private attorney before \nbecoming a Federal prosecutor, rising to the position of head of the \ncriminal division in the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego.\n  The southern district will benefit greatly from the exemplary \nservices of Mr. Hayes, and I fully support confirmation of this \nnominee.\n  I wish to emphasize, once again, to my colleagues that we have a \nwonderful process in place in California to come up with these nominees \nfor the district court. Senator Feinstein and I have three members on \nthe committee. The Bush administration has three members on the \ncommittee. It takes a majority vote. This means we are working \ntogether, and we have proven that we can come up with mainstream \nnominees for the district court. I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nWilliam Q. Hayes, who has been nominated to the United States District \nCourt for the Southern District of California.\n  Mr. Hayes received both his J.D. and M.B.A. from Syracuse University \nin 1983. Following his graduation, he spent a year in private practice \nuntil 1987, at which time he went to work for the United States \nAttorney's Office for the Southern District of California. He was \neventually elevated to chief of the criminal division of that office in \nrecognition of his exceptional legal abilities. Despite the demands of \nhis career in public service, he has nevertheless found the time to \nteach at both the undergraduate and law school levels.\n  Mr. Hayes is an exceptional nominee who will be a fine addition to \nthe Federal bench, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nhis nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is one amendment that might still require a vote \ntonight. We think it will be worked out. So many people want to start \nthis vote, I suggest we start it. If that amendment is worked out, \nthere will be more votes tonight, but we should know before the \nrollcall is over. So I suggest we start the rollcall now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nJohn Houston, who has been confirmed to the United States District \nCourt for the Southern District of California.\n  Judge Houston, a graduate of the University of Miami School of Law, \nhas used his outstanding legal skills in public service. He first \nserved in the United States Army Judge Advocate General Corps and then \nin various positions at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern \nDistrict of California before his appointment in 1998 as a Federal \nmagistrate judge, the position in which he currently serves.\n  Judge Houston has won many accolades for his legal skills, including \nawards from the National Association of Black Customs Enforcement \nOfficers and from the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force for \nOutstanding Contributions. He was also presented with the Director's \nAward for Superior Performance in Asset Forfeiture by then-Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno.\n  In addition to his judicial responsibilities, Judge Houston finds \ntime to participate in community programs that assist children in \nmeeting educational and economic challenges. He has, for example, \nopened his courtroom to public school students to give them hands-on \nlessons in the judicial process. And he has served as a mentor to young \nAfrican-American men who have excelled in high school to prepare them \nfor college and beyond.\n  I applaud President Bush for his nomination of Judge Houston and am \nconfident that he will serve on the bench with compassion, integrity \nand fairness.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nRobert Clive Jones, who has been confirmed to the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Nevada.\n  Before I go any further, I must tell you that Judge Jones is a fellow \nCougar--a graduate of my alma mater, Brigham Young University. He then \nattended UCLA School of Law, where he graduated in the top 10 percent \nof his\n\n[[Page S12348]]\n\nclass--a member of the Order of the Coif--and where he had been an \nassociate editor of the UCLA Law Review.\n  Following his graduation from law school, Judge Jones clerked for the \nNinth Circuit Judge J. Clifford Wallace. He then entered into private \npractice with the Las Vegas law firm of Albright and McGimsy, as an \nassociate, specializing in tax law, real property, bankruptcy, and \ncommercial law. He then worked at the law firm of Jones & Holt, where \nhe was a partner.\n  In 1983, Judge Jones was appointed to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for \nthe District of Nevada, where he currently serves. He simultaneously \nserved as a member of a three-judge panel for the U.S. Bankruptcy \nAppellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit from 1986 until 1999.\n  In addition to his judicial responsibilities, Judge Jones \nparticipates in the promotion of State bar pro bono bankruptcy \nservices, which include educating the public on bankruptcy law. He also \nfinds time to volunteer his services to such charitable organizations \nas the American Cancer Society and Opportunity Village, a group that \nassists the mentally disabled.\n  I applaud President Bush for his nomination of Judge Jones and am \nconfident he will continue to be an asset on the Federal bench.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

FIGA, OF COLORADO, TO BE UNITED STATES \n              DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the next nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Phillip S. Figa, of \nColorado, to be United States District Judge for the District of \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on the nomination.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today on the occasion of the \nconfirmation of Phil Figa to the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Colorado. I urge my colleagues to vote favorably on Figa's \nconfirmation, a man who represents the very best our legal system has \nto offer. The Judiciary is a fundamental institution of our democracy; \nit is given neither force nor will, but merely judgment. Our \nConstitution dictates that the President shall nominate, and by and \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint judges of the \nFederal Court. Today we can fulfill this obligation by confirming Mr. \nFiga. With further commitment to the country's founding principles, we \ncan move toward fulfilling this commitment in regard to all outstanding \nvacancies. I want to thank Chairman Hatch and Senator Leahy for the \ngreat speed with which Mr. Figa's nomination has moved through the \nSenate. Nominated by the President in June, this vote is a shining \nexample of a process that can work when a spirit of bipartisanship \ntriumphs. Chairman Hatch, your leadership is truly appreciated.\n\n   In light of recent terrorist attacks, it is readily apparent that we \nface a new age of global unrest, a world in which terror has replaced \nformal declarations of war as the major threat against freedom and \ndemocracy. A necessary component of providing justice to those who \nwould do harm to our nation is to maintain an efficient court system--a \ncourt equipped with the personnel and resources that enable it to \nfulfill its role as a pillar of our constitutional system of \ngovernance. Swift punishment serves as a warning to tyranny and a \ndeterrent to evil. By filling this vacancy, America continues to show \nits resolve in justice and law.\n   Mr. Figa's nomination arose after Judge Richard Matsch, who presided \nover the Oklahoma City bombing trial, went to senior status. Judge \nMatsch's departure leaves big shoes to fill. However, after months of \nbackground investigations and congressional inquiry, it is obvious that \nPhil Figa is the right person for the job.\n   For the past several years. I have had the opportunity to get to \nknow Phil's wonderful family. His wife Candy, and their two children, \nBen and Lizzie, were able to watch their father's job interview before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee last month. I admire the strong family \nvalues so apparent in every member of the Figa family--it was their \ncontinued support and encouragement that provided the strength and \nenergy he needed in order to stand steadfast in pursuit of this most \nworthy endeavor. Together, the family enjoys the Colorado outdoors, \nspending free time hiking and biking in the mountains. According to \nCriminal defense lawyer Gary Lozow, Figa is a ``thoughtful and bright \nperson who will make a good Federal judge and is mindful of the \nawesomeness of taking on that responsibility.''\n   The two major newspapers in my home State of Colorado agree. The \nRocky Mountain News noted, Phil has achieved a rare balance in his life \nof family, law practice and community activities. The Denver Post, in \nan endorsement earlier this year, noted that Figa is a good, solid \nchoice for the bench. The Post was encouraged by the fact that Figa's \nbackground is in civil litigation, which makes up a high percentage of \nthe cases handled by Federal judges.\n   I am not the only one who believes that his keen intellect and \ntemperament is ideal for the bench. In a letter dated June 10, 2003, \nSenator Campbell and I wrote to the committee, ``Mr. Figa is highly \nqualified and will ably serve the people of the United States . . . \n(he) is well known throughout the Colorado legal community for his \ncredibility, integrity, hard work and firm grasp of the law.'' His \nsupporters hail from across party lines and include a variety of \nelected officials from\n\n[[Page S12349]]\n\nall levels of local, State, and Federal Governments. Of the many \ngracious comments I have heard about Phil, none characterize him better \nthan a statement made by the managing partner at his firm. ``He's a \nvery gracious fellow . . . a very likable person. He's a gentlemanly \ncharacter.''\n   In Federalist Number 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote that Judges are \nthe guardians of the constitution, ``The courts must declare the sense \nof the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead of \njudgment, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their \npleasure to that of the legislative body.''\n   Phil Figa is the guardian we need on the bench of the District Court \nfor the District of Colorado. He will serve our Nation with the utmost \nof respect to our country and our constitution, and for this, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote favorably on his confirmation.\n  Phillip Figa is somebody who has been reviewed by his peers in \nColorado. He has been reviewed by the American Bar Association. He will \nbe a very good individual for the bench and he has bipartisan support.\n  I yield the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nPhillip Figa, who has been confirmed to the United States District \nCourt for the District of Colorado.\n  Mr. Figa graduated from Cornell Law School in 1976. He then entered \nprivate practice with Sherman & Howard, where he primarily worked on \ncommercial litigation, general business matters and municipal bond \nwork.\n  In 1980, Mr. Figa became a partner at Burns & Figa, P.C. The firm \nmaintained a boutique litigation practice emphasizing complex \ncommercial litigation, especially antitrust, contract, real estate and \nother business-related disputes. Mr. Figa's practice also included \nrepresenting lawyers and law firms in a variety of malpractice, ethics, \nattorney fee and disciplinary contexts. Since 1991, Mr. Figa has \nbroadened his practice areas to include environmental litigation, \ntrademark, oil and gas, health care and employment litigation. Mr. Figa \nhas also served as an expert witness in the areas of legal ethics, \nstandard of care of lawyers, conflicts of interest, malpractice and \nattorneys fees.\n  Mr. Figa enjoys the strong support of his home state senators, and I \nam pleased to join them in support of his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is, will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Phillip S. Figa, of Colorado, to be United States District Judge for \nthe District of Colorado?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motions to \nreconsider are laid on the table, and the President shall be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tonight we voted unanimously to confirm \nfour district court nominees: William Hayes and John Houston to be U.S. \nDistrict Judges for the Southern District of California, Robert Clive \nJones to be a U.S. District Judge for the District of Nevada, and \nPhillip Figa to be a U.S. District Judge for the District of Colorado.\n  I commend the Republican leadership for finally bringing the \nnominations of William Hayes and John Houston of California to the \nfloor. These two nominees will be filling vacancies on the busiest \ndistrict court in the nation. The two seats which these men will fill \nhave been created to address the growing crisis to the border court in \nSan Diego--the federal court with the highest caseload per judge in the \nnation. It is too bad that the Republican leadership chose to move \nnominees from Oklahoma and Texas ahead of these California nominees who \nare desperately needed by the people of the Southern District of \nCalifornia due to the high caseload of that court.\n  I would also note that the way in which these nominees have come \nforth should be used as a model for the White House to emulate in other \nStates and circuits. Senator Diane Feinstein and Senator Barbara Boxer \nworked hard to establish a bipartisan commission in California which \nhas recommended these individuals for the Southern District of \nCalifornia. I am happy to be able to join the two California Senators \nin confirming these two new judges.\n  At the conclusion of the confirmation votes tonight, a total of 64 \njudicial nominees of President Bush will be confirmed this year. Adding \nthat to the 100 confirmations during 17 months of the Democratic \nmajority in the Senate, 164 of President Bush's judicial nominees have \nbeen confirmed thus far. This number of confirmations, 164, is \nsignificantly higher than Republicans allowed by the third year of \nPresident Clinton's second term, the most recent presidential term, \nwhen they allowed 135 judicial nominees of that president to be \nappointed from 1997 through the end of 1999.\n  It also should be noted that when I became chair of the Judiciary \nCommittee on July 10, 2001, the Democrats inherited 110 vacant seats in \nthe Federal judiciary. In the 17 months of Democratic control, we \nsignificantly reduced the vacancy rate by confirming 100 of President \nBush's judicial nominees. Today, there are only 41 vacancies on the \nFederal courts. This is the lowest level reached in 13 years. Had we \nnot created 15 new seats this year, that number would be even lower--\ndown to 26.\n  In just the past week, Senate Democrats have worked with the \nRepublicans to confirm 10 district court judges and 1 circuit court \njudge. There are a lot of accusations of delay being thrown around but \nthe truth is in these plain numbers. With more full-time Federal judges \non the bench today than any other time in U.S. history, the \nconfirmation process is moving forward and judges are being confirmed \nexpeditiously with support from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee \nand in the full Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12349-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide an additional $322,000,000 for safety equipment \nfor United States forces in Iraq and to reduce the amount provided for \n                reconstruction in Iraq by $322,000,000)\n\n       On page 2, line 20, strike ``$24,946,464,000:'' and insert \n     ``$25,268,464,000, of which $322,000,000 shall be available \n     to provide safety equipment through the Rapid Fielding \n     Initiative and the Iraqi Battlefield Clearance program:''.\n       On page 25, line 10, strike ``$5,136,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$4,884,000,000''.\n       On page 25, line 16, strike ``$353,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$283,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I apologize to my colleagues. I know it is a late hour. \nThis is an important amendment, and I hope my colleagues can support \nit.\n  I rise to propose this amendment to the emergency supplemental \nspending bill to ensure that Congress and the administration keep sight \nof what I believe must remain our number one priority for the conduct \nof the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the protection of our \nAmerican troops.\n  According to the U.S. Army, the President's supplemental bill falls \nshort of over $200 million for critical gear for our soldiers slated to \nrotate in Iraq and Afghanistan in the months ahead. This amendment was \ndesigned specifically to see to it that those U.S. troops coming into \nIraq, into a theater of war, would receive important equipment they \nneed to perform their missions effectively. This equipment includes \nimportant high-tech body armor, bullet-proof helmets, special water \npacks to keep soldiers hydrated, and other survival gear.\n  I don't need to make the case about what is happening in Iraq on a \ndaily basis, nor do I need to stress the importance of this kind of \nequipment. My colleagues are well aware of this situation.\n  As it stands now, the supplemental bill before the Senate only covers \nexpenses for soldiers' personal equipment up to the first 3 months of \n2004 and does not take into account very soon a considerable number of \nmen and women who will be entering the theater to relieve soldiers who \nare there now.\n  In an $87 billion emergency spending package for 2004, one would \nthink we could find enough money to meet the pressing equipment needs \nof our young men and women in uniform. That is why I was surprised to \nfind an official list from the U.S. Army Comptroller's Office dated \nSeptember 26 detailing several important items that remain unfunded in \nthis supplemental. Above all else, it is a requirement that thousands \nof our soldiers, particularly those in the Reserves and the National \nGuard, be equipped with the most effective personal equipment \navailable. Our troops need this gear to improve their performance in \ncombat and to enhance their safety under intense conditions.\n  As my colleagues know, every day our men and women in uniform have \nbeen ordered into harm's way, sent into extreme heat--exceeding 120 \ndegrees in some cases--with strenuous missions in different settings \nthroughout Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  My chart shows what a foot soldier wears on his shoulders in Iraq: 60 \npounds of body armor, tactical equipment, in hot desert heat, carrying \nhigh-tech night vision equipment, special framed backpacks, and other \nsurvival gear. In 120 degrees, carrying all this equipment becomes \nquite burdensome, so they have special hydration systems necessary for \ntroops to safely survive the desert heat. These water pack systems, \ncalled camelbaks, are attached to the soldier's backpack to allow easy \naccess to water when they are in motion.\n  Unfortunately, with the shortage of funds, the Army could not afford \nto equip all soldiers with this equipment, so many soldiers are using \nbulky canteens that quickly heat up in the desert sun. Most of the \ncanteens do not have adequate capacity to carry the water they need in \nIraq's intense heat.\n  This information comes from the U.S. Army. I am not making this up \nfrom news reports. This is what our military is telling us and where a \nshortfall exists in this supplemental.\n  In other cases, the soldiers are paying hundreds of dollars out of \ntheir own pockets to buy the equipment themselves, everything ranging \nfrom the camelbaks to gun scopes, because in spite of the Army's stated \npriorities, the administration did not procure enough personnel \nequipment for these men and women. I think we can do better than that.\n  The 2003 Defense Appropriations Act included language demanding \nanswers to why the very men and women we send into combat are being \nforced to spend upwards of $300 per person. Our own Congress made this \npoint: They are spending up to $300 per person on equipment to outfit \nthemselves for combat in Iraq. The Army has yet to report on this issue \nand has established a rapid fielding initiative designed to outfit our \nsoldiers with the most modern equipment available so they do not have \nto spend their own money on the latest body armor hydration systems.\n\n  Out of $324.5 million needed to fund this program in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, only $122.5 million was to be available in this \nsupplemental budget bill. That means if our soldiers, many of whom are \nless than 21 years of age, making under $20,000 a year, want the right \ngear for their mission, they are going to have to dig into their own \npockets to buy their own hydration equipment, radios, weapon sights, \ncombat helmets, and individual body armor.\n  Let me cite an article that appeared in yesterday's Washington Post \ncalled ``The Children Of War,'' section C, page 16. There was an \ninterview with the children whose parents are fighting in the Persian \nGulf. One young person points out that her father has been buying other \nsupplies already--a portable hammock, special water pouches, et cetera.\n  That is from a child talking about her parent having to buy his own \nequipment. I don't know of anyone who believes that ought to persist.\n  Now, in response to the Army's request, the committee added $300 \nmillion to the present supplemental request which could be used for \neither this additional equipment or the clearance of weapons and mines \nstill lingering on Iraqi battlefields. It says it right here, in the \nCongressional Record, dated October 1, 2003, when the Supplemental \nAppropriations bill's accompanying report was printed. On page S12222, \nthere is a chart detailing expenditures in the Army Operations and \nMaintenance account. $300 million is to be allocated for ``SAPI body \narmor/Rapid Fielding Initiative or battlefield cleanup.''\n  But the Army says it needs an additional $420 million just to handle \nthe Iraqi battlefield clearance. As the pending legislation stands now, \nthere is still not enough money in the bill to do both, and both \nitems--more safety equipment and Iraqi battlefield clearance--are top \nArmy priorities.\n  I think we need to address both of these issues. For those reasons, I \nhave asked my colleagues to support this amendment to allocate an \nadditional $322 million for the critical equipment of our troops and \nadequate resources for battlefield clearance to fully meet the Army's \ncurrent requirements.\n  The funding in my amendment is fully offset by reductions in some of \nthese reconstruction accounts called emergencies. I want to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to them.\n  Looking at this next chart. I have reprinted items submitted to us by \nthe Administration in their request, entitled ``Coalition Provisional \nAuthority Request to Rehabilitate and Reconstruct Iraq,'' dated \nSeptember 2003. It lists in this supposed emergency budget proposal, \namong other things, $15\n\n[[Page S12352]]\n\nmillion to procure 3,000 computers. That means we are providing \ncomputers at $5,000 a piece. This does not seem reasonable, when you \ncould find a perfectly reasonable computer for $750. I have a lot of \nrespect for what the Iraqis are going through, but I do not know, for \nthe life of me, why you are going to spend around $3,000 to $5,000 per \ncomputer, and $40 million to train them under this so-called emergency \nbudget.\n  You can go down even further on this list, and there are additional \npoints to make. I will not go through all these items because of the \ntime constraints. But my bill takes the money from two or three areas \nto come up with this $250 million to make up the difference between the \n$300 million in the bill and this additional amount to cover both \nbattlefield clearance and the equipment they need.\n  Out of the money the administration has proposed to fund the \nconstruction of two 4,000-bed maximum security prisons, at a cost of \n$400 million--$50,000 per bed in an Iraqi prison--these moneys would be \nin addition to the $99 million also included in that account for the \nrefurbishing and construction of 26 prisons and detention centers that \nexisted under the regime of Saddam Hussein.\n  Even without spending one penny of the $400 million--by the way, we \nrecommend taking $200 million of this, not all the $400 million. Even \nwithout spending one penny of the $400 million for the maximum security \nprisons, the prison capacity in Iraq will be nearly doubled from the \n11,200 to 19,700, thanks to our efforts.\n  The question I would ask--anyone ought to ask--is, Do we really \nbelieve, in a democratic Iraq, there will be a need to imprison three \ntimes more Iraqi citizens than were kept behind bars under Saddam \nHussein?\n  We would be transferring $200 million out of this account, cutting it \nin half--not eliminating all of it. We would also like to take $50 \nmillion out of the $100 million fund for the Iraqi witness protection \nprogram. That is right, there is $100 million listed in the \nAdministration's budget justification materials for the emergency \nsupplemental for witness protection. By the way, that is $100 million \nfor 100 families.\n  Now, the average Iraqi makes $2,200 a year. I don't know what anyone \nis thinking here. And I do not understand how we can provide $1 million \nper family, when we are at the same time not meeting the requirements \nthat our men and women in uniform are lacking.\n  The offsets for my amendment therefore include $50 million from the \nwitness protection program as well as $70 million from the proposals \nfor computers, computer training and even English classes proposed in \nthis so-called emergency budget.\n  There are a lot of emergencies that need to be met, but you are going \nto be hard pressed to convince the American public that doubling the \ncapacity of prisons is an emergency, or providing witness protection at \n$1 million per family, or buying computers at $3,000 each--when we are \nbeing told we cannot provide the necessary resources for our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  In sum, I want to make the point that the Administration's \nsupplemental budget request has simply not been scrubbed sufficiently. \nI do not believe any of my colleagues, if they were sitting down going \nover this in detail, would make a case that in $20 billion of \nconstruction money for Iraq, that a $100 million witness protection \nprogram, $400 million to double or triple the prison cells at $50,000 a \nbed in their prisons, and that $3,000 for computers--and $40 million, \nby the way, is to provide computer training--I would like to see \nsomeone get a $40 million appropriation to provide computer training \nfor anyone else in this country, let alone to do it over in Iraq.\n\n  So these are the areas that we would take money from to provide for \nthe $322 million to provide for the men and women in uniform who need \nthese resources.\n  I mentioned earlier the kind of equipment. I will come back and just \nidentify this for my colleagues. Again, this is not my assessment. This \nis the U.S. Army saying what they need. They need adequate provisions \nfor clean water, additional high-tech backpacks, advanced combat \nhelmets and body armor, additional radios, machine gun sights and \ntripods, M-16 ammunition, high-tech GPS compass equipment, additional \ndesert boots, sun and wind dust goggles and gloves, grappling hooks, \ndoor ramming kits, sniper rifles, binoculars, and special night vision \ngoggles.\n  That is their list. Yet they are being told: Either spend money to \nclear Iraqi battlefields of mines and other dangerous materials or \nreceive effective safety gear. This seems unacceptable. The Army needs \nmoney for both of these line items.\n  And I think we ought to do both. I am saying do both. Do not add to \nthe deficit, just take the $20 billion that we have for the \nreconstruction and go after some of these items that I do not think \nanyone--regardless of where you come out politically.\n  Let us take care of our men and women in uniform going over to Iraq. \nI do not think any of us want to read a story where one of our young \ntroops has to go out and buy their own equipment to protect themselves. \nThis is the 21st century. And in this day and age, the sole superpower \nin the world should not have to tell its military personnel to fend for \nthemselves.\n  So for those reasons, I urge the adoption of the amendment. I \napologize to my colleagues for taking time tonight, but I thought they \nought to understand what was at stake and why I thought this amendment \nwas particularly important.\n  For those reasons, I urge the adoption of the amendment, and I \nwithhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am indeed sorry that the Senator did \nnot discuss it with us further before he offered this amendment. There \nis $26 billion in the 2004 bill the President signed the night before \nlast for the Army. They could reprogram any money they need from the \n$26 billion.\n  We asked them in and we identified the needs in the Army. We took \n$952 million from other services and moved it to the Army. And we \ncovered specific items that they identified in terms of their \npriorities.\n  What Senator Dodd's amendment does, though, is it adds money to \naccounts we have already plused up, and it takes it from money to bring \nthe troops home. He has attacked the exact wrong part of the bill.\n  I wish I had more than 5 minutes, but I do not want to inconvenience \nmy colleagues and keep them here too long tonight. People are missing \nplanes because of this vote. And it is a vote that is duplicitous. It \nreally is designed to reduce the $20.3 billion in the other part of the \naccount.\n  We did get money for these people. We got money for every item that \nis on that list, and in the regular bill they have $26 billion. In \naddition to that, we added $952 million.\n  Now, I have been overseas. I said the other day, I remember going \noverseas, and on the way I bought boots. I did not like my boots. I \nbought shirts. I did not like my shirts. I bought gloves I would rather \nwear. Kids are kids, and they are going to buy what they want. This \nidea that they have to buy armor, armor is available on the basis of \nhow rapidly it is produced. And we have put up money in here, more than \nenough to buy everything to be produced in this time that he mentioned \nbetween now and--what?--about 5 months away.\n  That is special money on top of the $26 billion that they could use \nif they want. It is in the O account. These are O items they are \ntalking about.\n  Now, I do not believe we should do this at this late hour, try to \ntake money out of one account and justify it by virtue of this litany \nof items that we reviewed. We did review it.\n  They brought us this list. The Senator has gone over this list of \nitems that the Army would like to have in addition to what the \nDepartment of Defense gave them. We went over it and we agreed. We \nsaid: $952 million of this you should have had in the go-around in the \nDepartment of Defense. And we took it from the Air Force and from the \nNavy and from the Marines and put it here.\n  What we do miss is we do have $300 million for body armor in the \nrapid fielding initiative, and explosive and ordnance cleanup, $174 \nmillion for damaged equipment. We have $136 million for radios.\n\n[[Page S12353]]\n\n  Now, the Senator mentions this $1 million for families. That is money \nthat may be claimed--may be claimed. We paid $30 million for the people \nwho came in and identified the two sons of Saddam Hussein. It may not \nbe spent at all. It will only be spent if these people come in and \ndisclose people we want to pick up that are worth the cost. What is the \ncost? Moving them out of the country forever. That is taking people and \nbuying them a new life somewhere else because they have exposed \nthemselves to death because they disclosed the location of some of \nthese people.\n\n  I am appalled the Army would ask for this addition. We made an \nagreement with them. We took money from the other three services. And \nsomeone in the Army is going to answer to me. If it is really true \nsomeone in the Army went to the Senator from Connecticut and demanded \nmore money than we gave them, after we gave them $26 billion in the \nregular bill, gave them another $952 million, almost a billion we took \nfrom other services, to come in and make this demand at this time, it \nis absolutely nonsense.\n  Anyone who comes back, I hope they understand they have been brought \nback to answer a political amendment. I am going to move to table it \nwhen the time comes. The Senator from Connecticut is my friend, but I \nhave to tell you, to bring back people who have already gone home, some \nof them who missed planes in order to vote on this amendment at this \ntime, is an absolute absurdity.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will reserve it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Army did not come to me. This is an \nofficial briefing provided by the United States Army Comptroller to \nboth the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees. I am just \nreading what they said. They didn't make an attempt to get in touch \nwith me. Their briefing materials speak for them. They say that there \nis a requirement for $420 million to fund the ordnance disposal on the \nbattlefields still out there, and, in addition, there is a shortfall in \nArmy equipment. That is it plain and simple.\n  What the committee has said is: You can only do one or the other, but \nyou will not have enough money to do both.\n  I am suggesting you ought to be able to do both. To provide the $300 \nmillion, that is great, that helps. But the $300 million doesn't cover \nthe $420 million for the battlefield clearance and for the shortfalls \nthat occurred in this equipment. This is not about allowing service \nmembers to go out and buy shirts and gloves simply that they like. This \nis about equipping our soldiers with the most effective gear available \nto protect them from hostile fire as well as from the intense desert \nclimate. I am not arbitrarily making up figures. The suggestion here is \nwe come up with an additional $322 million to cover both \ncircumstances--that is, the battlefield clearance as well as the \nequipment--and pay for it, by the way, not by readjusting moneys within \nthe defense needs but in the reconstruction side of this supplemental \nrequest, that you can do away or at least delay, if you want, the idea \nof buying computers at $3,000 a copy, a witness protection program at \n$50 million for 50 families, and whether or not you can cut down prison \nconstruction from $400 million to $200 million. With my amendment, \nthere is still plenty of funding to implement the reconstruction plans \nof the Coalition Provisional Authority.\n  I don't know why this is so controversial. Why don't we just accept \nthis amendment? If I did it by not going into these reconstruction \naccounts, they might take it. But because I am talking about a witness \nprotection program and ridiculously high-priced computers and going \nafter excessive prison construction, which I think is hardly an \nemergency, all of a sudden this is a bad amendment and I am a dreadful \nguy for making folks come back and miss a plane.\n\n  I don't want a soldier out there getting hurt because they don't have \nthe right equipment. I didn't make this up. The Army didn't come to me \nspecifically. They made this case on September 26, the source was a \nbriefing provided to Congress' defense committees by the Assistant \nSecretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller, \nentitled, ``FY04 Supplemental Request for the Global War on Terrorism: \nThe Army At War.'' That is where it comes from. I appreciate what the \ncommittee did with $300 million. But the committee report says you have \nto make a choice: Clearing up the battlefield or provide funding for \nsoldiers' equipment. And I don't think the Army ought to be put in that \nposition. I don't think you ought to ask them to have to make that \nchoice. That is the reason for the amendment.\n  Again, I am sorry people have to come back and vote. That is not my \nintention. But I, in good conscience, believe this is a responsible \namendment. I would have thought it might be accepted instead of making \na lot more out of this than has to be the case. We all agree they ought \nto get the equipment. Why not just agree to the amendment? If you want \nto table the amendment, put people on record saying they would rather \nspend money on a witness protection program at $1 million a family in \nIraq when the average family makes $2,200 a year, you explain that to \nthe American taxpayer, why an Iraqi family would get $1 million in \nwitness protection. That is ridiculous.\n  Spending $3,000 for a computer and $400 million to create new prison \noperations over there is not an emergency need. You make the choice \nwhether or not you think that is more important than seeing these young \npeople get what they need. I stand by the amendment. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The yeas and nays are not ordered until I speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are in order at this time.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have not yielded back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not a motion to table. The yeas and nays \ncan be requested at any time.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the moment there is not a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that is good for me. If you want to have \na quorum, go right ahead. Go right ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I renew my request. I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to point out the Army has all of \nthis money in this supplemental without any directions in the bill. The \nline items the Senator mentions are specified in our report. They have \nentire discretion to use any money in this bill for the moneys he has \nasked for. But he wants to take it from the other money. This is a \nduplicitous amendment to take money from the second part of the bill \nand put it in the first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska's time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A motion to table has been made.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the motion to table amendment No. 1817.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nCampbell), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), the Senator from \nMississippi (Mr. Lott), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum), \nand the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the obligation and expenditure of funds for using \n   procedures other than full and open competition for entering into \n     certain contracts or other agreements for the benefit of Iraq)\n\n       On page 39, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 3002. (a) None of the funds appropriated by this Act \n     may be obligated or expended by the head of an executive \n     agency for payments under any contract or other agreement \n     described in subsection (b) that is not entered into with \n     full and open competition unless, not later than 30 days \n     after the date on which the contract or other agreement is \n     entered into, such official--\n       (1) submits a report on the contract or other agreement to \n     the Committees on Armed Services, on Governmental Affairs, \n     and on Appropriations of the Senate, and the Committees on \n     Armed Services, on Government Reform, and on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives; and\n       (2) publishes such report in the Federal Register and the \n     Commerce Business Daily.\n       (b) This section applies to any contract or other agreement \n     in excess of $1,000,000 that is entered into with any public \n     or private sector entity for any of the following purposes:\n       (1) To build or rebuild physical infrastructure of Iraq.\n       (2) To establish or reestablish a political or societal \n     institution of Iraq.\n       (3) To provide products or services to the people of Iraq.\n       (4) To perform personnel support services in Iraq, \n     including related construction and procurement of products, \n     in support of members of the Armed Forces and United States \n     civilian personnel.\n       (c) The report on a contract or other agreement of an \n     executive agency under subsection (a) shall include the \n     following information:\n       (1) The amount of the contract or other agreement.\n       (2) A brief discussion of the scope of the contract or \n     other agreement.\n       (3) A discussion of how the executive agency identified, \n     and solicited offers from, potential contractors to perform \n     the contract, together with a list of the potential \n     contractors that were issued solicitations for the offers.\n       (4) The justification and approval documents on which was \n     based the determination to use procedures other than \n     procedures that provide for full and open competition.\n       (d) The limitation on use of funds in subsection (a) shall \n     not apply in the case of any contract or other agreement \n     entered into by the head of an executive agency for which \n     such official--\n       (1) either--\n       (A) withholds from publication and disclosure as described \n     in such subsection any document or other collection of \n     information that is classified for restricted access in \n     accordance with an Executive order in the interest of \n     national defense or foreign policy; or\n       (B) redacts any part so classified that is in a document or \n     other collection of information not so classified before \n     publication and disclosure of the document or other \n     information as described in such subsection; and\n       (2) transmits an unredacted version of the document or \n     other collection of information, respectively, to the \n     chairman and ranking member of each of the Committees on \n     Governmental Affairs and on Appropriations of the Senate, the \n     Committees on Government Reform and on Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives, and the committees that the head of \n     such executive agency determines has legislative jurisdiction \n     for the operations of such executive agency to which the \n     document or other collection of information relates.\n       (e)(1)(A) In the case of any contract or other agreement \n     for which the Secretary of Defense determines that it is \n     necessary to do so in the national security interests of the \n     United States, the Secretary may waive the limitation in \n     subsection (a), but only on a case-by-case basis.\n       (B) For each contract or other agreement for which the \n     Secretary of Defense grants a waiver under this paragraph, \n     the Secretary shall submit a notification of the contract or \n     other agreement and the grant of the waiver, together with a \n     discussion of the justification for the waiver, to the \n     committees of Congress named in subsection (a)(1).\n       (2)(A) In the case of any contract or other agreement for \n     which the Director of Central Intelligence determines that it \n     is necessary to do so in the national security interests of \n     the United States related to intelligence, the Director may \n     waive the limitation in subsection (a), but only on a case-\n     by-case basis.\n       (B) For each contract or other agreement for which the \n     Director of Central Intelligence grants a waiver under this \n     paragraph, the Director shall submit a notification of the \n     contract or other agreement and of the grant of the waiver, \n     together with a discussion of the justification for the \n     waiver, to the Select Committee on Intelligence, the \n     Committee on Appropriations, and the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate and to the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on \n     Appropriations, and the Committee on Governmental Reform of \n     the House of Representatives.\n       (f) Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting \n     obligations to disclose United States Government information \n     under any other provision of law.\n       (g) In this section--\n       (1) the term ``full and open competition'' has the meaning \n     given such term in section 4 of the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403);\n       (2) the term ``executive agency'' has the meaning given \n     such term in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, and \n     includes the Coalition Provisional Authority for Iraq; and\n       (3) the term ``Coalition Provisional Authority for Iraq'' \n     means the entity charged by the President with directing \n     reconstruction efforts in Iraq.\n\n\n[[Page S12355]]\n\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. The amendment my colleague from Oregon and I are \noffering tonight requires the use of full and open competition for the \naward of contracts under this bill to support our military or related \nto the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  Competitive bidding ensures the taxpayer gets the very best value for \nhis investment. It also enhances public confidence that contracts are \nawarded in a manner that is fair and transparent, a process that allows \nall qualified bidders to submit bids for the contract.\n  This principle of full and open competition is enshrined in the \nCompetition and Contracting Act, which is current law.\n  Under that law, contracts must generally be bid under full or open \ncompetition unless one of seven exemptions is invoked.\n  Unfortunately, however, some of the contracts that have been awarded \nto date, both to support our military in Iraq and to begin \nreconstruction efforts, have not been awarded using full and open \ncompetition. The contracting process has been curtailed.\n  We want to make sure the general rule is competitive bidding, and, if \nthere are cases where there are legitimate reasons for curtailing \ncompetition--say, for reasons of national security--then we believe \nthere should be a process in place that requires a justification for \ncurtailing competition and disclosure of that fact.\n  Generally, under our amendment, if competition is not used in the \naward of a contract, the agency involved would have to justify the \nreason for invoking an exception to competition and report that in the \nCommerce Business Daily, the Federal Register, and to the appropriate \ncommittees of Congress. We recognize there may be a few cases where it \nis so secret, it is so classified, that disclosure in the Commerce \nBusiness Daily and the Federal Register would not be appropriate. In \nthose cases, we provide for an alternative form of notifying Congress.\n  Our amendment will bring accountability and sunshine to the \ncompetition and contracting process. I urge my colleagues to support \nour amendment.\n  It has been a great pleasure to work with my colleague, Senator \nWyden. We have made a number of efforts in this regard. I believe this \namendment should enjoy widespread support.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have enjoy working with my colleague from \nMaine over the last 5 or 6 months.\n  This amendment is especially important because it would mean for the \nfirst time the Congress is going to restrict the funds under this \neffort for reconstruction to only those contracts let in an open and \ncompetitive bid, except in very narrow circumstances.\n  In my view, much of the work to rebuild Iraq has been outsourced to \nprivate companies and it is now time, with this legislation, to end the \noutsourcing of accountability. What our constituents have said is: How \nmuch is this whole effort going to cost? How long is it going to take? \nAnd how is this money going to be spent?\n  As I have said, my view is that right now the contracting process \nlooks a little like Dodge City before the marshall showed up. It seems \nvery influential companies and others seem to write the rules that the \nUnited States is essentially in the dark. Then the news media comes out \nand highlights various concerns, most of which the Senate does not know \nmuch about, and there is a flurry of activity and people discuss \nwhether or not the contract is going to be rebid.\n  What Senator Collins and I would like to do is establish some \nbipartisan order and go back, as the Senator from Maine has said, to \nthe principles that the Competition and Contracting Act have been all \nabout. Yes, $87 billion is a jaw-dropping sum of money. The Coalition \nProvisional Authority, the World Bank, and the U.N. have estimated--it \nwas in the Wall Street Journal today--that it will take $56 billion \nover just the next 5 years for rebuilding in Iraq.\n  It seems to me it does not pass the smell test to allow this process \nwhere the Congress is in the dark, the American people are in the dark, \nand every Member of the Senate goes home and faces constituents who \nsay, We want this process to work a little bit like our family finances \ndo. Right now, a family makes purchases, they get a bank statement. For \nexample, they spend X amount of dollars at Sears, they spend more at \nthe grocery store, they pay for essentials, and get a bank statement \nshowing what they spent. That is a process that is straightforward, \nthat can be monitored. We look at the bank statement for Iraq; it is \nessentially devoid of specifics.\n  Senator Collins and I have tried to approach this on a bipartisan \nbasis. People may think it is a quaint idea, but we believe in \ncompetition. We believe that transparency and disclosure works and it \ngets taxpayers the most for their money.\n  This amendment for the first time actually puts in place a funding \nrestriction. In the past, Senator Collins and I have said we are \nwilling to look at various approaches that involve reports after the \nfact. Now we are waiting for all of these investigations and inquiries \nto move at glacial speed.\n  What Senator Collins has said is--and I agree with her point \ncompletely--what we need now is some legislation with teeth in it. This \nfunding restriction for the first time provides that.\n  We are very pleased to be able to come to the Senate, given the fact \nthere have been a number of instances already where contracts were let \nwithout competitive bid or with only limited bidding. We have had a \nnumber of colleagues involved, colleagues from both parties.\n  I particularly commend Senator Clinton, who has been my partner on \nthe Democratic side. I also note that Senator Enzi has been very \nsupportive of this effort. He joins this cause as well. Our thanks to \nSenator Clinton, Senator Enzi, and many other Senators who have been \ninvolved in this effort.\n  Tonight, it seems to me, the Senate is saying: We will do it \ndifferently. We will draw a line in the sand. The Senate is no longer \ngoing to be in the dark with respect to this issue. I am very pleased \nwe will be able to go home for this recess and say that at a time when \nthe American people are looking for some concrete specifics with \nrespect to the pricetag on this legislation and where the money exactly \nis going to go, we can say that because of this bipartisan amendment, \nfor the first time the Senate is going to restrict these funds so as to \npromote open and competitive bidding and the kind of transparency that \nbest makes free markets work.\n  I reserve the remainder of any time I have remaining. I also thank \nthe chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee who has had strong \nviews on this issue and has worked closely with Senator Collins and me \nover almost 6 months. We appreciate the fact that now we have \nlegislation with some real teeth in it to make sure the taxpayers get \nvalue for their money in the contracting process.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I may speak for a moment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will be happy to accept this amendment. It has been \nmodified, as has been indicated. I want to state to the Senate, \nhowever, although the Senators are correct, this adds to existing law.\n  Existing law at the current time requires competitive bidding on \ncontracts. The contracts that are outstanding now that have been \nentered into by the United States and its entities in Iraq have been \nlet on the basis of competitive bids. There have been lots of questions \nraised about that, but some of the contracts were outstanding before \nthe contractors were sent to Iraq, and they were general services \ncontracts, and those were extended to Iraq. But we are now putting, as \nthe two Senators mentioned, additional emphasis on that, and I am \npleased to accept the amendment on behalf of the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield back my time if the Senator from \nOregon will also yield back his time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there is no further debate, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1820) was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S12356]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, now Senator Daschle and Senator Graham \nwill present their amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1816\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that members of the Ready Reserve of the Armed \n Forces are treated equitably in the provision of health care benefits \n     under TRICARE and otherwise under the Defense Health Program)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. \n1816.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for Mr. \n     Daschle, for himself and Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Bond, Mr. Burns, Mr. Warner, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Chambliss proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1816.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina and I \nhave been negotiating and working with the distinguished manager of the \nbill regarding an amendment we have been attempting to pass now over \nthe course of this entire session of Congress.\n  Our view has been from the very beginning that members of the \nNational Guard and Reserves need the opportunity to have access to \nTRICARE health insurance. And now, on three occasions, the Senate has \nbeen on record--with increasing numbers--in support of this concept, \nthis idea that TRICARE ought to be offered to members of the Guard and \nReserves.\n  We have been gratified with the strong bipartisan support that has \nbeen indicated with each one of the votes. Our concern, however, is it \ndoes not do us much good to continue to pass these measures on the \nSenate floor only to see the amendments dropped by the time they get to \nconference.\n  We want to pass something into law. We want something to be provided \nto as many of these members of the Guard and Reserves as we possibly \ncan this year. So in trying to figure out what might work best, and in \nworking with the distinguished Senator from Alaska, we have concluded \nperhaps the best way to do this is to ensure we go to those people who \nneed it the most, that is, those members of the Guard and Reserves who \nhave no health insurance today, and that when members of the Guard and \nReserves are called up to active duty, they also are compensated for \nthe TRICARE insurance that would be provided to them while they are on \nactive duty.\n  Now, we will say from the very beginning this is not what we would \nlike. We would like to do more, but we know that doing something is \nbetter than doing nothing if, in the end, that is what happens.\n  So I first thank the distinguished Senator from South Carolina for \nhis tenacity and persistence. He has done an outstanding job in working \non this issue and has provided great leadership. He has been a very \nhelpful partner. I also say there are Senators on my side of the aisle, \nSenator Leahy in particular, and Senator Clinton, who have been \nespecially helpful in this effort. So I appreciate very much the \nSenator from Alaska working with us. I am satisfied this is a \nreasonable compromise.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I will try to be brief.\n  We have a great team defending America right now. That team is made \nup of active-duty members who have made a decision to serve 4 years or \nmaybe have a career in the military. But that team is supplemented by \nthe Guard and Reserves. There are 224,000 Guard and Reserve members \ncalled up to active duty and, working together, they are doing a great \njob defending our freedom. It is time to look anew at the role the \nGuard and Reserves play.\n  I say to Senator Daschle, I want to publicly thank him for making \nthis possible because he has been great to work with, and Senator \nDeWine. I think we have been a pretty good team here on the floor. We \ndisagree on a lot, and there will be a lot of fussing and fighting \nbefore this bill is over with, but that is the American way. It is OK \nto express our differences. It is great to be able to tell people you \ndisagree. There are a lot of countries where there are not many ways to \nexpress your disagreements. But one of the things we have done tonight, \nand I think in the spirit of the country, is to come together to \nsupport our men and women who serve.\n  So why do we need this? One-fourth of the Guard and Reserves are on \nactive duty now, with more to come. We need to acknowledge the obvious. \nThey will be asked to do more, not less, over the coming months and \nyears. Why? The cold war model of having tanks in the Fulda Gap and a \nlarge nuclear deterrent force standing up against the former Soviet \nUnion, that war, thank goodness, is in the history books for the most \npart.\n  The new war, the war on terrorism, has a totally different dynamic. \nThe Guard and Reserves, which were tangential, to be honest with you, \nin the cold war are in the forefront of this war on terrorism. Most of \nyour military police are guards and reservists. Seventy-five percent of \nthe aircrews flying C-130s--and I know our Presiding Officer knows this \nbecause we took nine trips in the theater of Afghanistan and Iraq. \nEight of the crews are Guard crews, one is a Reserve crew. Seventy-five \npercent of the people flying C-130s are Guard and Reserves. Fifty-five \npercent of the people flying airlift to get the supplies and resources \ninto the region to protect our troops and help them survive are \nreservists. Almost 90 percent of the intelligence service for the Army \nis in the Reserves, 90 percent is civil affairs Reserves. It is growing \nby leaps and bounds.\n  What we are trying to do tonight is provide a better benefit package \nthan they have had before because we are going to ask so much of the \nGuard and Reserves.\n  Senator Stevens made this possible. We have passed two bills by 80-\nplus votes, but there is no money behind it. For all those who follow \nthe Senate, they know who is in charge of the money. Senator Stevens \nmade this possible because we are putting money behind the bill.\n  What does that mean? It is no longer talk. Twenty percent--2 out of \n10 people--who are Guard and Reserves are without health care. This \nbill immediately will allow them to have health care year round. They \nwill pay a premium like a retiree would pay, but they will have health \ncare by being a member of the Guard or Reserves.\n  We need to do more, and we will. The problem of a Guard or Reserve \nfamily goes like this: If you are called up to active duty for a year, \nyou go into the military health care system called TRICARE. If you have \nhealth care in the private sector, most times--almost all the time--\nyour physician network is replaced. You go from the private health care \nsector to the military health care sector. And when you get \ndeactivated, you change, and there is no continuity of health care. \nThirty percent of the people called to active duty were unable to be \ndeployed because of health care problems.\n\n  We are not done yet. There is more to do. It is my goal, my hope, my \ndream, for the Guard and Reserve forces that if you will join, and you \nwill participate, and you will help defend America as a guard or \nreservist, we will offer you full-time health care. You pay a premium, \nbut you and your family will be taken care of in the health care area. \nI think it is the least we could do. I think it is what we should do. \nAnd tonight is a huge step forward.\n  I thank all of the Senators who made it possible. The fussing, the \nfighting yet to come on this bill is part of America. But let it be \nsaid at about 8:50 at night, Republicans and Democrats came together to \nhelp Guard and Reserve members. When you are in a war, they do not ask \nyou if you are a Republican or a Democrat. They are asking you to do \nyour job. So I am honored to be part of this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel and Senator Allen be added \nas cosponsors.\n\n[[Page S12357]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I thank the Chair.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I do not know--I haven't seen the list of \ncosponsors--but if they are not listed, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Leahy, Reid, and Clinton be added as cosponsors.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have worked on this amendment. There \nis a vast problem out there among Guard and Reserve people. We have a \ntotal force now in our military. We passed the concept that the Guard \nand Reserves are replacements for the regular services when they are \nsent overseas. The Guard and Reserves are sent overseas almost as much \nas the regular members of our military. They have volunteered to defend \nus, as the Senators have said. Their families need the same protection \nthat we offer to those who volunteer in the regular services.\n  We have modified this amendment because we really basically want to \nsee what happens when this change takes place. The cost of this \namendment that we have put forward is approximately $400 million this \nyear and by the following year it will be $500 million. We don't know \nhow much it will really cost because we don't know how many will come \nforward and take this, as compared to what they are doing now as far as \ntheir medical is concerned. It is a contributory system for TRICARE, \nanother experiment that we hope we will be able to get some track \nrecord on.\n  As I have become more familiar with the National Guard, it is very \nstrong, and the Reserves, also. We want to assure that people will \ncontinue to maintain an interest in joining the Guard and Reserves. \nMost people don't understand that the transition from Guard and \nReserves to regular services has reversed history. In days gone by, \npeople came out of the military and entered the Guard and Reserves. \nToday many people enter the Guard and Reserves and then decide they are \ngoing to try to become career military. This will be an added \ninducement to get more people to enlist in the Guard and Reserves. It \nmight have a reverse effect and we are not sure of that yet. This will \ngive us a track record.\n  I am pleased to say that we have conferred with members of the Armed \nServices Committee on this amendment, and they have agreed we should go \nforward with it.\n  I am pleased to accept the amendment on behalf of the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I want to add one thing. There was an \narticle in USA Today yesterday: ``Army Reserve Fears Troop Exodus.'' \nThe Army National Guard is 15,000 below its recruiting goal. ``Soldiers \nare `stressed' on yearlong deployments.'' I really honestly believe \nthat this benefit made available will help retention and recruitment \nbecause the problems with these deployments are coming down the road. \nThe further we can get ahead of this by beefing up the benefit package, \nthe better America will be.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the article to which I referred in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Army Reserve Fears Troop Exodus\n\n                            (By Dave Moniz)\n\n       If the United States is unable to recruit significantly \n     more international troops or quell the violence in Iraq in \n     the next few months, it could trigger an exodus of active and \n     reserve forces, the head of the U.S. Army Reserve said \n     Monday.\n       Lt. Gen. James Helmly, chief of the 205,000-member Army \n     Reserve, said he and other Pentagon leaders will be \n     monitoring retention rates closely next year, when problems \n     could begin to become apparent for full-time and part-time \n     soldiers coming off long tours of duty in Iraq.\n       ``Retention is what I am most worried about. It is my No. 1 \n     concern,'' Helmly told USA TODAY's editorial board. ``This is \n     the first extended-duration war the country has fought with \n     an all-volunteer force.''\n       Helmly described the war on terrorism as an unprecedented \n     test of the 30-year-old all-volunteer military. Historically, \n     he said, the National Guard and Reserve were designed to \n     mobilize for big wars and then bring soldiers home quickly.\n       Today, he said, they have ``entered a brave new world'' \n     where large numbers of troops will have to be deployed for \n     long periods.\n       Counting training time and yearlong tours in Iraq, some \n     Army Reserve soldiers could be mobilized for 15 months or \n     more. Helmly described the situation facing soldiers in Iraq \n     as ``stressed'' but said he could not characterize it as at a \n     ``breaking point.''\n       The stresses facing the nation's reservists were \n     demonstrated again this week when the National Guard \n     announced it had alerted a combat brigade from Washington \n     state that it could be sent to Iraq next year if a third \n     block of international troops cannot be recruited to join the \n     British and Polish-led divisions now in Iraq.\n       Guard officials said Monday that the 5,000-member 81st Army \n     National Guard brigade from Washington state has been \n     notified that it could be called to active duty.\n       Helmly said a huge factor in Iraq will be the Pentagon's \n     ability to train an Iraqi army and security force.\n       The Defense Department recently announced plans to \n     accelerate the development of an Iraqi army, pushing the goal \n     from 12,000 troops to 40,000 troops in the next year.\n       The Army National Guard and Army Reserve have about one-\n     fourth of their troops--nearly 129,000 soldiers--on active \n     duty.\n       The active-duty Army and the Army Reserve both met their \n     recruiting goals for the fiscal year that ends today. The \n     Army National Guard, however, is expected to fall about 15% \n     short of its recruiting goal of 62,000 soldiers.\n       Although the Guard and Reserve say their retention rates \n     have not suffered this year, the figures could be misleading. \n     Under an order known as ``stop loss,'' soldiers on active \n     duty are prohibited from leaving the service until their \n     tours end.\n       Active-duty and Reserve commanders fear that when U.S. \n     soldiers on yearlong rotations come home next year, many will \n     choose to leave the service.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Mr. \n     Bayh, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 1812, \n     as modified.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the amount provided for the Army for procurement \n  of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, to require an Army \nreevaluation of requirements and options for procuring armored security \n                  vehicles, and to provide an offset)\n\n       On page 22, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       Sec. 316. (a) Of the funds provided in this title under the \n     heading ``Iraq Freedom Fund'', up to $191,100,000 be \n     available for the procurement of up-armored High Mobility \n     Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles in addition to the number of \n     such vehicles for which funds are provided within the amount \n     specified under such heading.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to ensure that \nour troops in Iraq and other dangerous areas throughout the world, many \nof whom are Reservists and members of the National Guard, have the \nequipment they need to protect themselves. In particular, I would like \nto discuss the uparmored Humvees which soldiers need to protect \nthemselves from the threat of RPGs and mines and weapons that are \ninflicting casualties today as we speak in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S12359]]\n\n  To effectively carry out the mission, Army officials have said that \nthey need more Humvees, uparmored Humvees. I believe them. The \nadministration in this bill failed to fully meet that request.\n  My amendment is designed to meet the needs of the Army today as they \nface these numerous threats around the globe. The amendment is \ncosponsored by Senators Bayh and Kennedy. It would add funding to this \nsupplemental request to buy additional uparmored Humvees and would also \ndirect the Army to reevaluate its requirements for the armored security \nvehicle.\n  The HMMWV, or high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle, better \nknown as the Humvee, is the workhorse of the United States. It is being \nused around the globe today in conflicts from Afghanistan to Iraq to \nthe Balkans. The uparmored Humvee is a variation of the basic vehicle. \nIt was designed to offer increased protection to troops from small arms \nfire, rocket-propelled grenades, and blasts from mines.\n  It was designed primarily for military police and special operations \npersonnel, exactly the type of soldiers being called upon to do very \ndangerous missions in Iraq today.\n  The armored security vehicle, or the ASV, is also a vehicle in the \nArmy inventory. It is designed to complement the uparmored Humvee. \nThere are very few of them, but it is a requirement that I believe the \nArmy should study again.\n  In July, I visited Iraq and had the opportunity to meet with my \nconstituents from the Rhode Island National Guard, the 115th Military \nPolice Company, and 119th Military Police Company, the 118th Military \nPolice Battalion. It was on the tarmac at Baghdad International \nAirport. I got off the aircraft with my colleagues. I rushed over to \nthe formation of these military police men and women. I began to speak \nwith them. The first request that I got was repeated several times \nover: We need uparmored Humvees. We are in a dangerous situation. We \nare patrolling the roads of Iraq. We see other units with these \nvehicles. We need them.\n\n  When I came back to the United States, I was convinced that we needed \nmore uparmored Humvees. In the intervening weeks, the Rhode Island \nNational Guard, 115th Military Police Company, has lost three soldiers. \nTwo were killed when an improvised explosive device, a 155-millimeter \nshell, exploded underneath their regular Humvee. No one can determine \nwhether or not an uparmored Humvee would have saved the lives of these \ntwo soldiers, Staff Sergeant Joseph Camara and Sergeant Charles \nCaldwell. I know having such a vehicle would add to the confidence and \nsecurity of the troops.\n  A few days ago Specialist Michael Andrade of the 115th Military \nPolice was killed, again in a Humvee in an accident involving a convoy \noperation in which a tanker truck crashed into his vehicle. Last Monday \nevening I was there in Rhode Island when they brought Specialist \nAndrade's body home to his family. This Saturday he will be buried in \nRhode Island. I know you can't determine whether or not this type of \nvehicle would have saved this young soldier's life. But I can tell you, \nif they had a choice, all of our military police, all of our soldiers \nin Iraq would prefer to be in an uparmored Humvee than a Humvee without \nthe armor, and their families would make that choice, also.\n  It is clear that we need more. This bill contains more vehicles. I \ncommend the President for that proposal. I believe we need more than \neven what is included in this bill.\n  When I returned from Iraq, I wrote to Secretary Rumsfeld. I also \ncalled the Army. At that time I was verbally told by the Army that the \nrequirement for additional Humvees was about 500. But then as the \nsummer wore on, several things became apparent. This insurgency was \nextremely serious and extremely lethal. Also that the requirement for \nuparmored Humvees was going up. Indeed, I believe--I have said this \nbefore--that we could be involved and will likely be involved in Iraq \nfor years, not months, stretching perhaps to 10 years. These are the \ntypes of vehicles that are crucial to effective operation in an \noccupation force as we have in Iraq.\n\n  Now, my initial response from the Army was that they need 500 more. \nBy September 8, the Army sent a formal response indicating that the \nrequirement now is 1,723 uparmored Humvees and 1,461 will be sent \nimmediately to the theater. I commend the Army because they have tried \ntheir best to move as many available vehicles into the theater of Iraq \nas possible.\n  Now, 619 vehicles were coming off the assembly line and being sent \ndirectly to Iraq; 430 were being pulled from units in the United States \nand Europe; another 412 were pulled out of the Balkans. So we are \ntrying to meet the need in Iraq, but we are doing it by taking these \nvehicles from other potentially dangerous areas, such as the Balkans. \nAlso, vehicles were taken from the units in the United States--we hope \nthey are training on these vehicles in preparation to go overseas.\n  I believe indeed that this requirement will increase, and in fact \nwhat we have seen throughout the course of the last several months is \nthe Army and the Department of Defense seriously reevaluating the need \nfor uparmored Humvees. They have concluded that these uparmored Humvees \nare indeed necessary.\n  We have received information that the Army in fact has a requirement \nin excess of 3,400 vehicles. Again, just a few weeks ago, the \nrequirement was 1,700; now the requirement is 3,400 vehicles. They say \nthe best way to accommodate future funding for increased production \nwould be to use the Iraqi Freedom Fund. I propose to do that. In fact, \nOSD has concurred with this approach. The Secretary of Defense has \nconcurred. What we are waiting on is a validation of how many of these \nvehicles can be produced at the assembly point.\n  So my amendment is straightforward. It requests additional money in \nthe amount of approximately $191 million from the Iraqi Freedom Fund to \nbuy 800 additional vehicles, or so many as may be acquired with that \nmoney. In fact, I hope we can, in the next year, buy even more. The \nanalysis by myself and my staff suggests this money would be sufficient \nto fully operate the production line and get all the vehicles possible \nthat we need.\n  The Iraqi Freedom Fund in this bill contains $1.9 billion, so there \nare sufficient resources. I believe we should do this and we should do \nit promptly. The indication from the Army is that they need the \nvehicles, and also if we act in this appropriations bill, we can speed \nthose vehicles to Iraq.\n  As I said earlier, there is another aspect of this, and that is the \narmored security vehicle. We are asking the Army to look back at this \nrequirement and reevaluate it.\n  I will conclude by taking the advice of Secretary Rumsfeld that it is \nnot necessary to listen to the media but listen to the soldiers. I have \na letter from a young lieutenant in Afghanistan. Here is what he \nwrites:\n\n       I am the leader of one platoon of many here trained \n     Stateside for dismounted missions and handed uparmored \n     Humvees upon arrival at our firebases. My strong NCO's have \n     adapted and worked hard to train on this different platform. \n     I feel it is criminal, however, to have sent so many units \n     here without Stateside training on either the . . . uparmored \n     Humvee or its complementary weapon, the MK-19 auto grenade \n     launcher and M2 .50 caliber machine gun.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Our mechanics, for example, have no experience with the \n     uparmored Humvees and are too few to fix vehicles which have \n     been driven hard for at least 18 months on the awful \n     ``roads'' here. Without vehicles, we have no mobility. \n     Without mobility, we cannot either protect the reconstruction \n     teams or interdict terrorists/criminals intent on rocketing \n     our bases and mining the roads.\n\n  That is the viewpoint of one of these magnificent young soldiers in \nAfghanistan working with the vehicles. He appreciates the value of the \nvehicles. I think every soldier, every squad that has missions like \nthis, whether in Afghanistan or Iraq, should have these vehicles, and \nthat is the intent of this amendment. Further, I will add that one of \nthe suggestions to me in his letter is:\n\n       Purchase new uparmored Humvees for Afghanistan to replace \n     the ones about to die or send qualified mechanics with the \n     requisite parts to fix them.\n\n  That could be written by any soldier in Afghanistan or Iraq, and \nindeed there are many in Iraq, particularly, that do not even have \naccess to\n\n[[Page S12360]]\n\nuparmored Humvees. I will conclude by thanking the chairman and the \nstaff for their assistance on this amendment. I also thank the chairman \nsincerely not only for this effort but for almost $900 million of \nadditional funding for the Army, for vests, for a host of equipment. I \nalso understand from our discussion that he feels as strongly as I do \nabout this issue and will do his best in conference to ensure these \nadditional Humvees are provided.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. We funded in this \nbill what we thought were a number of these upgraded Humvees that could \nbe produced and were the stated demand of the Army at that time. This \ndemand keeps going up as it is realized how much these Humvees need to \nbe modernized. We have changed to deal with the circumstances in Iraq. \nThey are very interesting modifications. We have both been briefed on \nthem. Some of the modifications are still classified.\n  It is our intention to fund it. Coming out of conference, I will do \nmy utmost to fund the number of Humvees that can be upgraded in a \nreasonable period ahead of time so we can meet this demand so that \nevery group of the military that needs Humvees for their protection \nwill be modernized and upgraded for self-protection. They do have to \nhave some additional items. There are methods some of the terrorists \nhave used to destroy Humvees that can't be defended against.\n  So it is our intention to modernize these Humvees. They were not \ndefective. Some of the methods terrorists use are unique. We need \nadditional protection from above, and from the side, and from the rear, \nand underneath the Humvees. We cannot turn them completely into \nshockproof tanks, but we are going to do our best. This is a No. 1 \npriority for the Senate, as far as I am concerned--that and the problem \nof finding these weapons caches and destroying them, or really making \ncertain that the usable weapons, particularly hand-held weapons, are \nput under guard and assured that they will not get in the wrong hands.\n  I thank the Senator for his willingness to accept our modifications, \nand I assure him we will keep on top of this. We will confer with the \nSenator because I know of his distinguished Army career. We are pleased \nto have his assistance on this matter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1812), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1808\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for Mr. \nVoinovich and Mr. Lott.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Voinovich \n     and Mr. Lott, proposes an amendment numbered 1808.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require a report on efforts to increase financial \n contributions from the international community for reconstruction in \n    Iraq and the feasibility of repayment of funds contributed for \n                    infrastructure projects in Iraq)\n\n       On page 38, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec. 2313. Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to Congress \n     a report on the efforts of the Government of the United \n     States to increase the resources contributed by foreign \n     countries and international organizations to the \n     reconstruction of Iraq and the feasibility of repayment of \n     funds contributed for infrastructure projects in Iraq. The \n     report shall include--\n       (1) a description of efforts by the Government of the \n     United States to increase the resources contributed by \n     foreign countries and international organizations to the \n     reconstruction of Iraq;\n       (2) an accounting of the funds contributed to assist in the \n     reconstruction of Iraq, disaggregated by donor;\n       (3) an assessment of the effect that--\n       (A) the bilateral debts incurred during the regime of \n     Saddam Hussein have on Iraq's ability to finance essential \n     programs to rebuild infrastructure and restore critical \n     public services, including health care and education, in \n     Iraq; and\n       (B) forgiveness of such debts would have on the \n     reconstruction and long-term prosperity in Iraq;\n       (4) a description of any commitment by a foreign country or \n     international organization to forgive any part of a debt owed \n     by Iraq if such debt was incurred during the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein; and\n       (5) an assessment of the feasibility of repayment by Iraq--\n       (A) of bilateral debts incurred during the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein; and\n       (B) of the funds contributed by the United States to \n     finance infrastructure projects in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an amendment we discussed earlier \non the floor. I was ready to offer it earlier but was prevented. The \namendment would require a report from the President concerning the \nefforts of the United States to increase resources that are available \nin Iraq from other countries, and to do other matters, such as a \ndescription of the bilateral impact on the Iraq action, the question of \nforgiveness of debts, and other items that we believe are substantial \nand on which we should have a report from the administration. These \nreports request no later than 120 days.\n\n  I will state for the information of the Senate, there are several \namendments we are looking at that deal with reports. It is my hope that \nthe conference committee will have a report section. I see in some of \nthese amendments not a conflict but an overlapping of requests, and the \ntiming of them is different. I do not believe we should put a \nrequirement on these people to report one week on one item, another \nweek on another item, and another week on another item when they are \nall related. We should have quarterly reports from the administration \non what is going on with both sections of this bill and how the money \nis being handled.\n  This is a bill that has considerable discretion because it is a \nsupplemental bill. It is in addition to the enormous bill we passed and \nthe President already signed. Therefore, there is a lot of discretion \nas to where the money goes. It is a mechanism to avoid what has been \ndone in the past, as I have said repeatedly.\n  In the past, Presidents have dipped into the money available to the \nDepartment of Defense and have used it in other places. We have taken \nthe occasion to provide the money in advance and have allowed \ndiscretion of the President to put it in the places where it is needed \nand tell us 5 days before that happens and report to us later on how \nthe money was actually used. Those reports will come to us. I am sure \nwe will keep very good track of the people's money as we proceed.\n  Mr. President, so far as I am concerned, that is the last item to be \nconsidered tonight.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1808.\n  The amendment (No. 1808) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the leader will shortly make a statement \nconcerning the bill. As the manager of the bill, we have an \nunderstanding that tomorrow there will be a period during which \nSenators may bring amendments to the floor and offer them so they will \nbe in the queue, so to speak. There will be no consideration of any \namendment tomorrow and no vote on any amendment tomorrow.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I voted for the McConnell amendment, as \nmodified, because I believe that it is appropriate to recognize and \ncommend the men and women of our Armed Forces for their bravery, \nprofessionalism and dedication during the military campaigns in \nAfghanistan and Iraq; to honor the sacrifice of those who died or were \nwounded and to convey our deepest sympathy and condolences to their \nfamilies and friends; and to support the efforts of communities across \nthe Nation who are honoring our troops.\n  Although I voted for the amendment, I want to make clear that I have \nsome reservations about some parts of it. For example, I do not believe \nthat the planning for the post-Saddam portion of the military campaign \nin Iraq was done well. Additionally, I want to note my concern that \nthere may be unacceptable profiteering by some contractors in the post-\nSaddam period in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S12361]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12350-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12350-S12361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN SECURITY \n                AND RECONSTRUCTION ACT, 2004--Continued\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 1818 and 1819, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1817\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1817.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide an additional $322,000,000 for safety equipment \nfor United States forces in Iraq and to reduce the amount provided for \n                reconstruction in Iraq by $322,000,000)\n\n       On page 2, line 20, strike ``$24,946,464,000:'' and insert \n     ``$25,268,464,000, of which $322,000,000 shall be available \n     to provide safety equipment through the Rapid Fielding \n     Initiative and the Iraqi Battlefield Clearance program:''.\n       On page 25, line 10, strike ``$5,136,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$4,884,000,000''.\n       On page 25, line 16, strike ``$353,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$283,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I apologize to my colleagues. I know it is a late hour. \nThis is an important amendment, and I hope my colleagues can support \nit.\n  I rise to propose this amendment to the emergency supplemental \nspending bill to ensure that Congress and the administration keep sight \nof what I believe must remain our number one priority for the conduct \nof the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the protection of our \nAmerican troops.\n  According to the U.S. Army, the President's supplemental bill falls \nshort of over $200 million for critical gear for our soldiers slated to \nrotate in Iraq and Afghanistan in the months ahead. This amendment was \ndesigned specifically to see to it that those U.S. troops coming into \nIraq, into a theater of war, would receive important equipment they \nneed to perform their missions effectively. This equipment includes \nimportant high-tech body armor, bullet-proof helmets, special water \npacks to keep soldiers hydrated, and other survival gear.\n  I don't need to make the case about what is happening in Iraq on a \ndaily basis, nor do I need to stress the importance of this kind of \nequipment. My colleagues are well aware of this situation.\n  As it stands now, the supplemental bill before the Senate only covers \nexpenses for soldiers' personal equipment up to the first 3 months of \n2004 and does not take into account very soon a considerable number of \nmen and women who will be entering the theater to relieve soldiers who \nare there now.\n  In an $87 billion emergency spending package for 2004, one would \nthink we could find enough money to meet the pressing equipment needs \nof our young men and women in uniform. That is why I was surprised to \nfind an official list from the U.S. Army Comptroller's Office dated \nSeptember 26 detailing several important items that remain unfunded in \nthis supplemental. Above all else, it is a requirement that thousands \nof our soldiers, particularly those in the Reserves and the National \nGuard, be equipped with the most effective personal equipment \navailable. Our troops need this gear to improve their performance in \ncombat and to enhance their safety under intense conditions.\n  As my colleagues know, every day our men and women in uniform have \nbeen ordered into harm's way, sent into extreme heat--exceeding 120 \ndegrees in some cases--with strenuous missions in different settings \nthroughout Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  My chart shows what a foot soldier wears on his shoulders in Iraq: 60 \npounds of body armor, tactical equipment, in hot desert heat, carrying \nhigh-tech night vision equipment, special framed backpacks, and other \nsurvival gear. In 120 degrees, carrying all this equipment becomes \nquite burdensome, so they have special hydration systems necessary for \ntroops to safely survive the desert heat. These water pack systems, \ncalled camelbaks, are attached to the soldier's backpack to allow easy \naccess to water when they are in motion.\n  Unfortunately, with the shortage of funds, the Army could not afford \nto equip all soldiers with this equipment, so many soldiers are using \nbulky canteens that quickly heat up in the desert sun. Most of the \ncanteens do not have adequate capacity to carry the water they need in \nIraq's intense heat.\n  This information comes from the U.S. Army. I am not making this up \nfrom news reports. This is what our military is telling us and where a \nshortfall exists in this supplemental.\n  In other cases, the soldiers are paying hundreds of dollars out of \ntheir own pockets to buy the equipment themselves, everything ranging \nfrom the camelbaks to gun scopes, because in spite of the Army's stated \npriorities, the administration did not procure enough personnel \nequipment for these men and women. I think we can do better than that.\n  The 2003 Defense Appropriations Act included language demanding \nanswers to why the very men and women we send into combat are being \nforced to spend upwards of $300 per person. Our own Congress made this \npoint: They are spending up to $300 per person on equipment to outfit \nthemselves for combat in Iraq. The Army has yet to report on this issue \nand has established a rapid fielding initiative designed to outfit our \nsoldiers with the most modern equipment available so they do not have \nto spend their own money on the latest body armor hydration systems.\n\n  Out of $324.5 million needed to fund this program in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, only $122.5 million was to be available in this \nsupplemental budget bill. That means if our soldiers, many of whom are \nless than 21 years of age, making under $20,000 a year, want the right \ngear for their mission, they are going to have to dig into their own \npockets to buy their own hydration equipment, radios, weapon sights, \ncombat helmets, and individual body armor.\n  Let me cite an article that appeared in yesterday's Washington Post \ncalled ``The Children Of War,'' section C, page 16. There was an \ninterview with the children whose parents are fighting in the Persian \nGulf. One young person points out that her father has been buying other \nsupplies already--a portable hammock, special water pouches, et cetera.\n  That is from a child talking about her parent having to buy his own \nequipment. I don't know of anyone who believes that ought to persist.\n  Now, in response to the Army's request, the committee added $300 \nmillion to the present supplemental request which could be used for \neither this additional equipment or the clearance of weapons and mines \nstill lingering on Iraqi battlefields. It says it right here, in the \nCongressional Record, dated October 1, 2003, when the Supplemental \nAppropriations bill's accompanying report was printed. On page S12222, \nthere is a chart detailing expenditures in the Army Operations and \nMaintenance account. $300 million is to be allocated for ``SAPI body \narmor/Rapid Fielding Initiative or battlefield cleanup.''\n  But the Army says it needs an additional $420 million just to handle \nthe Iraqi battlefield clearance. As the pending legislation stands now, \nthere is still not enough money in the bill to do both, and both \nitems--more safety equipment and Iraqi battlefield clearance--are top \nArmy priorities.\n  I think we need to address both of these issues. For those reasons, I \nhave asked my colleagues to support this amendment to allocate an \nadditional $322 million for the critical equipment of our troops and \nadequate resources for battlefield clearance to fully meet the Army's \ncurrent requirements.\n  The funding in my amendment is fully offset by reductions in some of \nthese reconstruction accounts called emergencies. I want to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to them.\n  Looking at this next chart. I have reprinted items submitted to us by \nthe Administration in their request, entitled ``Coalition Provisional \nAuthority Request to Rehabilitate and Reconstruct Iraq,'' dated \nSeptember 2003. It lists in this supposed emergency budget proposal, \namong other things, $15\n\n[[Page S12352]]\n\nmillion to procure 3,000 computers. That means we are providing \ncomputers at $5,000 a piece. This does not seem reasonable, when you \ncould find a perfectly reasonable computer for $750. I have a lot of \nrespect for what the Iraqis are going through, but I do not know, for \nthe life of me, why you are going to spend around $3,000 to $5,000 per \ncomputer, and $40 million to train them under this so-called emergency \nbudget.\n  You can go down even further on this list, and there are additional \npoints to make. I will not go through all these items because of the \ntime constraints. But my bill takes the money from two or three areas \nto come up with this $250 million to make up the difference between the \n$300 million in the bill and this additional amount to cover both \nbattlefield clearance and the equipment they need.\n  Out of the money the administration has proposed to fund the \nconstruction of two 4,000-bed maximum security prisons, at a cost of \n$400 million--$50,000 per bed in an Iraqi prison--these moneys would be \nin addition to the $99 million also included in that account for the \nrefurbishing and construction of 26 prisons and detention centers that \nexisted under the regime of Saddam Hussein.\n  Even without spending one penny of the $400 million--by the way, we \nrecommend taking $200 million of this, not all the $400 million. Even \nwithout spending one penny of the $400 million for the maximum security \nprisons, the prison capacity in Iraq will be nearly doubled from the \n11,200 to 19,700, thanks to our efforts.\n  The question I would ask--anyone ought to ask--is, Do we really \nbelieve, in a democratic Iraq, there will be a need to imprison three \ntimes more Iraqi citizens than were kept behind bars under Saddam \nHussein?\n  We would be transferring $200 million out of this account, cutting it \nin half--not eliminating all of it. We would also like to take $50 \nmillion out of the $100 million fund for the Iraqi witness protection \nprogram. That is right, there is $100 million listed in the \nAdministration's budget justification materials for the emergency \nsupplemental for witness protection. By the way, that is $100 million \nfor 100 families.\n  Now, the average Iraqi makes $2,200 a year. I don't know what anyone \nis thinking here. And I do not understand how we can provide $1 million \nper family, when we are at the same time not meeting the requirements \nthat our men and women in uniform are lacking.\n  The offsets for my amendment therefore include $50 million from the \nwitness protection program as well as $70 million from the proposals \nfor computers, computer training and even English classes proposed in \nthis so-called emergency budget.\n  There are a lot of emergencies that need to be met, but you are going \nto be hard pressed to convince the American public that doubling the \ncapacity of prisons is an emergency, or providing witness protection at \n$1 million per family, or buying computers at $3,000 each--when we are \nbeing told we cannot provide the necessary resources for our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  In sum, I want to make the point that the Administration's \nsupplemental budget request has simply not been scrubbed sufficiently. \nI do not believe any of my colleagues, if they were sitting down going \nover this in detail, would make a case that in $20 billion of \nconstruction money for Iraq, that a $100 million witness protection \nprogram, $400 million to double or triple the prison cells at $50,000 a \nbed in their prisons, and that $3,000 for computers--and $40 million, \nby the way, is to provide computer training--I would like to see \nsomeone get a $40 million appropriation to provide computer training \nfor anyone else in this country, let alone to do it over in Iraq.\n\n  So these are the areas that we would take money from to provide for \nthe $322 million to provide for the men and women in uniform who need \nthese resources.\n  I mentioned earlier the kind of equipment. I will come back and just \nidentify this for my colleagues. Again, this is not my assessment. This \nis the U.S. Army saying what they need. They need adequate provisions \nfor clean water, additional high-tech backpacks, advanced combat \nhelmets and body armor, additional radios, machine gun sights and \ntripods, M-16 ammunition, high-tech GPS compass equipment, additional \ndesert boots, sun and wind dust goggles and gloves, grappling hooks, \ndoor ramming kits, sniper rifles, binoculars, and special night vision \ngoggles.\n  That is their list. Yet they are being told: Either spend money to \nclear Iraqi battlefields of mines and other dangerous materials or \nreceive effective safety gear. This seems unacceptable. The Army needs \nmoney for both of these line items.\n  And I think we ought to do both. I am saying do both. Do not add to \nthe deficit, just take the $20 billion that we have for the \nreconstruction and go after some of these items that I do not think \nanyone--regardless of where you come out politically.\n  Let us take care of our men and women in uniform going over to Iraq. \nI do not think any of us want to read a story where one of our young \ntroops has to go out and buy their own equipment to protect themselves. \nThis is the 21st century. And in this day and age, the sole superpower \nin the world should not have to tell its military personnel to fend for \nthemselves.\n  So for those reasons, I urge the adoption of the amendment. I \napologize to my colleagues for taking time tonight, but I thought they \nought to understand what was at stake and why I thought this amendment \nwas particularly important.\n  For those reasons, I urge the adoption of the amendment, and I \nwithhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am indeed sorry that the Senator did \nnot discuss it with us further before he offered this amendment. There \nis $26 billion in the 2004 bill the President signed the night before \nlast for the Army. They could reprogram any money they need from the \n$26 billion.\n  We asked them in and we identified the needs in the Army. We took \n$952 million from other services and moved it to the Army. And we \ncovered specific items that they identified in terms of their \npriorities.\n  What Senator Dodd's amendment does, though, is it adds money to \naccounts we have already plused up, and it takes it from money to bring \nthe troops home. He has attacked the exact wrong part of the bill.\n  I wish I had more than 5 minutes, but I do not want to inconvenience \nmy colleagues and keep them here too long tonight. People are missing \nplanes because of this vote. And it is a vote that is duplicitous. It \nreally is designed to reduce the $20.3 billion in the other part of the \naccount.\n  We did get money for these people. We got money for every item that \nis on that list, and in the regular bill they have $26 billion. In \naddition to that, we added $952 million.\n  Now, I have been overseas. I said the other day, I remember going \noverseas, and on the way I bought boots. I did not like my boots. I \nbought shirts. I did not like my shirts. I bought gloves I would rather \nwear. Kids are kids, and they are going to buy what they want. This \nidea that they have to buy armor, armor is available on the basis of \nhow rapidly it is produced. And we have put up money in here, more than \nenough to buy everything to be produced in this time that he mentioned \nbetween now and--what?--about 5 months away.\n  That is special money on top of the $26 billion that they could use \nif they want. It is in the O account. These are O items they are \ntalking about.\n  Now, I do not believe we should do this at this late hour, try to \ntake money out of one account and justify it by virtue of this litany \nof items that we reviewed. We did review it.\n  They brought us this list. The Senator has gone over this list of \nitems that the Army would like to have in addition to what the \nDepartment of Defense gave them. We went over it and we agreed. We \nsaid: $952 million of this you should have had in the go-around in the \nDepartment of Defense. And we took it from the Air Force and from the \nNavy and from the Marines and put it here.\n  What we do miss is we do have $300 million for body armor in the \nrapid fielding initiative, and explosive and ordnance cleanup, $174 \nmillion for damaged equipment. We have $136 million for radios.\n\n[[Page S12353]]\n\n  Now, the Senator mentions this $1 million for families. That is money \nthat may be claimed--may be claimed. We paid $30 million for the people \nwho came in and identified the two sons of Saddam Hussein. It may not \nbe spent at all. It will only be spent if these people come in and \ndisclose people we want to pick up that are worth the cost. What is the \ncost? Moving them out of the country forever. That is taking people and \nbuying them a new life somewhere else because they have exposed \nthemselves to death because they disclosed the location of some of \nthese people.\n\n  I am appalled the Army would ask for this addition. We made an \nagreement with them. We took money from the other three services. And \nsomeone in the Army is going to answer to me. If it is really true \nsomeone in the Army went to the Senator from Connecticut and demanded \nmore money than we gave them, after we gave them $26 billion in the \nregular bill, gave them another $952 million, almost a billion we took \nfrom other services, to come in and make this demand at this time, it \nis absolutely nonsense.\n  Anyone who comes back, I hope they understand they have been brought \nback to answer a political amendment. I am going to move to table it \nwhen the time comes. The Senator from Connecticut is my friend, but I \nhave to tell you, to bring back people who have already gone home, some \nof them who missed planes in order to vote on this amendment at this \ntime, is an absolute absurdity.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will reserve it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Army did not come to me. This is an \nofficial briefing provided by the United States Army Comptroller to \nboth the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees. I am just \nreading what they said. They didn't make an attempt to get in touch \nwith me. Their briefing materials speak for them. They say that there \nis a requirement for $420 million to fund the ordnance disposal on the \nbattlefields still out there, and, in addition, there is a shortfall in \nArmy equipment. That is it plain and simple.\n  What the committee has said is: You can only do one or the other, but \nyou will not have enough money to do both.\n  I am suggesting you ought to be able to do both. To provide the $300 \nmillion, that is great, that helps. But the $300 million doesn't cover \nthe $420 million for the battlefield clearance and for the shortfalls \nthat occurred in this equipment. This is not about allowing service \nmembers to go out and buy shirts and gloves simply that they like. This \nis about equipping our soldiers with the most effective gear available \nto protect them from hostile fire as well as from the intense desert \nclimate. I am not arbitrarily making up figures. The suggestion here is \nwe come up with an additional $322 million to cover both \ncircumstances--that is, the battlefield clearance as well as the \nequipment--and pay for it, by the way, not by readjusting moneys within \nthe defense needs but in the reconstruction side of this supplemental \nrequest, that you can do away or at least delay, if you want, the idea \nof buying computers at $3,000 a copy, a witness protection program at \n$50 million for 50 families, and whether or not you can cut down prison \nconstruction from $400 million to $200 million. With my amendment, \nthere is still plenty of funding to implement the reconstruction plans \nof the Coalition Provisional Authority.\n  I don't know why this is so controversial. Why don't we just accept \nthis amendment? If I did it by not going into these reconstruction \naccounts, they might take it. But because I am talking about a witness \nprotection program and ridiculously high-priced computers and going \nafter excessive prison construction, which I think is hardly an \nemergency, all of a sudden this is a bad amendment and I am a dreadful \nguy for making folks come back and miss a plane.\n\n  I don't want a soldier out there getting hurt because they don't have \nthe right equipment. I didn't make this up. The Army didn't come to me \nspecifically. They made this case on September 26, the source was a \nbriefing provided to Congress' defense committees by the Assistant \nSecretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller, \nentitled, ``FY04 Supplemental Request for the Global War on Terrorism: \nThe Army At War.'' That is where it comes from. I appreciate what the \ncommittee did with $300 million. But the committee report says you have \nto make a choice: Clearing up the battlefield or provide funding for \nsoldiers' equipment. And I don't think the Army ought to be put in that \nposition. I don't think you ought to ask them to have to make that \nchoice. That is the reason for the amendment.\n  Again, I am sorry people have to come back and vote. That is not my \nintention. But I, in good conscience, believe this is a responsible \namendment. I would have thought it might be accepted instead of making \na lot more out of this than has to be the case. We all agree they ought \nto get the equipment. Why not just agree to the amendment? If you want \nto table the amendment, put people on record saying they would rather \nspend money on a witness protection program at $1 million a family in \nIraq when the average family makes $2,200 a year, you explain that to \nthe American taxpayer, why an Iraqi family would get $1 million in \nwitness protection. That is ridiculous.\n  Spending $3,000 for a computer and $400 million to create new prison \noperations over there is not an emergency need. You make the choice \nwhether or not you think that is more important than seeing these young \npeople get what they need. I stand by the amendment. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The yeas and nays are not ordered until I speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are in order at this time.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have not yielded back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not a motion to table. The yeas and nays \ncan be requested at any time.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the moment there is not a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that is good for me. If you want to have \na quorum, go right ahead. Go right ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I renew my request. I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to point out the Army has all of \nthis money in this supplemental without any directions in the bill. The \nline items the Senator mentions are specified in our report. They have \nentire discretion to use any money in this bill for the moneys he has \nasked for. But he wants to take it from the other money. This is a \nduplicitous amendment to take money from the second part of the bill \nand put it in the first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska's time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A motion to table has been made.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the motion to table amendment No. 1817.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration on behalf of myself, Senator Wyden, and others.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself, Mr. \n     Wyden, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Byrd, Mr. McCain, and \n     Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 1820.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the obligation and expenditure of funds for using \n   procedures other than full and open competition for entering into \n     certain contracts or other agreements for the benefit of Iraq)\n\n       On page 39, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 3002. (a) None of the funds appropriated by this Act \n     may be obligated or expended by the head of an executive \n     agency for payments under any contract or other agreement \n     described in subsection (b) that is not entered into with \n     full and open competition unless, not later than 30 days \n     after the date on which the contract or other agreement is \n     entered into, such official--\n       (1) submits a report on the contract or other agreement to \n     the Committees on Armed Services, on Governmental Affairs, \n     and on Appropriations of the Senate, and the Committees on \n     Armed Services, on Government Reform, and on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives;

and\n       (2) transmits an unredacted version of the document or \n     other collection of information, respectively, to the \n     chairman and ranking member of each of the Committees on \n     Governmental Affairs and on Appropriations of the Senate, the \n     Committees on Government Reform and on Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives, and the committees that the head of \n     such executive agency determines has legislative jurisdiction \n     for the operations of such executive agency to which the \n     document or other collection of information relates.\n       (e)(1)(A) In the case of any contract or other agreement \n     for which the Secretary of Defense determines that it is \n     necessary to do so in the national security interests of the \n     United States, the Secretary may waive the limitation in \n     subsection (a), but only on a case-by-case basis.\n       (B) For each contract or other agreement for which the \n     Secretary of Defense grants a waiver under this paragraph, \n     the Secretary shall submit a notification of the contract or \n     other agreement and the grant of the waiver, together with a \n     discussion of the justification for the waiver, to the \n     committees of Congress named in subsection (a)(1).\n       (2)(A) In the case of any contract or other agreement for \n     which the Director of Central Intelligence determines that it \n     is necessary to do so in the national security interests of \n     the United States related to intelligence, the Director may \n     waive the limitation in subsection (a), but only on a case-\n     by-case basis.\n       (B) For each contract or other agreement for which the \n     Director of Central Intelligence grants a waiver under this \n     paragraph, the Director shall submit a notification of the \n     contract or other agreement and of the grant of the waiver, \n     together with a discussion of the justification for the \n     waiver, to the Select Committee on Intelligence, the \n     Committee on Appropriations, and the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate and to the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on \n     Appropriations, and the Committee on Governmental Reform of \n     the House of Representatives.\n       (f) Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting \n     obligations to disclose United States Government information \n     under any other provision of law.\n       (g) In this section--\n       (1) the term ``full and open competition'' has the meaning \n     given such term in section 4 of the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403);\n       (2) the term ``executive agency'' has the meaning given \n     such term in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, and \n     includes the Coalition Provisional Authority for Iraq; and\n       (3) the term ``Coalition Provisional Authority for Iraq'' \n     means the entity charged by the President with directing \n     reconstruction efforts in Iraq.\n\n\n[[Page S12355]]\n\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. The amendment my colleague from Oregon and I are \noffering tonight requires the use of full and open competition for the \naward of contracts under this bill to support our military or related \nto the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  Competitive bidding ensures the taxpayer gets the very best value for \nhis investment. It also enhances public confidence that contracts are \nawarded in a manner that is fair and transparent, a process that allows \nall qualified bidders to submit bids for the contract.\n  This principle of full and open competition is enshrined in the \nCompetition and Contracting Act, which is current law.\n  Under that law, contracts must generally be bid under full or open \ncompetition unless one of seven exemptions is invoked.\n  Unfortunately, however, some of the contracts that have been awarded \nto date, both to support our military in Iraq and to begin \nreconstruction efforts, have not been awarded using full and open \ncompetition. The contracting process has been curtailed.\n  We want to make sure the general rule is competitive bidding, and, if \nthere are cases where there are legitimate reasons for curtailing \ncompetition--say, for reasons of national security--then we believe \nthere should be a process in place that requires a justification for \ncurtailing competition and disclosure of that fact.\n  Generally, under our amendment, if competition is not used in the \naward of a contract, the agency involved would have to justify the \nreason for invoking an exception to competition and report that in the \nCommerce Business Daily, the Federal Register, and to the appropriate \ncommittees of Congress. We recognize there may be a few cases where it \nis so secret, it is so classified, that disclosure in the Commerce \nBusiness Daily and the Federal Register would not be appropriate. In \nthose cases, we provide for an alternative form of notifying Congress.\n  Our amendment will bring accountability and sunshine to the \ncompetition and contracting process. I urge my colleagues to support \nour amendment.\n  It has been a great pleasure to work with my colleague, Senator \nWyden. We have made a number of efforts in this regard. I believe this \namendment should enjoy widespread support.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have enjoy working with my colleague from \nMaine over the last 5 or 6 months.\n  This amendment is especially important because it would mean for the \nfirst time the Congress is going to restrict the funds under this \neffort for reconstruction to only those contracts let in an open and \ncompetitive bid, except in very narrow circumstances.\n  In my view, much of the work to rebuild Iraq has been outsourced to \nprivate companies and it is now time, with this legislation, to end the \noutsourcing of accountability. What our constituents have said is: How \nmuch is this whole effort going to cost? How long is it going to take? \nAnd how is this money going to be spent?\n  As I have said, my view is that right now the contracting process \nlooks a little like Dodge City before the marshall showed up. It seems \nvery influential companies and others seem to write the rules that the \nUnited States is essentially in the dark. Then the news media comes out \nand highlights various concerns, most of which the Senate does not know \nmuch about, and there is a flurry of activity and people discuss \nwhether or not the contract is going to be rebid.\n  What Senator Collins and I would like to do is establish some \nbipartisan order and go back, as the Senator from Maine has said, to \nthe principles that the Competition and Contracting Act have been all \nabout. Yes, $87 billion is a jaw-dropping sum of money. The Coalition \nProvisional Authority, the World Bank, and the U.N. have estimated--it \nwas in the Wall Street Journal today--that it will take $56 billion \nover just the next 5 years for rebuilding in Iraq.\n  It seems to me it does not pass the smell test to allow this process \nwhere the Congress is in the dark, the American people are in the dark, \nand every Member of the Senate goes home and faces constituents who \nsay, We want this process to work a little bit like our family finances \ndo. Right now, a family makes purchases, they get a bank statement. For \nexample, they spend X amount of dollars at Sears, they spend more at \nthe grocery store, they pay for essentials, and get a bank statement \nshowing what they spent. That is a process that is straightforward, \nthat can be monitored. We look at the bank statement for Iraq; it is \nessentially devoid of specifics.\n  Senator Collins and I have tried to approach this on a bipartisan \nbasis. People may think it is a quaint idea, but we believe in \ncompetition. We believe that transparency and disclosure works and it \ngets taxpayers the most for their money.\n  This amendment for the first time actually puts in place a funding \nrestriction. In the past, Senator Collins and I have said we are \nwilling to look at various approaches that involve reports after the \nfact. Now we are waiting for all of these investigations and inquiries \nto move at glacial speed.\n  What Senator Collins has said is--and I agree with her point \ncompletely--what we need now is some legislation with teeth in it. This \nfunding restriction for the first time provides that.\n  We are very pleased to be able to come to the Senate, given the fact \nthere have been a number of instances already where contracts were let \nwithout competitive bid or with only limited bidding. We have had a \nnumber of colleagues involved, colleagues from both parties.\n  I particularly commend Senator Clinton, who has been my partner on \nthe Democratic side. I also note that Senator Enzi has been very \nsupportive of this effort. He joins this cause as well. Our thanks to \nSenator Clinton, Senator Enzi, and many other Senators who have been \ninvolved in this effort.\n  Tonight, it seems to me, the Senate is saying: We will do it \ndifferently. We will draw a line in the sand. The Senate is no longer \ngoing to be in the dark with respect to this issue. I am very pleased \nwe will be able to go home for this recess and say that at a time when \nthe American people are looking for some concrete specifics with \nrespect to the pricetag on this legislation and where the money exactly \nis going to go, we can say that because of this bipartisan amendment, \nfor the first time the Senate is going to restrict these funds so as to \npromote open and competitive bidding and the kind of transparency that \nbest makes free markets work.\n  I reserve the remainder of any time I have remaining. I also thank \nthe chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee who has had strong \nviews on this issue and has worked closely with Senator Collins and me \nover almost 6 months. We appreciate the fact that now we have \nlegislation with some real teeth in it to make sure the taxpayers get \nvalue for their money in the contracting process.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I may speak for a moment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will be happy to accept this amendment. It has been \nmodified, as has been indicated. I want to state to the Senate, \nhowever, although the Senators are correct, this adds to existing law.\n  Existing law at the current time requires competitive bidding on \ncontracts. The contracts that are outstanding now that have been \nentered into by the United States and its entities in Iraq have been \nlet on the basis of competitive bids. There have been lots of questions \nraised about that, but some of the contracts were outstanding before \nthe contractors were sent to Iraq, and they were general services \ncontracts, and those were extended to Iraq. But we are now putting, as \nthe two Senators mentioned, additional emphasis on that, and I am \npleased to accept the amendment on behalf of the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield back my time if the Senator from \nOregon will also yield back his time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there is no further debate, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1820) was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S12356]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, now Senator Daschle and Senator Graham \nwill present their amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1816\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that members of the Ready Reserve of the Armed \n Forces are treated equitably in the provision of health care benefits \n     under TRICARE and otherwise under the Defense Health Program)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. \n1816.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for Mr. \n     Daschle, for himself and Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Bond, Mr. Burns, Mr. Warner, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Chambliss proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1816.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina and I \nhave been negotiating and working with the distinguished manager of the \nbill regarding an amendment we have been attempting to pass now over \nthe course of this entire session of Congress.\n  Our view has been from the very beginning that members of the \nNational Guard and Reserves need the opportunity to have access to \nTRICARE health insurance. And now, on three occasions, the Senate has \nbeen on record--with increasing numbers--in support of this concept, \nthis idea that TRICARE ought to be offered to members of the Guard and \nReserves.\n  We have been gratified with the strong bipartisan support that has \nbeen indicated with each one of the votes. Our concern, however, is it \ndoes not do us much good to continue to pass these measures on the \nSenate floor only to see the amendments dropped by the time they get to \nconference.\n  We want to pass something into law. We want something to be provided \nto as many of these members of the Guard and Reserves as we possibly \ncan this year. So in trying to figure out what might work best, and in \nworking with the distinguished Senator from Alaska, we have concluded \nperhaps the best way to do this is to ensure we go to those people who \nneed it the most, that is, those members of the Guard and Reserves who \nhave no health insurance today, and that when members of the Guard and \nReserves are called up to active duty, they also are compensated for \nthe TRICARE insurance that would be provided to them while they are on \nactive duty.\n  Now, we will say from the very beginning this is not what we would \nlike. We would like to do more, but we know that doing something is \nbetter than doing nothing if, in the end, that is what happens.\n  So I first thank the distinguished Senator from South Carolina for \nhis tenacity and persistence. He has done an outstanding job in working \non this issue and has provided great leadership. He has been a very \nhelpful partner. I also say there are Senators on my side of the aisle, \nSenator Leahy in particular, and Senator Clinton, who have been \nespecially helpful in this effort. So I appreciate very much the \nSenator from Alaska working with us. I am satisfied this is a \nreasonable compromise.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I will try to be brief.\n  We have a great team defending America right now. That team is made \nup of active-duty members who have made a decision to serve 4 years or \nmaybe have a career in the military. But that team is supplemented by \nthe Guard and Reserves. There are 224,000 Guard and Reserve members \ncalled up to active duty and, working together, they are doing a great \njob defending our freedom. It is time to look anew at the role the \nGuard and Reserves play.\n  I say to Senator Daschle, I want to publicly thank him for making \nthis possible because he has been great to work with, and Senator \nDeWine. I think we have been a pretty good team here on the floor. We \ndisagree on a lot, and there will be a lot of fussing and fighting \nbefore this bill is over with, but that is the American way. It is OK \nto express our differences. It is great to be able to tell people you \ndisagree. There are a lot of countries where there are not many ways to \nexpress your disagreements. But one of the things we have done tonight, \nand I think in the spirit of the country, is to come together to \nsupport our men and women who serve.\n  So why do we need this? One-fourth of the Guard and Reserves are on \nactive duty now, with more to come. We need to acknowledge the obvious. \nThey will be asked to do more, not less, over the coming months and \nyears. Why? The cold war model of having tanks in the Fulda Gap and a \nlarge nuclear deterrent force standing up against the former Soviet \nUnion, that war, thank goodness, is in the history books for the most \npart.\n  The new war, the war on terrorism, has a totally different dynamic. \nThe Guard and Reserves, which were tangential, to be honest with you, \nin the cold war are in the forefront of this war on terrorism. Most of \nyour military police are guards and reservists. Seventy-five percent of \nthe aircrews flying C-130s--and I know our Presiding Officer knows this \nbecause we took nine trips in the theater of Afghanistan and Iraq. \nEight of the crews are Guard crews, one is a Reserve crew. Seventy-five \npercent of the people flying C-130s are Guard and Reserves. Fifty-five \npercent of the people flying airlift to get the supplies and resources \ninto the region to protect our troops and help them survive are \nreservists. Almost 90 percent of the intelligence service for the Army \nis in the Reserves, 90 percent is civil affairs Reserves. It is growing \nby leaps and bounds.\n  What we are trying to do tonight is provide a better benefit package \nthan they have had before because we are going to ask so much of the \nGuard and Reserves.\n  Senator Stevens made this possible. We have passed two bills by 80-\nplus votes, but there is no money behind it. For all those who follow \nthe Senate, they know who is in charge of the money. Senator Stevens \nmade this possible because we are putting money behind the bill.\n  What does that mean? It is no longer talk. Twenty percent--2 out of \n10 people--who are Guard and Reserves are without health care. This \nbill immediately will allow them to have health care year round. They \nwill pay a premium like a retiree would pay, but they will have health \ncare by being a member of the Guard or Reserves.\n  We need to do more, and we will. The problem of a Guard or Reserve \nfamily goes like this: If you are called up to active duty for a year, \nyou go into the military health care system called TRICARE. If you have \nhealth care in the private sector, most times--almost all the time--\nyour physician network is replaced. You go from the private health care \nsector to the military health care sector. And when you get \ndeactivated, you change, and there is no continuity of health care. \nThirty percent of the people called to active duty were unable to be \ndeployed because of health care problems.\n\n  We are not done yet. There is more to do. It is my goal, my hope, my \ndream, for the Guard and Reserve forces that if you will join, and you \nwill participate, and you will help defend America as a guard or \nreservist, we will offer you full-time health care. You pay a premium, \nbut you and your family will be taken care of in the health care area. \nI think it is the least we could do. I think it is what we should do. \nAnd tonight is a huge step forward.\n  I thank all of the Senators who made it possible. The fussing, the \nfighting yet to come on this bill is part of America. But let it be \nsaid at about 8:50 at night, Republicans and Democrats came together to \nhelp Guard and Reserve members. When you are in a war, they do not ask \nyou if you are a Republican or a Democrat. They are asking you to do \nyour job. So I am honored to be part of this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel and Senator Allen be added \nas cosponsors.\n\n[[Page S12357]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I thank the Chair.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I do not know--I haven't seen the list of \ncosponsors--but if they are not listed, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Leahy, Reid, and Clinton be added as cosponsors.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have worked on this amendment. There \nis a vast problem out there among Guard and Reserve people. We have a \ntotal force now in our military. We passed the concept that the Guard \nand Reserves are replacements for the regular services when they are \nsent overseas. The Guard and Reserves are sent overseas almost as much \nas the regular members of our military. They have volunteered to defend \nus, as the Senators have said. Their families need the same protection \nthat we offer to those who volunteer in the regular services.\n  We have modified this amendment because we really basically want to \nsee what happens when this change takes place. The cost of this \namendment that we have put forward is approximately $400 million this \nyear and by the following year it will be $500 million. We don't know \nhow much it will really cost because we don't know how many will come \nforward and take this, as compared to what they are doing now as far as \ntheir medical is concerned. It is a contributory system for TRICARE, \nanother experiment that we hope we will be able to get some track \nrecord on.\n  As I have become more familiar with the National Guard, it is very \nstrong, and the Reserves, also. We want to assure that people will \ncontinue to maintain an interest in joining the Guard and Reserves. \nMost people don't understand that the transition from Guard and \nReserves to regular services has reversed history. In days gone by, \npeople came out of the military and entered the Guard and Reserves. \nToday many people enter the Guard and Reserves and then decide they are \ngoing to try to become career military. This will be an added \ninducement to get more people to enlist in the Guard and Reserves. It \nmight have a reverse effect and we are not sure of that yet. This will \ngive us a track record.\n  I am pleased to say that we have conferred with members of the Armed \nServices Committee on this amendment, and they have agreed we should go \nforward with it.\n  I am pleased to accept the amendment on behalf of the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I want to add one thing. There was an \narticle in USA Today yesterday: ``Army Reserve Fears Troop Exodus.'' \nThe Army National Guard is 15,000 below its recruiting goal. ``Soldiers \nare `stressed' on yearlong deployments.'' I really honestly believe \nthat this benefit made available will help retention and recruitment \nbecause the problems with these deployments are coming down the road. \nThe further we can get ahead of this by beefing up the benefit package, \nthe better America will be.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the article to which I referred in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Army Reserve Fears Troop Exodus\n\n                            (By Dave Moniz)\n\n       If the United States is unable to recruit significantly \n     more international troops or quell the violence in Iraq in \n     the next few months, it could trigger an exodus of active and \n     reserve forces, the head of the U.S. Army Reserve said \n     Monday.\n       Lt. Gen. James Helmly, chief of the 205,000-member Army \n     Reserve, said he and other Pentagon leaders will be \n     monitoring retention rates closely next year, when problems \n     could begin to become apparent for full-time and part-time \n     soldiers coming off long tours of duty in Iraq.\n       ``Retention is what I am most worried about. It is my No. 1 \n     concern,'' Helmly told USA TODAY's editorial board. ``This is \n     the first extended-duration war the country has fought with \n     an all-volunteer force.''\n       Helmly described the war on terrorism as an unprecedented \n     test of the 30-year-old all-volunteer military. Historically, \n     he said, the National Guard and Reserve were designed to \n     mobilize for big wars and then bring soldiers home quickly.\n       Today, he said, they have ``entered a brave new world'' \n     where large numbers of troops will have to be deployed for \n     long periods.\n       Counting training time and yearlong tours in Iraq, some \n     Army Reserve soldiers could be mobilized for 15 months or \n     more. Helmly described the situation facing soldiers in Iraq \n     as ``stressed'' but said he could not characterize it as at a \n     ``breaking point.''\n       The stresses facing the nation's reservists were \n     demonstrated again this week when the National Guard \n     announced it had alerted a combat brigade from Washington \n     state that it could be sent to Iraq next year if a third \n     block of international troops cannot be recruited to join the \n     British and Polish-led divisions now in Iraq.\n       Guard officials said Monday that the 5,000-member 81st Army \n     National Guard brigade from Washington state has been \n     notified that it could be called to active duty.\n       Helmly said a huge factor in Iraq will be the Pentagon's \n     ability to train an Iraqi army and security force.\n       The Defense Department recently announced plans to \n     accelerate the development of an Iraqi army, pushing the goal \n     from 12,000 troops to 40,000 troops in the next year.\n       The Army National Guard and Army Reserve have about one-\n     fourth of their troops--nearly 129,000 soldiers--on active \n     duty.\n       The active-duty Army and the Army Reserve both met their \n     recruiting goals for the fiscal year that ends today. The \n     Army National Guard, however, is expected to fall about 15% \n     short of its recruiting goal of 62,000 soldiers.\n       Although the Guard and Reserve say their retention rates \n     have not suffered this year, the figures could be misleading. \n     Under an order known as ``stop loss,'' soldiers on active \n     duty are prohibited from leaving the service until their \n     tours end.\n       Active-duty and Reserve commanders fear that when U.S. \n     soldiers on yearlong rotations come home next year, many will \n     choose to leave the service.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to ensure that \nour troops in Iraq and other dangerous areas throughout the world, many \nof whom are Reservists and members of the National Guard, have the \nequipment they need to protect themselves. In particular, I would like \nto discuss the uparmored Humvees which soldiers need to protect \nthemselves from the threat of RPGs and mines and weapons that are \ninflicting casualties today as we speak in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S12359]]\n\n  To effectively carry out the mission, Army officials have said that \nthey need more Humvees, uparmored Humvees. I believe them. The \nadministration in this bill failed to fully meet that request.\n  My amendment is designed to meet the needs of the Army today as they \nface these numerous threats around the globe. The amendment is \ncosponsored by Senators Bayh and Kennedy. It would add funding to this \nsupplemental request to buy additional uparmored Humvees and would also \ndirect the Army to reevaluate its requirements for the armored security \nvehicle.\n  The HMMWV, or high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle, better \nknown as the Humvee, is the workhorse of the United States. It is being \nused around the globe today in conflicts from Afghanistan to Iraq to \nthe Balkans. The uparmored Humvee is a variation of the basic vehicle. \nIt was designed to offer increased protection to troops from small arms \nfire, rocket-propelled grenades, and blasts from mines.\n  It was designed primarily for military police and special operations \npersonnel, exactly the type of soldiers being called upon to do very \ndangerous missions in Iraq today.\n  The armored security vehicle, or the ASV, is also a vehicle in the \nArmy inventory. It is designed to complement the uparmored Humvee. \nThere are very few of them, but it is a requirement that I believe the \nArmy should study again.\n  In July, I visited Iraq and had the opportunity to meet with my \nconstituents from the Rhode Island National Guard, the 115th Military \nPolice Company, and 119th Military Police Company, the 118th Military \nPolice Battalion. It was on the tarmac at Baghdad International \nAirport. I got off the aircraft with my colleagues. I rushed over to \nthe formation of these military police men and women. I began to speak \nwith them. The first request that I got was repeated several times \nover: We need uparmored Humvees. We are in a dangerous situation. We \nare patrolling the roads of Iraq. We see other units with these \nvehicles. We need them.\n\n  When I came back to the United States, I was convinced that we needed \nmore uparmored Humvees. In the intervening weeks, the Rhode Island \nNational Guard, 115th Military Police Company, has lost three soldiers. \nTwo were killed when an improvised explosive device, a 155-millimeter \nshell, exploded underneath their regular Humvee. No one can determine \nwhether or not an uparmored Humvee would have saved the lives of these \ntwo soldiers, Staff Sergeant Joseph Camara and Sergeant Charles \nCaldwell. I know having such a vehicle would add to the confidence and \nsecurity of the troops.\n  A few days ago Specialist Michael Andrade of the 115th Military \nPolice was killed, again in a Humvee in an accident involving a convoy \noperation in which a tanker truck crashed into his vehicle. Last Monday \nevening I was there in Rhode Island when they brought Specialist \nAndrade's body home to his family. This Saturday he will be buried in \nRhode Island. I know you can't determine whether or not this type of \nvehicle would have saved this young soldier's life. But I can tell you, \nif they had a choice, all of our military police, all of our soldiers \nin Iraq would prefer to be in an uparmored Humvee than a Humvee without \nthe armor, and their families would make that choice, also.\n  It is clear that we need more. This bill contains more vehicles. I \ncommend the President for that proposal. I believe we need more than \neven what is included in this bill.\n  When I returned from Iraq, I wrote to Secretary Rumsfeld. I also \ncalled the Army. At that time I was verbally told by the Army that the \nrequirement for additional Humvees was about 500. But then as the \nsummer wore on, several things became apparent. This insurgency was \nextremely serious and extremely lethal. Also that the requirement for \nuparmored Humvees was going up. Indeed, I believe--I have said this \nbefore--that we could be involved and will likely be involved in Iraq \nfor years, not months, stretching perhaps to 10 years. These are the \ntypes of vehicles that are crucial to effective operation in an \noccupation force as we have in Iraq.\n\n  Now, my initial response from the Army was that they need 500 more. \nBy September 8, the Army sent a formal response indicating that the \nrequirement now is 1,723 uparmored Humvees and 1,461 will be sent \nimmediately to the theater. I commend the Army because they have tried \ntheir best to move as many available vehicles into the theater of Iraq \nas possible.\n  Now, 619 vehicles were coming off the assembly line and being sent \ndirectly to Iraq; 430 were being pulled from units in the United States \nand Europe; another 412 were pulled out of the Balkans. So we are \ntrying to meet the need in Iraq, but we are doing it by taking these \nvehicles from other potentially dangerous areas, such as the Balkans. \nAlso, vehicles were taken from the units in the United States--we hope \nthey are training on these vehicles in preparation to go overseas.\n  I believe indeed that this requirement will increase, and in fact \nwhat we have seen throughout the course of the last several months is \nthe Army and the Department of Defense seriously reevaluating the need \nfor uparmored Humvees. They have concluded that these uparmored Humvees \nare indeed necessary.\n  We have received information that the Army in fact has a requirement \nin excess of 3,400 vehicles. Again, just a few weeks ago, the \nrequirement was 1,700; now the requirement is 3,400 vehicles. They say \nthe best way to accommodate future funding for increased production \nwould be to use the Iraqi Freedom Fund. I propose to do that. In fact, \nOSD has concurred with this approach. The Secretary of Defense has \nconcurred. What we are waiting on is a validation of how many of these \nvehicles can be produced at the assembly point.\n  So my amendment is straightforward. It requests additional money in \nthe amount of approximately $191 million from the Iraqi Freedom Fund to \nbuy 800 additional vehicles, or so many as may be acquired with that \nmoney. In fact, I hope we can, in the next year, buy even more. The \nanalysis by myself and my staff suggests this money would be sufficient \nto fully operate the production line and get all the vehicles possible \nthat we need.\n  The Iraqi Freedom Fund in this bill contains $1.9 billion, so there \nare sufficient resources. I believe we should do this and we should do \nit promptly. The indication from the Army is that they need the \nvehicles, and also if we act in this appropriations bill, we can speed \nthose vehicles to Iraq.\n  As I said earlier, there is another aspect of this, and that is the \narmored security vehicle. We are asking the Army to look back at this \nrequirement and reevaluate it.\n  I will conclude by taking the advice of Secretary Rumsfeld that it is \nnot necessary to listen to the media but listen to the soldiers. I have \na letter from a young lieutenant in Afghanistan. Here is what he \nwrites:\n\n       I am the leader of one platoon of many here trained \n     Stateside for dismounted missions and handed uparmored \n     Humvees upon arrival at our firebases. My strong NCO's have \n     adapted and worked hard to train on this different platform. \n     I feel it is criminal, however, to have sent so many units \n     here without Stateside training on either the . . . uparmored \n     Humvee or its complementary weapon, the MK-19 auto grenade \n     launcher and M2 .50 caliber machine gun.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Our mechanics, for example, have no experience with the \n     uparmored Humvees and are too few to fix vehicles which have \n     been driven hard for at least 18 months on the awful \n     ``roads'' here. Without vehicles, we have no mobility. \n     Without mobility, we cannot either protect the reconstruction \n     teams or interdict terrorists/criminals intent on rocketing \n     our bases and mining the roads.\n\n  That is the viewpoint of one of these magnificent young soldiers in \nAfghanistan working with the vehicles. He appreciates the value of the \nvehicles. I think every soldier, every squad that has missions like \nthis, whether in Afghanistan or Iraq, should have these vehicles, and \nthat is the intent of this amendment. Further, I will add that one of \nthe suggestions to me in his letter is:\n\n       Purchase new uparmored Humvees for Afghanistan to replace \n     the ones about to die or send qualified mechanics with the \n     requisite parts to fix them.\n\n  That could be written by any soldier in Afghanistan or Iraq, and \nindeed there are many in Iraq, particularly, that do not even have \naccess to\n\n[[Page S12360]]\n\nuparmored Humvees. I will conclude by thanking the chairman and the \nstaff for their assistance on this amendment. I also thank the chairman \nsincerely not only for this effort but for almost $900 million of \nadditional funding for the Army, for vests, for a host of equipment. I \nalso understand from our discussion that he feels as strongly as I do \nabout this issue and will do his best in conference to ensure these \nadditional Humvees are provided.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. We funded in this \nbill what we thought were a number of these upgraded Humvees that could \nbe produced and were the stated demand of the Army at that time. This \ndemand keeps going up as it is realized how much these Humvees need to \nbe modernized. We have changed to deal with the circumstances in Iraq. \nThey are very interesting modifications. We have both been briefed on \nthem. Some of the modifications are still classified.\n  It is our intention to fund it. Coming out of conference, I will do \nmy utmost to fund the number of Humvees that can be upgraded in a \nreasonable period ahead of time so we can meet this demand so that \nevery group of the military that needs Humvees for their protection \nwill be modernized and upgraded for self-protection. They do have to \nhave some additional items. There are methods some of the terrorists \nhave used to destroy Humvees that can't be defended against.\n  So it is our intention to modernize these Humvees. They were not \ndefective. Some of the methods terrorists use are unique. We need \nadditional protection from above, and from the side, and from the rear, \nand underneath the Humvees. We cannot turn them completely into \nshockproof tanks, but we are going to do our best. This is a No. 1 \npriority for the Senate, as far as I am concerned--that and the problem \nof finding these weapons caches and destroying them, or really making \ncertain that the usable weapons, particularly hand-held weapons, are \nput under guard and assured that they will not get in the wrong hands.\n  I thank the Senator for his willingness to accept our modifications, \nand I assure him we will keep on top of this. We will confer with the \nSenator because I know of his distinguished Army career. We are pleased \nto have his assistance on this matter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1812), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1808\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for Mr. \nVoinovich and Mr. Lott.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Voinovich \n     and Mr. Lott, proposes an amendment numbered 1808.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require a report on efforts to increase financial \n contributions from the international community for reconstruction in \n    Iraq and the feasibility of repayment of funds contributed for \n                    infrastructure projects in Iraq)\n\n       On page 38, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec. 2313. Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to Congress \n     a report on the efforts of the Government of the United \n     States to increase the resources contributed by foreign \n     countries and international organizations to the \n     reconstruction of Iraq and the feasibility of repayment of \n     funds contributed for infrastructure projects in Iraq. The \n     report shall include--\n       (1) a description of efforts by the Government of the \n     United States to increase the resources contributed by \n     foreign countries and international organizations to the \n     reconstruction of Iraq;\n       (2) an accounting of the funds contributed to assist in the \n     reconstruction of Iraq, disaggregated by donor;\n       (3) an assessment of the effect that--\n       (A) the bilateral debts incurred during the regime of \n     Saddam Hussein have on Iraq's ability to finance essential \n     programs to rebuild infrastructure and restore critical \n     public services, including health care and education, in \n     Iraq; and\n       (B) forgiveness of such debts would have on the \n     reconstruction and long-term prosperity in Iraq;\n       (4) a description of any commitment by a foreign country or \n     international organization to forgive any part of a debt owed \n     by Iraq if such debt was incurred during the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein; and\n       (5) an assessment of the feasibility of repayment by Iraq--\n       (A) of bilateral debts incurred during the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein; and\n       (B) of the funds contributed by the United States to \n     finance infrastructure projects in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an amendment we discussed earlier \non the floor. I was ready to offer it earlier but was prevented. The \namendment would require a report from the President concerning the \nefforts of the United States to increase resources that are available \nin Iraq from other countries, and to do other matters, such as a \ndescription of the bilateral impact on the Iraq action, the question of \nforgiveness of debts, and other items that we believe are substantial \nand on which we should have a report from the administration. These \nreports request no later than 120 days.\n\n  I will state for the information of the Senate, there are several \namendments we are looking at that deal with reports. It is my hope that \nthe conference committee will have a report section. I see in some of \nthese amendments not a conflict but an overlapping of requests, and the \ntiming of them is different. I do not believe we should put a \nrequirement on these people to report one week on one item, another \nweek on another item, and another week on another item when they are \nall related. We should have quarterly reports from the administration \non what is going on with both sections of this bill and how the money \nis being handled.\n  This is a bill that has considerable discretion because it is a \nsupplemental bill. It is in addition to the enormous bill we passed and \nthe President already signed. Therefore, there is a lot of discretion \nas to where the money goes. It is a mechanism to avoid what has been \ndone in the past, as I have said repeatedly.\n  In the past, Presidents have dipped into the money available to the \nDepartment of Defense and have used it in other places. We have taken \nthe occasion to provide the money in advance and have allowed \ndiscretion of the President to put it in the places where it is needed \nand tell us 5 days before that happens and report to us later on how \nthe money was actually used. Those reports will come to us. I am sure \nwe will keep very good track of the people's money as we proceed.\n  Mr. President, so far as I am concerned, that is the last item to be \nconsidered tonight.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1808.\n  The amendment (No. 1808) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the leader will shortly make a statement \nconcerning the bill. As the manager of the bill, we have an \nunderstanding that tomorrow there will be a period during which \nSenators may bring amendments to the floor and offer them so they will \nbe in the queue, so to speak. There will be no consideration of any \namendment tomorrow and no vote on any amendment tomorrow.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I voted for the McConnell amendment, as \nmodified, because I believe that it is appropriate to recognize and \ncommend the men and women of our Armed Forces for their bravery, \nprofessionalism and dedication during the military campaigns in \nAfghanistan and Iraq; to honor the sacrifice of those who died or were \nwounded and to convey our deepest sympathy and condolences to their \nfamilies and friends; and to support the efforts of communities across \nthe Nation who are honoring our troops.\n  Although I voted for the amendment, I want to make clear that I have \nsome reservations about some parts of it. For example, I do not believe \nthat the planning for the post-Saddam portion of the military campaign \nin Iraq was done well. Additionally, I want to note my concern that \nthere may be unacceptable profiteering by some contractors in the post-\nSaddam period in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S12361]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12361-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I draw to your attention an important \nevent that is taking place this Saturday, October 4 from 10 am until 5 \npm--First Lady Laura Bush and the Library of Congress is holding the \nthird annual National Book Festival on the National Mall.\n  The Library of Congress and Mrs. Bush have planned an enjoyable day \nof presentations by nearly 80 award-winning authors, illustrators, \npoets and storytellers.\n  Famous fiction, mystery and history writers will read from their \nworks. Children's authors such as R.L. Stine, of the Goosebumps book \nseries and actress and children's writer Julie Andrews will be among \nthose participating. Storybook characters from PBS will stroll the \ngrounds and greet young festivalgoers. There will even be special \nreadings in the teens and children's pavilion by NBA players \nrepresenting the National Basketball Association's ``Read To Achieve'' \ncampaign.\n  Additional activities will include book signings, musical \nperformances, storytelling, and panel discussions. I am especially \ninterested to hear that specialists will be on hand from the Library's \nVeterans History Project to provide information about collecting oral \nhistories of America's war veterans. There truly is something for \neveryone at this year's book festival.\n  The National Book Festival is free and open to the public and \npromises to be a wonderful family event. I hope that everyone will join \nMrs. Bush and the Library of Congress on Saturday in celebration of the \njoy of reading.\n  For more information, you may visit the Library's Web site \n or call toll-free (888) 714-4696.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12361-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MINIMUM PAY PROTECTION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have some good news. The House of \nRepresentatives just a little while ago passed, by a substantial \nmargin, a motion to instruct their conferees to adhere to the Senate's \nposition saying that the administration cannot go ahead to implement \nthe rules on overtime which would take away overtime pay protection for \nover 8 million Americans. The vote in the House was 221 to 203.\n  This is a great victory for American workers today. It sends a very \nclear message to the administration: Don't mess with overtime pay \nprotection. Don't take away from American workers the overtime pay \nprotection that we have had in the law since 1938. This is a clear and \nunequivocal message from both the House and the Senate.\n  I hope the administration has the message. I now call upon the \nSecretary of Labor to forthwith, today, by sundown tomorrow, go ahead \nand extend overtime pay protections to hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans on the low-income side of the scale.\n  Right now, the low-income threshold is $8,060 a year. Part of the \nproposal the administration sent down would have raised that level to \n$21,100 a year. This is an issue on which we all agree. This is \nsomething the Secretary of Labor can do today, tomorrow, before the \nweek is out. This can be done with a stroke of a pen.\n  I call upon the Secretary of Labor to immediately issue a new \nregulation that would raise the low-income threshold from $8,060 to \n$21,100 a year and thus cover many more Americans with overtime pay \nprotection.\n  What the House has spoken so loudly today is what we did in the \nSenate a few weeks ago. We want to extend overtime pay protection to \nmore Americans. We do not want to talk it away.\n  Let us move forward together, call upon the Secretary of Labor to \nissue these regulations to raise that threshold. Now the administration \ncan take those proposed rules they came out with this spring and put \nthem in the fireplace. Get rid of them. Then, if we want to move ahead, \nwe can do it in two stages. Raise the threshold right now, and then if \nwe need to modify and change some of the overtime regulations to \nreflect more accurately the modern day workplace, let's do it together, \ndo it with open public hearings, have our witnesses, and do it in a \ndeliberate manner that reflects the will of the American people, not \nunder the cover of night, putting out proposed regulations without any \nhearings whatever.\n  I stand ready as a member of the Labor Committee, and on both the \nauthorizing and appropriations side, to work with the Secretary of \nLabor and others to set up a route by which we can, if we need to, \nchange and modify some of the regulations to more accurately meet \ntoday's workforce. But in no case should we diminish the overtime pay \nprotections in the law today for people, in no way. We need to extend \nand raise that threshold immediately. That is what I call upon the \nSecretary of Labor to do.\n  It would be a great victory today for American workers who are \nlacking in a lot of good news coming out of Washington these days for \nworking families. This is one bit of good news for American working \nfamilies today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12361-4", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RULEMAKING EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

OTIS SINGLETARY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \nnoted Kentuckian, a community leader, and a dedicated educator and \nadministrator, Dr. Otis Singletary. I also want to take this \nopportunity to extend my condolences to his wife, Gloria, his three \nchildren, Bonnie, Robert, and Kendall, and all who knew and loved this \nremarkable man.\n  Dr. Singletary served his country in many capacities. A native of \nMississippi, he joined the Navy at the outbreak of World War II and \ncontinued to serve in the Armed Forces through the Korean War. After \nearning his Ph.D., he taught history at the University of Texas. There \nthe Students' Association recognized Dr. Singletary's talent and love \nfor teaching and twice honored him with its Teaching Excellence Award. \nIn 1958, he received the Scarborough Teaching Excellence Award.\n  An accomplished historian and published author, Dr. Singletary soon \nbegan to show his skills in administrative positions as well. After \nserving as the Associate Dean of Arts and Sciences at Texas, Dr. \nSingletary relocated to the University of North Carolina at Greensboro \nwhere he served as chancellor. In 1964, he took a leave of absence to \ndirect the Federal Job Corps, Office of Economic Opportunity, under \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson. Later, he served as the vice-president of \nthe American Council on Education.\n\n[[Page S12362]]\n\n  For most people this career would represent a lifetime worth of \nachievement, but Dr. Singletary was just getting started. He assumed \nthe presidency of the University of Kentucky in 1969, a time of \nnational campus unrest. While other college leaders faltered in the \nwake of the Kent State tragedy, Dr. Singletary successfully calmed the \nfears of his students and led the university forward. Under his \nguidance, the University of Kentucky prospered and became a nationally \nrecognized research institution. To compensate for shrinking State \nfunds, Dr. Singletary encouraged a vigorous fundraising campaign \ntargeting private donors. He raised almost $140 million in his 18-year \npresidency. A selective admissions policy, endowed professorships, the \nexpansion of library holdings, and an undergraduate honors program were \nall implemented during his tenure. Upon his retirement in 1987, Dr. \nSingletary had supervised over $250 million in new construction and \nrenovation at UK, including facilities for the arts, biological \nsciences, equine research, agriculture, and cancer research.\n  Dr. Otis Singletary will forever be remembered for his unwavering \ndedication to the University of Kentucky, its faculty, staff, and its \nstudents. I ask each of my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to \nOtis Singletary, for all that he has given to his students, his \ncommunity, and his Nation. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12362-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JUSTICE ROBERT E. ROSE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I take a moment to pay tribute to a long-\ntime friend and Nevadan, Justice Robert E. ``Bob'' Rose, who is being \nhonored by the Fellows of the American College of Trial Lawyers.\n  Justice Rose was elected to the Nevada Supreme Court in 1988. He was \nre-elected in 1994 and again in 2000.\n  However, before Justice Rose was a member of the Nevada Supreme \nCourt, he was elected Washoe County District Attorney and thereafter \nLieutenant Governor of Nevada. In fact, he was my successor in that \noffice.\n  After serving as Lieutenant Governor, he returned to the private \npractice of law for several years in Reno, NV.\n  In 1986, he was appointed District Court Judge for the Eighth \nJudicial District in Las Vegas by former Governor, who is also a former \nU.S. Senator, Richard Bryan.\n  The road to the Nevada Supreme Court started at a young age for Bob \nRose. The dream began in 1964 when he clerked there for one year \nfollowing his graduation from New York University Law School.\n  While he set his sights high, his path wasn't always an easy one. I \nremember during his tenure as Lieutenant Governor, he cast a vote in \nthe Nevada State Legislature on a very controversial Equal Rights \nAmendment. It was 1977, and he cast the tie-breaking vote against it.\n  It is not always easy to live and work in the public spotlight, but \nhe did what he felt was right. He has always been a man of courage and \nintegrity.\n  In his time to date on the Nevada Supreme Court, he has served as \nChief Justice, and he has earned a reputation as a ``reformer'' by \ncreating the Nevada Judicial Assessment Commission for the study and \nimprovement of the courts. He has also chaired and cochaired the \nCommittee to Establish Nevada Business Court and the Nevada Jury \nImprovement Commission, respectively.\n  Additionally, Justice Rose has been active with the Nevada Democratic \nParty, the American Cancer Society, and Nevada Easter Seal.\n  Today I would like to say to my friend, Bob, Justice Rose, \ncongratulations on the honor you are receiving and good luck to you in \nall your future endeavors. As a lawyer and a Nevadan, I am proud to \nhave you on our State Supreme Court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12362-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Atlanta, \nGA. In May 2001, Ahmed Dabarran, a gay man who was a Fulton County \nAssistant District Attorney, was brutally beaten and murdered. \nDabarran's perceived sexual orientation by his attacker was a \nmotivating factor in his death. Sadly, even though his killer confessed \nto the crime, a Cobb County, GA, jury later acquitted him.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12362-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12362-S12363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           LESSONS OF 9/11 AND THE D.C. AREA SNIPER SHOOTINGS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. A year ago, the entire capital region was terrorized by \nunknown killers striking randomly, without warning, without any \ndiscernible pattern, and without mercy. Sadly, we know now that those \nsavage murders could have been prevented.\n  On 9/11/2001, we had learned that the oceans could no longer protect \nus from the terrorism that has plagued other nations. We learned that \nour law enforcement agencies and our intelligence agencies were not \nadequately organized, trained, or prepared to identify the terrorists \nand prevent them from striking.\n  We learned, especially from the report of the Senate and House \nIntelligence Committees, that there were serious problems with \ninformation analysis and information sharing between agencies at the \nFederal, State and local levels, and even between Federal agencies.\n  As the FBI Director told the committees, no one can say whether the \ntragedy of 9/11 could have been prevented if all of the problems of our \nforeign and domestic intelligence and law enforcement agencies had been \ncorrected before 9/11. But 9/11 was certainly a wakeup call to these \nagencies. They were on notice that, whatever the reasons for their \nfailure to connect the many ``dots'' which their separate activities \nhad uncovered before the terrorist attacks, they needed to change their \nways.\n  The tragic DC area killings of a year ago, in which 13 people were \nshot and 10 lost their lives, provided a dramatic test of how well we \nhad learned the lessons of 9/11. At the time, we had no way of knowing \nwhether the shootings were the work of demented citizens, homegrown \nterrorists, or foreign terrorists bent on spreading mortal fear among \nthe people.\n  In many ways, the law enforcement response was a model of the lessons \nalready learned. Over 1,300 Federal agents of all types joined hundreds \nof State and local law enforcement personnel in a joint intensive \neffort to identify and apprehend the killers. The cooperation among law \nenforcement agencies in the area was close and seemingly effective.\n  But in some vital respects, the events of last October revealed \nshockingly that a year after 9/11, we had not yet filled obvious gaps \nin our day-to-day law enforcement and intelligence activities.\n  We had not made sure that all of the Nation's police agencies at all \nlevels were communicating with each other with the fastest possible \ntechnology, and acting in real time to share the useful information \nthey had gathered.\n  Unfortunately, too much of the national effort had been invested in \narguing over broad and controversial new investigative and enforcement \npowers that threatened draconian violations of basic rights and \nliberties, with little benefit to homeland security.\n  These debates deflected attention from the urgent need to assure that \nevery jurisdiction in the Nation has--and uses--full access to the vast \narray of already available Federal resources specifically designed to \nassist them in their local responsibilities. The DC sniper case showed \nus a year ago that we need even more focus on this very practical and \nachievable goal, and less focus on the distracting shortcuts urged on \nthe Nation by those who believe we must sacrifice our rights to gain \nsecurity.\n\n[[Page S12363]]\n\n  A year ago, we learned again that the national law enforcement system \nis only as strong as its weakest link. If all jurisdictions everywhere \nare not full partners in the legitimate, practical, day-to-day \noperations of the existing national system for information sharing and \nFederal-State cooperation, each of us anywhere is at risk.\n  The information now available demonstrates that the enormous \ntragedies of a year ago might well have been entirely prevented if \nauthorities in a State far from the Washington area had used the \nexisting Federal resources available to them.\n  The fact is, on the night of September 21, 2002, 11 days before the \nsniper shootings began in the Washington area, the local police in \nMontgomery, AL, obtained a clear fingerprint of a suspect in a brutal \nrobbery and murder. As we now know, that fingerprint matched a print on \nfile in the FBI electronic matching system.\n\n  That information could have quickly led the authorities to Malvo and \nMuhammad, the two people later charged with the Washington area \nkillings that began on October 2 that year.\n  A State crime laboratory with a few thousand dollars worth of proper \nhardware and free software from the FBI could have transmitted the \nAlabama fingerprint to the FBI system on Sunday morning, September 22. \nThat system would have automatically compared the print with the 45 \nmillion prints in the system. The matching print could have been found \nand identified by the FBI by noon on that Sunday. In fact, the FBI's \naverage response time on such print matches was 3 hours and 16 minutes \nlast year.\n  The FBI's State assistance program makes it easy and inexpensive for \na State to transmit unidentified prints directly to the automated \nfingerprint system. The Justice Department even provides grants to help \nwith the costs.\n  But 15 States, including the State of Alabama, are not yet fully \nconnected to the FBI system. They cannot transmit the fingerprints \nfound at crime scenes directly to the FBI's automated 24-hour-a-day \nfingerprint searching system.\n  In the Alabama case, had the full facilities available from the \nFederal Government been utilized, look-out alerts or arrest warrants \nfor the Alabama murder suspects could have been circulated throughout \nthe Nation some time between September 22 and September 24, followed \nquickly by the description and license plate number of the car they \nwere using.\n  In other words, at least 7 full days before the first shooting in the \nWashington area, Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies \ncould have identified Muhammad and Malvo and could have been searching \nurgently for them, because they were wanted for the robbery/murder in \nAlabama. Tragically, we now know that local police officers in two \nother States made traffic stops of the suspects' car and checked the \ndriver's license and plates with the national databases during those 7 \ndays. But because the readily available national system had not been \nused, those checks produced no response. Malvo and Muhammad were not \napprehended, and the DC area sniper shootings took place.\n  It is not my purpose to single out Alabama for special blame. This is \na national problem. Fifteen States are not fully connected to the FBI's \nelectronic matching system. Many other States may not take full \nadvantage of this and other Federal resources.\n  The FBI spent $640 million building its fingerprint system, because \nit persuaded Congress that ``if we build it they will come.'' The \nsystem works well beyond the planners' dreams. It usually responds on a \nten-fingerprint check of an arrested suspect within 20 minutes. It \nusually reports on an unknown single fingerprint within about 3 hours.\n  Thirty-five States are fully using this valuable resource. They use \nthe system routinely and automatically, because as one police official \nput it, ``You catch bad guys'' this way. In fact, some police \ndepartments sent the FBI all the old unidentified prints they had as \nsoon as they connected to the system. Time after time, even very old \nprints from unsolved cases were matched with prints in the system, and \nold crimes were finally solved.\n  On this sad anniversary of the DC sniper shootings, I hesitate to \ndiscuss these painful facts, when the victims' families are still \ngrieving. But I, too, have been where they are now, and so I feel I can \nspeak the painful truth, the truth that will teach us how to make the \nfuture better than the past.\n  The truth is that we now know this tragedy could have been \nprevented--not by tougher laws or more intrusive investigative powers, \nnot by ethnic or racial profiling, but by strengthening and fully using \nthe effective systems we already have in place.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft wants even more law enforcement powers that \nwill threaten still more basic rights. But I say, let's fix the nuts \nand bolts of the system we already have. It is a scandal that 15 of our \nStates are still not fully linked to the FBI system. The financial cost \nis small, and Federal grants are available to defray it and pay the \ncost of any training that is needed. Hopefully, no such avoidable \ntragedy will ever happen again, and the victims we mourn and honor \ntoday will not have died in vain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12363-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12363-S12364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CHANGE IN INTERNET SERVICES USAGE RULES AND REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to \nspeak in memory of U.S. Army Sgt Travis Friedrich, of Naugatuck, CT, \nwho was killed fighting for his country in Iraq on Saturday, September \n20. He was 26 years old.\n  Like so many of our brave men and women who are serving overseas \ntoday, Sgt Friedrich was a reservist. He was a graduate student at the \nUniversity of New Haven, working on his degree in forensic science, and \nwas also working full-time as a laboratory technician in Waterbury.\n  When he was summoned to active duty in January, he left behind family \nand friends who loved him, and a promising education and career. But \nSgt Friedrich answered his country's call and he did so in exemplary \nfashion.\n  Sgt Friedrich grew up in Hammond, NY, and was a shining star in both \nacademics and athletics. He graduated from Brockport State College, \nmajoring in chemistry and criminal justice, and came to Connecticut 3 \nyears ago with dreams of becoming an investigator in law enforcement. \nTragically, it was a dream he would not live to fulfill.\n  Everyone who knew Travis Friedrich said that he represented the best \nof the American armed forces and, indeed, the best of America. His \nfriends remembered his sense of humor, and his leadership as co-captain \nof his college crew team. He also had a tremendous work ethic whether \nhe was on the field of battle, in a classroom, or on the job. And he \nloved his family and friends, just as he loved his country.\n  When people like Travis Friedrich make the decision to enlist in our \narmed forces, they do so knowing that one day, they could be called \nupon to make profound sacrifices--and possibly the ultimate sacrifice--\nfor this nation, and the values and freedoms that we represent.\n  That's not an easy decision to make, but for an individual with the \ncourage and the integrity of Travis Friedrich, it was a natural one. \n``Wherever I go,'' Sergeant Friedrich once said, ``I want to do my \nshare.'' He did his share, and much, much more.\n  I salute Travis Friedrich for his bravery, his heroism, and his \nservice to his country. I offer my most sincere condolences to his \nparents, David and Elizabeth, and to all of his friends and family.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to express our Nation's \ndeepest thanks and gratitude to a young man and his family from Casper, \nWY. On September 23rd, 2003, Cpt Robert L. Lucero was killed in the \nline of duty in Iraq. While searching a building in Tikrit, Captain \nLucero was fatally wounded by an explosive device that took his life \nand injured another soldier.\n  Captain Lucero was a member of the Wyoming National Guard, and was \nthe very model of the citizen soldier. He was a vibrant young man who \nloved being outdoors and was an avid hunter and fisherman. He loved his \nfamily and his country. Captain Lucero had a profound sense of duty and \nfelt a strict obligation to his country and his job as an American \nsoldier.\n  It is because of people such as Captain Lucero that we continue to \nlive safe and secure. America's men and women who answer the call of \nservice and wear our Nation's uniform deserve respect and recognition \nfor the enormous burden that they willingly bear. Our people put \neverything on the line everyday, and because of these folks, our Nation \nremains free and strong in the face of danger.\n  Captain Lucero is survived by his wife Sherry and his mother Lois \nAnn, as well as many family and friends. We way good bye to a son, a \nhusband, a brother, a soldier, and an American. Our Nation pays its \ndeepest respect to Cpt Robert L. Lucero for his courage, his love of \ncountry and his sacrifice, so that we may remain free. He was a hero in \nlife and he remains a hero in death. All of Wyoming, and indeed the \nentire Nation was proud of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12364-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12364-S12365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE PROGRAM\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nstatement and efforts of my colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nBingaman, on behalf of the Essential Air Service, EAS, program.\n  Throughout my time in Congress, I have been a strong supporter of \nEAS, which provides subsidized air service to 125 small communities in \nthe country, including four in Maine--Augusta, Rockland, Bar Harbor and \nPresque Isle--that would otherwise be cut off from the nation's air \ntransportation network. As approved in May by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill \nreauthorized and flat-funded the program for 3 years, and includes \ncertain changes to the program, which are drastically scaled back from \nwhat the Administration proposed earlier this year for EAS ``reform.'' \nThe Administration had called for EAS towns to provide up to 25 percent \nmatching contributions to keep their air service.\n  The Commerce Committee bill creates a number of new programs to help \nEAS communities grow their ridership, including a marketing incentive \nprogram that would financially reward EAS towns for achieving ridership \ngoals. With regard to local cost-sharing--the centerpiece of the \nAdministration's EAS proposal--the Commerce bill would create a pilot \nprogram to allow for a 10 percent annual community match at no more \nthan 10 airports within 100 miles of a large airport.\n  While the cost-sharing provisions in the committee bill are much less \nstrict than the Administration proposal, and could only be applied to a \nEAS community under certain specific conditions, I remain concerned \nabout the concept of requiring EAS towns--some of which are cash-\nstrapped and economically depressed--from kicking in hundreds of \nthousands of dollars annually to keep their air service. For example, \nif Augusta or Rockland, ME, were to be chosen for the cost-sharing \npilot program, they would have to come up with more than $120,000 \nannually to retain their air service.\n  As such, on the floor I supported Senator Bingaman's amendment to \nstrike the cost-sharing section from the bill and was pleased when it \nwas approved unanimously by the full Senate. The House adopted an \nidentical amendment\n\n[[Page S12365]]\n\noffered by Representative Peterson. And I felt so strongly about this \nissue that in late July I circulated a letter to the FAA conferees, \nsigned by 15 other Senators, expressing strong opposition to having \nmandatory EAS cost-sharing language in the final legislative package. \nAs such, I was extremely disappointed when that same language found \nitself into the FAA conference report issued on July 25.\n  Mr. President, the EAS program is not perfect, and Congress certainly \nneeds to do all we can to keep the costs and subsidy levels associated \nwith the program as low as possible. I look forward to working with \nmembers of the Commerce Committee and the Senate on the issue, but I \ncontinue to believe that requiring cost-sharing in today's economy and \ntoday's aviation environment is clearly a wrong-headed approach.\n  I also wanted to take this opportunity to address the larger issue of \nthe importance of air service to America's small communities. As we \nwork to address the vital aviation issues facing the country, we cannot \nforget the challenges that small communities in Maine, and throughout \nthe Nation, face in attracting and retaining air service. I have always \nbelieved that adequate, reliable air service in our Nation's rural \nareas is not simply a luxury or a convenience. It is an imperative. And \nquite frankly, I have serious concerns about the impact deregulation of \nthe airline industry has had on small- and medium-sized cities in rural \nareas, like Maine. The fact is, since deregulation, many of these \ncommunities in Maine, and elsewhere, have experienced a decrease in \nflights and size of aircraft while seeing an increase in fares. More \nthan 300 have lost air service altogether.\n  Many air carriers are experiencing an unprecedented financial crisis, \nand the first routes on the chopping block will be those to small- and \nmedium-sized communities. This will only increase demand for the two \nexisting Federal forms of assistance, EAS and the Small Community Air \nService Grant Program.\n  In short, when considering this legislation, I believe that we need \nto do all we can to help small communities maintain their access to the \nnational transportation system during these difficult times. Mandatory \nEAS cost-sharing would have the opposite effect, and I hope that the \nconferees strip it out should the bill be recommitted to conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12365-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MOTHER TERESA OF CALCUTTA\n\n  Mrs. Boxer. Mr. President, I rise to speak in praise of the late \nMother Teresa of Calcutta, who will be canonized as a Roman Catholic \nsaint later this month.\n  Her life and work were a blessing to everyone, regardless of creed or \nreligion. No one who ever saw her--even on television--will ever forget \nMother Teresa: the tiny nun with the wrinkled face, beaming smile, and \npenetrating eyes filled with love and understanding. And no one who \nlearned of her work among the poorest of the poor will ever forget her \ngentle challenge to us all to do more for our fellow human beings.\n  Mother Teresa inspired us not only by her good works but by the \nspirit of love and respect for every individual that permeated her \nwork. As she herself said in accepting the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, \n``Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do, but how much love \nwe put in the action that we do.'' She accepted the prize ``in the name \nof the hungry, the naked, the homeless, of the crippled, of the blind, \nof the lepers, of all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared-\nfor throughout society, people who have become a burden to the society \nand are shunned by everyone.''\n  In presenting the prize to Mother Teresa, Chairman John Sanness of \nthe Norwegian Nobel Committee noted: ``The hallmark of her work has \nbeen respect for the individual's worth and dignity. . . . In her eyes \nthe person who, in the accepted sense, is the recipient, is also the \ngiver, and the one who gives most. Giving--giving something of \noneself--is what confers real joy, and the person who is allowed to \ngive is the one who receives the most precious gift.''\n  In her final years, Mother Teresa focused her attention and \nprodigious energy on establishing hospice programs for people with \nAIDS. ``It is a terrible tragedy to have AIDS,'' she said, ``but it is \nworse to be unloved.'' Perhaps more than any other person, Mother \nTeresa changed the way that the world sees AIDS. The broad, bipartisan \nsupport for international AIDS programs that has emerged in the United \nStates Congress is largely a result of her work and message of love and \ncompassion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12365-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12365-S12367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FAA REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes \non the pending reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. \nA conference report on HR 2115 was filed back in July, and since then \nthere has been no further action in either house of Congress.\n  As I see it, the problem with the bill is that the conferees on the \npart of the majority chose to conduct a back-room conference without \nthe participation of the minority. This was a flawed process, and the \nresult is a conference report that can't pass either the House or the \nSenate. The House is now poised to recommit the bill to the conference. \nMeanwhile, Congress had to pass a short-term extension of FAA's \nadministration just to keep the agency in operation.\n  I think by now all Senators are aware of the many concerns that have \nbeen raised over the FAA conference report. On a number of key \nmeasures, the conferees ignored the will of the majority in the House \nand the Senate and arbitrarily inserted provisions that both houses had \nvoted to oppose. I believe adding such extraneous and objectionable \nprovisions is an egregious violation of the conference process. All \nSenators should be offended by what the conferees did in this case.\n  Senator Reid spoke Tuesday about the conferees' rejection of House- \nand Senate-passed provisions regarding privatization of federal air \ntraffic controllers. I was pleased to support Senator Lautenberg's \nbipartisan amendment on this issue, which passed the Senate 56 to 41. I \nwant to reinforce what my colleague Senator Reid said yesterday about \nthe air traffic control system. The privatization issue must be dealt \nwith fairly, or the bill will not pass the Senate.\n  Another particularly egregious violation of the conference process \nwas a provision the conferees added affecting the Essential Air Service \nprogram, which helps small, rural communities maintain their vital \ncommercial air service. In my State, five communities participate in \nEAS: Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Clovis, Hobbs, and Silver City. For these \ncommunities, commercial air service provides a critical link to the \nnational and international transportation network that would not \notherwise exist.\n  The FAA reauthorization bill originally reported by the Senate \nCommerce Committee would have required EAS communities for the first \ntime to pay to maintain their commercial air. In my view, this ill-\ntimed proposal would have jeopardized existing commercial air service \nin many rural areas. Across America, our small communities are facing \ndepressed economies and declining tax revenues and are simply not in a \nposition to pay for their commercial air service.\n  To help preserve essential air service, Senator Inhofe and I offered \nan amendment with 13 cosponsors that struck out the mandatory cost-\nsharing language. Our bipartisan amendment was adopted on a voice vote. \nIn parallel, Representatives McHugh, Peterson of Pennsylvania, and \nShuster offered an amendment that struck out similar mandatory cost-\nsharing language in the House's bill.\n  As a followup to our amendment, Senator Snowe and I, along with \nSenators Nelson of Nebraska, Bunning, Schumer, Brownback, Lincoln, \nJeffords, Clinton, Inhofe, Leahy, Pryor, Collins, Hagel, Grassley, and \nHarkin, sent a bipartisan letter to the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Commerce Committee reinforcing our strong opposition to mandatory \ncost-sharing for EAS communities.\n  Most students of Government would tell you that when a majority of \nboth houses of Congress have voted against a particular measure, the \nconferees couldn't arbitrarily put it back in. Well, they did. Section \n408 of the conference report basically restores the very cost-sharing \nlanguage both\n\n[[Page S12366]]\n\nHouses one month before had voted to reject.\n  This week, with the FAA conference report soon going to be \nrecommitted to the conference, 16 Senators wrote to the conferees \nexpressing grave concern over the restoration of the mandatory cost-\nsharing language and urging them to drop this harmful provision before \nthe conference report is brought back to the full House and Senate. \nThirty-five members of the House signed a similar bipartisan letter.\n  I want to pass an FAA reauthorization bill. The FAA plays an \nimportant role in assuring the safety of the traveling public. At the \nsame time, New Mexico's 51 airports are in desperate need of the \nFederal funding provided under the FAA's Airport Improvement Program. I \nhope all Senators are aware that AIP was not extended under the first \ncontinuing resolution, and all new airport construction projects are on \nhold pending the reauthorization. With the serious unemployment \nsituation the Nation faces, this is no time to shut down the jobs these \nvital airport construction projects produce.\n  I've come to the floor today to urge the conferees to work together \nin a bipartisan manner to produce a conference report that all Senators \ncan support. Inserting controversial measures in conference that are \nopposed by both houses has left us with an FAA conference report that \nis essentially dead. In my opinion, imposing mandatory cost sharing for \nEAS communities, which a majority in both houses rejected, will only \ndelay further the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  I do believe that by returning the FAA bill to conference we can \nbegin to work in a bipartisan manner to restore integrity to the \nconference process that all Senators should demand. When this bill goes \nback to conference, I urge the FAA conferees to do the right thing for \nrural communities across America by preserving the Essential Air \nService Program.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced letters in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2003.\n     Hon.

Ernest Hollings,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science \n         and Transportation, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n        Dear Gentlemen: We want to thank you for your leadership \n     in developing S. 824, ``The Aviation Reinvestment and \n     Revitalization Vision Act'' (AIR-V). As you lead the Senate \n     conferees and complete work on settling differences in the \n     House companion, H.R. 2115, we want to express our support \n     for the Senate position and our strong opposition to the \n     inclusion of any Essential Air Service (EAS) mandatory cost-\n     sharing language in the final legislative package.\n        As you know, EAS provides subsidized commercial air \n     service to 125 small communities nationwide that would \n     otherwise be cut off from the air transportation network. The \n     Committee-reported version of S. 824 includes a number of \n     innovative provisions to help EAS communities grow their \n     ridership, including a marketing incentive program that would \n     financially reward EAS towns for achieving ridership goals. \n     At the same time, the Committee's bill proposed a pilot \n     program requiring a 10 percent annual community cost-sharing \n     requirement at EAS airports within 100 miles of any hub \n     airport. In the end, the full Senate did not endorse the \n     concept of an annual local community match, having on June 12 \n     unanimously approved an amendment offered by Senators \n     Bingaman and Inhofe to strike the EAS cost-sharing provisions \n     in S. 824. In addition, the House passed its FAA \n     Reauthorization bill after voting not to include cost-sharing \n     for EAS.\n        While the Commerce Committee's proposed cost-sharing would \n     have only applied to an EAS community under certain specific \n     conditions, we remain concerned about the concept of \n     mandatory cost-sharing. Some of these cash-strapped \n     communities in economically depressed rural areas of our \n     states would be unable to contribute the hundreds of \n     thousands of dollars necessary to keep their air service. As \n     such, we ask that the final version of the FAA \n     Reauthorization legislation reflect the Senate's position on \n     this issue and not include any EAS cost-sharing language.\n        We look forward to working with you and other members of \n     the Senate Commerce Committee on modernizing and \n     strengthening the EAS program. Thank you for your \n     consideration of our views on this issue and we hope they \n     will be considered during the upcoming conference committee.\n           Sincerely,\n         Olympia Snowe, Jeff Bingaman, E. Benjamin Nelson, Jim \n           Bunning, Charles Schumer, Sam Brownback, Blanche L. \n           Lincoln, James M. Jeffords, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jim \n           Inhofe, Patrick Leahy, Mark Pryor, Susan Collins, Chuck \n           Hagel, Chuck Grassley, Tom Harkin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2003.\n     Hon.

James Oberstar,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and \n         Infrastructure, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Gentlemen: We write out of grave concern for a provision \n     added to the Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization \n     conference report regarding the adoption of a local cost \n     share for certain Essential Air Service communities. This \n     addition to the conference report not only goes against the \n     will of both the House and the Senate, but may also have a \n     disastrous effect on many of our small rural airports. \n     Therefore, we urge the conference committee to remove this \n     language before bringing the report to the respective floors \n     for a vote.\n       The local cost share provision was removed from S. 824 by a \n     bipartisan amendment offered by 15 senators, which passed on \n     a voice vote. Likewise, a similar local cost share provision \n     was removed from H.R. 2115 by an amendment offered by \n     Representatives McHugh, Peterson (PA) and Shuster.\n       It is our understanding that negotiations are currently \n     under way to remove language from the conference report \n     regarding the privatization of air traffic controllers. This \n     provides the conference committee an excellent opportunity to \n     remove the EAS local match provision that was already \n     stricken on both the House and Senate floors and not included \n     in either bill brought to the conference committee.\n       Additionally, this provision will have untold effects on \n     many small rural communities. It is unacceptable to force \n     communities to pay up to $100,000 in a local cost share, in \n     addition to the many costs they currently incur in running a \n     small local airport.\n       We respectfully request the removal of Section 408 from the \n     Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act \n     conference report before it is brought to the House and \n     Senate floors for consideration, and we look forward to \n     working with you in the future to ensure rural communities \n     continue to receive essential air service.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jeff Bingaman, Olympia Snowe, Hillary Rodham Clinton, \n           Patrick Leahy, Blanche L.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge our Nation's \nindependent community pharmacists for their diligent work, expansion of \nservices, and consistent high quality service.\n  Independent community pharmacies are a strong part of our health care \ndelivery system and a significant part of local economies. In fact, \nindependent pharmacies, independent pharmacy franchises, and \nindependent chains represent a $67 billion marketplace. Clearly, \nindependent pharmacies create jobs while providing high quality \nservices to consumers.\n  Independent community pharmacies play a critical role in local \ncommunities, a role which has enhanced the level and quality of \npharmacist-patient personal interactions and has led to high \nsatisfaction rates from consumers. Independent pharmacies should be \ncommended for their accessibility, immense knowledge about medications, \nand broad inventories of medications. These observations were validated \nby more than 32,000 readers surveyed by Consumer Reports, which found \nthat ``more than 85 percent of customers at independent drugstores were \nvery satisfied or completely satisfied with their experience.''\n  Pharmacists are health care professionals who consistently strive to \nimprove care and promote the safe use of drugs. In addition to \ndispensing medications, many independent pharmacies offer other \nservices to meet the needs of their customers. This includes providing \nhealth screenings, disease management information, and even home \ndelivery.\n  I am honored today to recognize the achievements of independent \npharmacies for their excellent job in serving the pharmaceutical and \nother health care needs of consumers in their communities. As Congress \nmoves forward with enacting a Medicare prescription drug benefit, it is \nessential that we preserve the quality care being provided by community \npharmacies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an \narticle from the October 2003 issue of Consumer Reports.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Time To Switch Drugstores?\n\n       If you're among the 47 percent of Americans who get \n     medicine from drugstore giants such as CVS, Eckerd, and Rite \n     Aid, here's a prescription: Try shopping somewhere else. The \n     best place to start looking is one of the 25,000 independent \n     pharmacies that are making a comeback throughout the U.S.\n       Independent stores, which were edging toward extinction a \n     few years ago, won top honors from Consumer Reports readers, \n     besting the big chains by an eye-popping margin. More than 85 \n     percent of customers at independent drugstores were very \n     satisfied or completely satisfied with their experience, \n     compared with 58 percent of chain-drugstore customers.\n       Many supermarket and mass-merchant pharmacies also did a \n     better job than the best-known conventional chains at \n     providing caring, courteous, knowledgeable, and timely \n     service. And in a nationwide price study we conducted, the \n     chains we evaluated charged the highest prices--even slightly \n     more than the independents.\n       Those findings come from our latest investigation into the \n     best places to shop for prescription medications. More than \n     32,000 readers told us about more than 40,000 experiences at \n     31 national and regional drugstore chains (like CVS, \n     Genovese, Osco, Rite Aid, and Walgreens); supermarket-\n     pharmacy combos (such as Kroger, Publix, and Safeway); \n     mass-merchant pharmacies (like Costco, Target, and Wal-\n     Mart); and independent pharmacies across the nation.\n       For most consumers, insurance covers at least some of the \n     cost of prescription drugs, so our Ratings emphasize service \n     factors that affect everyone. For consumers who have to pay \n     more than a small percentage of their prescription-drug \n     costs, including more than a third of our readers, our price \n     study indicated where to save money. (See Where to shop, how \n     to save.)\n       Among the other highlights of our research:\n       Some of the drugstore chains and supermarkets that readers \n     favored are family owned or businesses in which workers have \n     a stake. Medicine Shoppe, the top ``chain,'' is actually a \n     collection of about 1,000 individually owned and operated \n     stores with a common parent company. Among supermarkets, \n     high-rated Wegmans (in New Jersey, New York, and \n     Pennsylvania) is family owned; and at high-rated Publix (in \n     the South), most workers are stockholders.\n       Forty percent of readers said that at least once during the \n     past year, their drugstore was out of the medicine they \n     needed.\n       Our market basket of a month's worth of five widely \n     prescribed medications cost $377 to $555, depending on where \n     we shopped. For a family needing all five drugs, that \n     difference would exceed $2,000 a year.\n\n\n                         sorting out the stores\n\n       Most people start by searching for a store that accepts \n     their insurance plan. Fortunately, that isn't the hassle it \n     used to be, especially since independents are accepting more \n     plans these days. Insurers once considered the disparate \n     stores too much trouble to work with, but they realized that \n     keeping independents out of their networks alienated \n     customers and didn't cut costs as much as they'd hoped. Also, \n     33 states have adopted ``any willing provider'' laws, which \n     require insurance companies to take into their networks any \n     pharmacy that's willing to accept the insurer's reimbursement \n     rate. As a result, you have a greater choice of where and how \n     to shop.\n       The basic choices:\n       Independents: Service is all. Prescription drugs are the \n     independents' lifeblood, accounting for 88 percent of sales. \n     That means independents can be a good source of hard-to-find \n     medications. (The chains, where drugs account for 64 percent \n     of sales, tend to focus on the 200 most-prescribed drugs.)\n       That focus on prescriptions can mean more personal \n     attention. Readers said that pharmacists at independent \n     stores were accessible, approachable, and easy to talk to, \n     and that they were especially knowledgeable about \n     medications, both prescription and nonprescription.\n       The independents (and some chains) offer extras such as \n     disease-management education, in-store health screenings for \n     cholesterol, services such as compounding (customizing \n     medications for patients with special needs), and home \n     delivery.\n       Many independents are affiliated with programs such as Good \n     Neighbor or Value-Rite, whose names you'll see in the stores. \n     These ``banner'' programs, offered by wholesale product \n     suppliers, help independents with marketing and with the sale \n     of private-label products, improving purchasing power and \n     name recognition much the way ServiStar and True Value \n     help small hardware stores compete with Home Depot and \n     Lowe's.\n       About half of the nation's independents have Web sites, \n     where you can generally order medicine and find some health \n     information but not much more.\n       Chains: Convenient but crowded. With about 20,000 stores \n     nationwide, mega-drugstores are in nearly everyone's \n     backyard. Many are open around the clock, have a drive-\n     through pharmacy for faster pickup, and let you order online \n     or by punching a few numbers on a telephone. You can even set \n     up your Web account to have renewals automatically processed \n     and readied for pickup or mailing. The biggest chains let you \n     check prices online. Another advantage: The chains accept \n     payment from lots of health plans (managed care pays for 80 \n     percent of all conventional-chain prescriptions).\n       Now for the drawbacks. The chains' locations in populous \n     areas and their acceptance of a plethora of plans has made \n     them, in effect, too popular, and service is suffering. \n     Except for Medicine Shoppe, chains typically made readers \n     wait longer, were slower to fill orders, and provided less \n     personal attention than other types of drugstores.\n       Like other drugstores, the chains have experienced \n     shrinking reimbursement from insurers. They've helped \n     maintain profits by selling everything from milk to Halloween \n     costumes. That makes one-stop shopping possible (if your list \n     isn't too specific), but it also can create bottlenecks at \n     the checkout.\n       Supermarkets: One stop does it. There are fewer than 9,000 \n     supermarkets that include a pharmacy, but the number is \n     rising. One-stop shopping is the attraction. Many \n     supermarkets put the pharmacy near the entrance for easy \n     access and to attract store traffic. For those very reasons, \n     however, you may not have as much privacy to consult with the \n     druggist as you would elsewhere.\n       Supermarkets have online pharmacy sites, usually as a link \n     from the home page, but they're often less comprehensive than \n     those of big drugstore chains.\n\n[[Page S12368]]\n\n       Mass merchants: Low price is key. Like supermarkets, these \n     stores sell a wide variety of goods. But their main draw is \n     low prices. One in five readers who bought medication from a \n     mass merchant had no prescription-drug coverage. In our price \n     study, only Web sites sold medications as cheaply. In our \n     survey, ShopKo and Target were among the high-rated mass \n     merchants; Wal-Mart was worse than most others.\n       All of the mass merchants in our survey have Web sites for \n     ordering prescriptions, but only the Costco site lets you \n     check drug prices.\n       Online: Low prices, no face time. Virtual pharmacies come \n     in two basic flavors. There are adjuncts to brick-and-mortar \n     stores, where you can order online and receive your \n     prescription by mail or pick it up. Then there are sites such \n     as www.drugstore.com and www.aarppharmacy.com, which have no \n     store and simply mail the medicine to you. With both types of \n     site, you can enter the name and quantity of the drug online; \n     a pharmacist will confirm the prescription with your doctor. \n     (Often, you can fax or mail a paper prescription instead and \n     wait for it to be approved, but that can add days to the \n     process.)\n       Anytime you're not picking up from a pharmacist, you lose a \n     chance for personal contact, a consideration if you're using \n     a medication for the first time or are juggling medications. \n     To compensate, the stand-alone Web sites--and those operated \n     by the drug chains and some mass merchants--make it easy to \n     e-mail questions to pharmacists 24/7, research medical \n     topics, search online for potentially dangerous drug \n     interactions, receive e-mail refill reminders, keep track of \n     your medications, and note any drug allergies. Drugstore.com \n     will also alert you if the branded drug you're taking becomes \n     available in generic form.\n       It can take as little as a couple of hours for your \n     medicine to be ready if you order from a chain and are \n     willing to retrieve it, or as long as three to five business \n     days if you ask for it to be mailed standard shipping. That's \n     free or nearly so. You can pay about $15 to have medicine \n     overnighted (refrigerated medicines must be sent that way). \n     Web sites can't ship every controlled substance.\n       When you use a Web site, you can avoid waiting in line, of \n     course, and you'll tend to pay lower prices, even when \n     shipping costs are included. No computer? No problem. Sites \n     have toll-free numbers.\n       Four percent of our readers had bought medications online, \n     most often from drug chains, and three-quarters of those said \n     the transaction went smoothly: Their order was processed \n     quickly enough for their needs, and e-mailed questions were \n     answered promptly. (For details on ordering via the Web, see \n     The online option.)\n\n\n                         getting better service\n\n       Some stores did far better than others in service, speed, \n     and information provided by the druggist. The most frequent \n     complaints: Drugs were out of stock, readers had to wait a \n     long time for service at the pharmacy counter, and \n     prescriptions weren't ready.\n       Drugstore chains and supermarkets were most likely to be \n     out of a requested drug. When a drug was out of stock, \n     independents were able to obtain it within one day 80 percent \n     of the time, vs. about 55 to 60 percent for the other types \n     of stores. Only 9 percent of the time did independent \n     customers have to wait at least three days for an out-of-\n     stock drug or find it elsewhere, vs. at least 18 percent of \n     the time for other types of stores.\n       Drugs were out of stock more often this time than when we \n     published our last drugstore survey, in 1999. The steepest \n     jump took place at Albertsons, Giant, and Longs Drugs, whose \n     out-of-stocks increased by more than 15 percentage points. \n     That's probably the case in part because the number of \n     prescriptions being written is growing faster than the shelf \n     space.\n       Overall, 27 percent of readers complained about long waits. \n     It's no wonder. Pharmacists fill nearly 4 billion \n     prescriptions a year, an average of almost 200 per day for \n     each pharmacist, and spend one-fourth of their time on \n     administrative work such as calling doctors and dealing with \n     insurance companies. Moreover, there's a shortage of \n     druggists--there are approximately 5,500 job openings around \n     the U.S. At CVS, Genovese, Longs Drugs, and Sav-On, about 40 \n     percent of readers complained of long waits for service. \n     Lines were short at Medicine Shoppe (only 6 percent of \n     readers complained) and at the independents (8 percent).\n       Twenty percent of readers overall said that their \n     prescription wasn't ready when promised. Among the worst \n     offenders: CVS, Genovese, and Rite Aid, where prescriptions \n     weren't ready nearly one-third of the time. Better-prepared \n     stores included Medicine Shoppe, Publix, ShopKo, Winn-Dixie, \n     and the independents.\n       Other complaints focused on how pharmacists interact with \n     customers. Worst offenders: the drugstore chains, where 10 \n     percent of readers said they did not receive enough personal \n     attention from their pharmacist. Best: You guessed it--the \n     independents--where only 2 percent of readers found fault.\n       Service may improve in all stores, eventually. In many \n     states, regulators are giving technicians more authority to \n     assist druggists. Technology is also lending a hand in the \n     form of robotic machines that dispense medications. They do \n     everything but cap the bottle (which goes uncapped to the \n     pharmacist for a final inspection).\n       Although only a small fraction of doctors are now writing \n     e-prescriptions, they are the wave of the future. Doctors use \n     a handheld device to transmit your prescription to the \n     drugstore. The procedure avoids one of druggists' biggest \n     problems and a contributor to the rising incidence of drug \n     errors: deciphering doctors' handwriting.\n       While waiting for the future, you might improve the odds of \n     getting good service now by patronizing an independent \n     pharmacy. But whatever drugstore you use, you're apt to get \n     better service by following some simple advice:\n       Avoid waiting. Order drugs online or by phone, then pick \n     them up (or, if you're not in a rush, have them mailed). If \n     you plan to pick up drugs, check from home whether the doctor \n     and druggist have connected and the prescription is ready.\n       Establish a good relationship. Make sure you can step aside \n     and talk privately with the pharmacist and that you can reach \n     him or her by phone.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to an \nissue that affects every community in this country, and that is mental \nillness. Next week is Mental Illness Awareness Week, and I think the \nbest way that we in the Senate can recognize this event is to ensure \nparity for mental health treatment in our Nation's health care system.\n  Mental illness has a drastic impact not only on the country's health, \nbut also on its economic well-being. According to the 1999 Surgeon \nGeneral's report on mental illness, the unequal coverage of mental \nillness treatment results in direct business costs of at least $70 \nmillion per year, mostly due to lost productivity and increased use of \nsick leave. Earlier this year, the President's New Freedom Commission \non Mental Health released a report laying forth goals and objectives to \ntransform mental health care in the United States. According to this \nreport, mental illness ranks first among illnesses that cause \ndisability in this country, and the indirect costs of mental illness \nare estimated to be $79 billion a year. This report goes on to reaffirm \nthe President's call for Federal legislation to provide full parity \nbetween coverage for mental health care and for nonmental health care.\n  Over the past two decades we have made great strides in the area of \nmental illness. Not only are a number of innovative, beneficial \ntreatments available for sufferers of mental illness, but we have also \nworked to eradicate many of the social stigmas that have too often \naccompanied mental illness. However we still have much to do for those \nwho suffer from potentially debilitating and destructive mental \nillnesses.\n  Currently, those with mental illness often struggle to obtain \nnecessary medical treatment, even when they have sufficient health \ninsurance. Employers who offer health benefits to their employees can \nimpose limitations on the treatment of mental illness, while not \nplacing similar limitations on the treatment of physical illness. This \ndiscrimination prevents many from obtaining the medical treatment they \nneed.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to answer the President's call, \nand recognize Mental Illness Awareness Week by ensuring that those \nsuffering from mental illness have access to medical treatments that \nwill help them to preserve the quality of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12368-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12368-S12369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING THE U.S. ARMY FORCES COMMAND\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize the \nU.S. Army Forces Command, headquartered at Fort McPherson, GA, as it \ncelebrates 30 years of dedicated service to our great Nation.\n\n[[Page S12369]]\n\n  On July 1, 1973, U.S. Army Forces Command was formed as part of a \nDepartment of the Army initiative to reorganize its major headquarters \nand establish a professional, volunteer force.\n  U.S. Army Forces Command is the Army's largest major command. It \ntrains, mobilizes, and deploys ready land forces in support of \noperations worldwide. U.S. Army Forces Command units have been integral \nin fighting the global war on terrorism abroad as well as in defense of \nour homeland. These soldiers are deployed for our Nation in the \nBalkans, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Sinai, Central and South \nAmerica, and throughout the continental United States.\n  Having conducted the largest mobilization of Army Reserve and \nNational Guard forces since the Korean war in support of Operations \nNoble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom, U.S. Army Forces \nCommand units have demonstrated the strong and seamless partnership \nthat exists between the active and reserve components.\n  Wherever U.S. Army Forces Command's soldiers and units deploy, they \naccomplish their mission with exemplary professionalism. U.S. Army \nForces Command's soldiers across the globe are advancing the proud \nrecord of success achieved by earlier generations of American fighting \nmen and women.\n  I am extremely proud to have U.S. Army Forces Command headquartered \nin my State. I take this opportunity to commend them and ask my \ncolleagues to join me in honoring their 30th anniversary and offer best \nwishes for many more years of proud service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12369-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n TRIBUTE TO MS. SELENA FLORENCE'S CLASS AT ADAMSVILLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize a group of students in my home State of \nAlabama. In July, students from Adamsville Elementary in Adamsville, \nAL, traveled to San Francisco to present a portfolio at the seventh \nannual We the People: Project Citizen National Showcase. Middle school \nclasses from 43 States submitted portfolios on issues ranging from \ndrugs in schools to recycling. In each portfolio, students identified a \nproblem, evaluated alternative solutions, proposed a class policy, and \ndeveloped an action plan to implement their proposed policy. Portfolios \nwere evaluated by State legislators, legislative staff, and educators \nfrom across the country. Scoring criteria for the portfolios included \npersuasiveness, practicality, coordination, and reflection. Portfolios \nwere evaluated based on four levels of achievement: superior, \nexceptional, outstanding, and honorable mention.\n  The title of the Adamsville Elementary Project Citizen portfolio was \n``Making a Difference in Blackwell Park.'' The class chose to focus on \nBlackwell Park, a city park a few blocks from the school. The park is \nin bad shape and has deteriorated over the years. While there are funds \nin the city budget for the park, they have often been diverted to other \npark complexes. The class proposed a policy that would divide all the \nmoney in the city budget equally among the city's parks. I am proud to \nsay that the Adamsville students placed in the Exceptional Achievement \nLevel.\n  I would like to pay special tribute to the teacher of the class, \nSelena Florence. The students of the Adamsville Elementary Project \nCitizen class are: J.D. Barnes, Zaiere Brigman, Zach Burford, Brittany \nChandler, Dakota DeLuca, Sheldon Dumas, Demetrius Eutsey, Jessica \nGarrett, Tiffany Hayes, Josh Hughes, Braylen Jones, Chris Jones, Joshua \nLangford, Lauren Leblanc, Shelby Manning, Amanda McDuff, Justin Motley, \nShalani Offord, Nicole Sanders, Austin Shadix, Brandon Shipp, Rayna \nWarren, and Chatney Williams.\n  The achievements of these students are proof that the civic education \ninitiative we approved in this chamber is paying dividends. Project \nCitizen, which is part of the civic education initiative of the No \nChild Left Behind legislation, is giving students the lifelong skills \nthey need to be effective, engaged, and informed citizens. I commend \nthe Center for Civic Education and the National Conference of State \nLegislatures for their leadership in sponsoring this excellent service \nlearning-type program. I also would like to commend Wade Black, the \nstate coordinator from the Alabama Center for Law & Civic Education for \nhis work in administering the program in my State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12369-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATIONS TO DEBORAH FLATEMAN AND VERMONT FOOD BANK\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to \ncongratulate and thank Vermont Foodbank and its Chief Executive \nOfficer, Deborah Flateman, for their inspired tenacity and expertise in \nthe fight against hunger in Vermont. Access to nutritional food is a \nfundamental right for all people and the Vermont Foodbank's philosophy \nseeks to eradicate the persistence of hunger by constructing a system \nthat assures every person--not just the poor--equal access to quality \nfood. According to the Vermont Office of Economic Opportunity, food \nshelf caseloads have increased 69 percent over the past 10 years. \nVermont Foodbank's contribution to the cause has more than quadrupled \nover the past 6 years, from 1.5 million pounds of food distributed in \n1997 to more than 7 million in 2003.\n  As its leader, Deborah Flateman has devoted her energy and expertise \nto placing the Vermont Foodbank on the fast track towards ending \nhunger. From successfully raising $2.1 million and building a state of \nthe art facility, to hiring quality personnel, to partnering with the \nVermont state government to create and implement an innovative \nCommunity Kitchen, Ms. Flateman has raised the standards of best \npractice. The Vermont Foodbank is a lively organization with a strong \nethical base and a stellar reputation.\n  Deborah Flateman's personal achievements illustrate her vested \ncommitment to ending hunger. In addition to exhibiting leadership on \nthe local and State levels. Ms. Flateman has occupied posts on the \nnational and international levels for America's Second Harvest, \nincluding work on an international conference planning committee and \nthe Public Policy Task Force. In the year 2000, Ms. Flateman personally \nsolicited $800,000 for new facilities to accommodate the Foodbank's \ngrowing operation. She has also been an integral member of the Eastern \nRegion Affiliates Association of America's Second Harvest, and was \nelected chairperson in 2002. Recently, Ms. Flateman accepted the Model \nProgram Hunger's Hope Award from America's Second Harvest on behalf of \nthe Vermont Foodbank.\n  With Deborah Flateman at the helm, the Vermont Foodbank has done a \nfirst rate job in addressing hunger in the Green Mountain State. The \nVermont Foodbank has made exceptional progress in a short time, and its \nsuccesses mark victory after victory in the fight against \nhunger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12369-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12369-S12370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL JOHN M. LeMOYNE, U.S. ARMY, ON HIS \n                               RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to \nrecognize a great patriot, soldier and fellow Floridian, LTG John M. \nLeMoyne. General LeMoyne is retiring after a distinguished 35-year \ncareer in the United States Army.\n  John LeMoyne entered military service in 1968 after graduating from \nthe University of Florida, in Gainsville, FL. He was commissioned \nthrough ROTC as a second lieutenant in the Infantry and has served with \ndistinction for over three decades in peace and during two wars. Most \nnotable was his final assignment as the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff \nfor Personnel, G-1. He was personally selected by the Army's senior \nleadership to serve as its head personnel officer and to take control \nof an organization which had sustained substantial casualties during \nthe September 11 terrorist attack on the Pentagon. His calm hand, \nsteady leadership and personal touch were instrumental in guiding the \norganization through a period of mourning and reconstitution, while \ncontinuing to support the Army's many personnel needs. Over the past 2 \nyears, during a period of unprecedented global action, with Operations \nEnduring Freedom and\n\n[[Page S12370]]\n\nIraqi Freedom, General LeMoyne ensured that the Army's personnel \nchallenges were met.\n  Throughout his career, General LeMoyne has distinguished himself in \nnumerous command and staff positions both overseas and in the United \nStates. In Vietnam, he commanded an infantry company, where he was \nrecognized for his heroism and received a Purple Heart. In Europe, his \nassignments included command of the 3rd Battalion, 30th Infantry, 3rd \nInfantry Division; Operations Officer and later Chief of Staff for the \nU.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army. General LeMoyne's stateside \nassignments included serving as the Commander, 1st Brigade, 24th \nInfantry Division and Commanding General, U.S. Army Infantry Center, \nFort Benning, GA. While in command of the 1st Brigade during Operation \nDesert Storm, General LeMoyne's unit led the famous ``Hail Mary'' into \nthe Iraqi Army's rear which contributed to the quick end of hostilities \nand the defeat of the Iraqi Army in Kuwait.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking General \nLeMoyne for the leadership he has provided, for the care and concern he \nhas demonstrated for our soldiers and their families and for his \ndedicated and honorable service to our Nation and its Army. As he \nreturns to Gainsville, we wish him, his wife Marion and family Godspeed \nand all the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12370-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12370-S12371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RAJESH (RAJ) SOIN 2003 ELLIS ISLAND MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \npay tribute to Mr. Raj Soin of Beavercreek, OH as a 2003 Ellis Island \nMedal of Honor recipient.\n  The prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor award is presented \nannually to ``remarkable American who exemplify outstanding qualities \nin both their personal and professional lives,'' and ``who have \ndistinguished themselves as citizens of the United States, while \ncontinuing to preserve the richness of their particular heritage.''\n  Mr. Soin was born in New Delhi, India in 1947 and graduated from \nDelhi University in 1969 with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical \nEngineering. After graduation, he came to the United States with barely \nenough money to make his way to Bradley University, where he earned a \nMaster of Science degree in Industrial Engineering in 1971, while \nworking as a research assistant. Mr. Soin continued his post-graduate \nstudies in business and finance, at Bradley University, Illinois State \nUniversity, and the advanced management programs at Harvard University \nand The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n  Raj Soin and his wife, Indu, became proud citizens of the United \nStates in 1978.\n  In 1984, Raj Soin created his company, Modern Technologies \nCorporation, MTC, on a dream. MTC was founded with the idea of proving \nengineering and technical services to the Department of Defense, but \nquickly became an incubator that has spawned numerous businesses in a \nvariety of industries. From its inception, MTC has grown at an \nexceptional rate and was hailed as one of the fastest growing companies \nin the United States by Inc. magazine for 4 consecutive years. In June \n2002, MTC Technologies was listed on NASDAQ. Today the company has \nsales in excess of $140 million and employs over 1100 people in 25 \ncities and 18 States.\n  With the success of his company, Modern Technologies Corporation, he \ncould have chosen to channel his energies solely toward his business. \nInstead, he believes in contributing to the community that has given \nhim so much. And the one area in which Mr. Raj Soin has made a \nparticular difference has been in the area which has had such an \nenormous impact on his own life--education.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, one of the goals that I set for my \nadministration was to celebrate the cultural diversity of our State by \nseeking out individuals from non-traditional ethnic groups and giving \nthem an opportunity to serve.\n  I was so impressed by Raj's devotion to education, that as Governor, \nI appointed him to Wright State University's Board of Trustees in 1993. \nOne of the main reasons that I asked Raj to serve on the Board of \nTrustees was that he constantly mentioned the fact that we needed to do \na better job in higher education, that we needed to do a better job in \nsecondary and primary education.\n  He has served with great distinction and is held in the highest \nregard by his colleagues. More important is the fact that through his \nwork on behalf of Wright State University, Raj has directly touched the \nlives of so many. Raj Soin has truly made a difference on behalf of the \ncitizens of Dayton, the State of Ohio and thousands of Wright State \nUniversity graduates.\n  Because of his commitment to higher education and in honor of his \naccomplishments and support of the University, in 2000, the business \ncollege at Wright State was renamed the Raj Soin College of Business \nand I was delighted to be on campus in Dayton, OH, for the dedication \nceremony.\n  Raj's determination, his hard work and his selflessness are traits \nthat all of us should strive to emulate, not only in business, but in \nlife, because there are rewards that are greater than money--\nparticularly, the ability to make a difference in the lives of one's \nfellow man.\n  For example, Raj is the founding trustee and first president of the \nOhio-India project. Two of the local projects of the Ohio-India Project \nare the Ghandi House, a transitional house for women in need and the \nAnnual Day of Caring, which started as a local event and is now \nconducted in several states with expectations of becoming a national \nprogram.\n  Additionally, as Governor, we led a trade mission to India in April \nof 1996, and I had the chance to see Raj Soin in action when his \ncompany, Modern Technologies Corporation and CMC Limited announced \ntheir joint agreement to, among other things, greatly expand India's \naccess to the Internet.\n  Mr. Soin's company, MTC Technologies also supports many community \nprojects through the MTC Foundation. MTC not only provides part of the \nfunding for the Foundation, but permits and encourages employers to \nspend company time to help with the Foundation's work.\n  Raj Soin serves as a member of the Board of Directors of Victoria \nTheatre Association, and on the Board of Directors of the Kettering \nMedical Center Network. He is a past member of the Board of Trustees of \nWright State University, the Advisory Board of KeyBank, and Dayton \nDistrict. He is a founding trustee and past president of Asian Indian \nAmerican Business Group. He has also served as a member of the Dayton \nArea Chamber of Commerce Board of Trustees; member of the Ohio Business \nRoundtable; Co-Chair of the Center for Information Technology in \nDayton; member of the Board of Dayton Council on World Affairs; and \nmember of the Board of the Dayton Air and Trade Show.\n\n  Mr. Soin has received many awards, including: The National Conference \nof Christians and Jews Humanitarians Award, Ernst & Young's Master \nEntrepreneur, and Beavercreek Chamber of Commerce Business Person of \nthe Year.\n  Even with all the business success he has enjoyed and all the \ncharitable and philanthropic acts that he has undertaken, perhaps what \nbest exemplifies Raj Soin is the fact that he is a loving husband, \ndevoted father and caring son. I have been to Raj and Indu's home and I \nhave been with them at other occasions and observed the genuine love \nand admiration they have for each other and their pride in their two \nsons.\n  Raj understands, as so many Asian Indians do, that the family is the \nbackbone of our society.\n  I remember also on our business mission having the pleasure of \nmeeting Raj Soin's father. You could not help but see how proud he was \nof Raj. And that love and respect was mutual; for Raj is the main \nbenefactor for the Sukh Dev Raj Soin Hospital which is being built in \nmemory of his father in India.\n  Raj has been a role model in every sense: in terms of his family, in \nterms of his contributions to his ``extended family'' in the community, \nand in terms of his success in business.\n  Raj Soin is indeed a remarkable American of the highest integrity in \nboth his personal and professional life.\n\n[[Page S12371]]\n\nHe has made many outstanding contributions to the Asian Indian \ncommunity, to his local community in Dayton, OH and to American \nsociety.\n  Raj Soin is a man who came to our shores in search of a dream, who \nstarted from scratch and became a success in his adopted country, and \nthen he went back to his homeland to help millions of people join the \ninformation age. There is just one way to describe it--only in America \ncould such an opportunity arise to be successful and to serve.\n  I am proud to recognize my friend, Raj Soin, and congratulate him on \nthis wonderful honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12371-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE 70TH BIRTHDAY OF VERONICA MARRON AND ELIZABETH MARRON\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I would like to \nrecognize the upcoming birthday of two native Nebraskans--both fine \neducators, loving mothers, and devoted wives.\n  Veronica and Elizabeth Marron were born Oct. 14, 1933, to parents \nHarry and Pearl Marron, in Waterbury, NE. They were the last children \nof five, including Joe, Leonard and Gene. Fraternal twins, the girls \nwere called Bonnie and Betty from childhood.\n  The twins graduated from Newcastle High in 1951, with Betty earning \nvaledictorian and Bonnie salutatorian and Girls' State honors. Although \njust 17-years-old, both quickly earned teaching certificates and \nstarted work in Dixon County's country schools.\n  That was just the beginning of two lifetimes dedicated to education \nand twin, true passions for teaching. Both women taught for more than \n30 years, with Bonnie ending her career at the O'Neill Public Schools \nand Betty at Falls City Elementary School.\n  Bonnie married Jim Lowe of Ponca and had four children, Peggy, Paula, \nAnn and Patrick. Betty married Phil Slagle of Falls City and also had \nfour children, Scott, Todd, Jeff and Jay.\n  On October 14, 2003, Bonnie and Betty will celebrate 70 years of \nliving ``the good life'' in Nebraska. I join their family and friends \nin wishing them a very happy birthday, and many more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12371-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT ELEMENTARY\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

A bill to delay notice of search warrants; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will introduce in the Senate the \nReasonable Notice and Search Act. This bill addresses the provision of \nthe USA PATRIOT Act that has caused perhaps the most concern among \nMembers of Congress. Section 213 of the PATRIOT Act, sometimes referred \nto as the ``delayed notice search provision'' or the ``sneak and peek \nprovision,'' authorizes the Government in limited circumstances to \nconduct a search without immediately serving a search warrant on the \nowner or occupant of the premises that have been searched.\n  Prior to the PATRIOT Act, secret searches for physical evidence were \nperformed in some jurisdictions under the authority of Court of Appeals \ndecisions, but the Supreme Court never definitively ruled whether they \nwere constitutional. Section 213 of the Patriot Act authorized delayed \nnotice warrants in any case in which an ``adverse result'' would occur \nif the warrant were served before the search was executed. Adverse \nresult was defined as including: 1. Endangering the life or physical \nsafety of an individual; 2. flight from prosecution; 3. destruction of \nor tampering with evidence; 4. intimidation of potential witnesses; or \n5. otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying \na trial. These circumstances went beyond what court decisions had \nauthorized before the PATRIOT Act. In addition, while some courts had \nrequired the service of the warrant within a specified period of time, \nthe PATRIOT Act simply required that the warrant specify that it would \nbe served within a ``reasonable'' period of time after the search.\n  It is interesting to note that this provision of the PATRIOT Act was \nnot limited to terrorism cases. Nor was it made subject to the sunset \nprovision that will cause most of the new surveillance provisions of \nthe act to expire at the end of 2005 unless Congress reenacts them. So \nSection 213 was pretty clearly a provision that the Department of \nJustice wanted regardless of the terrorism threat after 9/11.\n  Perhaps that is why this provision has caused such controversy since \nit was passed. Just over 2 months ago, by a wide bipartisan margin, the \nHouse passed an amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations \nbill offered by Representative Otter from\n\n[[Page S12378]]\n\nIdaho, a Republican, to stop funding for delayed notice searches \nauthorized under section 213. The size of the vote took the Department \nby surprise, and it immediately set out to defend the provision \naggressively. Clearly, this is a power that DOJ does not want to lose.\n  I raised concern about the sneak and peek provision when it was \nincluded in the Patriot Act and even considered offering an amendment \nat that time to strip it out. I did not believe there had been adequate \nstudy and analysis of the justifications for these searches and the \npotential safeguards that might be included. I did not argue then, \nhowever, and I am not arguing now that there should be no delayed \nnotice searches at all and that the provision should be repealed. I do \nbelieve, however, that it should be modified to protect against abuse. \nMy bill will do four things to accomplish this.\n  First, my bill would narrow the circumstances in which a delayed \nnotice warrant can be granted to the following: potential loss of life, \nflight from prosecution, or destruction or tampering with evidence. The \n``catch-all provision'' in section 213, allowing a secret search when \nserving the warrant would ``seriously jeopardize an investigation or \nunduly delay a trial'' is too easily susceptible to abuse.\n  Second, I believe that any delayed notice warrant should provide for \na specific and limited time period within which notice must be given--7 \ndays. This is consistent with some of the pre-PATRIOT Act court \ndecisions and will help to bring this provision in closer accord with \nthe fourth amendment to the Constitution. Under my bill, prosecutors \nwill be permitted to seek 7-day extensions if circumstances continue to \nwarrant that the subject not be made aware of the search. But the \ndefault should be a week, unless a court is convinced that more time \nshould be permitted.\n  Third, Section 213 should be brought into the group of PATRIOT Act \nprovisions that will sunset at the end of 2005. This will allow \nCongress to reexamine this provision along with the other provisions of \nthe act, which was passed within 6 weeks of the 9/11 attacks, to \ndetermine if the balance between civil liberties and law enforcement \nhas been correctly struck.\n  Finally, the bill requires a public report on the number of times \nthat section 213 is used and the number of times that extensions are \nsought beyond the 7-day notice period. This information will help the \npublic and Congress evaluate the need for this authority and determine \nwhether it should be retained or modified after the sunset.\n  These are reasonable and moderate changes to the law. They do not gut \nthe provision. They do not make it worthless. They do recognize the \ngrowing and legitimate concern from across the political spectrum that \nthis provision was passed in haste and presents the potential for \nabuse. They also send a message that fourth amendment rights have \nmeaning and potential violations of those rights should be minimized if \nat all possible. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1701\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe exclusion from gross income for employer-provided health coverage \nto designated plan beneficiaries of employees, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nconsistent tax treatment of employer-provided health insurance for \ndomestic partners. Today, Senator Bob Graham and I are introducing the \nDomestic Partner Health Benefits Equity Act, a bill that seeks to \nsimplify the tax code and address the growing trend among both public \nand private employers who have decided to provide domestic partner \nbenefits to their employees.\n  More than one-third of Fortune 500 companies, as well as numerous \nState and local governments, are providing health insurance benefits to \nthe domestic partners of their employees. This is a clear trend in the \nAmerican workplace. However, Federal tax law has not kept pace with \ncorporate changes in this area and employers who offer such benefits \nand the employees who receive them are taxed inequitably. Our \nlegislation would provide consistent tax treatment for employer-\nprovided health insurance for domestic partners.\n  Currently, the tax code provides that the employer's contribution of \nthe premium for health insurance for an employee's spouse is excluded \nfrom the employee's taxable income. An employer's contribution for the \ndomestic partner's coverage, however, is included in an employee's \ntaxable income as a fringe benefit. In addition, the employer's payroll \ntax liability is increased. This forces businesses to create a two-\ntrack payroll system for benefits provided to spouses and those \nprovided to domestic partners, an administrative burden that this \nlegislation would eliminate.\n  I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, \nwe will increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance by \nproviding employers with a tax incentive. The tax code should not \npenalize employers for offering these benefits to their employees.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and support the Domestic Partner \nHealth Benefits Equity Act. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthis legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1702\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, in introducing the Domestic \nPartner Health Benefits Equity Act, which corrects an inequity in our \ncurrent tax law. Employees who receive health benefits from their \nemployers are not taxed on the value of this benefit. The tax benefit \nalso applies to health care that covers the employee's spouse and \ndependents.\n   In growing numbers, both public and private sector employers are \nproviding domestic partner benefits to employees. For example, more \nthan one-third of the Fortune 500 companies and 146 State and local \ngovernments provide such benefits. Unlike health benefits provided to \ntheir other employees, however, health care that covers a domestic \npartner is taxable to both the employee and the employer.\n   An employer's payroll tax liability is calculated based on its \nemployees' taxable incomes. When contributions for domestic partner \nbenefits are included in employees' incomes, employers pay higher \npayroll taxes. This provision also places an administrative burden on \nemployers by requiring them to identify those employees utilizing their \nbenefits for a partner rather than a spouse. Employers must then \ncalculate the portion of their contribution that is attributable to the \npartner, and create and maintain a separate payroll function for these \nemployees' income tax withholding and payroll tax. Thus, the employer \nis penalized for making a sound business decision that contributes to \nstability in the workforce.\n   Senator Smith and I have drafted legislation to amend the tax law to \nallow health benefits to domestic partners to be received by employees \non the same tax-free basis as ``spouses.'' Specifically, the bill \nchanges the definition of ``dependent'' in the code--for purposes of \nemployer-provided health benefits only--to be any beneficiary allowed \nby the health plan.\n   Although the primary beneficiaries of this legislation will be \nemployees with domestic partners, the change will also benefit \nemployees who provide health insurance to family members who may not \nqualify as a ``dependent'' under current law. For example, the change \nwould make it easier for an employee to include a brother, sister or \nparent on an employer's health plan even if the employee does not \nprovide more than one-half of the support for that individual, a \nrequirement for a person being a ``dependent''.\n   I commend Senator Smith for his leadership in correcting this \ninequity in our tax laws. I also thank Senators Chafee, Wyden, Corzine \nand Boxer for joining us in this effort. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor our bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH:\n  S. 1703.

The bill provides a Federal tax \ncredit for short line railroad rehabilitation and addresses a critical \nneed in small town America.\n  There are some 500 short line railroads serving large areas of the \ncountry that are no longer served by the large Class I railroads. These \nrailroads keep our farmers and our small businesses connected to the \nnational main line railroad system and are the only alternative to \nincreasing truck traffic on local roads.\n  Many of today's short lines were once the light density branch lines \nof the large Class I railroads. As Class I systems began to lose money, \nthese branch lines received little investment and were gradually \nabandoned. As an alternative to abandonment, the Federal Government \nencouraged spinning off these lines to form new local railroads that \nwould preserve service and jobs.\n  Today, this local service is threatened due to the introduction of \nthe new, heavier 286,000-pound railcar that the Class I's are making \nthe new industry standard. Because of the interconnectivity of our \nNation's rail network, short lines are forced to use these heavier \ncars. This places an added strain on track structure and makes \nrehabilitation even more important and more urgent. Studies indicate \nthat it will take $7 billion in new investment for our nation's short \nlines to accommodate these heavier rail cars.\n  My legislation is not intended to fund this entire rehabilitation. \nRather, it is intended to help small railroads make the improvements \nrequired to grow traffic so they can earn the additional investment \nincome needed to complete the $7 billion capital upgrade.\n  Short lines operate 50,000 miles of track in 49 states, employ over \n23,000 workers at an average wage of $47,000, and earn $3 billion in \nannual revenue. Railroading is one of the most capital-intensive \nindustries in the country. That capital effort is also labor intensive \nand my legislation will result in the immediate creation of jobs needed \nto undertake these rehabilitation projects.\n  The major provisions of the Local Railroad Rehabilitation and \nInvestment Act include:\n  Authorization of a federal tax credit against qualified railroad \ntrack maintenance expenditures paid or incurred by a taxpayer during \ntaxable years 2004 to 2008.\n  The qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures include \nexpenditures, whether or not otherwise chargeable to capital account, \nfor maintaining or upgrading railroad track, including roadbed, bridges \nand related structures, owned or leased by the taxpayer of a Class II \nor Class III railroad.\n  The total tax credit is capped at $10,000 for every mile of railroad \ntrack owned or leased by a Class II or Class III railroad, provided \nthat the expenditure is certified by the State as part of an essential \nrail upgrade. For example, a 20-mile railroad qualifies for a $200,000 \ncredit.\n  And, to maximize private investment in this critical infrastructure, \nthe bill allows railroads that are unable to fully utilize credits \nearned to transfer such credits to other railroads, railroad shippers, \nor railroad suppliers and contractors.\n  For rural America, the specter of losing rail access is a serious \nmatter. As characterized in the American Association of State Highway \nTransportation Officials' (AASHTO) recent Freight-Rail Bottom Line \nReport, short lines ``often provide the first and last service miles in \nthe door-to-door collection and distribution of railcars.'' The \nAssociation of American Railroads estimates that short lines originate \nor terminate one out of every four carloads moved by the domestic \nrailroad industry. Preserving short line rail service is important to \nthe national transportation system; it is absolutely critical to the \nrural transportation system. This legislation provides a modest and \nefficient way to help the short line industry help itself.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and support this important \nlegislation. I\n\n[[Page S12381]]\n\nask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1703\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nState family support grant program to end the practice of parents \ngiving legal custody of their seriously emotionally disturbed children \nto State agencies for the purpose of obtaining mental health services \nfor those children; to the committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenators Pryor, Coleman and Bingaman in introducing the ``Keeping \nFamilies Together Act.'' Among other provisions, our bill authorizes a \nnew, competitive State grant program to support statewide systems for \ncare for children with serious mental illness so that parents are no \nlonger forced to give up custody of their children solely for the \npurpose of securing mental health treatment.\n  Serious mental illness afflicts millions of our Nation's children and \nadolescents. It is estimated that as many as 20 percent of American \nchildren under the age of 17 suffer from a mental, emotional or \nbehavioral illness. Of these, nearly half have a condition that \nproduces a serious disability that impairs the child's ability to \nfunction in day-to-day activities. What is even more disturbing is the \nfact that two-thirds of all young people who need mental health \ntreatment are not getting it.\n  Behind each of these statistics is a family that is struggling to do \nthe best it can to help a son or daughter with a serious mental illness \nto be just like every other kid--to develop friendships, to do well in \nschool, and to get along with their siblings and other family members. \nThese children are almost always involved with more than one social \nservice agency, including the mental health, special education, child \nwelfare, and juvenile justice systems. Yet no one agency, at either the \nState or the Federal level, is clearly responsible or accountable for \nhelping these children.\n  Recent news reports in more than 30 States have highlighted the \ndifficulties that parents of children with serious mental illness have \nin getting the coordinated mental health services that their children \nneed. My interest in this issue was triggered by a compelling series of \nstories by Barbara Walsh in the Portland Press Herald last summer which \ndetailed the obstacles that many Maine families have faced in getting \ncare for their children.\n  Too many families in Maine and elsewhere have been forced to make \nwrenching decisions when they have been advised that the only way to \nget the care that their children so desperately need is to relinquish \ncustody and place them in either the child welfare or juvenile justice \nsystem.\n  Yet neither system is intended to serve children with serious mental \nillness. Child welfare systems are designed to protect children who \nhave been abused or neglected. Juvenile justice systems are designed to \nrehabilitate children who have committed criminal or delinquent acts \nand to prevent such acts from occurring. While neither of these systems \nis equipped to care for a child with a serious mental illness, in far \ntoo may cases, there is nowhere else for the family to turn.\n  Earlier this year, the General Accounting Office (GAO) completed a \nreport that I requested with Representatives Pete Stark and Patrick \nKennedy titled ``Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice: Federal Agencies \nCould Play a Stronger Role in Helping States Reduce the Number of \nChildren Placed solely to Obtain Mental Health Services.''\n  The GAO surveyed child welfare directors in all States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, as well as juvenile justice officials in the 33 \ncounties with the largest number of young people in their juvenile \njustice systems. According to the GAO survey, in 2001, parents placed \nmore than 12,700 children into the child welfare or juvenile justice \nsystems so that these children could receive mental health services.\n\n[[Page S12382]]\n\n  Moreover, the GAO estimate is likely just the tip of the iceberg, \nsince 32 States--including the five States with the largest populations \nof children--did not provide the GAO with any data.\n  There have been other studies indicating that the custody \nrelinquishment problem is pervasive. In 1999, the National Alliance for \nthe Mentally Ill released a survey which found that 23 percent--or one \nin four of the parents surveyed--had been told by public officials that \nthey needed to relinquish custody of their children to get care, and \nthat one in five of these families had done so.\n  While some States have passed laws to limit or prohibit custody \nrelinquishment, simply banning the practice is not a solution, since it \ncan leave mentally ill children and their families without services and \ncare. Custody relinquishment is merely a symptom of the much larger \nproblem, which is the lack of available, affordable and appropriate \nmental health services and support systems for these children and their \nfamilies.\n  In July, I chaired a series of hearings in the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs to examine the difficult challenges faced by \nfamilies of children with mental illnesses. We heard compelling \ntestimony from families who told the Committee about their personal \nstruggles to get mental health services for their severely ill \nchildren. The mothers who testified told us they were advised that the \nonly way to get the intensive care and services that their children \nneeded was to relinquish custody and place them in the child welfare \nsystem. This is a wrenching decision that no family should be forced to \nmake. No parent should have to give up custody of his or her child just \nto get the services that the child needs.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today was developed in \nresponse to concerns raised by both the GAO report and in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee hearings.\n  First, the legislation authorizes $55 million for competitive grants \nto States that would be payable over six years to create an \ninfrastructure to support and sustain statewide systems of care to \nserve children who are in custody or at risk of entering custody of the \nState for the purpose of receiving mental health services. These grants \nare intended to help states serve these children more effectively and \nefficiently, while keeping them at home with their families.\n  States would use funds from these Family Support Grants to foster \ninteragency cooperation and cross-system financing among the various \nState agencies with responsibilities for serving children with mental \nhealth needs. The funds would also support the purchase and delivery of \na comprehensive array of community-based mental health and family \nsupport services for children who are in custody, or at risk of \nentering into the custody of the State for the purpose of receiving \nmental health services. This will allow States, which already dedicate \nsignificant dollars to serving children in state custody, to use those \nresources more efficiently by delivering care to children while \nallowing them to remain with their families.\n  In response to recommendation made by the GAO report, the Keeping \nFamilies Together Act will also establish a Federal interagency task \nforce to examine mental health issues in the child welfare and juvenile \njustice systems and the role of their agencies in promoting access by \nchildren and youth to mental health services.\n  And finally, the legislation will remove a current statutory barrier \nthat prevents more states from using the Medicaid home and community-\nbased services waiver to serve children with serious mental health \nconditions. The Medicaid home and community-based services waiver is a \npromising way for States to reduce the incidence of custody \nrelinquishment and address the underlying lack of mental health \nservices for children. While a number of States have requested these \nwaivers to serve children with developmental disabilities, to date very \nfew have done so for children with serious mental health conditions. \nThat is because, under current law, States can only offer home- and \ncommunity-based services under these waivers as an alternative to care \nin hospitals, nursing facilities, or intermediate care facilities for \nthe mentally retarded. Our legislation will correct this omission and \nprovide parity to children with mental illness by including inpatient \npsychiatric hospitals and residential treatment facilities on the list \nof institutions for which alternative care through the Medicaid home- \nand community-based services waivers may be available.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help to reduce the \nbarriers to care for children who suffer from mental illness and will \nassist States in eliminating the practice of parents relinquishing \ncustody of their children to State agencies solely for the purpose of \nsecuring mental health services.\n  Our legislation has been endorsed by a number of mental health and \nchildren's groups including the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, \nthe Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health, the National \nChild Welfare League, the Bazelon Center, the Children's Defense Fund, \nand the National Mental Health Association. I urge all of my colleagues \nto join us as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Biden, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Collins, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Dayton, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Smith, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1705. A bill to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2003.\n  Civil rights is the unfinished business of our nation. Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 gives all Americans--without regard to \nrace, ethnic background, gender, or religion--the opportunity to obtain \nand keep a job. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is an essential \nadditional step in preventing job discrimination.\n  The act is straightforward and limited. It prohibits discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation in making decisions about hiring, firing, \npromotion, and compensation. It makes clear that there is no right to \npreferential treatment, and that quotas are prohibited. It does not \napply to employers with less than 15 employees. It does not apply to \nthe armed forces, religious organizations, or such volunteer positions \nas troop leaders in the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts.\n  In fact, this fundamental additional protection for America's \nworkforce is long overdue. Too many hardworking Americans are being \njudged on their sexual orientation, rather than their ability and \nqualifications.\n  Consider the example of Kendall Hamilton in Oklahoma City. After \nworking at Red Lobster for several years and receiving excellent \nreviews, he applied for promotion at the urging of the general manager, \nwho knew he was gay. His application was rejected after a co-worker \nrevealed his sexual orientation to the upper management team, and the \npromotion was given instead to another employee who had been on the job \nfor only 9 months--and whom Mr. Hamilton had trained. He was told that \nhis sexual orientation ``was not compatible with Red Lobster's belief \nin family values,'' and that being gay had destroyed any chance of \nbecoming a manager. As a result, Hamilton left the company.\n  Consider the example of Steve Morrison, a firefighter in Oregon. His \nco-workers saw him on the local news protesting an anti-gay initiative, \nand incorrectly assumed he was gay himself. He began to lose workplace \nresponsibilities and was the victim of harassment, including hate mail. \nAfter a long administrative proceeding, the trumped-up charges were \nremoved from his record, and he was transferred to another fire \nstation.\n\n[[Page S12383]]\n\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that this kind of \ndiscrimination is wrong. According to a 2003 Gallup study, 88 percent \nof Americans believe that gays and lesbians should have equal job \nopportunities. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is strongly \nsupported by labor unions and a broad religious coalition. They know \nthat America will not reach its full potential or realize its promise \nof equal justice and equal opportunity for all until we end all forms \nof discrimination.\n  Over 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies have implemented non-\ndiscrimination policies that include sexual orientation. Our \nlegislation has been endorsed by leading corporations such as AT, BP, \nCisco Systems, Eastman Kodak, FleetBoston, General Mills, Hewlett-\nPackard, IBM, JP Morgan Chase & Co., Microsoft, Nike, Oracle, Shell \nOil, and Verizon.\n  Small businesses support our legislation as well. At a hearing in \n2001, Lucy Billingsly, a Republican small business owner in Dallas, \nsaid, ``A uniform Federal law banning sexual orientation discrimination \nwill give businesses the right focus. By paying attention to the \nquality of work being done and not to factors that have nothing to do \nwith job performance, all of America's businesses will perform \nbetter.''\n  Despite broad-based support in the business community and Congress's \nhistory of enacting anti-discrimination legislation, some argue that \nthe solution to the problem of job discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation should be left to the States. I disagree. Only 14 \nStates and the District of Columbia have laws similar to the Employment \nNon-Discrimination Act. Too many American workers are left without \nredress. A Federal law is clearly needed to ensure that all Americans \nreceive equal treatment in the workplace.\n  Hard-working citizens in every State deserve the opportunity to feel \nsecure in their jobs when they perform well, and they deserve the \nopportunity to compete in the workplace when they are qualified for a \njob. Job discrimination based on sexual orientation is unacceptable, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with Senators \nKennedy, Chafee, Jeffords and many other colleagues as an original \ncosponsor of this important legislation, the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act of 2003. By guaranteeing that American workers \ncannot lose their jobs simply because of their sexual orientation, this \nbill would extend the bedrock American values of fairness and equality \nto a group of our fellow citizens who too often have been denied the \nbenefit of those most basic values.\n  More than 225 years ago, Thomas Jefferson laid out a vision of \nAmerica as dedicated to the simple idea that all of us are created \nequal, endowed by our creator with the unalienable rights to life, \nliberty and the pursuit of happiness. As Jefferson knew, our society \ndid not in his time live up to that ideal, but since his time, we have \nbeen trying to. In succeeding generations, we have worked ever harder \nto ensure that our society removes unjustified barriers to individual \nachievement and that we judge each other solely on our merits and not \non characteristics that are irrelevant to the task at hand. We are \nstill far from perfect, but we have made much progress, especially over \nthe past few decades, guaranteeing equality and fairness to an \nincreasing number of groups that traditionally have not had the \nbenefits of those values and of those protections. To African-\nAmericans, to women, to disabled Americans, to religious minorities and \nto others we have extended a legally enforceable guarantee that, with \nrespect to their ability to earn a living at least, they will be \ntreated on their merits and not on characteristics unrelated to their \nability to do their jobs.\n  It is time to extend that guarantee to gay men and lesbians, who too \noften have been denied the most basic of rights: the right to obtain \nand maintain a job. A collection of 1 national survey and 20 city and \nState surveys found that as many as 44 percent of gay, lesbian and \nbisexual workers faced job discrimination in the workplace at some time \nin their careers. Other studies have reported even greater \ndiscrimination--as much as 68 percent of gay men and lesbians reporting \nemployment discrimination. The fear in which these workers live was \nclear from a survey of gay men and lesbians in Philadelphia. Over \nthree-quarters told those conducting the survey that they sometimes or \nalways hide their orientation at work out of fear of discrimination.\n  The toll this discrimination takes extends far beyond its effect on \nthe individuals who live without full employment opportunities. It also \ntakes an unacceptable toll on America's definition of itself as a land \nof equality and opportunity, as a place where we judge each other on \nour merits, and as a country that teaches its children that anyone can \nsucceed here as long as they are willing to do their job and work hard.\n  This bill provides for equality and fairness--that and no more. It \nsays only what we already have said for women, for people of color and \nfor others; that you are entitled to have your ability to earn a living \ndepend only on your ability to do the job and nothing else.\n  This bill would bring our nation one large step closer to realizing \nthe vision that Thomas Jefferson so eloquently expressed 227 years ago \nwhen he wrote that all of us have a right to life, liberty and the \npursuit of happiness. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW:\n  S. 1707. A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, to provide for \nfree mailing privileges for personal correspondence and certain parcels \nsent from within the United States to members of the Armed Forces \nserving on active duty abroad who are engaged in military operations \ninvolving armed conflict against a hostile foreign force, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Providing \nOur Support to Troops or POST Act of 2003. This bill would provide free \nmailing privileges for letters and packages sent from within the United \nStates to members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty abroad who \nare engaged in military operations involving armed conflict against a \nhostile foreign force. This bill is a companion bill to Representative \nLucas's H.R. 2705, a bill with 31 bipartisan cosponsors in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Our troops overseas can send mail and packages to their loved ones at \nno cost, but their families must pay postage to do the same. As the \nholidays approach, the families back here in the States are not only \nnot able to give their Christmas or Hanukah presents to their loved \nones in person, but they have to pay postage to do so.\n  Two constituents of mine, both mothers of servicemen in Iraq, brought \nthis inequity to my attention. Renee Walton from Lincoln Park, MI, \nmother of twins Jeremy and Joshua who are serving in the Marine Corps, \nwrites, ``I believe this is something all the troops' families will \nbenefit from and most especially the soldier who is waiting patiently \nfor a package from home.''\n  Suzann Sareini, a Dearborn resident, says, ``As a mother of one of \nthe brave individuals in our armed forces fighting for this country, I \nbelieve this act exhibits a tremendous amount of patriotic gratitude \nfor the sacrifices being made by members of the military and their \nfamilies. This small gesture would be invaluable in its contribution to \nthe morale of our soldiers waiting patiently for packages from back \nhome.''\n  I wholeheartedly agree with these two Michigan moms.\n  Currently 2,500 Michigan Guard and Reserves are on active duty, many \nof whom are serving in Iraq or Afghanistan or fighting the war against \nterrorism around the globe. That means that there are thousands of \nfamilies who will have an empty seat at the Thanksgiving table and will \nbe missing a loved one during the holidays. But, by providing free \npostage for these families, we are making it easier for them to stay in \ntouch with their loved ones and provide them with moral support. This \nis only fair since our service men and women have so unselfishly made \ngreat sacrifices to protect us and our country. This is a small \ngesture, but one that will speak loudly in the hearts of our troops and \ntheir families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S12384]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1707\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the USA PATRIOT ACT to place reasonable \nlimitations on the use of surveillance and the issuance of search \nwarrants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Durbin, Crapo, Feingold, Sununu, and Bingaman, to introduce \nthe Security and Freedom Ensured Act of 2003, which we call the SAFE \nAct.\n  This bill is aimed at addressing some specific concerns that have \nbeen raised about the USA PATRIOT Act. We believe this is a measured, \nreasonable, and appropriate response that would ensure the liberties of \nlaw-abiding individuals are protected in our Nation's fight against \nterrorism, without in any way impeding that fight.\n  Let me say at the outset that I voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT \nAct. I believed then, and still do, that it was the right thing to do \nin the wake of the terrible and unprecedented attacks on our Nation on \nSeptember 11, 2001. I would also like to express my gratitude to those \nbrave men and women who put their lives on the line every day to \nprotect the American people from further attacks by would-be terrorists \nand criminals. The Department of Justice and Department of Homeland \nSecurity should be commended for the dramatic progress they are making \nin detecting, pursuing, and stopping those who pose a threat to our \nNation and our people.\n  Even so, the USA PATRIOT Act is not a perfect law, and it is no \ncriticism of those who are so ably waging the war against terrorism to \nsuggest that it may be in order to amend some aspects of that law.\n  The SAFE Act is intended to do just that: make some commonsense \nchanges that help to safeguard our freedoms, without sacrificing our \nsecurity. It focuses on areas of activity that have been particularly \ncontroversial: delayed notice warrants, which are also referred to as \n``sneak and peek'' warrants; wiretaps that do not require specificity \nas to either person or place; the impact of the new law on libraries; \nand nationwide search warrants. Our bill would amend, not eliminate \nthese tools or repeal the USA PATRIOT Act in these areas.\n  I spend a lot of time on the ground in my home State of Idaho, and \nregardless of the pride Idahoans have in the success of the war on \nterrorism, many of them continue to raise concerns about the tools \nbeing used in that war. Admittedly, a lot of misinformation has been \nspread about the USA PATRIOT Act, and I applaud the Administration for \nworking to correct that misinformation. However, not all of the \nconcerns about the law are unfounded or misguided, and I strongly \nbelieve they deserve a proper airing in Congress. Furthermore, one has \nonly to look at the cosponsors of the SAFE Act to see that these \nconcerns are not unique to Idahoans--they are shared by a wide regional \nand political spectrum.\n  This morning, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee announced a series of hearings on how our anti-terrorism laws \nare working. As a member of that committee, I look forward to the \nopportunity of exploring these issues in detail and finding solutions \nfor any problems we discover, possibly including the SAFE Act. The \nchanges this bill makes are not numerous or sweeping, but they are \nsignificant. I hope my colleagues will agree and will support the \nlegislation we are introducing today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1709\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EXTENSION OF PATRIOT SUNSET PROVISION.\n\n       Section 224(a) of the USA PATRIOT ACT (18 U.S.C. 2510 note) \n     is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``213, 216, 219,''; and\n       (2) by inserting ``and section 505'' after ``by those \n     sections)''.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the USA PATRIOT Act, the counterterrorism \nbill that the Bush administration pushed through Congress after the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks, has been the focus of much controversy \nin recent months. I voted for the PATRIOT Act, as did the vast majority \nof my colleagues in the Congress. I believed then, and I still believe, \nthat the PATRIOT Act made many reasonable and necessary changes in the \nlaw.\n  For example, the PATRIOT Act tripled the number of Federal agents at \nthe Northern border, an area that had been greatly understaffed. It \nallocated $100 million to upgrade technology for monitoring the \nNorthern border. It expedited the hiring of FBI translators, who were \ndesperately needed to translate intelligence after 9/11.\n  Most importantly, the PATRIOT Act updated information technology and \nenhanced information sharing between Federal agencies, especially the \nFBI and the CIA. As we learned after 9/11, the failure of these \nagencies to communicate with each other may have prevented law \nenforcement from uncovering the 9/11 plot before that terrible day.\n  However, the PATRIOT Act contains several controversial provisions \nthat I and many of my colleagues believe went too far. The Bush \nadministration placed Congress in a very difficult situation by \ninsisting on including these provisions in the bill. We were able to \namend or sunset some of the most troubling components of the bill. \nHowever, many remained in the final version. As a result, the PATRIOT \nAct makes it much easier for the FBI to monitor the innocent activities \nof American citizens with minimal or no judicial oversight. For \nexample:\n  The FBI can now seize records on the books you check out of the \nlibrary or the videos you rent, simply by certifying that the records \nare sought for a terrorism or intelligence investigation, a very low \nstandard. A court no longer has authority to question the FBI's \ncertification. The FBI no longer must show that the documents relate to \na suspected terrorist or spy.\n\n  The FBI can conduct a ``sneak and peek'' search of your home, not \nnotifying you of the search until after a ``reasonable period,'' a term \nwhich is not defined in the PATRIOT Act. A court is now authorized to \nissue a ``sneak and peek'' warrant where a court finds ``reasonable \ncause'' that providing immediate notice of the warrant would have an \n``adverse result,'' a very broad standard. The use of ``sneak and \npeek'' warrants is not limited to terrorism cases.\n  The FBI can obtain a ``John Doe'' roving wiretap, which does not \nspecify the target of the wiretap or the place to be wiretapped. This \nincreases the likelihood that the conversations of innocent people \nwholly unrelated to an investigation will be intercepted.\n  Many in Congress did not want to deny law enforcement some of the \nreasonable reforms contained in the PATRIOT Act that they needed to \ncombat terrorism. So, we reluctantly decided to support the \nadministration's version of the bill, but not until we secured a \ncommitment that they would be responsive to Congressional oversight and \nconsult extensively with us before seeking any further changes in the \nlaw.\n\n[[Page S12386]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the Justice Department has reneged on their commitment \nto Congress, frustrating oversight on the PATRIOT Act at every turn. \nAttorney General Ashcroft only rarely appears on Capitol Hill. In fact, \nhe has only testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which I \nam a member, once this year. He appeared, along with two other \nadministration officials, for just half a day. The Justice Department \nregularly fails to answer congressional inquiries, either arguing that \nrequested information is classified, or simply not responding at all.\n  At the same time, the administration's allies in Congress have argued \nthat the PATRIOT Act's sunset clauses should be repealed before we have \nhad an opportunity to review their effectiveness. Earlier this year, we \nlearned that the administration had secretly drafted another sweeping \ncounterterrorism bill, ``PATRIOT Act II,'' without consulting with \nCongress. This bill would grant the Justice Department even broader \nauthority, such as the right to strip Americans of their citizenship.\n  That proposal generated widespread opposition, but, unchastened, the \nadministration went on the offensive again recently. On the anniversary \nof the 9/11 attacks, President Bush proposed new legislation that would \ngive the Justice Department the authority to issue so-called \nadministrative subpoenas, without judicial review, create 15 new \nfederal death penalty crimes, and mandate pretrial detention for \ndefendants accused of a laundry list of crimes, many of them unrelated \nto terrorism. These proposals continue the Administration's pattern of \nseeking to limit judicial oversight and grant broad, unchecked \nauthority to law enforcement.\n  While they are pushing radical changes in the law, the Bush \nadministration has failed to take commonsense steps to prevent \nterrorism, like developing fully interoperable information systems and \ncreating a consolidated terrorist watch list. Most of the information \nsystems now within the Department of Homeland Security's jurisdiction \nwere acquired and developed independently within the former agencies in \na parochial ``stovepipe'' fashion, and may be incompatible with other \nDHS systems. The Bush administration indicated that an initial \ninventory of these systems would be completed by this spring. I \nunderstand that inventory is still not completed.\n  This April, the GAO concluded that nine different agencies still \ndevelop and maintain a dozen terrorist watch lists, including \noverlapping and different data, and inconsistent procedures and \npolicies on information sharing. The law creating the Department of \nHomeland Security requires the Department to consolidate watch lists. \nThe Bush Administration promised that these lists would be consolidated \nby the first day of Homeland Security's operations. Seven months later, \nthe lists are still not consolidated.\n  The Bush administration has devoted too many resources to \ncounterterrorism measures that threaten our civil liberties and do \nlittle to improve our security. For example, John Ashcroft's Justice \nDepartment has launched a number of high-profile initiatives that \nexplicitly target immigrants, especially Arabs and Muslims, for \nheightened scrutiny. These efforts squander precious law enforcement \nresources and alienate communities whose cooperation we desperately \nneed. They run counter to basic principles of community policing, which \nreject the use of racial and ethnic profiles and focus on building \ntrust and respect by working cooperatively with community members.\n  The Justice Department's own Inspector General has found that the \nJustice Department has not adequately distinguished between terrorism \nsuspects and other immigration detainees. The IG found that the Justice \nDepartment detained 762 aliens as a result of the September 11 \ninvestigation, exactly zero of whom were charged with terrorist-related \noffenses. No one is suggesting that the Department should never use \nimmigration charges to detain a suspected terrorist, but the broad \nbrush of terrorism should not be applied to large numbers of every out-\nof-status immigrants who happen to be Arab or Muslim.\n  Many of us in Congress have raised concerns with the Justice \nDepartment about implementation of the PATRIOT Act and other civil \nliberties issues, and, rather than respond to legitimate concerns, they \nhave gone on the offensive. In testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee, Attorney General John Ashcroft warned his critics:\n\n       To those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of \n     lost liberty; my message is this: Your tactics only aid \n     terrorists--for they erode our national unity and diminish \n     our resolve. They give ammunition to America's enemies, and \n     pause to America's friends. They encourage people of good \n     will to remain silent in the face of evil.\n\n  It is unacceptable to dismiss those who raise legitimate concerns \nabout civil liberties as terrorist sympathizers.\n  For the American people, the PATRIOT Act has become a potent symbol \nof the Justice Department's poor record on civil liberties. In fact, \nthree states, Alaska, Hawaii, and Vermont, and over 180 cities and \ncounties across the country, including Chicago in my home State of \nIllinois, have passed resolutions opposing provisions of the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  Almost 2 years after its passage, I believe that it is time to \nrevisit the debate about the PATRIOT Act. Let me be clear: I do not \nbelieve that we should repeal the PATRIOT Act. However, I do believe \nthat we should amend several of its most troubling provisions. Law \nenforcement must have all the necessary tools to combat terrorism, but \nwe must also be careful to protect the civil liberties of Americans. I \nbelieve we can be both safe and free.\n  Today, I, Senator Craig, and several of our Republican and Democratic \ncolleagues in the Senate introduced the Security and Freedom Ensured \nAct of 2003. The SAFE Act is a narrowly-tailored bipartisan bill that \nwould amend the most problematic provisions of the PATRIOT Act, those \nthat grant broad powers to the FBI to monitor Americans with inadequate \njudicial oversight. The bill would impose reasonable limits on law \nenforcement's authority without impeding their ability to investigate \nand prevent terrorism. It would not amend pre-PATRIOT Act law in \nanyway. The SAFE Act is supported by a broad coalition from across the \npolitical spectrum, including the American Civil Liberties Union and \nthe American Conservative Union.\n  The SAFE Act would:\n  Reinstate the pre-PATRIOT Act standard for seizing business records. \nIn order to obtain a subpoena, the FBI would have to demonstrate that \nit has reason to believe that the person to whom the records relate is \na suspected terrorist or spy. The SAFE Act retains the expansion of the \nbusiness record provision to include all business records, including \nlibrary records, rather than just the four types of records--hotel, car \nrental, storage facility and common carrier--covered before the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  Authorize a court to issue a delayed notification warrant where \nnotice of the warrant would endanger the life or physical safety of an \nindividual, result in flight from prosecution, or result in the \ndestruction of or tampering with the evidence sought under the warrant. \nIt would require notification of a covert search within seven days, \nrather than an undefined ``reasonable period.'' It would authorize \nunlimited additional 7-day delays if the court found that notice of the \nwarrant would continue to endanger the life or physical safety of an \nindividual, result in flight from prosecution, or result in the \ndestruction of or tampering with the evidence sought under the warrant.\n  Limit ``John Doe'' roving wiretaps by requiring the warrant to \nidentify either the target of the wiretap or the place to be \nwiretapped. To protect innocent people from Government surveillance, it \nwould also require that surveillance be conducted only when the suspect \nis present at the place to be wiretapped.\n  Sunset several of the PATRIOT Act's most controversial surveillance \nprovisions on December 31, 2005. Many of PATRIOT's surveillance \nprovisions already sunset on December 31, 2005. The SAFE Act would \nsimply give Congress an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of \nseveral additional controversial provisions before deciding whether to \nreauthorize them.\n  Under the SAFE Act, the FBI would still have broad authority to \ncombat terrorism. For example, consider the following hypotheticals:\n\n[[Page S12387]]\n\n  The FBI would like to search the travel records of a suspected \nterrorist to help determine if he attended a meeting with other \nextremists. The FBI has reason to believe the records are related to a \nsuspected terrorist, so the SAFE Act would authorize the issuance of a \nsubpoena.\n  The FBI suspects that an individual affiliated with an extremist \norganization is planning a terrorist attack. The FBI would like to \nsearch the suspect's computer drive to learn more about the plot \nwithout tipping off the suspect and his co-conspirators. The SAFE Act \nwould permit the issuance of a ``sneak and peek'' warrant, and permit \nthe FBI to delay notice of the warrant for as long as it would continue \nto endanger the life or physical safety of an individual, result in \nflight from prosecution, or result in the destruction of or tampering \nwith the evidence sought under the warrant.\n  At the same time, the SAFE Act would protect innocent Americans from \nunchecked Government surveillance. For example:\n  The FBI is investigating suspected members of a terrorist cell and \nwould like to subpoena the records of a library and a bookstore that \nthey frequent. Currently, the FBI could subpoena all of the records of \nthe library and bookstore, including the records of countless innocent \nAmericans, by certifying they are sought for a terrorism investigation, \nthe exceedingly low standard created by the PATRIOT Act. The SAFE Act \nwould permit the FBI to obtain the records related to the suspected \nterrorists, but not records related to innocent Americans who are not \nsuspected terrorists.\n  The FBI is tracking a suspected terrorist who is using public phones \nat local restaurants to do business. The PATRIOT Act would permit the \nissuance of a roving wiretap that would apply to any phone the suspect \nuses. Under the PATRIOT Act, the FBI could monitor the conversations \nnot just of the suspect, but of innocent patrons of these restaurants. \nThe SAFE Act would also permit the issuance of a roving wiretap that \nwould apply to any phone the suspect uses, but would only permit the \nFBI to gather intelligence when they ascertain that the suspect is \nusing a phone.\n  The Justice Department has argued that amending the PATRIOT Act would \nhandcuff law enforcement and make it very difficult to combat \nterrorism. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is possible to \ncombat terrorism and protect our liberties. The SAFE Act demonstrates \nthat. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/02/senate-section/article/S12387-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 238--AUTHORIZING REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE USE OF \n                           OFFICIAL EQUIPMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. SMITH submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 1585, making appropriations for Departments of \nCommerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related agencies for \nthe fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes; \nwhich was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 38, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec. 2313. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States armed forces entered Iraq on March \n     19, 2003 to liberate the Iraqi people from Saddam Hussein and \n     remove a threat to global security and stability.\n       (2) Having liberated the country from its prior regime, the \n     United States and its coalition partners now have the \n     temporary responsibility of rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure \n     and economy until a new Iraqi government can take over this \n     work.\n       (3) During the long reign of Saddam Hussein many public and \n     private entities extended billions of dollars in loans to his \n     regime despite his record of aggression and barbarism. Such \n     debts must not be permitted to burden the new Iraq that is \n     now emerging or be a factor in shaping current efforts to \n     rebuild Iraq.\n       (4) Pursuant to basic principles of bankruptcy law, such \n     prior creditors are no longer entitled to repayment of their \n     loans. These creditors extended money to a debtor regime that \n     no longer exists and is the functional equivalent of a \n     bankrupt estate.\n       (5) Pursuant to basic principles of equity, the people of \n     Iraq must not be burdened with the obligation of repaying \n     loans that funded the very regime that oppressed them.\n       (6) Entities which extended financial support to the regime \n     of Saddam Hussein after his record of military aggression and \n     war crimes became public did so contrary to international \n     norms of decency and United States foreign policy. Those who \n     thus aided and abetted Saddam Hussein were accessories before \n     the fact to the atrocities committed by Saddam Hussein and \n     should not be rewarded with repayment of their loans.\n       (7) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483, which \n     passed unanimously on May 22, 2003, specifically provides \n     that all proceeds from the sale of Iraqi oil be deposited \n     into a United States-controlled development fund for the \n     reconstruction of Iraq.\n       (8) Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1483, the United States has an obligation to use revenue \n     generated by the sale of Iraqi oil to fund the reconstruction \n     of Iraq.\n       (9) Pursuant to basic principles of bankruptcy law, the \n     United States is entitled to priority repayment of any loans \n     the United States now extends to Iraq. Such loans are the \n     equivalent of debtor-in-possession financing because the \n     loans are being extended to an already distressed entity in \n     order to help that entity rebuild. Loans made under such \n     circumstances are traditionally repaid before any previously \n     extended loans.\n       (10) Pursuant to basic principles of secured transactions, \n     the United States is entitled to priority repayment of any \n     loans it now extends to Iraq. The United States is currently \n     in control of Iraq and its assets and is therefore a secured \n     creditor, a creditor in physical possession of collateral, \n     entitled to priority repayment.\n       (11) Pursuant to the norms of international financial aid, \n     the United States is entitled to priority repayment of any \n     loans it extends to Iraq. The role of the United States in \n     Iraq is analogous to the role of the International Monetary \n     Fund and the World Bank in extending credit to a distressed \n     country to help it achieve solvency. Such International \n     Monetary Fund and World Bank loans are repaid prior to any \n     pre-existing loans.\n       (12) Extending loans instead of outright grants to Iraq \n     will not lend credibility to any assertion that the United \n     States liberated Iraq merely to gain control of its oil \n     assets. The United States seeks to use Iraqi oil revenues for \n     one purpose only, namely, to rebuild Iraq for the good of the \n     Iraqi people. The United States will not use these assets to \n     pay for its own military expenses in Iraq (which far exceed \n     the cost of reconstruction). Nor will the United States take \n     any Iraqi assets with it when it leaves the country.\n       (13) Extending loans instead of outright grants to Iraq \n     will not make it more difficult for the United States to \n     secure participation from other potential donor nations in \n     the rebuilding of Iraq. If the United States provides all \n     reconstruction funds in advance in the form of grants, there \n     will be little need or incentive for other donor nations to \n     contribute funds. If the United States provides only loans, \n     however, it leaves open the question of whether and how much \n     all donor nations, including the United States, should \n     provide to Iraq in the form of grants.\n       (14) The United States does not typically fund the \n     development projects of other nations with outright grants. \n     When Israel undertakes a major new infrastructure or \n     development project, for example, the United States assists \n     Israel by providing loan guarantees. Such loan guarantees \n     have no cost to United States taxpayers if Israel repays its \n     loans. Iraq should be treated no better than allies of the \n     United States such as Israel.\n       (b) Of the amount appropriated in title II under the \n     subheading ``Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund'' under the \n     heading ``OTHER BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FUNDS \n     APPROPRIATED TO THE PRESIDENT'', $20,304,000,000 shall be \n     used as loans to, or used to guarantee loans entered into by, \n     the Development Fund for Iraq acting on behalf of the people \n     of Iraq. The Development Fund for Iraq shall act in \n     consultation with the Governing Council in Iraq, or any \n     successor governing authority in Iraq, and shall, as provided \n     in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483, be \n     subject to audits supervised by the International Advisory \n     and Monitoring Board of the Development Fund for Iraq. The \n     members of such Board shall include duly qualified \n     representatives of the United Nations Secretary General, of \n     the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, of \n     the Director General of the Arab Fund for Social and Economic \n     Development, and the President of the World Bank.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1802.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Deciphering the sequence of the human genome and other \n     advances in genetics open major new opportunities for medical \n     progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of illness \n     will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before \n     symptoms have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to \n     take steps to reduce the likelihood that they will contract a \n     particular disorder. New knowledge about genetics may allow \n     for the development of better therapies that are more \n     effective against disease or have fewer side effects than \n     current treatments. These advances give rise to the potential \n     misuse of genetic information to discriminate in health \n     insurance and employment.\n       (2) The early science of genetics became the basis of State \n     laws that provided for the sterilization of persons having \n     presumed genetic ``defects'' such as mental retardation, \n     mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among \n     other conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in \n     the State of Indiana in 1907. By 1981, a majority of States \n     adopted sterilization laws to ``correct'' apparent genetic \n     traits or tendencies. Many of these State laws have since \n     been repealed, and many have been modified to include \n     essential constitutional requirements of due process and \n     equal protection. However, the current explosion in the \n     science of genetics, and the history of sterilization laws by \n     the States based on early genetic science, compels \n     Congressional action in this area.\n       (3) Although genes are facially neutral markers, many \n     genetic conditions and disorders are associated with \n     particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some \n     genetic traits are most prevalent in particular groups, \n     members of a particular group may be stigmatized or \n     discriminated against as a result of that genetic \n     information. This form of discrimination was evident in the \n     1970s, which saw the advent of programs to screen and \n     identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a disease which \n     afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures \n     began to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the \n     early 1970s began mandating genetic screening of all African \n     Americans for sickle cell anemia, leading to discrimination \n     and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this stigma, \n     Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia \n     Control Act, which withholds Federal funding from States \n     unless sickle cell testing is voluntary.\n       (4) Congress has been informed of examples of genetic \n     discrimination in the workplace. These include the use of \n     pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley \n     Laboratory, which led to a court decision in favor of the \n     employees in that case Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley \n     Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998)). Congress \n     clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the \n     fear of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice \n     in employment and health insurance.\n\n[[Page S12395]]\n\n       (5) Federal law addressing genetic discrimination in health \n     insurance and employment is incomplete in both the scope and \n     depth of its protections. Moreover, while many States have \n     enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these \n     laws vary widely with respect to their approach, application, \n     and level of protection. Congress has collected substantial \n     evidence that the American public and the medical community \n     find the existing patchwork of State and Federal laws to be \n     confusing and inadequate to protect them from discrimination. \n     Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and \n     uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the \n     public from discrimination and allay their concerns about the \n     potential for discrimination, thereby allowing individuals to \n     take advantage of genetic testing, technologies, research, \n     and new therapies.\n\n         TITLE I--GENETIC NONDISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, this legislation and the unanimous consent \nthat was just obtained signifies an important accomplishment of this \nbody but an accomplishment that resulted after about 6 years of work. \nAs with so much important legislation, I think we sometimes take for \ngranted how much work it takes to get to a certain point. Then when we \npresent the bill, debate the bill, and then pass the bill, we move very \nquickly on to other issues.\n  What the unanimous consent just said was that we will be voting on \nthis Tuesday when we get back from recess; that all time for debate and \ndiscussion on this particular issue, which I should add over the last 6 \nyears has been debated a lot on this floor, will have been exhausted.\n  For more than 6 years, Members of this body have worked on this \nissue. I have worked with Senator Olympia Snowe for about 5\\3/4\\ years, \nalong with Senators Jeffords, Enzi, Gregg, Hagel, Collins, and DeWine \non this issue of genetic nondiscrimination. Today, with the invaluable \ncontributions of Senators Daschle and Kennedy, we bring to the Senate \nfloor this solid, important, significant legislation that, if I had to \nsummarize, I would say provides individuals, citizens, patients, with \nstrong protections against the potential of genetic discrimination in \nhealth insurance.\n  I especially want to take this opportunity to commend the chairman of \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Chairman Judd \nGregg, for his leadership on this issue. In large part, it is due to \nhis passion and commitment to this issue, to the principle of fairness \nand of equity, which has driven this process forward.\n  I also commend President Bush for his dedication in ensuring strong \nprotections against genetic discrimination and for bringing attention \nto this critical matter.\n\n  When we began work on this issue many years ago, we were looking \nahead at what we anticipated, which was the anticipation of the \ndecoding of the human genome. At that time, we looked to the future. We \nwanted to preempt potential problems. Yes, it has taken 6 years, but \nfinally with passage a week from next Tuesday we can be satisfied that \nwe accomplished that goal set out 6 years ago.\n  This decoding of the human genome, which is about 3 billion bits of \ninformation that we did not have 15 years ago that we have now, has \nbeen accomplished. In fact, it was this year that scientists, working \nin collaboration with the National Human Genome Research Institute at \nthe National Institutes of Health, published a final draft documenting \nthe sequence of the entire human genetic code.\n  The publication of this final draft occurred more than 2 years ahead \nof schedule and almost 50 years to the day from the historic \npublication by Dr. James Watson and Dr. Francis Crick of DNAs double \nhelix.\n  This dazzling accomplishment has begun to usher in a whole new era of \nmedical understanding. It has already begun to expand our understanding \nof human development and health, as well as disease. For example, the \ndiscovery of disease genes holds great promise. Based on this \ndiscovery, scientists may be able to design drugs to treat specific \ngenes and genetic defects. Organs and tissues may be specifically \nengineered for use in transplantation. Preventive care will be based in \npart on genetic testing.\n  This explosion of knowledge, these tremendous advances in science and \ntechnology, are also fraught with risk, which this legislation will \nminimize.\n  When I first joined Senator Snowe in this effort several years ago, \nat that point in time almost a third, one out of three, of the women \noffered a test for breast cancer risk at the National Institutes of \nHealth declined the test. The reason they gave at that time for \ndeclining the test was that the result might in some way be made \navailable to an insurance company which would then use that data, that \ninformation, to discriminate against them in whether health insurance \nwould be issued to them.\n  I think it is a tremendous example of the danger of having a threat \nof discrimination, preventing one from getting a test that might be \nuseful to them. Thus, that example led me to strongly believe then, and \nI do now, that we must protect people from the threat of genetic \ninformation in any way being used against them. That is a practical \nresponsibility. It is a moral responsibility and it is one with this \nlegislation that this body speaks to directly.\n  Simply stated, if unchecked, the fear of genetic discrimination would \nhave the potential of keeping people from participating in very useful \nresearch studies. It had the potential for keeping people from taking \nadvantage of new genetic technologies, and it had the potential of \nkeeping an individual from having the opportunity to obtain information \nthat demonstrated that they are not at risk for a potential genetically \ndetermined disease.\n  The fear of genetic discrimination has the potential to prevent \ncitizens from making informed health decisions for themselves or their \nloved ones.\n  Congress, of course, has a rich history in battling against \ndiscrimination, most notably through the landmark 1964 Civil Rights \nAct. We think also of the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act and the \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The legislation \nbefore us now extends those very same protections to citizens who have \ngenetic markers, a move that, ultimately, I believe, through this \nlegislation, will allow us to save lives.\n\n[[Page S12417]]\n\n  Genetic research, this unraveling of the genetic code, genetic \ntesting will undoubtedly unleash tremendous advances to the benefit of \nmankind--thrilling advances, possible cures to illnesses today that \nseem vexing, that we do not fully understand. The potential medical \nadvances from our knowledge of the human genome will be more dramatic \nthan any of the advances that I had the opportunity to directly \nparticipate in over 20 years in the practice of medicine--just from \nthis single unraveling of the genetic code.\n  As we greet the future, as we look at new technology, this is just \none example of this body acting proactively, acting preemptively, so \nthat such potential use in a discriminatory fashion of medical advances \nis kept from hurting the American people. We must take care to protect \nour body politic, and this legislation does just that. I am pleased by \nthe progress we have made thus far, and I do congratulate each of my \ncolleagues on their dedication to this issue over the last several \nyears.\n  This legislation stands squarely on our time-tested civil rights laws \nestablishing comprehensive, equitable, fair, consistent, and reasonable \nprotections. I strongly support this bill, and I look forward to its \nswift passage when we vote on Tuesday, following our recess.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this year we celebrated the 50 year \nanniversary of the now fabled discovery by Watson and Crick of the \ndouble helix. And this year the scientists at the NIH Human Genome \nProject completed the sequencing of human DNA.\n  These are major historical developments that will permanently change \nthe course of biological science. The color of our eyes and the \ntreatment of disease are now understood through the lens of genetics. \nAs the science has progressed, so too have reservations with what we \nwill do with this new information we are uncovering. Unlocking our \ngenetic code unleashes new power. And power produces new \nresponsibilities in protecting the privacy of our genetic information \nand protecting it from misuse.\n  Scientific advances in field of genetics hold great promise for \nmedical prevention of new treatments and therapies. However, because \nour public policies lag behind the science, the promise of the Human \nGenome Project is going unfulfilled. Individuals are afraid to get \ngenetic tests or seek genetic counseling out of fear that they will \nlose their health insurance or face discrimination in their employment.\n  After 6 years, numerous hearings, and hours of deliberation, I am \npleased the Senate is finally taking up this important legislation, \nwhich was unanimously reported out of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee on May 21, 2003. I am also pleased that the first \ncivil rights legislation adopted under my chairmanship deals with an \nissue of truly 21st century concerns. This is the first civil rights \nact of the 21st century.\n  Genetic discrimination is an issue that affect all Americans. \nEveryone has genes. Everyone has hereditary medical traits. It's a non-\npartisan issue. This is reflected in the fact that this legislation is \ntruly a bipartisan product. For more than a year, the HELP Committee \nhas worked hard to marry together two major pieces of legislation--one \nsponsored by Senators Snowe/Frist/Jeffords and the other sponsored \nSenators Daschle and Kennedy.\n  This legislation established in Federal law basic legal protections \nthat prohibit discrimination in health insurance or employment based on \ngenetic information.\n  A key component of the legislation is its privacy provisions. \nAlthough current law already contains medical privacy rules covering \ngenetic information, this legislation addresses some additional \nconcerns and closes loopholes that are unique to genetics. For \ninstance, it protects the privacy of genetic information at work and \nprohibits the use of genetic information in health insurance \nunderwriting.\n\n  This bill prohibits an employer from making employment decisions--\nhiring, firing, etc.--based on genetic information, or even that fact \nthan an individual or family member requested or received genetic \nservices.\n  This bill prohibits health insurance plans from denying eligibility \nor enrollment in the health plan based on genetic information. And it \nprohibits health insurance plans from charging higher premiums based on \nan individual's--or his or her family member's--genetic information.\n  Most importantly, the legislation recognizes that all individuals, \nwhether they are healthy or sick, and all medical information, whether \ngenetic or otherwise, should be afforded the same protections under \nlaw.\n  While genetic discrimination may not be widespread at this point in \ntime, this legislation ensures that discriminatory practices will never \nbecome common practice. From the past we have learned that employees, \nemployers, insurers and others all work best together when the rules \nare clear and opportunities for personal achievement and health are \navailable. This legislation tells everyone what is expected of them and \navoids the trip wires and uncertainty of some of our existing laws.\n  Any concerns about new regulations on employers or health plans are \nfar outweighed by the benefits of scientific advances that will further \nrevolutionize the medical field. With no silver bullet solution in \nsight to cure what ails our expensive and troubled health care system, \nI believe all stakeholders will welcome reasonable legislation that \nfosters medical advances that can lead to prevention and cure disease.\n  It is my hope that the bipartisan spirit that brought the parties \ntogether to craft this historic legislation will continue as we seek to \nrealize the full potential of the human genome project.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
