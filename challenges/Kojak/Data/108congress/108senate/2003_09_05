Mr. President, this morning we will resume consideration \nof the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. Beginning at 9:30 this morning, \nthere will be two consecutive votes in relation to amendments to this \nappropriations bill. The first vote will be in relation to Senator \nClinton's amendment on a bioterrorism workforce, and the second will be \nin relation to the Harkin amendment on school renovation. Following \nthose votes, the chairman and ranking member are prepared to remain and \ndebate further amendments.\n  As we have indicated previously, we need and plan on finishing this \nbill as soon as possible. There are additional appropriations bills \nthat are now ready for full Senate action, and once this bill is \ncompleted we will be proceeding to those bills. We need to continue to \nwork in an orderly way, which has been demonstrated over the course of \nthis week. Today I know will be a very productive day, as will Monday.\n  It is my hope we can finish Labor-HHS, this appropriations bill, no \nlater than Tuesday, and with the cooperation of Members working \ntogether, this is indeed still possible. This will require votes this \nmorning. There will be just these two votes this morning. Again, debate \nwill continue throughout the course of the day. We will be voting late \nMonday afternoon. Specific times will be set later today. There may be \nmultiple votes on Monday. I will have more to say on Monday's schedule \nlater today, as we see what amendments are offered and which will be \nappropriate to vote on on Monday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11133-6", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we worked the day before yesterday and \nyesterday and did come up with a finite list of amendments on our side \nand on the majority's side. The respective staffs worked closely \ntogether, and we now have a list. We were hopeful last night we could \nhave had that put into a unanimous consent request. We have been told \nthat the issue holding that up has been the request that we had to have \nan overtime vote on Tuesday when all four Presidential candidates will \nbe here.\n  I will say, through the Chair to the majority leader, from the first \nday I started talking, as did Senator Harkin, to the Republican \nmanager, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, we acknowledged that we \nwanted to have a vote on Tuesday. So it is not anything that is new or \nunique that we have been setting that time aside tentatively.\n  We would hope that before we leave here this morning, we can have \nsome kind of agreement to that effect. Otherwise, we will do our best \nto cooperate, but we certainly need that vote. We think it would be the \nright thing to do to have as many of our people here as possible when \nthat vote occurs. As the leader knows, we have a few Republican votes \non that, but with the margins as small as they are, it would be a very \nclose vote. We should have everyone whenever that vote occurs.\n  We have been acting in very good faith. It was hard to get agreement \non our side. That is why I was hoping we could have it done last night. \nI do hope we can have that done today.\n  Senator Domenici and I have worked the Energy and water bill on many \noccasions. We feel we have a good bill. It is one I am glad the \nmajority leader is going to move to quickly because we are going to \nhave a very difficult conference with the House. There are some big \nissues we normally don't have to work with in our conference that are \nin dispute. I think we can finish that bill in a fairly short period of \ntime. It is a bill that is very important to almost every Member.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. In response to the assistant Democratic leader, scheduling \nis always a challenge. I appreciate the straightforward way he presents \nit because it is very clear that on the other side of the aisle there \nare a number of people running for the nomination for\n\n[[Page S11134]]\n\nPresident and the candidates are participating in the political \nprocess. But we do have business here in the Senate. To try to dictate \nthe schedule entirely around their candidacy for President is just \nimpractical. I cannot do that. I want to be respectful as much as \npossible as we go forward. It is difficult. I want to be as \naccommodating as we possibly can in terms of votes, allowing people to \nparticipate.\n  On the other hand, we need to keep business going. We have made great \nprogress in terms of the amendments on our side and on the other side, \ngetting them down to a manageable number. Some might question ``a \nmanageable number,'' but to a number that we can work with. I \nappreciate that. That is what it is going to take in order to bring \nreal focus to this bill.\n  In terms of agreeing to when we will vote on, indeed, a very \ncomplicated and complex issue at a specific time, at a day that is most \nconvenient because of political candidates running around the country, \nespecially since that amendment has not even yet been offered, is \nsomething we can't do at this time. That was explained to the other \nside of the aisle. That should not slow things down at all. But again, \nthere is an orderly process. When the amendment is provided and \ndebated, we have a lot of people who will want to speak on that. Again, \nthe issue is a very important one.\n  We are making real progress. I am pleased where we are in terms of \nhaving this manageable group of amendments. Systematically, we will be \ngoing through those over the course of the day and Monday and Tuesday. \nHopefully, we will complete the bill.\n  Mr. REID. If I may briefly reply, we shared the amendment Senator \nHarkin is going to offer with Senator Specter and Republican staff. The \nquestion is when he should offer it. He could have offered it last \nnight. He will offer it today. Everyone has had the opportunity to see \nthe amendment.\n  We are respectful of the majority leader's problems in trying to set \nschedules. That is why, when we have had very close votes, we have not \nasked for revotes when our people come back. It is not often we have \nasked to have a vote at a certain time, but we have telegraphed, so to \nspeak, our punch and let everyone know we were trying to get something \nlined up for Tuesday. I hope we can do that. With the number of \namendments we have, as the leader knows, we can finish the bill very \nquickly or it can take a long time. We hope on Tuesday we can have that \nvote to work toward ending debate on this very important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11134-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, until the hour \nof 9:30 a.m., the time will be equally divided between the two bill \nmanagers or their designees.\n  In my capacity as a Senator from Alaska, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask the clerk to call the roll. The time will be charged \nagainst both sides.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand the first vote this morning \nwill be on the Harkin amendment; is that true?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The first vote will be on the Clinton \namendment, No. 1565, to be followed by the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Iowa, No. 1575.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1575\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to speak a couple minutes on my \namendment. The amendment we will be voting on has to do with school \nconstruction. Actually 3 years ago, this Congress appropriated almost \n$1 billion for school construction around the United States. This money \nhas gone out to States all over the country. Some of it has been used \nand some of it still is going out for construction and renovation \npurposes. But what it has done is leveraged for every Federal dollar \nabout $15 or $20 of local money. So we are getting a heck of a bang for \nthe buck by putting money into school construction and renovation. That \nhappened in Iowa, and it is happening in every other State in the \ncountry.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers 3 years ago gave a report \ncard on the infrastructure of America, and they gave the schools a D \nminus, the lowest grade of any category, lower than sewer and water and \nhighways and everything else. They said schools were a D minus 3 years \nago. Just yesterday they came out with their report card again and said \nthere has been no progress at all.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. The time \nwas equally divided before 9:30. The Senator's time has expired. Under \nthe previous agreement, the time before 9:30 was equally divided \nbetween the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am very sympathetic to the objectives \nsought by the Senator from Iowa. In the past, on budget resolutions in \nprior years, I have supported using Federal funds on school \nconstruction. But the difficulty this year is that there is no money \navailable for this line. Senator Harkin and I, on a bipartisan basis, \nhave worked out the allocation of $137 billion. I would like to have \nmoney for school construction, but it simply isn't there.\n  It was not included in the budget resolution this year. It has always \nbeen highly controversial to pass this body, and it was only Senator \nD'Amato and Senator Campbell and I who supported it in the past, when \nSenator Harkin spearheaded this effort along with Carol Moseley-Braun. \nThis is one of the many laudable objectives I would like to see funded. \nI fought hard for a larger allocation from the subcommittee. I would be \nglad to join Senator Harkin in supporting this measure, but as manager \nit is my duty to stay within the confines of the bill and within the \nconfines of the allocation. So it is with regret that I have to raise a \npoint of order.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order under section 504 of the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year\n\n[[Page S11135]]\n\n2004 that the amendment exceeds the discretionary spending limits \nspecified in this section and therefore is not in order.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Which amendment is the point of order \nraised against?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that was raised against the amendment to \nbe voted on first, which has already been noted by the Chair, the \namendment of Senator Clinton.\n  Similarly, I raise a point of order under section 504 of the \nconcurrent resolution for fiscal year 2004 that the amendment of \nSenator Harkin exceeds the discretionary spending limits and therefore \nis not in order.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. So the Senator has made a point of order \nunder each of the amendments?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 504(b)(2) of House \nConcurrent Resolution 95, the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nfiscal year 2004, I move to waive section 504 of that concurrent \nresolution for the purpose of the pending amendment, and also for the \namendment that I offered, which would be following this vote at 9:30 on \nthe Clinton amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the two motions are \nreceived.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on both \namendments.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 1565\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the motion \nwith respect to amendment No. 1565.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McConnell.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 23, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. None of the funds provided under this Act shall \n     be used to promulgate or implement any regulation that \n     exempts from the requirements of section 7 of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 207) any employee who is not \n     otherwise exempted pursuant to regulations under section 13 \n     of such Act (29 U.S.C. 213) that were in effect as of \n     September 3, 2003.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is an amendment about which I spoke \nat some length yesterday and the day before on the floor. Others spoke \non it also. This is the amendment that would preclude the \nadministration from issuing final proposed regulations that would take \naway the right of up to 8 million to 10 million Americans to get \novertime pay if they work over 40 hours a week.\n  Just to recap for a minute, earlier this year, sort of under the \ncover of darkness, without one hearing, the Department of Labor issued \nproposed regulations to modify the Fair Labor Standards Act that would \nbasically modify, in a very drastic manner, how employers would decide \nwho was covered under overtime law and who was not.\n  Now, again, this has been in existence since 1938. We have had some \nchanges in it since that time, but none as sweeping as the \nAdministration has proposed this spring and that would result in \nmillions of working Americans losing their overtime pay protection.\n  The Department of Labor has said this only affects about 644,000 \nworkers. Well, they're only counting the people are currently, \nroutinely work overtime and receive overtime pay. There are about 8 to \n10 million people who are qualified to get overtime pay, but they are \nnot working overtime.\n  Again, if an employer were to ask them to work overtime, then they \nwould get time and a half. Well, this pending regulation would take \nthat away for many workers. And then we'll see their employers require \nthem to work longer hours, without pay.\n  The first wave of people who will be most affected by this will be \nworking women, women who work on a salary basis, maybe as accountants, \nworking in banks, insurance companies, whatever, women who have \nchildren in childcare, daycare centers. Now they are going to be asked \nto work longer hours with no more pay, but they are going to have to \ncontinue to pay more for childcare. This is antiworker. This is \nantifamily. And its bad economics.\n  Obviously, if I am an employer, and I don't have to pay overtime pay, \nand I can work people longer than 40 hours a week, I'm not going to \nhire new people.\n  And I will--not today; I know others want to speak this morning--but \nwhen we come back next week I will be laying out in even more detail \nhow it is that American workers are working longer than workers in all \nother industrialized countries, and now they are being asked to work \nlonger without even being paid for it.\n  I think this is one of the most crucial issues facing this Congress \nthis year: whether we are going to sit back and let the administration \nchange, sort of by fiat--not by legislation, not through the hearing \nprocess and the developing of legislation and the votes here--but just \nthrough rules and regulations, to just wipe out--wipe out--the \nprotections 8 to 10 million working Americans have to guarantee that if \nthey have to work over 40 hours a week, they are going to get at least \ntime-and-a-half overtime. Just wipe out the 40-hour work week, that has \nbeen law for 65 years now.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I am delighted to yield to the assistant leader.\n  Mr. REID. As the Democratic manager of this bill, it has been your \nintention, has it not, to have this as, if not the most important vote, \none of the most important votes in this multibillion dollar bill? I \nthink it is about a $125 billion bill you and Senator Specter are \nmanaging. So you consider this a very important vote?\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Nevada, I consider this--well, we \nhave a lot in the bill for education, but in terms of what we are going \nto do to protect working Americans, to protect their families, and to \nensure their right to get time-and-a-half overtime, this is the key \nvote.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to.\n  Mr. REID. And it has been a fact that we have presented to the \nmajority since Tuesday of this week the fact we were going to have our \nfour Democratic Presidential aspirants here on Tuesday, and that we \nwanted to have a vote on this most important amendment on next Tuesday; \nis that right?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the leader, yes, that is right. In fact, I was \npart of a conversation that took place on the floor just last evening \nregarding that. There were no surprises. The amendment I have offered I \nactually read into the Record yesterday so everyone knew what the \namendment was. It has been out there. It is not a very convoluted \namendment. It is just a very simple, straightforward amendment. So \neveryone knew what it was.\n  Since it is such an important issue, I think we all thought it would \nbe advisable to have as many Senators here as possible to vote on this \namendment. Therefore, as I understood it, there was at least some \nagreement made that we were going to vote next Tuesday on this \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. And we also worked very hard, with your staff principally \nand floor staff generally, to come up with a finite list of amendments \nDemocrats wanted to offer; is that true?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is my understanding. I saw the list. I think it was \ndrawn up last night with a finite list of amendments, yes.\n  Mr. REID. I would finally say to my friend, the distinguished \nDemocratic manager of this bill, the Senator would acknowledge, I am \nsure, we have been most cooperative in this most important piece of \nlegislation. We have set amendments aside and moved to other amendments \nfor the convenience of Senators.\n  It is my understanding the manager of this bill now feels so strongly \nabout this overtime amendment, that now this amendment is laid down, \nand you are not going to agree to set this amendment aside to offer any \nother amendments; is that true?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The leader has it correct. I feel so strongly about this, \nand the fact that we worked with the leadership on the other side and \non this side to try to get a finite list of amendments, to get a time \ncertain on Tuesday to vote on this so there would be no surprises to \nanyone, and then I am told today that has fallen through for some \nreason. It was not my intention until now, but it is my intention. I \nhave laid down the amendment. There are no more votes today. The leader \non that side said there would be no more votes today, that we would \nhave one vote or maybe two on Monday evening, I don't know on what. \nThere are other things up there.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield on that issue?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. We had two amendments lined up. We had one or more from the \nSenator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu. We had one on Head Start from the \nSenator from Connecticut, and we had one on libraries from Senator Reed \nof Rhode Island. We had amendments lined up here that would be offered \ntoday and we would vote on those Monday.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But as I understand it, that cannot happen now. So it is \nmy intention, since this is such a vitally important issue----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Iowa yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. In just a second, as soon as I finish my statement.\n  Since there are no more votes today, and there are only going to be \none or two votes on Monday, at the most--I don't know what is lined \nup--it is my intention that I will object to setting aside my amendment \nuntil such time as we have an up-or-down vote on it, which should occur \non Tuesday, so there should not be any problem. But I will object to \nmoving off this amendment for any other amendment.\n  Without losing my right to the floor, I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is entirely likely the Senator from \nIowa\n\n[[Page S11137]]\n\ncan regain the floor. I would like to make a brief statement.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was yielding without losing my right to the floor. I \nthought you wanted to ask me a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, I didn't say that, but I agree that you maintain \ncontrol of the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Oh, OK.\n  Mr. SPECTER. And you are just yielding for a brief comment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. OK.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the assistant Democratic leader and the \ndistinguished ranking member have been cooperative, I don't think \nrealistically anything above and beyond the call of duty. Senator \nHarkin is always cooperative, and so is Senator Reid. We have been \nworking on a list for some time and finally got the list late yesterday \nafternoon. But that was the first time a condition appeared that we \nwould have to set a time certain for an amendment. That is the first \ntime that occurred, and I found it rather surprising.\n  The Senator from Iowa made reference to an agreement. I don't think \nthere ever had been an agreement as to a time on Tuesday. That would be \nmy preference to accommodate the Democrats. But I think it is not \ninappropriate to say the calendar, as the Democrats wish it, revolves \naround the absence of their Members who are running for President, a \nlofty ambition. It even happened once to Senator Harkin. It even \nhappened once to me. But the Senate is in session on occasions when the \npeople who run for President are not present.\n  I can understand your interest in wanting a time certain to have all \nyour Members here. But in regular order, we debate amendments and we \nvote. In this august body, any Member can tie it up at any time. So \nthat tries to produce comity. I think Senators Reid and Harkin and I \nhave gone a long way to establish comity and try to get the business of \nthe Senate done. I will continue.\n  There are concerns on this side of the aisle to set a time on that \namendment. That is on the substance. There are also a lot of concerns \nabout letting the absentee Democrats set the time. I am prepared to do \nthat because that is the nature of our business here, and Senators do \nrun for the office of President. But it is my hope that as we reflect \non this matter over the weekend, cooperation will prevail on all sides, \nthat we try to work to a time which is agreeable to the absentee \nSenators, that we do ultimately set aside amendments, and that we \nproceed to take care of the business of the Senate.\n  I am distressed to know that the amendments which were going to be \noffered are not now going to be offered. That enables me to return to \nPennsylvania a little earlier today. I have a primary campaign in the \ngeneral election. We are in the election cycle, but this is my day job, \nand I would be here as late as necessary to finish the work of the \nSenate.\n  As far as this week is concerned, on Tuesday we worked 6 hours 45 \nminutes and had two amendments on which to vote. And we thank the \nDemocrats for offering them. On Wednesday we worked 9 hours 59 minutes, \nand on Thursday 10 hours 50 minutes. We have only had seven rollcall \nvotes. Two amendments were accepted by voice vote, and we have 92 \nDemocratic amendments and 27 Republican amendments pending. So we have \na lot of work to do.\n  Senator Harkin and I have worked seamlessly for more than a decade. I \nexpect that to continue into next week. Senator Reid has been a master \nat organizing the Senate. He has spent more time in the Senate Chamber \nin the last several years than any other Member. I complimented him \nprivately yesterday about his efficiency. I do so publicly today.\n  I know there are partisan considerations. That is a part of the \nprocess. But I hope we can move ahead on Monday to finish this bill and \naccommodate all of the competing interests.\n  I thank my colleagues for yielding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, who has been \ncooperative, as he said, we have worked together well over a decade. We \nhave always worked these things out to make sure we get a bill through. \nWe will this time also.\n  My point is that there were at least some conversations last night \nwith leadership on both sides about accommodating schedules and having \nvotes set up on Tuesday.\n  The fact is that nothing has hindered the progress of this bill \nbecause four Democrats are running for President. We have had votes \nevery day. We haven't filibustered anything. We haven't done anything. \nWe have offered our amendments. We have had good debates and \ndiscussions, and we have had up-or-down votes. We had two votes today. \nIt was not my decision to have two votes today. I could have had four \nor five votes today. Someone else above my pay grade made the decision \nthat we would have two votes today and go home.\n  It was not my decision that on Monday we will have one vote late in \nthe day. Again, the leadership makes those decisions, not I. So Tuesday \nlooks like a day when we will all be here. Everyone is going to be \nhere. That is the day when we can get a lot accomplished.\n  We are making good progress on this bill. I say to my friend from \nPennsylvania and others, when you look at the past, this is a big bill. \nThis bill covers more spending and more Departments and Agencies of the \nFederal Government than any other bill considered in Congress. In terms \nof total spending, it is second only to Defense. But it covers a host \nof Agencies and Departments, more than the Defense Department does.\n  In the past, in 2001, we had 5 days of floor action on this bill; in \n2000, we had 7 days; in 1999, 5 days. In 1998, it was passed in an \nomnibus, but in 1997, 9 days. So as you can see, it has always taken 5, \n6, 7, 8 days to finish this bill because it covers so many different \nsubjects.\n\n  We went on the legislation on Wednesday. Monday was Labor Day. We \ncame in, by agreement of the leadership, with no votes on Tuesday. That \nwas, again, not our decision. That was a leadership decision on the \nRepublican side. So we had Wednesday and Thursday and two votes today. \nBasically, we have been on the bill, at least voting, really only 2 \ndays. To say we are going to have another couple days or 2 or 3 days on \nthis bill is not exorbitant. It is in line with what we have done in \nthe past.\n  We would like to finish the bill as quickly as anyone. I think we \nhave been very diligent in bringing up our amendments, offering them, \nand moving ahead.\n  Again, I will object to setting aside any other amendment until we \nvote on this because it is that important. Everyone is going to be here \non Tuesday. So we can vote on it on Tuesday, and we can vote on a lot \nof other things on Tuesday, too, and get a lot of this bill finished on \nTuesday when the maximum number of Senators will be here in the \nChamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from New York is here to make a very \nimportant statement.\n  Let me say this: I appreciate the work of the Senator from \nPennsylvania. He has done an outstanding job on this bill, and he and \nSenator Harkin have set a pattern for how people should work together \non legislation. I recognize it is not Senator Specter's decision how we \nare handling this legislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is absolutely true.\n  Mr. REID. We know that. If it were up to Senator Specter, we would \nhave the vote on Tuesday at any time we wanted the vote. Someone else \nis making that decision.\n  We understand the parliamentary procedure. We know there is a way of \ngetting off the Harkin amendment. They could move to the regular order \nand move to table Senators Byrd, Akaka, Mikulski, Kohl, Kennedy, and \nDodd. But when they get to DeWine, we are going to offer your amendment \nas a second-degree amendment. They are not going to figure out in a \nparliamentary fashion a way to prevent the American people from having \na vote on this legislation.\n  They may pull the bill. This may be a big enough issue for the \nPresident of the United States to hurt American workers and help the \nAmerican business community, as always happens, it seems, with this \nadministration. The people who work, the men and women who work for a \nliving, get it in the rear end. They may want to pull this bill and say \nwe are not going to allow the Congress of the United States to have a\n\n[[Page S11138]]\n\nvote on this. If they do that, we know there are other appropriations \nbills and other issues that come up that maybe this amendment will not \nbe in order, maybe it will not be germane, but we are going to offer it \nanyway. We are going to continue with this as an issue.\n  There are cartoons all over the country--I saw one earlier today--\nmaking a joke of what the President is trying to do. I saw one that was \ngiven to us by the senior Senator from South Carolina that says maybe \nthe point is that they want the American people not have as much \nleisure time as they have had in the past.\n  This is by Toles, and this ran in a number of papers around the \ncountry. This one is from South Carolina's largest newspaper. It shows \na man standing there at his desk. It reads:\n\n       In the 1960s, Americans wondered what they'd do with all \n     their free time in the twenty-first century.\n\n  The next view reads:\n\n       1. Vacationing at sea-floor resort.\n       2. Eating gourmet meals in pill form.\n       3. Flying personal car to robot store.\n       4. Attending spaceball game on Saturn.\n\n  The next view shows him with some consternation on his face and \nreads:\n\n       I . . . I just can't decide.\n\n  And then the final view reads:\n\n       So they have decided for us.\n\n  And some little person says to the man at the desk with his head \nagainst the computer:\n\n       You'll spend your leisure time working a 70-hour week. \n     Without overtime.\n\n  Then there is a little man at the bottom who says:\n\n       You could take your vacation in pill form.\n\n  We believe this is an important issue. Overtime pay has been the law \nof this land since the 1930s, Federal law. They are going to change it \nby administrative fiat? I don't think so. They can do a lot of things \nto stop us, but they can't stop us from talking.\n  We are going to continue to talk on this until the American people \nunderstand what this administration is doing to American men and women. \nHere it is not subtle; it is just a slap in the face to the American \npeople.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the assistant Democratic leader for his support \nand for the support of our working families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, first, I commend my colleagues and \nleaders, the Senators from Iowa and Nevada, for their heartfelt, \neloquent statements on behalf of the rights of Americans to be paid for \nthe work they do. I appreciate greatly that our leader on this bill, \nthe Democratic manager, the Senator from Iowa, has really drawn a line \nin the sand, because we know we are not creating jobs, we know that \nmore people have fallen into poverty, and we know that the incomes of \nmore Americans will be cut dramatically if the provision this \nadministration wants to put into effect is allowed to go forward. So I \nthank them for their very strong commitment.\n\n\n           EPA's Response to the World Trade Center Collapse\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about another very important issue, one \nthat directly affects the people I represent in New York but which I \nbelieve affects our entire country and the credibility of this \nadministration and our Government. I am speaking about the report \nreleased on August 21 by the Office of the Inspector General of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency entitled ``EPA's Response to the World \nTrade Center Collapse: Challenges, Successes, and Areas for \nImprovement.''\n  As the title suggests, this report is carefully researched, \nconstructively presented, and it outlines how the EPA carried out its \ncharge in the immediate and longer term aftermath of the terrible \nattack that struck New York on the infamous day of September 11--now \nalmost 2 years ago. No one will ever forget that day. Those who were \nthere in lower Manhattan will never be able to erase the images--not \njust the visual images but the feelings, the smells, the sounds, the \nsmoke.\n  I remember so well being there the day after and seeing the \nfirefighters emerging from the haze that hung over the site, covered in \ndust and debris; the rescue workers, whom all of us saw, and many of \nwhom I have met, who guided people to safety without a mask or a bit of \nconcern about their own long-term health. I am sure that Americans \nremember--and New Yorkers lived with--the apartment buildings, the \nbusiness buildings that were covered in gray dust.\n  When we turned to our Government in Washington for guidance in the \nhours, days, and weeks after that tragedy, one of the questions I was \nasked and I know the EPA was asked, the White House was asked, and the \ncity and the State were asked was: Is the air safe?\n  What did the EPA tell us? The EPA said: Yes, it is safe. Go back to \nwork, get back to your daily lives.\n  Mr. President, it is a very hard thing to stand on this Senate floor \nand say this, but I believe our Government let us down. It wasn't by \naccident and it wasn't a mistake during the chaos of those terrible \ndays. Instead, as spelled out in this report by the EPA inspector \ngeneral, it is clear that the EPA was overruled and directed about what \nto say.\n  I want to underscore the important fact that this report is not the \nproduct of my office, not the product of an advocacy group or an \noutsider; it was done by the EPA's own career watchdog.\n\n  Why do we have inspectors general? Because we know our Government \nneeds somebody to keep track of and hold accountable for actions that \nare taken. It is not a Republican or a Democratic job; it is a \nnonpartisan job. Sort of like Sergeant Friday, they ``just want the \nfacts.'' They want to be able to know what is actually going on in the \nbowels and processes of these huge bureaucracies that perform so many \nimportant functions. But still, like any human institutions, extra eyes \nare needed on what they are doing.\n  The inspector general of the EPA looked at the actions EPA took to \naddress the quality of the air affected by the collapse of the World \nTrade Center and what the EPA told the public about the air we were \nbreathing. The inspector general rightly acknowledges that the EPA, \nlike all of our governmental entities at the Federal, State, and local \nlevels involved with the response to September 11, found themselves \ndealing with an unprecedented crisis, the scope and nature of which \nnone of us ever imagined.\n  I admit, and I think it is fair to say, that no part of Government \nwas prepared for the enormity of what occurred on September 11, and \nthat is understandable because of what did happen. So in that spirit, \nand I think realistically so, the inspector general recognized that the \nparticular demands placed on the EPA were considerable.\n  I was there day after day, down at Ground Zero in the city, meeting \nwith EPA officials, and I know how stressed they were because of all \nthey were having to contend with. But still, even taking into account \nthe unprecedented nature of the attacks, the implosion of the \nbuildings, releasing into the air billions and billions of particles of \nall kinds of compounds and chemicals, the EPA inspector general found \nand asserted that where the Agency could and should have been more \nthorough, more proactive, more effective in its responsibility, it did \nnot live up to what we should have rightly expected.\n  We looked to the EPA to give us straight information and help us try \nto reduce the dangerous emissions in the air from the collapse, from \nthe cleanup and the recovery, and the inspector general looked \nparticularly at the EPA action dealing with monitoring, testing, and \ncleaning up of indoor air.\n  I want to make this distinction because I think it is very important. \nWhen the towers collapsed, clearly, so much was released into the \nenvironment. We could see, as we helicoptered over the site on \nSeptember 12, the burning fires still. The outdoor air was of \nparticular concern to all of the people--the brave men and women who \nwere on the search and recovery teams, who were beginning to work to \nremove the debris. But there is another separate and equally important \nissue, and that is about indoor air, because this blizzard of debris \nand dust went through windows, went through cracks in buildings, \nsettled on roofs, fell into living quarters and businesses.\n  As a Senator from New York, I have been particularly concerned about\n\n[[Page S11139]]\n\nthese air quality issues and the implications for the public's health \nsince September 11. I have worked with other elected officials \nrepresenting New York and the region. I have worked with our first \nresponders--our firefighters, police officers, and public health \nprofessionals. I have worked with residents and workers and \nbusinessowners to press for the help and the resources and the \ninformation we needed so that the air, both outdoors and indoors, would \nbe clean as fast as possible and that the public's health would be \nprotected as much as possible.\n  With Senator Lieberman, who was then chair of the Clean Air \nSubcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee, on which I \nserve with him, we held a field hearing in lower Manhattan in February \nof 2002 to examine what we thought then were troubling and \ncontradictory messages from the EPA about the quality of air in \ndowntown New York City.\n  I especially wanted to be sure of the basis for then-Administrator \nChristy Todd Whitman's statement on September 18, 1 week after the \nattack, that the air in New York was ``safe to breathe.''\n  I pointed out that information from other Government and official \nsources contradicted that assertion, not to mention the concerns of my \nconstituents who were coming to me asking whether it was safe for them \nto go back to their apartments, to go back to work, to bring their \nchildren home because of what they could feel and smell in the air. \nEvery time I went down there, my eyes burned and my throat burned. It \nwas a palpable feeling that we were in an environment that may not be \nsafe.\n  I do not think either Senator Lieberman or I at that hearing received \na straight answer. I am not sure we ever got a straight answer in the \ntime between September 11, 2001, and August 21, 2003. In fact, we know \nwe did not because the inspector general's report confirms that New \nYorkers and others affected were, in fact, misled about the most \nfundamental issue: whether the air they were breathing, the breaths \nthey took were safe.\n  I find this deeply disturbing and very disappointing. Let me quote \nfrom the report itself. I have excerpts from the report on these two \ncharts.\n  In the executive summary of the report, the inspector general says in \nthe very first finding:\n\n       EPA's early public statements following the collapse of the \n     World Trade Center Towers reassured the public regarding the \n     safety of the air outside the Ground Zero area. However, when \n     EPA made a September 18 announcement that the air was \n     ``safe'' to breathe, it did not have sufficient data and \n     analyses to make such a blanket statement. At that time, air \n     monitoring data was lacking for several pollutants of \n     concern, including particulate matter and PCBs.\n       Furthermore, the White House Council on Environmental \n     Quality, influenced, through the collaborative process, the \n     information that the EPA communicated to the public through \n     its early press releases when it convinced the EPA to add \n     reassuring statements and delete cautionary ones.\n\n  The inspector general later on in the report states:\n\n       Based on the documentation we reviewed and our discussions \n     with numerous environmental experts, both within and outside \n     the EPA, we do not agree with the Agency's statement of \n     September 18, 2001, that the air was safe to breathe \n     reflected the Agency's best professional advice. In contrast \n     . . . it appeared that the EPA's best professional advice was \n     overruled when relaying information to the public in the \n     weeks immediately following the disaster.\n\n  Basically, what the IG is saying is that the EPA did not have the \ntesting data and analyses to make the statements it did, and that the \nbest professional judgment of the EPA experts was influenced by the \nWhite House itself.\n  As examples of where White House officials intervened and what the \nEPA told the public at the time, the inspector general reports that the \nWhite House had the EPA remove recommendations that all area residents \nobtain professional cleaning of their homes and offices and told the \nEPA to remove any reference to the increased risks from air pollution \nfor sensitive populations, such as young children and the elderly.\n  On these charts, I now want to turn to the actual examples that the \ninspector general includes in the report of where and how the White \nHouse evidently--although we do not know this--evidently, through its \nCouncil on Environmental Quality, dictated very specific changes to the \nEPA on what it could and could not say in its press releases to the \npublic.\n\n  Here we see in vivid language, to once again use the very words of \nthe inspector general's report, the White House's role in insisting \nthat ``the EPA's overriding message was that the public did not need to \nbe concerned about airborne contaminants caused by the World Trade \nCenter collapse.''\n  If we look at these charts, we can see very clearly what was told by \nthe White House to be changed. Here is the draft press release from the \nEPA, and it reads:\n\n       Recent samples of dust gathered by OSHA--\n\n  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration--\n\n     on Water Street show higher levels of asbestos in EPA tests.\n\n  The issued press release after the White House dictated the changes:\n\n       The new samples confirm previous reports that ambient air \n     quality meets OSHA standards and consequently is not a cause \n     for public concern. New OSHA data also indicates that indoor \n     air quality in downtown buildings will meet standards.\n\n  Draft press release:\n\n       Seven debris and dust samples taken Thursday showed levels \n     of asbestos ranging from 2.1 percent to 3.3 percent. EPA \n     views a 1 percent level of asbestos as the definition for \n     asbestos-containing material.\n\n  Changed press release at the White House direction:\n\n       Debris samples collected outside buildings, on cars, and \n     other surfaces contained small percentages of asbestos, \n     ranging from 2.1 to 3.3--slightly above the 1 percent trigger \n     for defining asbestos material.\n\n  These are statements that were added to the press release based on \nthe White House instructions. Here was the instruction from the White \nHouse:\n\n       Add sentence about OSHA monitors walking the streets \n     yesterday and wearing personal monitors and coming up clean.\n\n  Of course, the EPA did what they were told by the White House. This \nis what they said:\n\n       OSHA staff walked through New York's financial district on \n     September 13th, wearing personal air monitors, and collected \n     data on potential asbestos exposure levels. All but two \n     samples contained no asbestos. Two samples contained very low \n     levels of an unknown fiber which is still being analyzed.\n\n  Of course, what we know now is that they had not done the analysis. \nThey did not have the data. So, basically, the White House decided they \nbetter invent some and put it in the press release so they could create \nmore reassurance than what the facts clearly indicated.\n  The White House says: Get a quote in from somebody in charge, \nsomebody with some responsibility; put a quote in so you can get people \nback to work and back to living downtown. So they came up with a quote \nby a Mr. John L. Henshaw, Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA. This \nis the quote they put in:\n\n       Our tests showed that it is safe for New Yorkers to go back \n     to work in New York's financial district.\n\n  They just made it up: Might as well tell them it is OK to go back to \nwork; don't put in any cautionary language about children or the \nelderly, people with preexisting asthmatic, pulmonary, or respiratory \nconditions. Tell them it is safe.\n  It is really discouraging, I have to say, to go through this because \nit is not what any of us expected. It is certainly not what any of us \ntold our constituents and what we were told as we walked these streets \nand as people asked: Is it OK to go back?\n  I believe this is the kind of interference by Government altering \nscientific data, putting happy talk in where mature and accurate \ninformation would be better suited, and that does our Government a \ngreat disservice.\n  I conclude with these two final changes: The draft press release that \nthe experts at EPA put out had this caption:\n\n       EPA Initiating Emergency Response Activities, Testing \n     Terrorized Sites For Environmental Hazards.\n\n  That sounds pretty descriptive. That is what they were doing. That \nwas their job. That is what we expect the EPA to do, to go do the \nemergency response activities and test for environmental hazards.\n  This is what the White House said they had to put as the caption:\n\n\n[[Page S11140]]\n\n\n       EPA Initiating Emergency Response Activities, Reassures \n     Public About Environmental Hazards.\n\n  We went from testing to reassurance because of changes in words \ndictated by the White House, not based on data, not based on science.\n  Then this final example, the draft press release said:\n\n       Preliminary results of EPA's sampling activities indicate \n     no or very low levels of asbestos. However, even at low \n     levels, EPA considers asbestos hazardous in this situation \n     and will continue to monitor and sample for elevated levels \n     of asbestos and work with the appropriate officials to ensure \n     awareness and proper handling, transportation and disposal of \n     potentially contaminated debris or materials.\n\n  I have no problem with that. That is a very thoughtful, informative \nstatement: Thankfully, our testing shows very low levels at this point \nbut we want to caution people because even very low levels can be \ndangerous, so we want to tell you what you should do to deal with this \ndust that is everywhere, that is in your house, that covers everything \nfrom your drapes and your rugs to your teapot sets, that is filling the \nstreets and the roofs, so we are going to tell you what we need to do.\n  Here is what the White House told them to say instead:\n\n       EPA is greatly relieved to have learned that there appears \n     to be no significant levels of asbestos dust in the air in \n     New York City, said Administrator Whitman. We are working \n     closely with rescue crews to ensure that all appropriate \n     precautions are taken. We will continue to monitor closely.\n       Public health concerns about asbestos contamination are \n     primarily related to long-term exposure. Short-term, low-\n     level exposure of the type that might have been produced by \n     the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings is unlikely \n     to cause significant health effects. EPA and OSHA will work \n     closely with rescue and cleanup crews to minimize their \n     potential exposure, but the general public should be very \n     reassured by initial sampling.\n\n  Nothing about proper handling, transportation, or disposal.\n  These are very disturbing revelations. What the EPA wanted to report \nto the public in their press releases and communication was different \nfrom what they did report, and yet all of us relied on those reports.\n  I have talked to a lot of parents with kids who live downtown. I have \ntalked with a lot of business owners. They asked me whether they should \nsend their children back to the schools when they opened, whether they \nshould go to work when the businesses reopened. Based on both the \npublic information and the private information that I had solicited, I \nsaid, yes, from all we know, we think it is safe.\n\n  I understand what tremendous challenges these horrible events caused \nfor everyone, but I just cannot come up with any excuse, justification, \nor rationale for the White House to interfere with the agency in charge \nof providing accurate and trustworthy information about whether our air \nindoors and outdoors is safe to breathe. Dictating what the EPA can \ngenerally say is inexcusable, but making them misinform the public on \nsuch a critical issue is outrageous.\n  As the inspector general's report clearly points out, the EPA has a \nclear mandate to communicate honestly and openly with the public about \nenvironmental hazards and risks. The reporting even lists the Agency's \nown seven cardinal rules of risk communication in carrying out these \nimportant roles that they have done over the years in dealing with \ncountless situations such as toxic spills and explosions. Those rules \nwere tampered with and the public was misinformed.\n  On Tuesday, August 26, Senator Lieberman and I wrote to President \nBush to convey our serious questions and concerns about what we have \nlearned through the IG report. We asked the President to provide \nCongress and the public with an account of what took place in the White \nHouse that resulted in changing the content and the overall message \nconveyed by EPA through its press releases. We asked for the identities \nof the White House officials referred to in the report, who played a \nrole in imposing these changes, for an explanation on why the White \nHouse felt compelled to insist on the changes, and copies of the actual \ncommunications between the White House and the EPA about the air \nquality in downtown New York.\n  We asked for a response by September 5 with the hope of obtaining a \nfull and frank explanation of the sequence described in the report and \nbe assured that the EPA does indeed have the authority and the liberty \nto communicate accurately with the public on what it knows.\n  I know the White House did not cooperate with the inspector general \nreport but I hope they would want to get to the bottom of this and \nlearn the lessons that we should not only about the past but going \nforward. However, I cannot say that I will be surprised if we continue \nto hear from the administration some of the same excuses that they have \nbeen making in response to the IG's report.\n  In one statement reported a few days ago, former EPA Administrator \nWhitman said: We did not want to scare people.\n  White House representatives have said that the edits and changes \nimposed on the EPA were necessary for national security reasons.\n  Frankly, this is a canard. The public deserves better. When it comes \nto our health, the health of our children, the health of our elderly \nrelatives, we need accurate information in a timely manner.\n  Should we have worn a mask? Should we have gotten more sophisticated \nrespiratory protective gear? Should we have gotten a professional \ncleaner to clean our apartments before we went back? The public needs \nto know what the risks are so they can appropriately respond.\n  To say that national security somehow justifies telling people the \nair is safe when it is not is to essentially say that people are going \nto be told that when they need their Government the most at a time of \nterrible disaster they cannot trust what they hear.\n  A national crisis does not justify giving people the wrong \ninformation and continuing to do so days, weeks, and months after the \nevent.\n  Would any of us have wanted to worry that the Centers for Disease \nControl had changed what they were telling us about SARS or the West \nNile virus or any other public health incident? Would we ever want to \nquestion the FDA about what they tell us when it comes to drugs \navailable in our pharmacies? Should we ever fear the EPA's information \nabout a toxic spill in our community or our own backyard? What the \ninspector general told us in its August 21 report is that we have to \nraise these questions now.\n  What I hope we can achieve from examining this report and seeking \nanswers is that all New Yorkers and Americans will be assured that in \nthe future the EPA and all parts of our Government responsible for \ncommunicating to the public about our health and safety will do so \nhonestly and accurately without any political interference.\n  I have talked about this report and the serious issues it raises with \nresidents who live near Ground Zero. These New Yorkers have been \nthrough so much. Many of them were forced into homelessness for months. \nMany faced devastated neighborhoods when they returned home.\n\n  For them, who have lost so much, it is tragic if they lose one more \nprecious thing, namely, their trust in their Government, their faith \nthat they would be given accurate, truthful information they could make \njudgments on. People made life decisions based on what the EPA told \nthem. Families moved back into the area with their children. Parents \nsent their children to school. Doctors told their patients not to worry \nbecause of what the EPA told them.\n  To restore any semblance of that trust, we need to get to the bottom \nof what happened. I hope the administration, led by the White House, \nwill understand that and will help us do what we need to do which is, \nnumber one, to find out what the truth was, unvarnished, without any \nembroidery or reassuring words, just what it was; second, do an \nanalysis of the quality of the indoor air now. These particles, these \ncontaminants stay in rugs, drapes, and air vents. We need to know \nwhether people are living in places right now that are putting their \nhealth at risk. Then our Government needs to show good faith by doing \nwhat they said they would do, namely, to make sure the indoor air \nquality was cleaned up. And, perhaps most importantly, we need to \nrestore that trust which has been breached.\n  I hope the administration will help. These events also require \noversight by\n\n[[Page S11141]]\n\nthe Congress. A number of my colleagues have asked we hold hearings in \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. I hope we will. I cannot \nimagine anyone representing any State in this country with so many \nconstituents still coughing, who have acquired severe asthma, who have \npulmonary dysfunction, not asking for the very same thing I am asking \nfor, congressional hearings and a full, cooperative relationship with \nthe administration.\n  I conclude by responding to one of the constant themes I hear from \nthe administration, that they did not want to cause panic, they did not \nwant people to be upset. If New Yorkers had to prove this one more \ntime, they certainly did on September 11th and they did it again in the \nblackout. These are terrible times that try people, but New Yorkers \nrise to the occasion no matter what it is. They would have taken \naccurate information and acted accordingly. They would have done what \nthey needed to do to take precautions for themselves, their children, \ntheir friends, their neighbors.\n  I cannot imagine this idea we did not want to cause people to panic. \nThere are many ways of saying--we saw from the EPA's own language--the \ntruth and then telling people, here are the necessary steps you should \ntake. There is not one firefighter, not one police officer, there is \nnot one construction worker I met who would not have gone out of that \npile, would not have tried for days to find survivors, would not have \nbegun to remove the debris, to put the message clearly out to the world \nand the terrorists that we were not in any way daunted or fearful. Not \none. But they might have worn their masks and asked for and demanded \nbetter respiratory protection. Instead, the Government says the air is \nsafe.\n  I have not met one family member or business owner who did not want \nto go back downtown and rebuild and live their lives again. They would \nhave done it. But maybe instead of cleaning with a wet mop and a wet \ncloth to try to get rid of asbestos and PCBs, they would have done what \nthe EPA said, go out and get a professional cleaner. But the air was \nsafe.\n  This in and of itself is a serious, profoundly important issue that \nhas disturbing consequences, particularly when it comes to the trust we \nshould be able to place in our Government, believing they are looking \nout for our best interests when it comes to health and safety. I hope \nthe administration will respond to my letter, that the Senate will hold \nhearings, and we will all make it absolutely clear we will not abide \nmisinformation and political interference in something as important as \nthe air we breathe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1580\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know we are still on the Labor, Health \nand Human Services, Education appropriations, and I wish to speak for a \nlittle while on the pending amendment which I have laid down prior to \nthe distinguished Senator from New York speaking. I want to follow up \nand speak for a little bit longer on that. I know my colleague from \nAlabama and maybe others are here so I will try to be as succinct as \npossible, but I did want to, before the weekend came, to again lay out \nfor the Senate and for the Nation why it is so important for us to take \naction, to stop the implementation of these proposed changes in rules \nand regulations that deal with overtime pay.\n  I thought I would take some time now to, number one, respond to some \narguments made by the Senator from Wyoming yesterday, Senator Enzi, but \nalso to again give some personal stories of what is happening to people \naround the country today and how others might be affected with these \nchanges in rules and regulations.\n  As I have done with the rules and regulations, you can read them. If \nyou want to go to sleep fast, try reading rules and regulations \nsometimes. That will put you to sleep. It becomes a blur out there as \nto what all these fancy words and phrases and subparagraph and titles \nall mean. But when you get through it all, it means people are affected \none way or the other, either for good or for ill. It means workers are \neither supported in their jobs and their family life or they are not.\n  That is what these changes and rules are about, affecting human \nbeings and their lives and how they live and how they work and what \ntheir quality of life is going to be.\n  Again, a couple of things I want to lay out. One, to lay out what the \nindustry has said about the proposed overtime rule. I also wanted to \nbring specific examples and then show what has happened to the \nworkforce over the last few years because, as I said earlier, the first \nwave of people to be hit by this proposed change in rules and \nregulations, if they go into effect, are working women. I will show why \nthat is so in my comments this morning.\n  First of all, the Bush administration has said the proposed rules on \novertime will not substantially change the exempt and nonexempt status \nof American workers. They say they merely want to ``clarify the current \nrules.''\n  I believe this is misleading, at best. The proposal will have a \nsweeping effect on millions of Americans and will unalterably change, \nwill change fundamentally, the basic principle of the 40-hour workweek \nas we have known it since 1938.\n  Don't take my word for it. Look at some of the comments from \nindustry. In May 2003, an analysis by Hewitt Associates, which \nadvertises on their Web site as a global human resources outsourcing \nand consulting firm, says on their Web site their client roster \nincludes more than half of the Fortune 500 companies. Here is their \nanalysis of the proposed rule changes:\n\n       These proposed changes likely will open the door for \n     employers to reclassify a large number of previously \n     nonexempt employees as exempt. The resulting effect on \n     compensation and morale could be detrimental as employees \n     previously accustomed to earning in some cases significant \n     amounts of overtime, would suddenly lose their opportunity. \n     That is from Hewitt Associates.\n\n  And from the Society for Human Resource Management, which on its Web \nsite says it is ``the world's largest association devoted to human \nresource management.'' And regarding the proposed overtime changes, the \nsociety said:\n\n       This is going to affect every workplace, every employee, \n     every profession.\n\n  So, again, whether we hear from the administration, from the \nDepartment of Labor, that this is simply a clarification, these are \nsimple little clarifications. Meanwhile, the main human resource \nmanagement association and a human resource consultant for Fortune 500 \ncompanies say this is big stuff. It is going to affect every workplace, \nemployee, every profession, according to the Society for Human Resource \nManagement.\n  This same Society for Human Resource Management said the proposed \nrule is not clearer than current regulations. Deron Zeppelin told the \nChicago Tribune:\n\n       It looks like they're just moving from one ambiguity to the \n     next.\n\n  Again, as I said, according to the Chicago Tribune:\n\n       The Labor and Department's [Wage and Hour Administrator \n     Tammy] McCutchen predicts a deluge of lawsuits as employees \n     and employers press for clarifications once the new rules go \n     into effect.\n\n  I thought we wanted to reduce the number of lawsuits. My friend from \nWyoming argued that we have all these lawsuits out there right now. But \nthis is going to open the door for even more lawsuits. The reason we \nare having lawsuits out there now is because employers are already \nviolating the Fair Labor Standards Act, in terms of the 40-hour \nworkweek. I will refer to that more later.\n  The Chamber of Commerce said, on the proposed rule, in their formal \ncomments:\n\n       We support raising the minimum compensation necessary to \n     qualify as an exempt employee provided that such change is \n     made in conjunction with significant reforms of the duties \n     and salary basis test.\n\n  Understand what they are saying. They are saying we can raise the \nminimum compensation, that is fine, but not unless we have significant \nreforms of the duties and salary basis test--significant; not minor, \nnot simple clarification but significant reforms.\n  The American Corporate Council Association, and I am quoting from \ntheir statement:\n\n       . . . also supports other aspects of the present draft, \n     including creating a new computer employee exemption; \n     eliminating discretion and independent judgment test as a \n     criterion of the professional exemption;\n\n[[Page S11142]]\n\n     eliminating the primary and nonprimary duties criterion of \n     the administrative exemption; and the changes made to the \n     outside sales exemption.\n\n  For the uninitiated, in all this fancy jargon, what the American \nCorporate Council Association says is that they want a major exemption \nfor computer technicians from overtime protections. They also want to \nreally relax the current ``duties'' test to be exempt from overtime to \nincorporate more workers in the overtime exemption.\n  These are big changes, sweeping changes in who would get overtime pay \nand who would not.\n  Last, the National Association of Manufacturers said, on eliminating \nthe academic study requirement for the professional exemption--right \nnow it is generally based on 4 years of college. If you have 4 years of \ncollege that is sort of the first hurdle that you would be exempt as a \nprofessional employee. It doesn't necessarily mean you are exempt, but \nits one of the key requirements to be exempt. The proposed rule changes \nall that. It just says you can replace that academic requirement with \nwork experience or training. I get it, you do the exact same job for a \ncouple of years--let's say, nursing--so you go from getting overtime to \nbeing reclassified as a professional from all of that experience--and \nyou no longer receive overtime pay although you're doing the exact same \njob. Well, the National Association of Manufacturers appears to think \nthat's a great idea. They applauded the Labor Department for including \nthis alternative means of establishing that an employee has the \nknowledge required for the exemption to apply.\n\n  Again, what does that mean? You don't need 4 years of college. You \ncould have on-the-job training, a high school degree and, bang, all of \na sudden you are a professional, and they can say you are exempt.\n  So when you hear people say these are minor changes, they are not \nminor at all. That is why 8 to 10 million people are going to be \naffected by this.\n  Again, there is the argument that we need to update these rules. I am \nall for updating them. The Senator from Wyoming spoke the other day \nabout some of the occupations that are still listed. I think one of \nthem was straw man--I forget what some of the others were. Oh, a leg \nman and a straw man and all that--fine. If they want to tweak the \nregulations to get rid of those jobs that no longer exist, fine by me. \nBut don't take overtime pay protection from those workers, those jobs \nthat currently have it.\n  The fact is, the Department has revised overtime regulations several \ntimes since 1938 just because, obviously, jobs change. Some of the \nthings they covered before don't exist. Obviously a straw man, whoever \nthat was, or a leg man, whatever that was, doesn't exist anymore. If \nthey want to do away with that or change that, that is fine. But that \nis not what they are doing. So if they want to update them to match \ncurrent occupations, that is fine. If the administration had done that, \nthat would have been OK. But they went far beyond that.\n  I have just a few other brief things. The Senator from Wyoming said \nthe other day the amendment I offered would not allow the Department of \nLabor to review the 78,000 comments they got in. That is simply not \ntrue. My amendment says they can't promulgate these rules and \nregulations. They can have the comments, they can look at them, they \njust can't issue a rule that would take away the present overtime \nprotection that workers now have. That is all my amendment does.\n  And he said my amendment would block an increase in the income \nthreshold for low-income workers. Again, that's just not true. My \namendment specifically only prohibits implementing a rule that would \ntake overtime pay protection to those millions of workers who currently \nhave it. We would support new rules to increase overtime pay protection \nfor workers.\n  Then the Senator from Wyoming said the union contracts protect \novertime. That is true, union contracts do. But union contracts right \nnow only cover 13 percent of the workforce in America. What about the \nother 77 percent who are not covered? And right now when a union goes \nout and the contracts expire, overtime is not an issue. Why? Because \nthe law says they have to pay overtime.\n  So when the contract comes up, that isn't even an area for \nnegotiation because the law says they have to pay them overtime over 40 \nhours. Now with these proposed changes in rules and regulations, every \ntime a union contract expires, that is a negotiable item. We have to \nnegotiate for whether or not they will get paid overtime. That means \nthey will have to give up something else in order to get overtime.\n  There is something floating around about first responders, nurses and \nsuch, and that somehow that wouldn't be changed. But we have been \nthrough these rules and regulations. There is no exemption. There is no \ncarve-out for policemen, for firemen, and first responders. Not one \nthing in this carves them out. I have heard it said that the \nadministration said sort of quietly that maybe they will not include \nthis. I don't see that anywhere.\n  Lastly, it has been said that wage and hour cases now exceed \ndiscrimination suits. Well, I wonder which. Maybe it is because a lot \nof employers are now basically violating the Fair Labor Standards Act \nbecause they can get away with it.\n  For example, Wal-Mart, the largest retailer, is facing 37 lawsuits in \n29 States from employees alleging they were illegally forced to work \nextra hours to meet corporate productivity demands--not 1 but 37 \nlawsuits in 29 States.\n  In fact, in December, a Federal jury in Portland, OR, found Wal-Mart \nguilty of asking workers to clock out and then to return to work \nunpaid. A Federal jury found them guilty of doing that. Workers clocked \nout and then they had to come back and work overtime without getting \npaid.\n  About 270 insurance claims adjustors have filed here in U.S. District \nCourt in Washington, DC, alleging that their employer, GEICO Insurance, \nbroke the law by improperly classifying workers as exempt from overtime \npay.\n  Again, maybe it doesn't surprise me that wage and hour cases are now \nexceeding discrimination cases.\n  The proposed rules and regulations would make this legal and say to \nWal-Mart you are off the hook. All these lawsuits would just fall by \nthe wayside because of a change of law, and they could exempt these \npeople. They are big changes.\n  I said earlier that the first wave of people who would be hit by this \nwould be working women. I want to show you what I mean by that.\n  This chart shows basically what is happening in the workforce in \nAmerica--from 1948 it 2002. As you can see, the labor force \nparticipation rates for men and women have steadily declined. Look at \nwhat has happened with women--going from slightly over 30 percent to a \nlittle over 60 percent of the workforce in that period of time. More \nand more women have entered the workforce over that period of time.\n  Here are some other statistics.\n  In 1975, 44.9 percent of women with children were in the labor force \nin 1975. In 2001, 70.8 percent of women with children were in the labor \nforce. In 1975, 30.8 percent of the women who worked had children under \nthe age of 2.\n  Today, 58 percent of the women in the workforce have children under \nthe age of 2.\n  Here are two more statistics.\n  Twenty-eight percent of working mothers work nights or on weekends. \nForty percent of working mothers work different schedules than their \nspouses.\n  What that adds up to is families are working longer and longer, and \nthey are taking time away from their families to make ends meet. This \nchart shows the average weeks worked per year by middle-income families \nwith children.\n\n  In 1969, the average family with children worked 78.2 weeks per year. \nWe know there are 52 weeks in the year. That means that perhaps someone \nworked 40 or 52 weeks, and someone had a part-time job and they worked \nmaybe 28 weeks during the year in 1969. In 2000, the weeks worked by \nthe average middle-income family with children was 97.9 weeks per year.\n  Where is that coming from? It is coming from the women in the \nworkforce who are working longer hours, working nights, and working \nweekends. They are the first ones who are going to be hit by these \nchanges in overtime laws. Many of these women are working as \nsecretaries, as claims adjustors,\n\n[[Page S11143]]\n\nas nurses, bookkeepers, social workers and paralegals. They are \nsalaried. They work in insurance companies and banks. Right now, if \nthey work over 40 hours, they are paid overtime. Under these changes, \ntheir employers can legally take away their overtime.\n  Let me give a couple of examples of people who would be affected by \nthese changes.\n  Here is Michael Farrar who works at the NAV/AIR depot in \nJacksonville, FL. He is a cost estimator at the NAV/AIR depot who \nspecializes in aircraft engine and component production and repair. If \nhe loses his right to overtime pay, he will be paid straight time for \nany hours over 40 per week.\n  He says:\n\n       If I don't get my overtime, it will be hard to exist.\n\n  He and his wife rely on overtime pay to support their 21-year-old \ndisabled son who lives with them.\n  He says:\n\n       When I took this job, it was clear that I was supposed to \n     work more than 40 hours a week, and I agreed to that because \n     I knew I would need the money. We would be devastated without \n     the overtime. We have no more corners to cut.\n\n  Let us not go back 40 years with these proposed Bush regulations. Let \nus go forward and pay people what they deserve.\n  Here is Susan Moore, a planning coordinator from the Chicago Park and \nPlanning District, a member of the International Federation of \nProfessional and Technical Engineers.\n  She says:\n\n       I am currently entitled to time and a half under Federal \n     law. I know for a fact that that is the reason I am not \n     required to work long hours like the project managers who are \n     not entitled to overtime pay. My supervisor has to think hard \n     about whether to assign overtime to me because he has to pay \n     for my time. That means more time for my family and that time \n     is important to me. If the law changes and I lose my right to \n     overtime pay, I will be faced with the imposing choice of \n     losing time with my family, or losing my job.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I would be glad to yield to my friend from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator so much.\n  I have been trying to thank the Senator for a couple of days now, but \nit has been hard to get a moment. I am so glad I have this moment to \nthank him so much for giving us an opportunity here in the Senate to \nstand up for working families.\n  I want to read just one letter I received from a woman in my State \nand ask the Senator to comment because his point is so right.\n  This Bush administration rule, which would take away the pay from \nhard-working people, is an attack on America's families. What is so \ninteresting to me is, when I think back after 9/11 and the President \ngoing to Ground Zero and standing with his arms around firefighters and \nsaying, ``These are the heroes,'' the firefighters are the ones who are \ngoing to be hurt by this change. The safety workers are going to be \nhurt.\n  I want to read a letter, and I want to ask you to please comment. \nCeline Krimston, the wife of a firefighter from La Mesa, wrote:\n\n       We are a family of four. Our children are four months and \n     five years of age. I work full time outside of the home to \n     make ends meet for our family. My husband's firefighter \n     income is not enough to support a family of four, yet too \n     high to receive any type of subsidy. Without the overtime pay \n     we would actually be deemed low income and qualify for \n     subsidized childcare. Our nation should be ashamed!\n       Please support America's working families by voting against \n     the Bush administration's proposal to cut overtime.\n\n  So all I want to do today, in this brief interlude, if you will, is \nto thank you. These working people--who barely have time for their \nkids, who are struggling to make ends meet, to put food on the table, \nto pay the rent or the mortgage, to give their family a modicum of \nsecurity--are under attack by this Bush rule.\n  I want you to comment on this, if this does not reflect the comments \nyou are hearing as our leader on this issue?\n  Did it not strike you--let's just use the word in an ironic way--when \nPresident Bush stood, on Labor Day, with a group of working people and \ntalked about how much he understood that they were going through hard \ntimes and how important it was for them to get jobs? By the way, we \nhave lost more jobs now than ever in history since Herbert Hoover, \nsince the Great Depression.\n  But while he is doing this missionary work and trying to tell working \npeople how he is going to get them jobs, he is also going behind their \nback and cutting their pay with this rule.\n  I wonder if my friend would comment on those two issues: The irony of \nthis hitting our firefighters, our first responders, and also the fact \nthat at a Labor Day event the President was saying how he understands \nworking people, and then putting this provision in, which is such a \ndisaster for our people.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from California for her observations \nand her questions. I again thank my colleague from California for her \nmany years of working so hard on behalf of our working families. There \nis no one who has worked harder and longer and fought more diligently \nfor the rights of working families, working men, working women, in this \ncountry than Senator Boxer of California.\n  I say to the Senator, I am proud to have you on our side in this \nfight, too, because it is a fight for justice. It is a fight just to \nmake sure people are treated decently as human beings.\n  I guess in my fondest, perhaps, hopes, maybe President Bush didn't \neven know about this, and this was going on underneath him. Maybe \nthrough our debates here he will find out about it and say: What is \nhappening? Who is doing this on my watch? Well, the buck does stop at \nthe President's desk. Maybe he doesn't even know this is going on but \nthe people he has hired underneath him are implementing this. So maybe \nour debate will enlighten the President. Maybe some word will get to \nhim and he will say, ``What is going on?'' and he will become alarmed \nat what people under him are doing, and perhaps he will put a stop to \nit. That would be my fondest wish.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would hope your wish comes true, but I understand we \nreceived a message that he would veto this bill with this in it. Let's \nhope he knows that letter came over here because, frankly, if he \ndoesn't know it, he is not doing his job. So I have to assume he knows \nit. That is my own view, not that I want to ruin your day.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, no, as I say, hope springs eternal. I was hoping \nmaybe the President might learn about this. We did get this veto \nmessage from the White House.\n  I say to the Senator from California, this is mind-boggling. Here is \nan appropriations bill that funds all education, all health care, all \nresearch at the National Institutes of Health--on breast cancer, on \nemphysema, on diabetes; all this wonderful research done to help people \nlive their lives better--Head Start Programs, job training programs, \nand he is going to veto the whole thing if we stop these rules and \nregulations from going through that takes away overtime. To me this is \nmind-boggling.\n  Again, I hope it is his underlings doing this, and maybe he doesn't \nknow about it yet, and maybe he will learn about it. I hope he will \nlearn about it. Maybe he will tell his people to stop this nonsense.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Maybe he will take back that letter he sent us.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I hope he would take that letter back and say he \nwouldn't. The idea of having a veto threat out there, to veto this \nentire bill, if the Senate works its will and says: No, we are not \ngoing to let these rules and regulations come into effect, this almost \nborders on the bizarre that something like this would happen.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  I see my great leader. Again, talk about a fighter for working \nfamilies in America, there is no one, including me and the Senator from \nCalifornia, who has fought harder and longer for working families than \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. My friend, you are living in a dream world if for a moment \nyou think this President doesn't know what he is doing. You are living \nin a dream world. I hope to be with you in your dreams at some point.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I said, hope springs eternal. And I always believe in \nredemption. The hope for redemption is\n\n[[Page S11144]]\n\nalways there, that the wayward will come home and find the true path. \nAnd I hope the President will sit down and think about this and \nunderstand what is happening on his watch with regard to this issue.\n  So I appreciate what my friend from West Virginia has said. I would \nhope this would happen. But again, we can't go on hope around here. We \nhave to go on what reality is. And the reality is, the Department of \nLabor, under this administration, has promulgated these proposed \nchanges in overtime. They will go into effect unless we take \nthis action. That is the real world we live in. That is why I have \noffered this amendment. And that is why I feel so strongly about it.\n\n  Oh, there are maybe a few things that each of us gets interested in \nand gets involved in because we feel deeply about them. One of the \nissues I always get involved in and for which I take the floor is to \nmake sure we expand and promote opportunities for people with \ndisabilities in our country. This goes back to when I was the chief \nsponsor of the Americans With Disabilities Act. So this is another area \nin which I always keep a close watch and find out what the \nadministration and the Supreme Court and others are doing to cut down \non the rights of people with disabilities. That is one area.\n  Another area I feel so strongly about is our working families, \nworking people who don't have a lot of say-so over their jobs. They go \nto work every day. They do what their bosses tell them. They put in \nextra effort and extra energy. A lot of times they don't get paid \novertime for that extra few minutes every day, that extra effort. But \nif they are asked to work overtime, they should get paid. If they are \ntaking time away from their families to work overtime, they ought to be \njustly compensated for it. That is why I feel so strongly about this.\n  I couldn't say it any better than Sheila Perez of Bremerton, WA. Here \nis what she said:\n\n       I began my career as a supply clerk earning $3.10/hr in \n     1976. I recognized early in my federal career that in order \n     for me as a working single parent to support my family, I \n     needed to find more lucrative employment. I entered an upward \n     mobility program and received training to become an engineer \n     technician with a career ladder that gave me a yearly boost \n     in income. It seemed though that even with a decent raise \n     each year, I really relied on overtime income to help make \n     ends meet. There are many more single parents today with the \n     same problem. How does one pay for the car that broke down \n     or the braces for the children's teeth? Overtime income \n     has been a lifesaver to many of us. When I as a working \n     mother leave my 8-hour/day job and go home, my second \n     shift begins. There is dinner to cook, dishes to wash, \n     laundry, and all the other housework that must be done \n     which adds another 3 to 4 hours to your workday. When one \n     has to put in extra hours at work, it takes away from the \n     time needed to take care of our personal needs. It seems \n     only fair that one should be compensated for that extra \n     effort. Overtime is a sacrifice of one's time, energy, and \n     physical and mental well-being. Compensation should be \n     commensurate in the form of premium pay as it is a premium \n     of one's personal time, energy, and expertise that is \n     being used.\n\n  That is a great sentence that Sheila writes:\n\n       Compensation should be commensurate in the form of premium \n     pay as it is a premium of one's personal time, energy, and \n     expertise that is being used. It has been a crime that many \n     engineers and technicians were paid less than even their \n     straight time for overtime worked. It has never made sense to \n     me that the hours I work past my normal eight are of lesser \n     value, when those additional hours are at a cost of my \n     personal time.\n\n  Sheila Perez from Bremerton, WA. I could not say it any better. That \nis what this fight is all about. It is about people who get up and go \nto work every day. They pull their load, pay their taxes. They are good \ncitizens. They raise their families. They want to spend time with their \nfamilies. If they are being asked to work overtime, as Sheila said, \nthat is premium time. That is personal time. That is family time. They \nought to be paid for it. They ought to be paid time and a half for it.\n  What these proposed changes would mean is that Sheila Perez could be \nasked to work over 40 hours a week and not get paid one penny more than \nwhat she is being paid right now. She would not be paid anything more \nif she were on a salaried basis. It is sort of free time.\n  That is why I said the other day, not only is this President and this \nadministration shipping jobs out of the country, they are now importing \ninto this country Third World labor standards: work 60 hours a week, no \novertime, no commensurate pay.\n  We will have another issue on pensions where they are trying to \nchange the pension program, take away the rightful pensions which \npeople have earned, privatize Social Security, privatize Medicare. It \ndoesn't sound like the America I grew up in and the America that built \na strong and viable middle class.\n  Right now American workers work longer per year than workers in any \nindustrialized country. The International Labor Organization found that \nAmerican workers put in an average of 1,825 hours a year, average. In \nEurope, French workers have an average of 1,545 hours per year; German \nworkers, 1,444 hours per year. So we are already working longer. Now \nthey want us to work longer without any pay. That is why I have said \nthis is antiworker. It is antifamily to change these rules and \nregulations as they want.\n  I have had my say. I know others want to speak. I ask unanimous \nconsent to add Senator Johnson as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will have more to say about this next week. I hope we \nwill vote on this up or down when next Tuesday comes. But I hope the \nAmerican people get the word about what is happening. These proposed \nrules came out without one public hearing, not one. There still haven't \nbeen any public hearings. Why don't they go to Dallas, TX, or Des \nMoines, IA? Why don't they go to Detroit or Los Angeles? Why don't they \ngo to West Virginia, have public hearings and listen to what people \nmight have to say about this? No, they just want to ram them through \nwithout any public hearings.\n  This is our public hearing. This is the public's house, the Senate \nand the House of Representatives. Here, as we once said, the people \nrule. Here we are supposed to do the work of the people, not the \nspecial interests. The American people want us to fight for them and \nfor their rights, to support them in the workplace and to support their \nfamilies. That is what this fight is about--nothing more, nothing less. \nThat is why this Senate needs to speak, and we need to vote early next \nweek to say no to the Bush administration's proposed changes in \novertime rules and regulations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nfor his position on this matter, for his words today on this subject. I \nwill always remember Senator Tom Harkin for standing up for the working \npeople of this country. Through the years that I served with him, he \nhas never deviated from that course. He has never veered from that \ncourse: standing up for working people, the common people, the men and \nwomen of America who work with their hands, who get their hands dirty, \nwhose hands show the horns of toil and working. I will never forget him \nfor that. He has always been that way.\n  I think he has a streak of that coal miner in him. He doesn't want to \ngo back to the 1930s. What would have happened to me in the 1930s? I \nwas married in 1937. I worked as a produce boy. I don't mind being \ncalled boy.\n  I was a produce boy in a company store in the mining camp where my \nfoster father was a coal miner, where my wife's father was a coal \nminer. I was a produce boy, produce salesman. I got out on some Sunday \nafternoons.\n  I am a Baptist. I was a man who revered the Bible long before George \nBush ever got to this place. When he was running around in knee pants, \nI believed in the old time religion. I wasn't a Christian to the left \nor to the right. I believed in the old time religion that comes from \nthe King James version of the Bible. If you want to stir up the \nchurches, take me. We will sing ``Amazing Grace.'' We will get them out \ninto the aisles, those who are not afraid to say: Amen, amen. So he \nspeaks the language of the working poor. No, he is not mistaken about \nPresident Bush. I respect President Bush. He is President of the United \nStates, but he came from the other side\n\n[[Page S11145]]\n\nof the tracks. He didn't come from the side of the tracks I came from, \nor where the Senator from Iowa, I would venture, came from. I didn't \ncome from the corporate boardrooms of this country.\n\n  I came from the coal camps. I lived during those days the Senator is \ntalking about, back in the 1930s. I worked 6 days a week. I was glad to \nhave a job. I remember when I was making $70 a month working in a \nbutcher shop. I was a butcher. I was a produce boy. Yes, we worked long \nhours. We didn't get paid time and a half when I was in the butcher \nshops in southern West Virginia, but we were glad to have a job. I made \n$70 a month. Imagine living on $70 a month. Of course, things were \ncheaper then. But we didn't get time and a half. We had to work \nwhatever time was required to hold our jobs.\n  My dad had to clean up his ``place'' back in the coal mines. They \nwould shoot down the slate and the coal, and he was expected to clean \nthat up before he went home. He was glad to have a job. There was \nalways someone else there waiting on his job. If he didn't want to \nclean up the place, somebody was waiting to take his job.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for his leadership, and count me as one who \nstands with him.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. President, after a dismal summer of watching the situation in \nIraq spiraling from bad to worse, the White House appears to have \nfinally--finally--acknowledged what many of us have understood from the \nbeginning. It is going to take huge amounts of money--your money; aha, \nthey like to talk about that term ``your money''--it is going to take \nlarge amounts of your money, a long-term commitment, and substantial \nhelp from the international community to restore order to Iraq.\n  After stiff-arming--I will say that again--after stiff-arming the \nUnited Nations for its refusal to rubberstamp the administration's war \nplans for Iraq, and alienating some of our staunchest allies in the \nprocess, the White House--hear me down there--has finally acquiesced to \nseeking a new resolution that potentially would give the United Nations \na vital role in postwar Iraq that the President once pledged.\n  I only hope this change of heart on the President's part is not a \nlesson too late for the learning. The United States has squandered on \nIraq so much of the international good will that followed the September \n11 terrorist attacks that it may be impossible to regain all the ground \nthat has been lost.\n  It is particularly ironic that the administration's decision to seek \na new resolution to win international support from the United Nations \ncomes almost exactly 1 year after the President sternly warned the \nUnited Nations that it faced becoming irrelevant if it failed to \nsupport the United States on Iraq. How far off the mark that assessment \nturned out to be. How far off the mark. Instead of being irrelevant, \nthe United Nations has emerged as America's best and possibly only hope \nto win desperately needed international support for the postwar mission \nin Iraq.\n\n  It is deeply ironic that the administration is seeking an estimated \n$60 billion to $70 billion in additional funding for Iraq from the \nAmerican taxpayers--your money, I say--at a time when the Senate is \ndebating adding a fraction of that amount to an appropriations bill to \nprovide critical funding, funding that the President himself pledged to \nprovide in his No Child Left Behind initiative for schoolchildren in \npoor school districts.\n  Earlier this week, I offered an amendment to the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education appropriations bill that would add $6.1 \nbillion for title I education programs to fully fund the money Congress \nauthorized for fiscal year 2004 in the No Child Left Behind Act. This \nis money--your money--I like that term ``your money.'' Yes, it is your \nmoney that Congress promised to provide. It is your money that our \nschools desperately need.\n  Unfortunately, I fear I am fighting an uphill battle to win the \npassage of my amendment. It is going to take 60 votes on that \namendment. I fear I am fighting an uphill battle. Opponents of the \namendment have already staked out their positions, complaining that we \ncannot afford the additional funding, that the amendment will add $6 \nbillion to the deficit, and that we are already doing plenty for \neducation.\n  We will never do enough for education. I am not one who believes in \nthrowing money at education. No, not I. I came from a two-room \nschoolhouse back in the hills of West Virginia. Yes, I know about the \nBaby Ray Primer. Yes, I studied by the old oil lamp. I memorized my \nhistory lessons. I knew about Nathaniel Green, about Hamilton, and \nMadison. Those were my heroes when I was a boy. I got my heroes out of \nthe history books. The history book that I read was Muzzey. There \nweren't many pictures in my history book. There was substance there. I \nmemorized my history lesson. That was good for me. We didn't have all \nthe frills and so on that we have today.\n  So don't count me in to just throw money at education. I don't \nbelieve in that. But this is $6 billion that Congress promised and that \nthe President said he needed. He was for the No Child Left Behind act. \nWell, let's mean what we say. Let's get behind our words.\n  I don't believe and I don't buy any of the arguments used against my \namendment. I wonder how the Senators who object to the cost of my \namendment will view the President's request to add $60 billion, $65 \nbillion, or $70 billion to the deficit to fund military and \nreconstruction activities in Iraq. I wonder if those same Senators will \nbe comfortable voting to support a massive spending program for Iraq if \nthey cannot bring themselves to support a comparatively meager increase \nin education funding for American schoolchildren.\n  I intend to speak at greater length on my education amendment at a \nlater time, but I urge my colleagues to begin reflecting on what kind \nof signal we will be sending to the American families if we shortchange \neducation funding by $6 billion one day and approve 10 times that \namount for Iraq the next.\n  Make no mistake about it, Congress had little choice but to provide \nsome level of additional funding for military and reconstruction \nactivities in Iraq. Oh, yes, we now want the help of those whom we \nstrong-armed. They were not going to be relevant. They are very \nrelevant today when we need them. We bulldozed our way into that \ncountry, into Iraq, almost single-handedly, over the objections of most \nof the international community. They saw us as a bully. Now we are \npaying the price for our unmitigated arrogance.\n\n  With the exception of the help we have received from the British, we \nhave gotten almost no monetary assistance and precious little military \nassistance from other nations to assist with our operations in Iraq. It \nwas a war that we should never have fought. The U.N. inspectors were in \nthat country, and they were finding weapons. Weapons were being \ndestroyed. We did not need to send our men to invade another nation \nthat had not attacked us. And all of the claims that this was a nation \nthat posed an imminent danger to our country? How foolish we were to \naccept that idea.\n  I said at the time there is no such imminent danger to us. I said it \nthen. So I come with some credibility when I say it today. No, it was \nnot a just war. Think of the boys, think of the men and women who have \nhad to go to Iraq in the hot Sun and sweltering weather and be away \nfrom their homes; the Guard men and women and the reservists who have \nhad to go there. Some have perished. Say to their mothers and fathers \nthat it was a just war. Say it to them. No. And they could not even \nlift a plane against our forces.\n  Where was the imminent threat to our security? Where are the weapons \nof mass destruction? We were led down the primrose path by the \nleadership of this country: Oh, it was an imminent danger. Our security \nwas in danger. It was urgent that we invade another nation that had not \ninvaded ours, that had not attacked our Nation in pursuance of the \ndoctrine of preemption. That got us into Iraq.\n  I did not fall for that stuff. I did not vote for it and so said at \nthe time that this country was not in imminent danger, that our \nnational security was not being threatened.\n  Never before had we invaded another country when we had never been \nattacked. A major war--the American people have had to pay for that, \nand there are some people in this country who have had to pay it with \ntheir sons and daughters and husbands. When are they going to come \nhome?\n\n[[Page S11146]]\n\n  We have stiff-armed some of our most staunch allies through the \nyears. We gave them backhand slaps. We criticized them because they \nwould not follow us into Iraq because their constituencies did not \nagree with us. Yet we expected them to follow us. They did not see it \nas a war in which we were being placed in imminent danger. They did not \nsee it. They did not see it with respect to their own countries. They \nhad to follow their constituencies' feelings, and yet we had a good \ndeal to say about them that today we probably wish we had not said.\n  The polls released by the Pew Research Center on March 18, the day \nbefore the war began, showed that opposition to a war in Iraq was at 69 \npercent in Germany; 75 percent in France; 86 percent in Turkey; and 87 \npercent in Russia. And yet the White House scoffed at this opposition \nand belittled the need to unify the world in confronting Saddam \nHussein.\n  Could it be that we are now paying the price for the administration's \nbullheaded rush to war without the broad and active support of the \ninternational community? We have perhaps a chance to mend the fences \nand garner more support from the United Nations if the United States \ncan swallow, if this administration can swallow its false pride and \ncome up with a new resolution that cedes a meaningful role in the \nreconstruction of Iraq to the international community.\n  Perhaps we also have a chance to attract some serious monetary \ncontributions from the international community, but I doubt we will \nbegin to approach the level of support that we have received from other \nnations during the first gulf war. Nevertheless, we must keep trying, \nwe must keep returning to the United Nations because that is an \nimportant, if not long overdue, first step.\n  Moreover, Congress and the American people must insist on a full \naccounting from the administration of the dollars it is requesting for \nIraq. The fact that we are faced with staggering demands in Iraq does \nnot mean Congress should feel compelled to hand the administration a \nblank check and we should not be afraid to ask questions. It is not \nunpatriotic to ask questions. After all, it is your money out there, as \nI look into those television lenses.\n  Lack of careful planning on the part of the administration for \npostwar Iraq helped to get us into our current difficulties, and we \ncannot afford to repeat our mistakes. Oh, they were in a hurry. They \nwere impatient. They talk today about the need for patience. The \nadministration was not very patient when it wanted to take this Nation \ninto war.\n  Just 5 months ago, Congress provided $78.5 billion in funds--your \nmoney--for military and reconstruction activities in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Now we are learning that we will need far more money--your \nmoney--for Iraq far sooner than the administration either anticipated \nor admitted.\n  We need to demand the details before we approve any more money for \nIraq. We should require the President to submit a detailed budget \nrequest for the $60 billion to $70 billion he is seeking in \nsupplemental funding for Iraq, and the Appropriations Committees of \nboth Houses should hold hearings on that request.\n  We could not get straight answers from the administration on the \nexpected cost or duration of the Iraq operation prior to the war. We \ncould not get the information we needed the first time around. We \ncannot afford to settle for evasions this time around.\n  The supplemental funding request that the President is expected to \nsend to Congress in the next few weeks gives us an opportunity to get \nsome answers to some of the most pressing questions involving our \noccupation of Iraq. We had no business getting into that war. We had no \nbusiness invading another country that had not attacked us. The so-\ncalled imminent threat to our security was not there.\n  What is our postwar strategy for Iraq? What are we doing to improve \nthe security situation in Baghdad and other key cities? What have we \naccomplished in terms of restoring the electricity, the drinking water, \nand other basic services to the Iraqi citizens?\n  What kind of timetable are we facing? Do we have any kind of exit \nstrategy? Who is making the decisions? By far, the greatest monetary \ncost in Iraq is the cost of the military occupation. Of the $60 billion \nto $70 billion President Bush is expected to request, all but $10 \nbillion or so is earmarked for the Defense Department. The current cost \nof military operations in Iraq is $3.9 billion a month--$1 billion a \nweek. That is your money.\n  With massive Federal budget deficits staring us in the face, how long \ncan we sustain that level of spending in Iraq? Do we have any realistic \nexpectation that other countries will help to offset that cost? Even if \nwe manage to get another U.N. resolution, who is going to help us in \nIraq, and how will they help us? These are extremely important \nquestions. Somebody ought to be asking them.\n  The American people are not here to ask them. The young people of \nthis country are not here to ask them. The young people, young high \nschool children and college students who are going to pay the interest \non these deficits we are running cannot be here to ask the questions.\n  We have a duty to ask the questions. These are important questions. \nCongress and the American people need to know the answers before \ncommitting more resources to Iraq. Congress should put the White House \non notice now that it will require a full explanation and a rigorous \njustification of the budget request before voting on it.\n  The President said several weeks ago major operations in Iraq have \nended. Have they?\n  In the meantime, Congress has other pressing matters on its plate. \nNext week the Senate will consider whether to fully fund a critical \neducation program for our neediest school children. I was one of those \nchildren once upon a time. I was a disadvantaged child. So were just \nabout all of the other children in my mining town. So I try to see \nmyself as one in that class. The bottom rungs on my ladder of life were \ngone also.\n  I hope we will treat this issue and my amendment with the same sense \nof urgency and importance the President expects us to treat the \nsupplemental budget request for Iraq. It is important. We will have to \ntreat that budget request as a matter of urgency. It will face us. But \nthere is no issue more important to the future of our country than the \neducation of our children.\n  I am reminded of Benjamin Disraeli in the English Parliament who said \nin 1874: Upon the education of the people of this country, the future \nof this country depends.\n  Look it up. 1874. That was the year before my foster father was born. \nBenjamin Disraeli said in the English Parliament: Upon the education of \nthe people of this country, the future of this country depends.\n  We can say that here: Upon the education of the people of this \ncountry, the future of this country--the USA, God bless America--but \nupon the education of the people of America, the future of America \ndepends. So there is no issue more important to the future of our \ncountry than the education of our children.\n\n     I took a piece of plastic clay\n     And idly fashioned it one day\n     And as my fingers pressed it still\n     It moved and yielded to my will.\n     I came again when days were past.\n     The bit of clay was hard at last.\n     The form I gave it, it still bore,\n     And I could change that form no more.\n     I took a piece of living clay\n     And gently formed it day by day.\n     And molded it with my power and art\n     A young child's soft and yielding heart.\n     I came again when years were gone.\n     He was a man I looked upon.\n     He still that early impress wore,\n     And I could change him nevermore.\n\n  We have in our hands a piece of clay. On this issue especially I hope \nthe Senate will put aside partisanship and vote to fully fund the No \nChild Left Behind Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Prescription Drugs and Medicare\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, at this time the conferees of the Senate \nand House are meeting with regard to the prescription drug bill and the \nMedicare reform that is part of that bill. I know the Presiding Officer \nrepresents\n\n[[Page S11147]]\n\nthe State of Texas, and having worked with some of the issues I am \ngoing to address, I think no State would benefit more from the reforms \nI will be talking about than the State of Texas.\n  What most Americans do not know is when a person goes to a hospital \nfor surgery, for example--and over half the people who go to the \nhospital for surgeries in America today--their health care is paid for \nby Medicare, senior citizens on Medicaid, low-income people, is paid \nfor predominantly by the Federal Government. There are formulas that \ndecide how the hospitals and providers get paid for doing the services \nthey provide. The net result, and the way the system is working today, \nthere is a very substantial difference in how much a hospital in \nAlabama or Texas would get paid compared to a hospital in a State with \na high wage index.\n\n  Of course, within States there are differences. Even within a State, \nat hospitals a few miles from one another, one hospital is paid \nsubstantially more for a gallbladder operation, for heart surgery, for \na mastectomy, or many other surgeries. The system is out of control. It \nis unjust and it is unfair.\n  The driving factor behind it is the formula called the wage index. \nUnfortunately, when determining how much Medicare pays for a hospital \nto perform a medical procedure, 71.4 percent of that formula is \ndetermined by the wage index--how much they say salaries will be in \nthat hospital, in that region. One expert's independent study says the \nreal percentage should be 56 percent. The CMS, the Federal agency that \nhandles this, admits it ought to be 62 percent, not 71 percent, of the \nallocation of money based on wage index.\n  This bill fixes that. This bill has the wage index at only 62 \npercent--not as low as I think it should go--but 62 percent of the \nformula to determine how much they should be paid. This will narrow the \ndisparity somewhat, not enough, but it is a very significant first \nstep.\n  Currently, we are rewarding the rich. In this system, the rich are \ngetting richer and the poor are getting poorer. For example, there is a \nhospital that comes out with the low wage index. They receive less \nmoney per surgery than a hospital in a larger city down the road. What \ndo they have to do? They have to cut costs. So maybe they reduce the \nnumber of RNs, maybe they reduce the salaries of their hospital workers \nand nurses, or a number of things to cut costs. What happens then? A \nyear or two later, or the next year, they come in and recalculate wage \ncosts and say: Yours went down; you are getting by with less, so we do \nnot have to give you as much as we gave you last year.\n  The one who got more money, who was able to raise salaries and pay \nmore, has increased costs. So they come out, in the current formula, \nshowing they need more. The rich are getting richer and the poor are \ngetting poorer. It is not right. It is a transfer of wealth from poorer \nareas to wealthy areas of the country. It is too big a gap.\n  We can do something about it. This fix for which I advocated, and we \npassed in this Senate, is part of the bill. Likewise, it was made part \nof the House bill. So both bills are in conference and have fixes for \nthe wage index according to the terms I just mentioned. It needs to be \nin the final bill. I have to insist it be in the final bill. We have \nseen in times past bills get manipulated in conference, even when \nsomething has passed both Houses and should be in a bill.\n  I appreciate the chairman of the Senate conference and the chairman \nof the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. He has stood \nfirm on this issue. He understands the issue. He is not going to accept \nany erosion of this legislation. He has communicated that clearly to \nthe conferees. There has been some discussion about it. He has \ncommunicated very clearly, in my presence, to President Bush, and \nPresident Bush agreed with him. This would be in the bill. We are \nmoving forward with the possibility of a significant reform this time.\n  We need to watch it. There are a lot of competing demands for money. \nA lot of people in conference may have another priority, but it passed \nboth Houses. Senator Grassley is standing firm, standing like a giant \noak tree. I don't believe he is going to be moved. I thank him for his \nleadership and determination to see this matter to its end and to make \nat least this significant reform in that legislation. If we do it, we \nwill find these two classes of health care will not be continued in \nAmerica where rich hospitals and rich centers get more and the rural \nareas get less.\n  There are some programs out there for rural hospitals to give them \nspecial benefits. But Alabama, like Texas, has a lot of areas that are \nmetropolitan but not high-cost centers, or not perceived to be high-\ncost centers, centers in cities with 30,000, 40,000, or 50,000 people. \nThey do not get the benefits of rural assistance, nor do they get the \nbenefit of a big city. That factor has been hurting us.\n  We worked hard on this. We will be watching this legislation very \ncarefully. The fix in it for wage index and rural health care needs to \nremain in the bill. I thank Senator Grassley for his determination to \nensure that it remains in the bill. If the bill is passed as it came \nout of this Senate, and I hope it will be, we will see some benefit to \nour hospitals, many of whom are hurting.\n  In particular, I note Alabama hospitals have the lowest wage index in \nthe Nation. Why, I cannot imagine. For example, the University of \nAlabama Birmingham University Medical Center is one of the finest \nmedical centers in the world. People come from all over the world to be \ntreated there. They are No. 1 in the world in liver transplants and No. \n3 in kidney transplants. They do some of the top work for the National \nInstitutes of Health. The University of South Alabama in Mobile, \nlikewise, is a first-rate medical school and medical center. Yet \nsomehow this weird formula comes out in our State providing \nsubstantially less. It is just not right. Our people pay the same \nMedicare tax. A Texan pays the same Medicare tax as a person does in \nNew York. But their hospitals do not get paid the same for the surgery.\n  We need to make some reform. We have an opportunity to make a nice \nstep forward. It is not the end of the road. It is still too much of a \ngap. If we are lucky and things go as I hope, this bill will come back \nas it left this body. Then we can know that our hospitals, at least, \nhad one good step forward as a result of Medicare reform and the \nprescription drug bill.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1580\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of \nSenator Harkin to preclude and prevent the Bush administration from \neliminating overtime pay for millions of hard-working Americans.\n  We just celebrated Labor Day. As is the custom, the President was out \naddressing labor in Ohio, talking to working men and women. The reality \nis that many of those families depend on overtime pay to make ends \nmeet. He did not announce to them that buried in the bowels of the \nFederal Register is a provision that would severely restrict access to \novertime pay for millions of American workers.\n  He talked about creating a position of economic czar to spur \nmanufacturing, but, frankly, I think if that audience understood that \nas he spoke he was also proposing and working to deny many of them \naccess to overtime pay, they would have been shocked and amazed--as I \nam shocked and amazed.\n  At a time when our economy is searching for ways to rebound from the \nlongest recession we have experienced in many years and from the most \nsevere loss of employment of any administration since Herbert Hoover, \nthe idea that we should prevent people from getting overtime pay seems \nludicrous, but that is precisely what the administration is proposing.\n  Indeed, if the administration were serious about ways in which we \ncould stimulate the economy, one way is to reward the effort of working \nAmericans when they work beyond 40 hours, give them access to \ntraditional overtime pay, and let them go ahead and use\n\n[[Page S11148]]\n\nthose resources for the family, for investment in America.\n  Frankly, it is a shock to me that the President is conducting this \ncampaign to surreptitiously and quietly remove overtime protection that \nhas been the law for the country since 1938 which every American takes \nfor granted. In the 1930s, there was a great debate about labor laws, \nand a compromise was struck. Some industrial nations absolutely have a \nprohibition on working beyond so many hours a week, and I think \nrightfully so, but that is too inflexible--but certainly at some level, \nand the level decided on was 40 hours. After that, it would be \nappropriate--in fact required--that a worker would be compensated for \nat least time and half for his wages.\n  We are here today because Senator Harkin, I think quite rightly, has \nproposed that we step to the plate publicly--not surreptitiously--and \nvote on this measure, vote whether we are going to deny overtime pay to \nmillions of Americans or continue a practice, a tradition, and a law \nthat has served this Nation well for almost 70 years.\n  About 79 percent of today's workers qualify for overtime pay. It \naccounts for about 25 percent of their income. Just think, if working \nAmericans--79 percent of them--lost 25 percent of their income or, even \na fraction of that, 10 percent of their income. They would be in \ndesperate straits with their mortgage responsibilities, their tuition \nresponsibilities, and their health care responsibilities.\n  All of us know because we spent the last month back in our home \nStates visiting with families who are working hard. Both spouses are \nworking hard just to make ends meet--not saving up for a fancy vacation \nor for a fancy anything but just to make sure the bills are paid. As I \nsaid, in 1938 we struck a balance. We set a clear line. We said \nessentially that if you work beyond 40 hours a week, then you get time \nand a half. It gives families an option. In fact, we all know some \nfamilies look forward to the opportunity for overtime work because that \nis what gives them the margin to get by in a very competitive \nenvironment, and a very expensive one.\n  In 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act recognized that there has to be \nsome flexibility in legislation. It says there are certain white-collar \nworkers who are professionals--highly paid executives, highly \ncompensated workers who do not need the protection because of the \nnature of the marketplace and who could be exempt from the requirement \nto pay overtime. They established several salary tests--a ``salary-\nlevel'' test, a ``salary-basis'' test, and the ``duties test.'' But \nessentially, as I view it, it was a narrow exemption. The rule was that \nif you worked more than 40 hours, you would qualify for overtime pay. \nBut there is a narrow exemption for white-collar duties. Again, because \nof the nature of the marketplace, these individuals, because of their \nskills and because of their abilities, are quite capable of negotiating \ntheir own arrangements and their own terms. That was, a reasoned and \nprincipled balance. Today, that balance is being upset by the proposal \nby the Bush administration.\n  First, let's briefly discuss what the rules are today. If you earn \nless than $8,840 per year, you cannot be exempt from the requirement to \npay overtime. That is sensible. Of course, $8,840 a year is trivial in \nsome respects in terms of buying for a family in the United States in \nthe year 2003. The administration recognizes that the proposal is \nartificially low. They proposed to raise the figure to the total of \n$22,100. But they are not going to index this figure. So this figure \ncould be locked in concrete for years. More importantly, even this \nfigure of $22,100 is basically the poverty level for a family of five. \nIn fact, the Department of Labor's own lower living standard income \nlevel--when they do predictions--suggests that a family of four \nrequires about $31,750 to avoid poverty. Yet we are saying there is a \nrange of people earning $22,000 and beyond who could lose their \novertime pay even though they are desperately close to poverty. It \ndoesn't make any sense to me. I think we should raise the level. We \nshould raise it to a level that is consistent with keeping a family out \nof poverty before we take away their automatic rights for overtime \nbeyond 40 hours a week.\n\n  But the biggest change the administration is proposing is to \nbasically broaden the category dramatically for who is white-collar or \nexecutive. What it means is that before we considered a professional--\naccording to the definition, it is someone who has had a prolonged \ncourse of intellectual studies: lawyers, doctors, obviously academics, \ncivil engineers with qualifications and certificates. But now the \nadministration wants to go ahead and say, no, this is really just \nsomeone who, through experience, has gained the title of \n``professional.''\n  This means we are opening up this possibility of losing overtime pay \nfor draftsmen, engineering technicians, paralegals, emergency medical \ntechnicians, licensed practical nurses. And I can tell you that \nlicensed practical nurses in a hospital are professionals but they are \ncertainly not paid like a doctor is paid. This rule would put them on \nthat level. She is a professional. I don't think that makes any sense. \nLab technicians, dental hygienists, physical therapists, respiratory \ntherapists, lab technicians, and some registered nurses will be denied \novertime pay because they are now ``professionals.''\n  There is a broadening of the definition of ``executives.'' When this \nlegislation was passed almost 60 years ago, those executives had a \nnarrowly construed exemption. They were someone who exercised \nsignificant authority over a significant number of people. Now they are \ntalking about someone in a minimal supervisory responsibility who could \nbe classified as an executive. Some restaurant workers who happen to be \nthe head of a shift of other waiters are now suddenly executives. That \nis news to a lot of the people I know who work in the hospitality \nindustry. Certainly, they would be executives in terms of base pay. But \nin terms of overtime pay, they are not.\n  Again, to me, that is something that strikes against the whole spirit \nof people working beyond 40 hours a week. They should qualify for \novertime with these narrow exemptions. Exceptions now are being \nbroadened beyond that definition. I think this rule, as a result, is \nvery questionable.\n  The effect may be that families will lose out. The average American \nworking puts in more hours than in any other country in the world--\nalmost 1,900 hours a year. That is how long the average American worker \nworks.\n  As I said, more and more families rely on not just the income of a \nprimary breadwinner but both spouses are working. We are the hardest \nworking nation in the world. We pat ourselves on the back for our \nindustry, for our dedication, and for our determination. And here the \nadministration is not rewarding that effort but effectively punishing \npeople, saying: Well, you might be compelled to work overtime but you \nwon't be paid for that. That doesn't make any sense.\n  This has a particular impact on health care workers, I suggest, \nbecause it is so easy in that context to talk about supervisory \nresponsibilities and professional qualifications. There is just enough \npay so they will go over the threshold. My home State of Rhode Island \nhas 68,000 health care workers. Thousands of them count on overtime pay \nto just make it through the month. If they lose that pay, they are \ngoing to be in a serious predicament, along with their families and our \nwhole economy.\n  The Department of Labor estimates that the proposal will only affect \nabout 644,000 Americans. Frankly, that is a gross underestimate. \nProbably millions will be affected by it because of the ambiguity of \nthese new classifications because the incentives, if you will, are for \nemployers to find ways to deny individual workers the right to overtime \ncompensation.\n  In fact, the Economic Policy Institute studied just 78 of the 257 \nproposed ``white-collar'' occupations and estimated that 2.5 million \nsalaried employees would lose their right to overtime if these \nproposals were adopted. I don't believe we should weaken the exception \nin this economy.\n  We have just today seen another report of unemployment. Unemployment \nis hovering at 6.1 percent at recessionary levels.\n\n  In fact, we saw a dramatic fall in payrolls, the number of people \nactually in nonfarm occupations working. We have seen productivity \nincreases which are good, but they have not been balanced by gains in \nemployment.\n\n[[Page S11149]]\n\n  Fewer people are working. Since the administration took office, 9 \nmillion people have lost their job. Today, in addition to that, we are \ntelling the people who are still hanging on to employment: ``Don't \ncount on overtime''? That is not fair and it is not good for our \neconomy.\n  I would hope we could vote on this amendment and that we could send a \nvery strong message that what has worked for 60 years, what most people \nbelieve is deeply ingrained in the fabric of the American market and \nworkplace--the simple notion that if you work more than 40 hours a week \nyou qualify for overtime--can be maintained as it has been. I hope we \ncan do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill \nreported by the Senate Appropriations Committee contains $10 million to \nfund a small, but important, provision passed in 1996 which would \nextend the Federal Tort Claims Act coverage to medical volunteers in \nfree clinics in order to expand access to health care services for \nthose who are low income and have few avenues to receive health care. \nThis long overlooked provision is Section 194 of the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996 and is similar to the \ncoverage already offered community health centers.\n  Congress never appropriated funds for section 194. No administration \nrequested funding and no regulations to implement this section of the \nlaw were ever published. Yet, one of the key reasons retired health \nprofessionals often do not volunteer is the cost of malpractice \ninsurance. Free clinics simply cannot afford to purchase insurance for \nthem. HIPAA provided a mechanism to solve the problem, yet 7 years \nafter the law's passage, failure to fund this section of law has \nprevented it from becoming a reality.\n  Year after year, I, and several colleagues, have urged this and \nprevious administrations to implement this provision. The current \nadministration has been concerned that they would not be able to \nimplement the provision without funding. I thank my colleagues on the \ncommittee who have helped make this funding a reality, and I will \ncontinue to work with them to assure that the provision stays in \nthrough the conference.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Reid \nHispanic educational opportunities amendment.\n  My Democratic colleagues and I have held roundtables with Hispanic \nleaders across the Nation and members of the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus that have allowed us to share ideas and develop an agenda that \naddresses the issues that matter most to the Hispanic community.\n  We know how important education is to Hispanics and will continue to \nensure that it remains a top priority for the Democratic caucus.\n  Two years ago, Congress and this administration worked together to \npass the No Child Left Behind Act to improve the quality of education \nin America's public schools. We had the commitment from President Bush \nthat additional resources would be provided to help schools implement \nthe changes required.\n  Today, this administration has broken its promise and has chosen to \ncut funding for NCLB next year by $1.2 billion below this year's \nenacted level of funding. I stand with my colleagues in support of this \namendment because we recognize the education of Latino students as a \nnational priority. We are here today to ensure that these resources are \nrestored.\n  Hispanics are now the largest minority group, as well as the youngest \nfastest-growing minority group, in the country. Hispanic children make \nup 17 percent of the total school-age population in the country and \nrecent trends indicate that the number of Latino children attending our \nNation's schools is increasing. Despite these changing demographics, \nHispanic children remain among the most educationally disadvantaged of \nall students.\n  Hispanic children are more likely to attend schools in predominantly \nlow-income areas, they are more likely to be enrolled in segregated \nschools, less likely to complete high school, and are less likely to be \nenrolled in and graduate from college than their non-Latino peers.\n  This amendment will help restore funding for several key programs \nthat have traditionally helped put Hispanic students on par with their \nmore advantaged peers.\n  This administration has chosen to eliminate dropout prevention at a \ntime when the dropout rate among Hispanics is growing and continues to \nbe higher than that of White or Black students. Nationally, the dropout \nrate among Hispanics in 2000 was 34 percent up from 22 percent in 1990, \nand in New York State, the percentage rose to 38.4 percent in 2000. In \nNew York City, 38 percent of all children enrolled in elementary and \nsecondary schools are Hispanic, higher than any other group. These \nchildren face many barriers to graduation, yet New York City's dropout \nprevention grant will be zero funded in this appropriation bill.\n  School districts in New York and across the Nation already lack the \nresources, staffing and programs to help new immigrants adapt to U.S. \nschools and overcome language barriers. Eliminating this funding will \njust make matters worse. We know that young adults who do not finish \nhigh school are more likely to be unemployed than those who graduate. \nAt a time when our unemployment rate is staggering, we should be \ndoubling the funding for dropout prevention- not eliminating it.\n  I applaud Senator Bingaman for his leadership in making dropout \nprevention a national priority and look forward to working with him on \nthis issue.\n  This appropriations bill cuts title III of the NCLB by $20 million, \nseverely underfunding bilingual education programs and jeopardizing the \nacademic success of hundreds of thousands of English language learners \nacross the nation. New York's schools serve a large and growing number \nof Latino students and the rate of enrollment for limited English \nproficient students has grown by 44.3 percent, since 1990. Resources \nprovided under title III of the NCLB help school districts in my State \nprovide English language instruction to over 300,000 limited English \nproficient children and nearly 120,000 immigrant children.\n  Since this program was consolidated and turned into a block grant, \nstates like New York have had to reduce their services. This \nappropriations bill adds insult to injury by forcing cash-strapped \nschools to serve more students with far fewer resources. Restoring this \nfunding will help States, local schools, and colleges build their \ncapacity to teach limited English proficient students effectively.\n  The children of migrant farm workers, often called ``children of the \nroad,'' face many obstacles in their lives, including extreme poverty, \ngeographic and cultural isolation, discrimination based on race or \nethnic status, language minority status, and, most importantly, \nmobility.\n  I am pleased that this amendment restores and increases funding for \nkey migrant education programs that serve this at-risk population, \nincluding Head Start for children of migrant and seasonal farm workers. \nCurrently, only 664 of 1,177 eligible migrant children are enrolled in \nMigrant and Seasonal Head Start centers across New York. This is \nespecially troubling given the fact that migrant children who are not \nin head start classrooms are either cared for by other younger siblings \nor are left in the fields.\n  This amendment will take an additional 150 migrant children in New \nYork out of the fields where they are put at risk of exposure to \nharmful toxins and pesticides and into quality head start classrooms \nwhere they can receive the social, behavioral, and cognitive skills \nthey need to help prepare them for school.\n  This amendment also restores funding to the High School Equivalency \nProgram, HEP, and College Assistance Migrant Program, CAMP. The HEP and \nCAMP programs are both very important to New York as well as other \nStates in the Northeast. The HEP program helps migrant students who \nhave\n\n[[Page S11150]]\n\ndropped out of high school get their GED, and CAMP assists migrant \nstudents in their first year of college with both counseling and \nstipends.\n  The children of migrant farm workers face the highest dropout rate \namong all other Hispanic American ethnic groups. Current estimates \nplace the dropout rate for migrant at between 50 and 60 percent. Before \nthe Federal Government created CAMP programs, there was no record of a \nmigrant child having completed college. With HEP and CAMP these \nstudents are making amazing progress. At the State University of New \nYork at Oneonta, both programs serve students from migrant and seasonal \nfarm working families from New York, Maine, Pennsylvania and \nConnecticut. This year, Luis, a New Yorker and former HEP and CAMP \nstudent will be entering as a sophomore at SUNY-Oneonta. Luis' \nexperience as a migrant youth is shared by countless other children of \nmigrant and seasonal farm workers.\n  For many migrant children, moving from state to state can take its \ntoll. For Luis, it resulted in a pattern of repeating grades until he \nquit school to work with his father in the vineyards in Western New \nYork. A year later, he learned about High School Equivalency Program, \nHEP. With the assistance of the HEP program, he earned his GED, applied \nto college, and was accepted to SUNY last year as biology major. As a \nCAMP student, Luis received vital academic, social, and financial \nsupport during his first year of college, the most critical year for \nmost first-generation college students.\n  Luis now mentors other CAMP students, is a member of the Migrant \nAmeriCorps program and has maintained a cumulative GPA of 3.04. \nSecuring additional resources for HEP and CAMP will help ensure the \ndreams of students like Luis become reality. I also support increasing \nfunding for Hispanic Serving Institutions, HSIs.\n  For New York this increase will help 12 colleges and universities \nexpand their capacity to serve a large and growing number of Hispanic \nstudents. By supporting these institutions we are recognizing the large \ncontribution they make to increasing access to higher education for \ntraditionally underserved communities, and are making the dream of \ncollege a reality for many more Hispanics. The condition of America's \nfuture will depend upon how well we meet the demand for an educated \nworkforce.\n  Cuts in education programs might help balance the books in the short-\nterm, but it is a bad idea for our economy in the long-term. We need a \nhighly skilled workforce to compete in this global economy and \ninvesting in the education and training of our Hispanic population will \nhelp our Nation meet this challenge.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11150-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee passed legislation that has real promise, and that promise \ngoes to the heart of offering the schoolchildren of this city, the \nDistrict of Columbia, a genuine, a real opportunity to achieve an \neducation. Specifically, I am talking about the DC Choice Program, a \nprogram my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Judd Gregg, has worked \nso very hard on over the past several months; an issue that other \ncolleagues, especially Mike DeWine, the Senator from Ohio, has been so \ncommitted to; an issue that colleagues from the other side of the \naisle, Senator Feinstein and Senator Byrd, are both committed to. \nIndeed, both showed, I believe, bold and courageous action on behalf of \nthe Capital City's schoolchildren.\n  The District of Columbia appropriations bill provides $40 million for \npublic schools here in the Capital City. That money will be divided \nbetween public charter schools and a new private school tuition program \nthat would offer up to $7,500 per student for about 2,000 additional \nstudents.\n  Regrettably, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nsupported doing nothing, supported the status quo. They refuse to allow \n2,000 of the District's schoolchildren who are from hard-working, low-\nincome families to have that opportunity of earning a better education. \nThey would rather trap these children in failing schools. They would \nrather tolerate failure than take a chance at success.\n  The record of the District's public schools is shocking. Despite \nunprecedented Federal and local spending in the District totaling about \n$12,000 per student, the District's scores are the lowest in the \nNation. Only 10 percent of the District's fourth graders are proficient \nat reading. Fewer than 12 percent of District fourth graders can write \nat grade level. Only 6 percent of District fourth graders can do math \nat a proficient level.\n  This is a disgrace. DC's public schools are graduating children who \ncannot read, who cannot write, who cannot add, and who cannot subtract. \nWould any of us in this Chamber allow our children to be illiterate and \nunable to do simple fourth grade math problems? The answer is obvious.\n  In fact, many of those who oppose Choice for the Capital's \nschoolchildren send their own children to private schools where their \nchildren are able to read great literature, learn calculus, learn \nphysics, and dream about careers in anthropology, or careers in \naeronautics, and, indeed, go on to competitive colleges and \nuniversities.\n  Unlike some of my colleagues here on the Hill, the locally elected \nofficials from the District itself want the very same for the \nDistrict's school age kids. They are determined that the District \nschoolchildren will learn to read and to write and thereby share in \nthat American dream. The city's Mayor, Anthony Williams, understands \nthat. The DC Board of Education president, Peggy Cooper Cafritz, and \ncity council member Kevin P. Chavous are all courageously advancing the \ncause of universal education for kids here in the District of Columbia. \nThey understand it. Most importantly, the people who understand it and \nwho are leading the fight are the parents of the kids here in the \nDistrict.\n  Across the city, parents are lining up in order to obtain better \noptions and better alternatives for their children. The need is so \nintense that the District Public School Choice Programs are now way \noversubscribed. Each year, more than 1,000 schoolchildren are ``wait-\nlisted'' for the city's magnet programs. Charter schools educate right \naround 15 percent of DC kids, with nearly 11,500 children in attendance \nand another 1,000 on waiting lists to get into these charter schools.\n  When John Walton and Ted Forstmann invested $2 million in the \nChildren's Scholarship Fund here in the District, more than 10,000 \nfamilies applied for about 1,000 seats.\n  Virginia Walden-Ford, the executive director of DC Parents for School \nChoice and a mother of three, knows first hand how desperately parents \nwant a better education for their children. She tells me that each week \nshe receives in her organization hundreds of calls just about this \nissue of having a better choice, a better alternative. She knows first \nhand the desperation of these parents.\n  Virginia had to take matters into her own hands when her son was \nhaving trouble in school. He was skipping school. He was having run-ins \nwith the law. He felt like no one cared. He also felt peer pressure to \nnot work hard, to not achieve, to not aspire. Virginia, as a parent, \nwas terrified. We all would feel this way. She was terrified of what \nwould happen if her son stayed in that environment--if he stayed or was \ntrapped along this path that would lead to nowhere. So she decided as a \nparent to make a difference and to make a change. She sent him to a \nprivate school. And within 2 weeks she tells me her son, who she was so \nworried about being trapped in this environment in which there was no \nescape whatsoever and no opportunity to achieve that American dream, \nwas transformed--no more getting into trouble, no more skipping school, \nno more getting into trouble with the police, no more skipped homework \nassignments. Virginia asked him why. What made that difference? What \nled to that transformation?\n  Her son told her very directly that the teachers for the first time \ncared\n\n[[Page S11151]]\n\nabout whether he learned. At the new school, skipping class and not \nshowing up the next day was a major infraction. For the first time, \nVirginia was told by her son that he actually felt safe walking through \nthe school's hallways. Not only did Virginia's young son graduate, but \nunlike many of his friends at the old school who had dropped out before \ngraduation, he graduated with a 3.8 grade average. And, indeed, today \nhe proudly serves in the Marine Corps. Virginia believes that going to \nprivate school literally saved her son's life.\n\n  That is one story. There are thousands of stories like that in terms \nof better opportunities. But there are thousands more parents who want \nthe same for their kids, who want that opportunity, who simply don't \nhave that opportunity but who will now have that opportunity if the \nbill that was passed yesterday in the Appropriations Committee \nultimately becomes law.\n  It is nonsensical to withhold from these parents the opportunity to \nhave their kids be able to go to a school where they will thrive, where \nthey will have those new opportunities.\n  Yesterday, as I looked at the vote and who voted which way, it is \nclear that a majority of Senators in the Appropriations Committee--and \nI believe a majority of Senators on the floor of this Senate--are \nparents like Virginia who will demand better options for their \nchildren, and thus the Senate will support giving them those options.\n  I, for one, support each child's right to learn to read and write and \nadd and subtract. Basic education for our schoolchildren simply cannot \nwait. It is incumbent upon us to act.\n  Cardinal McCarrick, who is the Archbishop of Washington, DC, \nunderstands how crucial choice is to the future of this city's kids. I \nhad the opportunity to discuss with Cardinal McCarrick this very issue. \nHe stressed to me the importance of this piece of legislation to open \nup that opportunity to families and to kids all across the District. He \nwrote me a letter earlier this summer, which I ask unanimous consent to \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Archdiocese of Washington,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 21 2003.\n     Hon. Senator Bill Frist,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: As the U.S. Senate committees review \n     legislative proposals for appropriations to fund the DC \n     School Initiative, I would like to restate in the strongest \n     terms my support for this initiative and all that it \n     represents.\n       Our Catholic Schools in the District of Columbia have \n     served the children and families of Washington for over 100 \n     years, and we are determined to continue to provide for these \n     families in the future. We are committed to the City and to \n     all its families and children. In fact, the majority of our \n     students in the District are not Catholic. As stewards of \n     education we recognize the need for every student to have \n     equal access to educational opportunities that will best \n     serve the needs of both the family and the child. It is \n     because of this commitment that we wanted to work in \n     partnership with Mayor Williams and our colleagues on the \n     City Council, on the School Board, in the Superintendent's \n     office, and in the private sector. Working together, putting \n     politics aside, we realized the need for a three-sector \n     initiative. It is a simple collaborative model, and yet it \n     continues to remain a controversial concept to some.\n       This three-sector concept has formed the basis for the DC \n     School Funding Initiative. This approach provides the \n     opportunity for all in leadership to support the strongest \n     strategy to date for improving and increasing educational \n     options for low-income families. Just as a triangular \n     structure is the sturdiest of structures, because each side \n     reinforces the other, the three-sector approach allows the \n     whole of DC education to be greater than the sum of its \n     parts.\n       The Archdiocese of Washington is committed to this solid \n     approach and strongly supports legislation that provides 45 \n     to 50 million dollars over five years for:\n       a. DC public schools to bolster the Transformation schools, \n     to recruit principals and teachers, and to provide for \n     professional development programming,\n       b. DC charter schools to support building renovations; and\n       c. Non-public scholarships for the neediest families in the \n     District to be used to pay for the cost of education at the \n     school of choice.\n       Let me just say a further word about the third part of this \n     triangle, the help for parents who want to exercise their \n     right to choose a non-public school for the education of \n     their children. If they are poor--as so many of our families \n     here in the District are--they have the right in theory, but \n     they cannot exercise it in fact because they cannot pay the \n     cost of their education. Some are working three and four jobs \n     just to make their choice possible and your heart breaks to \n     see this sacrifice made year after year. This three-sector \n     program will help them as it will help the youngsters in the \n     public system as well.\n       It is our sincere belief that this partnership model is \n     significant and worthy of legislative support, funding, and \n     assessment. This unique model of cooperation and strength \n     affords all three sectors opportunities to engage in shared \n     research, planning, and the continued development of services \n     to support all children.\n       Hoping these legislative initiatives will be successful, \n     the Catholic Schools of Washington, DC are prepared to accept \n     1,200 to 2,000 students. Many of these students may attend \n     schools that already serve low-income neighborhoods. In fact \n     eleven of our Center City Consortium schools currently serve \n     a population that is 99% non-white, with 65% non-Catholic, \n     50% living below the poverty level, and 70% of the students \n     living in single-parent households. More important, these \n     schools are successful--with 100% of the graduating students \n     accepted at Catholic High Schools, where 99% of the graduates \n     go on to college. The average cost of educating our children \n     is approximately $7,000 per child compared to the $12,000 \n     cost for the District of Columbia. This ground-breaking \n     initiative to participate as partners in education is an \n     opportunity each of our District of Columbia Schools \n     welcomes.\n       This is a unified and comprehensive strategy to level the \n     playing field for under-resourced communities by ensuring \n     economically disadvantaged families a chance to pursue all \n     options, giving all children access to quality educational \n     choices.\n       The Archdiocese remains committed to the three-sector \n     initiative. Together with the Mayor, the City Government, the \n     School Board, and our colleagues in all charter and non-\n     public schools, we share this dream of giving the children \n     and the families of our nation's Capital one of the finest \n     educational opportunities in the land. All three sectors need \n     to be supported for this partnership strategy to succeed. \n     Each sector gains strength and stability from the other \n     sectors. This is a partnership representing a long-term \n     commitment of cooperation for the good of our children.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to share our commitment to \n     this vision.\n       With every good wish, I am\n           Faithfully yours,\n                                      Theodore Cardinal McCarrick,\n                                         Archbishop of Washington.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in that letter, he tells me that he \nregularly in the course of his counseling and in the course of his work \nsees parents who work ``three and four jobs just to make their choice \npossible.''\n  He goes on to write that ``your heart breaks to see this sacrifice \nmade year after year.''\n  My fellow colleagues, parents are breaking their backs in this \nDistrict to send their kids to schools that work, schools that really \nteach, schools that really provide an environment in which learning can \ntake place. When you learn that only 10 percent--only 1 out of 10--of \nthe District's fourth graders are proficient readers, your heart breaks \nall over again. These children almost certainly will never be able to \ncatch up.\n  I would like to close these brief remarks with a statement from the \neditorial page of the Washington Post. Although I don't quote the \neditorial pages of the Washington Post often, on this issue the Post is \nabsolutely correct. The editorial reads:\n\n       It is inexcusable for a group of Senators, many from \n     distant States, to turn this into a partisan issue of their \n     own. Instead, they should fight to make the District of \n     Columbia school system work better for more children, in \n     public, private and charter schools across the city.\n\n  ``They should fight to make the DC school system work better for more \nchildren.''\n  Mr. President, we should--and we must--fight to do just that. The \nDistrict schoolchildren should not be trapped in the shadows of our \nshining city on the hill. They deserve, and their families deserve, our \nbest efforts to make their classrooms models of success. They deserve, \njust as much as any other child--as much as a child of a U.S. Senator--\nto achieve the American dream. We can give them that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11151-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11151-S11154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have a few comments to make about the \nfall\n\n[[Page S11152]]\n\nand some of the progress we have made to date, and then I plan on \nclosing the Senate for the weekend. Not having had the opportunity this \nweek, the first week back after our August break, I did want to comment \na bit on the agenda.\n  Over the course of the week, we have had time to have our conference, \nand I talked to the Democrat leader as well, and I think over this week \nwe have made good progress. There has been not quite as much progress \ntoday as I would like. I am very hopeful we will make more progress on \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations bill. But after discussions with our own \nconference and the leaders on the other side, I am optimistic and very \nexcited about the agenda for the next several weeks and into the fall.\n  Over the course of this week, we have made good progress. We have had \nseven rollcall votes. We have disposed of a number of other amendments, \nand I remain hopeful we can complete action on this bill early next \nweek so we can continue with other appropriations bills.\n  In addition, this week we passed several important banking reforms \nunder Chairman Richard Shelby's leadership, including hospital mortgage \ninsurance and the FHA mortgage commitment. I thank Senator Shelby for \nhis tremendous leadership on both of these issues.\n  Next week, once we complete Labor-HHS, we will go, as I mentioned, to \nother appropriations bills. Chairman Stevens this week was able to \nprocess all of the remaining appropriations bills. We have done three \nof the 13 bills. We are on our fourth appropriations bill. The rest of \nthose bills were processed in committee and, indeed, all of them now \nare awaiting Senate action. That is why again and again, as majority \nleader, I will be encouraging our colleagues to work together and \ncontinue to make progress because all of this we are directed to do \nover the next 30 days. So I ask for patience, cooperation, and \npartnership so we can continue to move in the direction of completion \nof these bills.\n  Next week, we will continue working with the Democrat leader on the \ncommemoration we will have in this body for the anniversary of \nSeptember 11. With all of these efforts and the accomplishments of the \nlast 8 months, if you put it all together, the Senate has made steady, \nconsistent progress. That is what the American people want, that is \nwhat the American people deserve, and that is what they expect. So I \nthink we are on course.\n  If we look back over the last several months at issues such as our \njobs-and-growth package to tax relief to global concerns, such as HIV/\nAIDS and the commitment we have made and the legislation we have \npassed, we see a whole range of policies that directly impact people's \nlives, at a very personal level, a very intimate level, both here at \nhome and, indeed, across the globe.\n  Over the August recess, I had the opportunity to spend much time in \nAfrica, to be able to look firsthand at the ravages of HIV/AIDS and the \ndevastation that this greatest of all humanitarian causes has inflicted \nupon a people, but also the great hope that can result and is resulting \nfrom the commitment of the United States of America in this regard.\n  We will continue into the fall season with a very clear mission. It \nis the mission that I have stated on the floor, in our leadership \nmeetings, and in our caucus: to move America forward and to do it in \nsuch a way that serves the cause of the freedoms that we all cherish, \nthe freedoms for which we fight, the freedoms upon which this country \nwas founded.\n  That mission is coupled with forging a path of security in a whole \nrange of fields--in military, defense of the country, and health care--\nand to forge a path of strength and opportunity as reflected in my \nstatement just a few minutes ago for the American dream of the people \nin the District through expanded school choice.\n  As we look at this mission of moving America forward, I very quickly \nthink of the issue of energy. We left before the August recess having \npassed very important legislation, the energy legislation under the \nleadership of our colleague from New Mexico, Chairman Pete Domenici. \nLittle did we know that within 2 weeks of that we would have the August \n14 blackout that blanketed the Northeast and Canada and dramatically \nbrought home to us, in a concrete way, the importance of that \nlegislation and the importance of completing that legislation which \naddresses the issues of the energy supply, abundancy, and a more secure \nenergy policy.\n  Although I am not sure if they are finished now, a few hours ago the \nconference committee on energy between the House and Senate were \nmeeting. Going into that meeting, I talked to Senator Domenici. He said \nhow excited he is that we have an opportunity now that we have tried to \nrealize in the past, an opportunity to realize something that the \nAmerican people again deserve and expect and that will impact the lives \nof every single American in such a positive way.\n  The chairman and members on the conference committee have been hard \nat work with the administration in developing a policy that is \nconsistent with what we are working towards today, and that is \nsolutions to the energy crisis which address everyday Americans, \nwhether we look at production, consumption, or transmission of \nelectricity. So as we look into the fall and project ahead, I am \nconfident we will have an Energy bill on the President's desk by the \nend of the year.\n  This week, there has been much discussion on the supplemental to our \nefforts in Iraq. Although we do not know what that figure from the \nWhite House will specifically be, it is clear, at least to my mind--and \nthere will be debate and discussion and points will be made, but at the \nend of the day, we will stand behind the President and the request of \nthe President of the United States, and we will provide those resources \nand provide them proudly because we must win. We will win. There is no \nquestion in my mind we will win, but we must be fully behind that \neffort to make sure that those freedoms, which are the very freedoms \nupon which this country was founded, are preserved for our current \ngeneration but also for the future.\n  Our work around the world and with the world community to bring Iraq \ninto that world community of nations not only advances freedoms across \nthe globe but a safer and a more secure Iraq indeed makes Americans \nsafer and more secure.\n\n  We have the challenges before us, but there is no question that we \nwill win that war on terrorism, that we will win those battles for \nsecurity in Iraq, and that we will provide those appropriate resources.\n  As we look at moving America forward, we started by passing a \nMedicare prescription drug bill in this body, but our full impact has \nnot been felt and will not be felt until we have a final product in the \nconference report, which is currently underway. Meetings among \ncolleagues have taken place this week on both sides of the aisle to \nhelp develop that final product in Medicare and really to develop a \nMedicare system that, for the first time in the almost 40 years of its \nexistence, will offer help to people who need that help for \nprescription drug coverage.\n  There is a lot of talk about: Can it be done? Is there going to be a \nbacklash to it? It is going to cost too much. It is too complicated to \ndo now. There is still a lot of partisanship. Some say it is going to \nget mixed up in elections. I hear all of that again and again, but this \nis a particular issue that this body has spoken on strongly and \noverwhelmingly.\n  There were over 70 votes in favor of this legislation. It is \nlegislation that will have an impact, again, on millions of seniors' \nlives.\n  It leaves me to fairly confidently say we are going to have a bill \nthat is going to be on the President's desk sometime this year--I \ncannot predict exactly when it will be--that will represent the most \nsignificant legislative change, and I should also add the most \nsignificant increase in resources applied for health care security for \nseniors and individuals with disabilities; this gets lost a lot, but a \nbill that focuses on low-income people who simply do not have the \nresources to buy what we know are very expensive drugs, lifesaving \ndrugs, quality-of-life-improving drugs.\n  This bill will cut the burden of prescription drugs by over half on \npeople who are low income or simply have no health insurance or no \naccess to those lifesaving drugs. It is a bill that will provide \nimmediate relief. We are not\n\n[[Page S11153]]\n\ntalking about 5 years from now or 10 years from now but literally \nwithin probably around 8 to 9 months after the President signs that \nbill, every senior will have a prescription drug card that will give \nthem help immediately with the purchase of those prescription drugs.\n  We have a challenge. The challenge is basically to take the very best \nof the Senate bill and the very best of the House bill, bipartisan, \nbicameral, and put it together to accomplish those goals. I am \nconfident we are going to be able to do that in spite of the naysayers, \nwho--and I am not sure what drives it--basically say it cannot be done, \nit will not be done. I am confident it will be done. It will be \nchallenging, but it will be done.\n  When I think of security in Iraq and the security of our freedoms or \nenergy security, it comes back to health care security because if one \nis a senior or a near senior, their greatest fear is something is going \nto happen to them or to their mom or spouse, and it is going to wreck \ntheir life. They are going to die, their spouse is going to die, or \ntheir mom is going to die because of lack of access or lack of ability \nto access that can be lifesaving.\n  Looking at other areas of health care, these are all things that we \nwill be addressing very directly over the coming weeks.\n  There is the issue of frivolous lawsuits. People will say, well, we \naddressed this 3 months ago, or tried to address it, and therefore we \ndo not need to come back to it for another 3 or 4 years. That is not \nthe way we are going to approach it. We are not going to approach it \nbecause it is a problem that affects access to health care to people \nall over the United States of America with now 22 of the 50 States in \nwhat can be classified as a health care crisis because these frivolous \nlawsuits have now--maybe unlike 10 years ago--come to the point that it \naffects health care for everybody who is listening to me. Frivolous \nlawsuits are increasing in number every year--frivolous, unnecessary \nlawsuits. The lawsuits that are legitimate need to be there and there \nneeds to be fair and just compensation. I am talking frivolous, \nunnecessary lawsuits which are driving up the cost of health care, \npremiums to doctors, causing doctors to leave their practices and \ncausing doctors to leave certain communities and move to other States, \nthus affecting--for everybody listening--access to quality health care.\n\n  When it gets to that level, it becomes a crisis. It is our job to \nrespond. Although when we brought it to the floor 3 months ago we were \nunsuccessful in transforming the system, it will come back in the next \nseveral weeks. We will bring it back. Until we educate those who do not \nfully understand access and quality of care are being affected by the \nunnecessary, frivolous lawsuits--until people are fully educated, we \nwill keep bringing it back and, indeed, make a difference.\n  Another health care issue, although it is as much a jobs issue and an \nissue of the economy, but also health related, is asbestos. It is \ninteresting because as a thoracic surgeon, a chest surgeon--which is \nwhat I did before coming to the Senate--when I thought of asbestos, I \nthought of a disease called mesothelioma, a disease of the chest which \nis encasement of the lung, probably one of the most difficult \noperations a thoracic surgeon can do. People think transplants are \ndifficult. That is fairly straightforward compared to trying to resect \nand fix a mesothelioma of the lung, chest cavity, which is caused by \nasbestos.\n  The asbestos legislation was reasonable, and the intention was to \nhave adequate and fair and equitable reimbursement for asbestos-related \ndisease. That is positive, that is good, and good legislation.\n  The problem today is a little bit like the medical liability issue. \nWe have unnecessary claims being filed. People see there is a big pot \nof money out there. We have around 600,000 people who filed claims \nbecause they think there is a pot of money and because the legal system \nhas gone awry. They know that by filing a claim, they will be able to \nclaim some of the pot of money.\n  Again, like the medical liability issue, we need to, in a rational \nand balanced way, fix the system. It is a system that has gone awry \nbecause of certain incentives. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nOrrin Hatch, has done a fantastic job and said let's get everybody \ntogether, from the left, right, Democrat, Republican, union, nonunion; \nlet's all get together--business, workers, patients, consumers--and \ndevelop legislation, work through the committee. That is the first \nstep. Now we need to take that legislation, improve it, strengthen it, \neducate this body broadly.\n  People will soon realize it is health care in many ways but it is \nalso a jobs and stimulus package. Since the early 1980s, 70 good-sized \ncompanies have gone bankrupt because of the liability that has been \nthrust upon them. Some OK, probably, but a lot not OK. A lot has been \nirrational that has been thrust upon them, and they have gone out of \nbusiness through nothing intentional, because of the way the \nlegislation is written. Of those 70 companies over the last 20 years, a \nthird of them have been in just the last 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  So the problem is getting worse as we go forward, although the \nestimates of the cost of asbestos with the runaway lawsuits vary, and \nthey are very rough. I recall one figure, that over 420,000 jobs have \ndisappeared because of these inequities associated with asbestos and \nthe legislation that was originally written.\n\n  It is a health issue, it is an equity issue, a fairness issue, and \nalso a jobs issue. If we fix the problem, and fix it appropriately, we \nare going to have jobs actually created in the future. As people spend \nmore time with this legislation, they will understand that.\n  Class action litigation, although I don't know exactly when we will \naddress it in the Senate, is an issue we will address on the floor of \nthe Senate. Frivolous lawsuits are clogging the system. When they clog \nthe system and we have this use of resources, it is dollar resources, \nit is also person power resources. When we use the resources in a \nwasteful way, we cannot use the resources in a way that is productive, \nthat will help individuals in whatever realm of life. The class action \nsuits have clearly gotten to that point with frivolity, the waste, the \nunnecessary suits. That is something we on this floor sometime in the \nnext several weeks will address.\n  If we have the frivolous lawsuits, it is obvious they clog the \nsystem. They stifle innovation, they stifle creativity, they cost jobs, \nand they can even endanger the lives of our fellow citizens--all of \nthat, as we talk about the proposal which is before the Senate, a \nbipartisan proposal that can bring more order and efficiency to the \nsystem. This will become more obvious to both colleagues who do not \nfocus on this and also to the American people.\n  We can bring order, we can bring efficiency, and we can bring balance \nand rationality with the best use of resources to the system.\n  I add that we will be able to protect Americans listening right now, \nAmericans and American consumers, from unscrupulous and exploitative \nlitigators who are out there in many ways grubbing for that dollar to \ntake advantage of the system.\n  Environmental concerns. We had the opportunity to meet with the \nPresident this week, and we talked about a whole range of issues, \nstarting with Iraq and the security issues, moving quickly to the \nimportance of jobs and the economy, and talking about several of the \nissues I mentioned, but very early coming to a range or group of \nenvironmental issues.\n  It is very obvious that in the West, the long drought and dry timber \nhave created a dangerous situation, a perilous situation. We see on \ntelevision and hear from those Senators who represent the States, when \nyou fly over the country, you foresee the mammoth fires that can start \nwith just a single spark. Overnight they threaten property, threaten \ncommunities, and threaten lives.\n  The President of the United States, President Bush, has proposed \nlegislation that will reduce the danger of fire. How? By sensibly and \nrationally managing forests with a better balance of forests--\nconservation on the one hand and citizen safety on the other.\n  I have to mention that tax issues will likely come up in the next \nseveral months. People clearly on our side believe strongly we need to \nmake the tax relief that the President has put on the table permanent \nso people can plan for the future, so citizens can have more money--or \nat least do not increase taxes. Citizens will have more money\n\n[[Page S11154]]\n\nto be able to spend and invest the way they wish rather than send it to \nWashington, DC, and let Washington, DC, decide how to spend that money. \nThat does give economic stimulus and creates jobs.\n  We will most likely examine in the Senate, under the leadership of \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, the marriage tax penalty. Once \nagain, the complexities of the Tax Code, combined with peculiarities of \nour budget laws, have created a tax, a penalty for people who are \nmarried. Maybe a teacher and a policeman are married and they are \npaying more if they are married than if they were not married. It does \nnot make sense. People do not understand it. We know these couples have \nbeen unfairly taxed. We will argue that it is unfair. I hope this \ninequity that we have made some progress in addressing in the past we \ncan really permanently erase.\n\n  In the area of family--partial-birth abortion is something we have \ndebated on this floor. We passed it in this body. It was vetoed by \nPresident Clinton in the past. We have passed it in the body, and the \nHouse has passed it in the past. Now we have to pull those two together \nin conference. The problem is, we can't appoint and can't fulfill \nappointment of the conferees until we have another debate on the floor \nof the Senate. I am working very hard to get that scheduled so we can \ngo to conference, have a bill and send it to the President so we can \nfinally, finally ban partial-birth abortion. We don't need to get into \nthe issue right now, but it has been described by Members on both sides \nof the aisle as close to infanticide as you can get. Yet we still have \nnot been able to come to agreement on both sides of the aisle about the \nconferees, go to conference, and send the bill to the President. We are \ngoing to bring this to closure sometime here in the next several weeks.\n  Senator Mike DeWine from Ohio and Senator Lindsey Graham--I can't \ncome to this floor without them saying, What about our Unborn Victims \nof Violence Act? It is something we debated on this floor, we made the \ncase for, and now is the time for us to complete our legislative \nactivity so we truly can protect unborn victims of violence.\n  All of this is ambitious, but it is time to be bold and it is time to \nbe ambitious. I think this body demonstrated this again for the most \npart in a bipartisan way over the last several months. But each of \nthese issues that I have mentioned will be addressed on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Yesterday an event happened. Again, I don't need to rehash that \ntoday, but the withdrawal of Miguel Estrada's nomination yesterday was \na tragedy. It was a sad day for this body. At the end of the day I had \nthe opportunity to call and talk to Miguel Estrada, and there is just \nsimply nobody to my mind who is better qualified for the position for \nwhich he was nominated and who was more unjustly treated by this body.\n  These blocked judicial nominations are maybe the biggest challenges \nwe have before us--unprecedented filibusters, unprecedented partisan \nfilibusters on the floor of this Senate are unpardonable, I believe.\n  We are going to stay focused. We are going to do our very best to \neducate, to break these filibusters. I think one day the consequences \nof the minority blocking highly qualified nominees without good reason \nwill come home to roost.\n  Other issues, reauthorization issues, and then I will close. I know \nit is late on this afternoon and we need to move on. But \nreauthorization I at least wanted to mention. There are many so I don't \nwant to mention them all, but reauthorization of welfare, of the \nhighway bill--again, a lot of discussion this week as we look forward \nto addressing these sorts of issues in the coming weeks.\n  There are a lot of opportunities. It is a huge responsibility for \neach of us in the coming weeks. But I am absolutely confident that by \npulling together, by working as a team, by working across the aisle, we \nwill be able to advance the mission I mentioned of moving America \nforward and to do it in a way that celebrates the freedoms we all \nenjoy.\n  We will be able to make meaningful progress in our Nation's economic \nlife. We will be able to make meaningful progress in our Nation's moral \nlife. We will be able to make meaningful progress in our Nation's civic \nlife.\n  We are going to have a very busy and we are going to have a very \nproductive fall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11154-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SECTION 189 OF THE FAA CONFERENCE REPORT, H.R. 2115\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I would like to engage the Senator from Mississippi in a \ncolloquy regarding section 189 of the conference report in order to \nclarify the intent of the conferees.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy with the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. It is my understanding that this section is a very \nlimited, temporary funding restriction that will not affect noise \nmitigation funding in any significant way. Federal airport improvement \nprogram monies from the ``Noise set aside'' have not normally supported \nnoise mitigation projects below a Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL) \nof less than 65. This is because under the FAA's system of ranking \nprojects for the use of the noise set aside, projects to reduce higher \nlevels of noise having funding priority and projects below 65 DNL have \nnot normally ranked high enough to get such funding. I further \nunderstand that nothing in this section or any other provision of the \nFAA conference report would prohibit an airport from using either \npassenger facility charges, PFC, or other locally generated monies to \nfund noise mitigation projects below a DNL of 65. It is also my \nunderstanding that the provision is not intended to change the FAA's \ncurrent approach of not disapproving an airport's entire part 150 noise \nprogram, where there is only a portion or portions of the program that \nare problematic. The FAA would continue to be able to disapprove \nportions of a port 150 program, while approving other portions, as they \ndo today. Furthermore, the provision would not affect noise set-aside \nfunding that would not require part 150 approval, such as school \nsoundproofing or noise mitigation for an airport expansion project in \nan FAA environmental record of decision.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator is correct. The intent of this provision is a \nnarrow one and does not affect the use of non-AIP funds by any airport. \nNothing in this section or any other provision of the FAA conference \nreport would prohibit an airport from using either passenger facility \ncharges, PFC, or other locally generated monies to fund noise \nmitigation projects below a DNL of less than 65. It is my understanding \nthat the FAA agrees with this interpretation of the effect of the \nprovision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11154-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN.

Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues a new and innovative program created by the Alliance for \nJustice called Coaches Against Gun Violence.\n  This program asks high school coaches to dedicate one game or event \neach year to gun violence prevention. The dedication can take a variety \nof forms, including inviting a local speaker to talk about gun \nviolence, recognizing a victim or his or her family, having a school \nassembly devoted to the issue, or distributing ribbons in remembrance \nof lives lost to gun violence.\n  Each year, millions of students take part in athletic activities. \nCoaches are leaders and mentors and have an enormous impact on the \nlives of many of their players. Harnessing this influence to educate \nstudents about the deadly effects of gun violence is an excellent idea.\n  According to statistics compiled by the Alliance for Justice, there \nare an estimated 3,400 firearm-related injuries and 1,000 deaths each \nyear in Michigan. In 2000 alone, 133 Michiganders under the age of 20 \nwere killed in incidents of gun violence, and 3,894 people under 20 \nyears old were killed in firearm-related incidents in the United \nStates. These statistics are sobering. The Coaches Against Gun Violence \nProgram is a\n\n[[Page S11155]]\n\ncreative approach to educating young people about the deadly effects of \ngun violence and I hope that coaches across the country will consider \nthis program for their school communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to encourage coaches in their home States to \njoin the Coaches Against Gun Violence, and I commend the Alliance for \nJustice for its efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11155-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PROTECT HOME HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, home health care is an important part of \nMedicare in which seniors and the disabled can get basic nursing and \ntherapy care in their home. I rise today to urge the Senate Medicare \nconferees to stand firm against provisions in the House passed \nprescription drug and Medicare reform bill, H.R. 1, that would make \nfurther cuts in the Medicare home health benefit by reducing the home \nhealth inflation update and imposing a new copayment on home health \nbeneficiaries.\n  Home health care is convenient, but much more importantly, patients \nlove it. I have seen this first hand as I have had the privilege of \nvisiting with many of my constituents who rely on this benefit. They \nlove home health care because it is the key to fulfilling what is \nvirtually a universal desire among seniors and those with \ndisabilities--to remain independent and within the comfort of their own \nhomes despite their health problems.\n  Since the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, BBA, no other \ngroup of Medicare patients and providers have endured as many \ndifficulties. This is a big claim, given the many horror stories we've \nheard about the Balanced Budget Act. But absolutely nobody has suffered \nlike home health patients and home health agencies. True reform means \nmore than just ratcheting down payments to providers and services to \npatients.\n  Since 1997 Medicare home health spending has been reduced by over 40 \npercent and the number of beneficiaries by 1.3 million, or about a \nthird. Forty percent of the agencies in my State have closed down or \nquit serving Medicare patients.\n  In a move to modernize the Medicare program, Congress eliminated the \nhome health copay in 1972 to encourage the provision of health care in \nthe home rather than in more costly institutions. With all the cuts in \nhome health care that have occurred since 1997--including the loss of \nvenipunc- \nture, blood drawing, as a qualifying service, the imposition of per \nbeneficiary limits under the interim payment system, cuts in the market \nbasket inflation update, a ``15 percent'' cut in October of last year, \nand the loss of the 10 percent rural add on in April of this year--\nMedPAC has recently confirmed an alarming trend toward greater use of \nnursing home care. The reimposition of a home health copayment now \nwould be a step backward that would exacerbate this recent trend.\n  Home health beneficiaries already must pay the Part B deductible and \na 20 percent copay for preparation of a home health plan of care and \nongoing home health care oversight by a physician. Over half of home \nhealth patients come directly from the hospital and must pay the Part A \ndeductible of over $800 in order to receive the home health benefit. \nOften they and their families must pay out of pocket for personal care \nservices to assist with activities of daily living.\n  Our Nation's dedicated home health providers--and you know they are \ndedicated if they have stuck with it through the difficulties of the \nlast few years--deserve to be left alone and given a rest. They, and \nthe patients they serve, deserve to be left alone to recover from the \npost-BBA chaos. They deserve to be left alone in order to adjust to a \nnew home health payment system.\n  In passing the Senate prescription drug and Medicare reform \nlegislation, S. 1, the Senate wisely chose to forgo further cuts in the \nhome health benefit. I urge my colleagues on the Medicare conference \ncommittee to oppose the provisions in H.R. 1 that would further cut and \ndestabilize the home health benefit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11155-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in San Diego, \nCA. On September 24, 2002, two teenagers attacked an immigrant, Jose \nLuis Cisneros, that left him in a coma for several days and with head \nand facial injuries. The pair were charged with hate crimes. According \nto the Deputy District Attorney, they went looking for ``beaners'' to \nbeat and rob and went to a spot where they knew they could find \nundocumented immigrants.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11155-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN RECOGNITION OF THE 160TH ANNIVERSARY OF B'NAI B'RITH\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to call my colleagues' \nattention to a very significant milestone for our nation's oldest and \none of the largest service organizations, B'nai B'rith, which was \nfounded on New York City's lower east side in October 1843. Its name, \nmeaning ``Children of the Covenant,'' reflects a commitment to unify \nJewish people everywhere in service to their community and the world. \nOn September 7th, in my home state of Michigan, the Great Lakes Region \nof this great organization will celebrate the B'nai B'rith anniversary \nand mark its many achievements in helping others, advocating freedom \nand democracy, and combating racism and bigotry.\n  Over the years, B'nai B'rith has been steadfast in meeting challenges \non many fronts. Motivated in part by core Jewish values such as loving-\nkindness to others and peace and justice in the world, it has acted on \na fundamental belief that all people should be treated with dignity and \nrespect. Its members have answered the call to stand against racism, \npersecution, and violence against Jews and others, while working to \nprotect basic human rights and preserve justice. B'nai B'rith has taken \na leadership role during pivotal times in our history. Its members have \nworked to steer our nation on the right path to the benefit of all \nAmericans. They opposed General Ulysses Grant during the Civil War when \nhe attempted to expel Jews from several states. They urged President \nTheodore Roosevelt to take action in 1903 with the Czar of Russia to \ndenounce anti-Semitic violence. And in 1913 after the lynching of B'nai \nB'rith member Leo Frank in Atlanta, B'nai B'rith leaders were moved to \norganize the Anti-Defamation League to battle bigotry.\n  Now as an international organization, B'nai B'rith is represented in \n58 countries around the world. It has a full-time presence at the \nUnited Nations and the European Union in Brussels. It has the proud \nhistory of having initiated many programs and services, from disaster \nrelief, to feeding the hungry, to medical research, to housing for the \nlow-income elderly, to Jewish education, to a premier Youth \nOrganization and an effective campus outreach for thousands and \nthousands of Jewish college students. B'nai B'rith helped bring war \ncriminals to justice, has worked tirelessly for Jewish security around \nthe world, and has helped to strengthen the land of Israel. After more \nthan a century and a half of innovation and activism, B'nai B'rith is \nstronger than ever and continues to make an important and meaningful \ncontribution around the world.\n  B'nai B'rith can be proud of its dedication to preserve Jewish \nheritage and promote values that inspire individuals to act in goodwill \nand to shape their communities for the betterment of all. We as a \nnation have benefitted from their extraordinary contributions both here \nand abroad, and I am sure that my Senate colleagues join me in paying \ntribute to B'nai B'rith for 160 years of superior performance in \nserving the needs of generations of Americans and people of nations \naround the world.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11156-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11156]]\n                  100TH ANNIVERSARY OF TEAMSTERS UNION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a special honor to take this \nopportunity to congratulate the Teamsters Union on the 100th \nanniversary of their formation. On that historic occasion a century \nago, the merger of two smaller unions of local delivery men using \nvehicles drawn by teams of horses launched the extraordinary union we \nknow today as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n  In those early days, such workers were often fired for union \nactivity, and some were even killed. But the Teamsters persevered and \nbegan to thrive. By the 1930s, inter-city truck drivers had become the \npredominant members of the union, and they fought hard for legal \nprotections, especially the National Labor Relations Act and basic laws \nsetting minimum wages and maximum work hours for their work.\n  In World War II, the Teamsters were a key part of the war effort. \nThey served with great courage in the armed forces. They vigorously \npromoted war bonds and the collection of scrap metal and rubber.\n  When the war was won, they came home and took up the great cause of \nsocial justice in communities across the land, fighting for civil \nrights and striving to see that America's workers received their fair \nshare of the Nation's amazing post-war prosperity.\n  Now, on this remarkable centennial, the Teamsters are one of the \nNation's largest, most vital and most effective unions. They are at the \nforefront of ongoing major battles for the fundamental rights and \ndignity of all workers, especially on key issues such as jobs, civil \nrights, and worker health and safety.

JAMES S. SEIDEL\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the children of the United States \nlost a great champion on July 25 when Dr. James. S. Seidel died at the \nage of 60. Dr. Seidel was a professor of pediatrics at the University \nof California at Los Angeles School of Medicine and was chief of the \nDivision of General and Emergency Pediatrics at Harbor-UCLA Medical \nCenter.\n  He was an excellent teacher and researcher, but he was also a \ntenacious advocate for children. Through his students, residents, and \nfellows, he leaves behind a legacy of energetic inquiry and dedicated \nservice to children and their families. Through his advocacy work, he \nleaves behind a much improved system of care, particularly emergency \ncare, for children. While we will all miss the man, we will continue to \nbenefit from his work.\n  A major concern of Dr. Seidel, and a concern I share, was the \nchallenge our Emergency Medical Services system faces in appropriately \ncaring for the emergency needs of children. The system responds well to \nadult needs but is not always so successful in meeting the needs of \nchildren. He was a driving force behind the Emergency Departments \nApproved for Pediatrics, EDAP, system in California, but he also \nrecognized that a national problem such as this required national \nsupport if it was to be solved. Along with my good friend, Dr. Calvin \nSia, and a small group of pediatric emergency care advocates, Dr. \nSeidel worked with Senators Hatch, Weiker, and myself to help us enact \nin 1984 the Emergency Medical Services for Children, EMSC, program. \nThis modest program has made a tremendous difference in the lives of \nmany children and their families in every State and Territory. Dr. \nSeidel was a driving force in shaping the direction of the EMSC \nprogram, and was one of the program's first grantees. He maintained his \ninterest and advocacy as the program matured. There is almost nothing \nin EMSC that was not influenced by Dr. Seidel. Dr. Sia received the \nfirst National Heroes Award for Lifetime Achievement in emergency \nmedical services for children. In 2000, Dr. Seidel received the second. \nIt was an honor well deserved.\n  In 1991, Dr. Seidel edited Emergency Medical Services for Children: A \nReport to the Nation. He asked me to write the Foreword. In it, I said, \n``History has repeatedly shown that persistence is most often the key \nto success. We must persist in our advocacy for those most vulnerable \nchildren of all: the ill and the injured.'' Dr. Seidel's life is a \ntestimony as to how persistence will lead to success. We still have a \nlong way to go, but we are much further down the road thanks to \nremarkable people such as James S. Seidel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11156-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DOUGLAS D. FARIS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I pay tribute today to a \ndedicated and respected steward of our National Park system, Douglas D. \nFaris, superintendent of the C & O Canal National Historical Park. Doug \nis retiring after a long and distinguished career in the National Park \nService and I thank him for his outstanding achievements in managing \nand protecting the C & O Canal and other units of our National Park \nsystem over the past three decades.\n  Throughout his career in public service, Doug Faris has distinguished \nhimself as a leader in natural and cultural resource planning, \nmanagement and conservation. Beginning as a seasonal employee at \nYellowstone National Park in 1970, Doug quickly advanced to top \nplanning positions at the Park Service's Denver Service Center, the \nLowell, MA, field office, and the Southwest Regional office, where he \nmade substantial contributions to developing new park units, improving \npark facilities, and protecting park resources. In 1989, he was \nselected as Associate Regional Director of the Southwest Region and \nworked for 6 years building partnerships with Native American leaders \nand other organizations, developing highly professional work forces, \nsupervising special resource studies, and working with the Congress.\n  I came to know Doug shortly after he was appointed Superintendent of \nthe C & O Canal National Historical Park in 1994 and, over the past 9 \nyears, have had the opportunity and privilege to work closely with him \non a number of initiatives. I saw first hand the tremendous leadership \nhe provided in repairing and reopening the Park after two floods \ncompletely destroyed portions of the Canal and many historic \nstructures, picnic areas, and other park facilities during the winter \nof 1995-1996. Doug worked tirelessly to develop a strategic plan for \nrestoring the park and to mobilize and coordinate the work of hundreds \nof volunteers and organizations that came to the aid of the Park. \nThanks to his efforts, more than $25 million in public and private \nfunds were raised to repair the damages and reopen the park. Likewise, \nDoug spearheaded efforts to re-water the Canal at its Cumberland, MD, \nterminus, stabilize the historic Monocacy Aqueduct, and construct new \nvisitor facilities. Under his leadership, new partnerships were formed \nwith organizations and communities along the Canal, an Historic Leasing \nProgram was implemented to help repair and protect the historic \nlockhouses and other dwellings in the Park; and many improvements have \nbeen made to the C & O Canal.\n  The efforts of Doug Faris throughout his career in the National Park \nService have had a lasting effect not only on the parks and National \nPark system he has worked to protect, but on the people with whom he \nhas come in contact. He has earned the respect and admiration of his \ncolleagues in the Park Service as well as the visitors and citizens in \nthe local communities surrounding the parks. It is my firm conviction \nthat public service is one of the most honorable callings, one that \ndemands the very best, most dedicated efforts of those who have the \nopportunity to serve their fellow citizens and country. Throughout his \ncareer, Doug has exemplified a steadfast commitment to meeting this \ndemand. I want to extend my personal congratulations and thanks for his \nmany years of hard work and dedication to the principal conservation \nmission of the National Park Service and join with his friends and \ncoworkers in wishing him and his family well in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11156-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11156-S11157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE ANTHONY SBONA\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in memory of a \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S11157]]\n\npublic servant and a good friend, the Honorable Anthony ``Buddy'' \nSbona, of Middletown, CT, who passed away on August 4, at the age of \n73.\n  Buddy Sbona served three terms as the mayor of Middletown from 1970 \nto 1975, and to this day, he remains one of the most popular public \nfigures that city has ever seen. During his term as mayor, Buddy Sbona \nestablished Middletown's largest industrial park in the Westfield area. \nHe also established the first full-time attorney's office in the city. \nFrom 1958 to 1961, Buddy Sbona served three terms on Middletown's \nCommon Council, and after he left the mayor's office, he spent the next \n20 years as Middletown's Town Clerk.\n  Buddy Sbona was a Republican mayor in a mostly Democratic town. But \nhis appeal transcended party lines. Throughout his career, he was \nrespected and admired by Democrats and Republicans alike--not merely as \nan elected official, but as a good, honest, and decent human being. His \nwarm and outgoing personality and his enduring friendship were \nlegendary. Even if you didn't always agree with Buddy Sbona's views, it \nwas virtually impossible not to like him.\n  At 5 foot 5, you might think that Buddy Sbona could walk through City \nHall practically unnoticed. But his booming voice, and his tremendous \nenthusiasm, announced to anyone within earshot that Buddy was in the \nbuilding, ready to work hard on behalf of the people of Middletown.\n  Those who worked with Buddy Sbona remember him as a man with real \npassion for his work, a man who would come to the office each day \nexcited to serve his constituents. That infectious attitude was an \ninspiration to his staff members, some of whom went on to hold public \noffice themselves. During his later years, and even after he left \noffice, he was an invaluable mentor to newcomers to public service, \nsharing with them his immense wealth of knowledge about Middletown's \nhistory, its politics, and its government.\n  Outside of the office, Buddy Sbona was a devoted family man who could \noften be spotted at his son's high school football games at Palmer \nField. He was also an active member of St. Sebastian's Church and was \nthe chairman of the Feast of St. Sebastian Committee for a decade.\n  It is a testimony to how hard Buddy Sbona worked, and how many lives \nhe touched, that on Friday, August 8, all nonemergency city workers in \nMiddletown were given the morning off to attend his funeral. Nearly 30 \nyears after he left the mayor's office, the city of Middletown shut \nitself down to pay its respects to Buddy Sbona.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to the people of Middletown, to \nBuddy's wife Connie, to their sons William and Mark, to the entire \nSbona family, and to the countless others whose lives were enriched by \nBuddy Sbona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11157-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING STAFF SERGEANT MARK LAWTON\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of our \nfallen heroes of my State and this great Nation. SSG Mark A. Lawton was \nkilled in action while serving our country in support of Operation \nIraqi Freedom.\n  Sergeant Lawton served honorably with the 244th Engineer Battalion, \nU.S. Army Reserve of Grand Junction, CO. He was one of the many \ncitizens soldiers who took up the charge and left family and career \nwhen asked to defend the principles of freedom and democracy. Like all \nreservists and National Guard members, he balanced his responsibilities \nto his country with those to all that cared for and depended on him.\n  Staff Sergeant Lawton's unit was activated in February and are \nresponsible for constructing roads and bridges, improving irrigation \nand building playgrounds for the children of Iraq. The 244th is \ncreating a better place for Iraqis, and Sergeant Lawton helped raise \nthe quality of life. Colorado is proud of the actions of Sergeant \nLawton, the 244th and all of our servicemen and women serving during \nthis operation.\n  Staff Sergeant Lawton lived in Hayden, CO, with his wife, Sherri, and \ntwo sons, Dustin and Tanner.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to posthumously thank Staff Sergeant \nLawton for his service and ultimate sacrifice to this great Nation and \napplaud him as a hero to Colorado and all of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/05/senate-section/article/S11157-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11157-S11158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:55 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ndisagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 6).

A bill to make it a criminal act to willfully use a weapon, \nexplosive, chemical weapon, or nuclear or radioactive material with the \nintent to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person while on \nboard a passenger vessel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ncolleague Senator Specter, the ``Reducing Crime and Terrorism at \nAmerica's Seaports Act of 2003.'' About a year ago, the Independent \nTask Force on Homeland Security Imperatives, co-chaired by former \nSenators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman and sponsored by the Council on \nForeign Relations, released its report in which it concluded that \n``America remains dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a \ncatastrophic attack on U.S. soil.'' The report received considerable \nmedia fanfare and inspired eloquent proclamations about the need to \nstrengthen America's domestic security agenda--but sadly, in the \nensuing months, we have done little to protect one of the key \nvulnerabilities identified by the task force, this nation's seaports.\n  The 361 seaports in the United States serve essential national \ninterests by facilitating the flow of trade and the movement of cruise \npassengers, as well as supporting the effective and safe deployment of \nU.S. Armed Forces. Yet, our attention to the security needs of seaport \nfacilities and other marine areas, which cover some 3.5 million square \nmiles of ocean area and 95,000 miles of coastline, has been \ninadequate--especially when you consider the sheer volume of traffic \nthat moves through our seaports and along our waterways each year.\n  Annually, U.S. seaports handle more than 141 million ferry and cruise \nship passengers and unfathomable amounts of waterborne commerce, more \nthan 2 billion tons of domestic and international freight and 3 billion \ntons of oil. Each year, millions of truck-size cargo containers are \noff-loaded onto U.S. docks--yet, as the Hart-Rudman Report noted, \n``only the tiniest percentage of [these] containers . . .  are subject \nto examination--and a weapon of mass destruction could well be hidden \namong this cargo.'' Indeed, only about 2 percent of the nearly 6 \nmillion cargo containers that pass through the U.S. are inspected each \nyear--and, according to some expert reports, only 30 percent of that \ncargo contains material that matches the cargo manifest.\n  The 2002 Hart-Rudman Report was both timely and important in that it \nshed new light on these glaring vulnerabilities and, in the process, \nre-energized the debate surrounding America's national security needs. \nHowever, the report's findings were hardly new. Two years earlier, the\n\n[[Page S11163]]\n\nInteragency Commission on Crime and Security at U.S. Seaports, a blue-\nribbon government panel, had similarly noted that seaports and the \n``maritime mode'' were especially vulnerable and that they did ``not \nexhibit a substantial security or anti-terrorism profile, particularly \nwhen compared with the emphasis commercial aviation places on these \nactivities.'' The Interagency Commission concluded that ``terrorism, \nserious crime and inadequate cargo control are the most obvious threat \nvectors in seaports today.''\n  With that in mind, last Congress, Senator Specter and I introduced \nlegislation designed to update Federal law to address critical security \nissues at U.S. seaports. We have re-tooled and re-focused that \nlegislation, making important improvements and taking account of recent \nchanges in the law. Today, we re-introduce the ``Reducing Crime and \nTerrorism at America's Seaports Act of 2003,'' which addresses all \nthree threats identified by the Interagency Commission--terrorism, \nserious crime and inadequate cargo control.\n  Here is a summary of some of the pressing vulnerabilities that the \nlegislation would address directly: First, the Interagency Commission \nconcluded that ``control of access to the seaport or sensitive areas \nwithin the seaports'' poses one of the greatest potential threats to \nport security. Such unauthorized access continues and exposes the \nnation's seaports, and the communities that surround them, to acts of \nterrorism, sabotage or theft. In response, the Biden-Specter Bill would \ndouble the maximum term of imprisonment for anyone who fraudulently \ngains access to a seaport or waterfront.\n  Second, an estimated 95 percent of the cargo shipped to the U.S. from \nforeign countries, other than Canada and Mexico, arrives through out \nseaports. Accordingly, the Interagency Commission found that this \nenormous flow of goods through U.S. ports provides a tempting target \nfor terrorists and others to smuggle illicit cargo into the country, \nwhile also making ``our ports potential targets for terrorist \nattacks,'' In addition, the smuggling of non-dangerous, but illicit, \ncargo may be used to finance terrorism. Despite the gravity of the \nthreat, we continue to operate in an environment in which terrorists \nand criminals can evade detection by underreporting and misreporting \nthe content of cargo. In one review by the U.S. Customs Service, nearly \n20 percent of the carrier arrivals in the sample were discrepant, i.e., \ncarried more or fewer containers than were listed on the manifest. In \nan earlier review, Customs found a 53 percent discrepant rate. Even \nwhere this improperly-reported cargo is legitimate, it needlessly \ndiverts precious resources and attention away from the job of detecting \nterrorists and serious criminals. To deter this problem, the Biden-\nSpecter Bill would increase penalties for noncompliance with certain \nmanifest reporting and record-keeping requirements, including \ninformation regarding the content of cargo containers and the country \nfrom which the shipments originated.\n  Third, the Coast Guard is the main Federal agency responsible for law \nenforcement at sea. Yet, its ability to force a vessel to stop or be \nboarded is limited. While the Coast Guard has the authority to use \nwhatever force is reasonably necessary, a vessel operator's refusal to \nstop is not currently a crime. The Biden-Specter Bill would make it a \ncrime for a vessel operator to fail to slow or stop a ship once ordered \nto do so by a federal law enforcement officer; for any person on board \na vessel to impede boarding or other law enforcement action authorized \nby Federal law; or for any person on board a vessel to provide false \ninformation to a federal law enforcement officer.\n  Fourth, The Coast Guard maintains over 50,000 navigational aids on \nmore than 25,000 miles of waterways. These aids, which are relied upon \nby all commercial, military and recreational mariners, are critical for \nsafe navigation by commercial and military vessels. Accordingly, they \nare inviting targets for terrorists. The Biden-Specter Bill would make \nit a crime to endanger the safe navigation of a ship by damaging any \nmaritime navigational aid maintained by the Coast Guard; place in the \nwaters anything which is likely to damage a vessel or its cargo, \ninterfere with a vessel's safe navigation, or interfere with maritime \ncommerce; or dump a hazardous substance into U.S. waters, with the \nintent to endanger human life or welfare.\n  Fifth, each year, thousands of ships, including cruise ships, whose \nnumbers have swelled enormously over the last half century, enter and \nleave the U.S. through seaports, Smugglers and terrorists exploit this \nmassive flow of maritime traffic to transport dangerous materials and \ndangerous people into this country. The Biden-Specter Bill would make \nit a crime to use a vessel to smuggle into the United States either a \nterrorist or any explosive or other dangerous material for use in \ncommitting a terrorist act.\n\n  Sixth, under current Federal law, it is a crime to destroy an \naircraft or aircraft facilities. Incredibly, there are no equivalent \nFederal prohibitions in the maritime context. Given the magnitude of \nthe threat against America's seaports, we should provide the same \nprotection to seaports that we do for airports. The Biden-Specter Bill \nwould make it a crime to damage or destroy any part of a ship, a \nmaritime facility, or anything used to load or unload cargo and \npassengers; commit a violent assault on anyone at a maritime facility; \nor knowingly communicate a hoax in a way which endangers the safety of \na vessel.\n  Seventh, according to the Interagency Commission, ``at many seaports, \nthe carrying of firearms is not restricted, and thus internal \nconspirators and other criminals are allowed armed access to cargo \nvessels and cruise line terminals.'' Currently, Federal law prohibits \ncarrying firearms into airports, which is a sensible step to protect \nagainst possible terrorist attacks or other criminal activity. We \nshould provide the same protections currently afforded to airports to \nour seaports and passenger vessels. The Biden-Specter Bill would \nprohibit the carrying of a dangerous weapon, including a firearm or \nexplosive, at a seaport or on board a vessel.\n  Eighth, as a consequence of the vast amount of waterborne commerce, \ncargo theft has become a major problem. Yet, there is no national data \ncollection and reporting system that captures the magnitude of serious \ncrime at seaports. Given the importance of free-flowing commerce to our \nnation's economy and the reported trafficking and sale of contraband to \nfiance terrorist activity, it is especially important that we work to \nassess and correct the problem. The Biden-Specter Bill would require \nthe reporting of cargo theft offenses. It would also instruct the \nAttorney General to create a database containing the reported \ninformation, which would be made available to appropriate governmental \nofficials while respecting important privacy protections. Importantly, \norganizations like the American Institute of Marine Underwriters and \nthe Inland Marine Underwriters Association have specifically expressed \ntheir strong support for this provision.\n  And, ninth, the Interagency Commission concluded that existing laws \nare not stiff enough to stop certain crimes, including cargo theft, at \nseaports. The Biden-Specter Bill would increase the maximum term of \nimprisonment for low-level thefts of interstate or foreign shipments \nfrom 1 year to 3 years and expand the statute to outlaw theft of goods \nfrom trailers, cargo containers, warehouses, and similar venues. The \nAmerican Institute of Marine Underwriters and the Inland Marine \nUnderwriters Association also have expressed strong support for this \nprovision.\n  This comprehensive anti-crime and anti-terrorism legislation is the \nproduct of informal collaborations with ports, industry and labor \ngroups, as well as interested federal agencies. As a result of the \ncontributions by these groups, we believe that we have developed a \nstrong, bipartisan bill that, once passed, will significantly improve \nfederal criminal law; expand the array of tools available to \ninvestigators and prosecutors; and ensure that federal resources are \nappropriately invested.\n  We are delighted to have the support of organizations, like the \nAmerican Association of Port Authorities (AAPA), with special knowledge \nand expertise in seaport and cargo security. In fact, the AAPA, which \nrepresents more than 150 public port authorities in the United States, \nCanada, the Caribbean and Latin America, has sent me a strong letter \nendorsing the legislation--a copy of which will appear in the record at \nthe end of my statement.\n\n[[Page S11164]]\n\n  In closing, in the aftermath of September 11th and given the ongoing \nand escalating terrorism perpetrated around the globe, surely we \nrecognize that the conclusions contained in the Hart-Rudman Report were \nnot mere hyperbole--but a clarion call for action. Needless to say, a \nterrorist attack against any one of this Nation's seaports would not \nonly jeopardize human life, but could also bring the otherwise free \nflow of commerce to a screeching halt--exacting a heft toll on the U.S. \neconomy, world shipping, and international trade. That impact could be \nboth devastating and far-reaching, and that is not even considering the \neffect of America's military readiness which depends on quick access to \ncertain strategic ports in order to ensure effective mobilization and \ndeployment of U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Given the threat, we must undertake to do all that we reasonably can \nto discourage and/or frustrate such an attack. This legislation, while \nnot a cure-all, is an important step in the right direction. I implore \nmy colleagues to join our effort and move quickly to enact this bill \ninto law. America will be better for it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nthe letter from AAPA be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

As you \n     know, one portion that was left out of the final bill was the \n     section on criminal penalties. The ``Reducing Crime and \n     Terrorism at American's Seaports Act of 2003,'' that you plan \n     to introduce soon, addresses the need to broaden the federal \n     crime statute and stiffen the penalties for these crimes at \n     seaports.\n       AAPA endorses this bill and encourages its strong \n     consideration. It provides increased penalties for entry by \n     false pretense to a port; failure to ``heave to,'' use of a \n     dangerous weapon or explosive on a passenger vessel, criminal \n     sanctions for violence against maritime navigation, penalties \n     for transporting dangerous materials and terrorists; makes \n     destruction or interference with vessels or maritime \n     facilities a crime, limits carrying a weapon or explosive on \n     a port, mandates cargo theft data collection, expands the law \n     regarding theft of interstate shipments, and increases \n     penalties for noncompliance with manifest requirements.\n       We commend your leadership on this critical issue and look \n     forward to working with your staff as this bill progresses to \n     ensure the final law works well in the maritime environment \n     and further enhances port and maritime security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Kurt Nagle.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 1588. A bill to authorize the National Institute of Environmental \nHealth Sciences to develop multidisciplinary research centers regarding \nwomen's health and disease prevention and conduct and coordinate a \nresearch program on hormone disruption, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nEnvironmental Health Research Act. Science has long since shown that \nthe environment plays an important role in an individual's health. We \nhave made the correlation between clean drinking water and a person's \nwell being. We know that there is a link between childhood asthma and \nunclean air. Through scientific research we have been able to shed \nlight on these findings, and as a society we are healthier form knowing \nhow our environment affects our physical condition, as we are now able \nto take steps to ameliorate our environment so we can improve our \nhealth.\n  With all of the advancements we have made in recent decades, we must \nstill research further, especially in the area of how the environment \naffects women's health. There is evidence that shows that environmental \nfactors contribute to numerous diseases in women. For example, there \nare synthetic chemicals in numerous regularly used pesticides and \nnatural compounds in many plant products in our regular diet that \nproduce compounds that mimic the female hormone estrogen. Many \nscientists believe that these `environmental estrogens'' may block the \nnatural hormone. If this is true, then environmental estrogens may play \na role in diseases such as cancers of the breast, uterus, and ovaries, \nendometriosis, uterine fibroids, and osteoporosis. As we come into \ncontact with environmental estrogens everyday through eating, drinking, \nand breathing, it is very important that we have research dedicated to \ndiscovering how they may affect women's health.\n  In addition, 12 million American kids suffer from developmental, \nlearning, or behavioral disabilities. Attention deficit disorder \naffects three to six percent of our schoolchildren. Research shows that \nexposure to certain environmental factors during pregnancy may increase \nthe risk of disabilities after birth. The research called for by this \nbill would help us to answer the many questions raised by the incidence \nof birth defects in certain environments.\n  One in three women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in \ntheir lives. Uterine fibroids are present in between 20 and 30 percent \nof women over the age of 30. Endometriosis affects an estimated 10 to \n15 percent of pre-menopausal women. Millions of women are affected \nevery year with diseases that are more than likely linked to the \nenvironment. We must further our scientific knowledge in this area. For \nthis reason I ask for your support for the Environmental Health \nResearch Act. Thank you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1588\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Environmental Health \n     Research Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES; \n                   AWARDS FOR DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF \n                   MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH CENTERS REGARDING \n                   WOMEN'S HEALTH AND DISEASE PREVENTION.\n\n       Subpart 12 of part C of title IV of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285l et seq.) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following section:\n\n[[Page S11168]]\n\n   ``multidisciplinary research centers regarding women's health and \n                           disease prevention\n\n       ``Sec. 463B. (a) In General.--The Director of the Institute \n     shall make grants to public or nonprofit private entities for \n     the development and operation of not more than 6 centers \n     whose purpose is conducting multidisciplinary research on \n     environmental factors that may be related to the development \n     of women's health conditions (as defined in section 486). The \n     Director of the Institute shall carry out this section in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Research on \n     Women's Health and with the advisory council for the \n     Institute.\n       ``(b) Research, Training, and Information and Education.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Each center under subsection (a) shall, \n     with respect to the purpose described in such subsection--\n       ``(A) conduct basic and clinical research;\n       ``(B) develop protocols for training physicians, \n     scientists, nurses, and other health and allied health \n     professionals;\n       ``(C) conduct training programs for such individuals;\n       ``(D) develop model continuing education programs for such \n     professionals; and\n       ``(E) disseminate information to such professionals and the \n     public.\n       ``(2) Priority for prevention activities.--In carrying out \n     the activities described in paragraph (1), each center under \n     subsection (a) shall give priority to activities that are \n     directed toward preventing the development in women of the \n     diseases and conditions involved.\n       ``(3) Stipends for training of health professionals.--A \n     center under subsection (a) may use funds under such \n     subsection to provide stipends for health and allied health \n     professionals enrolled in programs described in paragraph \n     (1)(C).\n       ``(c) Collaboration With Community.--Each center under \n     subsection (a) shall establish and maintain ongoing \n     collaborations with community organizations in the geographic \n     area served by the center, including those that represent \n     women with disorders that appear to stem from environmental \n     factors.\n       ``(d) Coordination of Centers; Reports.--The Director of \n     the Institute shall, as appropriate, provide for the \n     coordination of information among centers under subsection \n     (a) and ensure regular communication between such centers.\n       ``(e) Structure of Center.--Each center assisted under \n     subsection (a) shall use the facilities of a single \n     institution, or be formed from a consortium of cooperating \n     institutions, meeting such requirements as may be prescribed \n     by the Director of the Institute.\n       ``(f) Duration of Support.--Support of a center under \n     subsection (a) may be for a period not exceeding 5 years. \n     Such period may be extended for 1 or more additional periods \n     not exceeding 5 years if the operations of such center have \n     been reviewed by an appropriate technical and scientific peer \n     review group established by the Director of the Institute and \n     if such group has recommended to the Director that such \n     period should be extended.\n       ``(g) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this section, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years \n     2004 through 2007.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT TO PROVIDE \n                   FOR RESEARCH ON HORMONE DISRUPTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Many compounds found or introduced into the environment \n     by human activity are capable of disrupting the hormone \n     system of humans and animals. The consequences of such \n     disruption can be profound because of the crucial role \n     hormones play in controlling development. No standardized and \n     validated screens or tests have been developed to routinely \n     and systematically assess chemicals for disruptive effects on \n     hormone systems.\n       (2) In the last 30 years, the United States has experienced \n     an increase in the incidence of such human disorders as \n     childhood cancers, testicular cancer, hypospadias, juvenile \n     diabetes, attention deficit-like hyperactivity disorders, \n     autism, thyroid disorders, and auto-immune disorders. \n     Exposure to hormone-disrupting chemicals may be contributing \n     to these increases. The impact on children's health as a \n     result of prenatal exposures in particular needs further \n     research.\n       (3) In 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention's ``National Report on Human Exposure to \n     Environmental Chemicals'' reported on human exposure to 27 \n     chemicals, and found unexpectedly high levels of certain \n     chemicals used in consumer products. The hazards to humans of \n     these chemicals, singly and in combination, are not well \n     understood.\n       (4) Many wildlife populations have been affected by \n     hormone-disrupting substances, including birds, fish, \n     reptiles, and mammals. The effects vary among species and \n     compounds.\n       (5) The effects in wildlife include thyroid dysfunction, \n     decreased fertility, decreased hatching success, gross birth \n     deformities, metabolic and behavioral abnormalities, \n     demasculinization and feminization of male organisms, \n     deformation and masculinization of female organisms, and \n     compromised immune systems. These effects may signal hazards \n     to human health.\n       (6) Laboratory studies have corroborated studies of effects \n     in wildlife and have identified biological mechanisms to \n     explain the effects shown.\n       (7) Since the chemicals found in wildlife are also found in \n     humans, humans are exposed to the same chemicals as wildlife.\n       (8) Hormone disruption can occur at very low doses, \n     especially when exposure occurs in the womb or immediately \n     after birth, periods during which rapid development is \n     occurring.\n       (9) In the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (21 U.S.C. \n     301 note), Congress recognized the special vulnerability of \n     infants and children to pesticides and requested that the \n     Environmental Protection Agency establish a program to screen \n     and test hormone-disrupting chemicals. The Environmental \n     Protection Agency has not yet required such screening or \n     tests.\n       (10) In 1998, a research committee on hormone disrupters, \n     organized under the auspices of the Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy, concluded that ``scientific knowledge is \n     inadequate to fully inform public policy, and a government-\n     wide coordinated research effort that addresses the key \n     scientific uncertainties . . . is needed''.\n       (11) In 1999, in response to a request from Congress and \n     funded through the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n     Department of the Interior, the National Academy of Sciences \n     compiled a lengthy list of research, monitoring, and testing \n     priorities related to hormone disruption.\n       (12) The National Institute of Environmental Health \n     Sciences conducts much of the Federal Government's research \n     on hormone disruption, often working in partnership with \n     other agencies.\n       (13) While recognizing the many contributions of animal \n     testing to understanding toxic hazards, the Congress also \n     recognizes the desirability of speeding the use of validated \n     nonanimal screens and tests (to reduce animal suffering and \n     to reduce costs) and expediting judgments about hazards from \n     toxic chemicals.\n       (14) The United States Geological Survey (referred to in \n     this section as the ``USGS'') has considerable experience \n     assessing the occurrence of chemicals in the environment, \n     ecological health, and the hazards to wildlife health and \n     associated human health posed by chemicals in the \n     environment, as a result of monitoring by the USGS of the \n     Nation's water resources and wildlife disease, and research \n     by the USGS on the effects of chemicals on wildlife.\n       (15) The National Academy of Sciences has recognized the \n     expertise of the USGS in such areas as food web contamination \n     and water quality assessment and has encouraged more \n     coordinated work on human health between the USGS and the \n     National Institutes of Health.\n       (b) Amendment.--Subpart 12 of part C of title IV of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 2851 et seq.), as \n     amended by section 2, is further amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n\n     ``directed national program of research on hormone disruption\n\n       ``Sec. 463C.
