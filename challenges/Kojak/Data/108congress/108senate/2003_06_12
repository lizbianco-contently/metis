Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have two Senators who wish to speak \non the pending amendment. The junior Senator from Texas wishes to speak \nfor 5 minutes. I understand the Senator from California wishes to speak \nfor 15 minutes immediately following the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will not object at all. I want to \nunderstand, I thought I already had 15 minutes from yesterday. I am \njust clarifying that point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, some of the time has been used on quorum \ncalls. That time was charged equally against both sides this morning. \nThe Senator still has 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. We may not have 15 minutes for somebody else, but there are \n15 minutes for the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Quorum calls have been charged \nproportionately to both sides. At this time, the Senator from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 884\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words in opposition to \nthe Graham-Feinstein amendment. I am opposed to this amendment for \nseveral significant reasons.\n  This amendment would restrict our ability to conduct an inventory and \nanalysis of our own energy resources. Section 105 of this bill will \ncommission a comprehensive scientific study by the Department of the \nInterior concerning the energy resources of the U.S. Outer Continental \nShelf. It will provide the groundwork for an informed debate on the \noffshore drilling issue.\n  This amendment will only decrease our knowledge of these issues. That \nis why I call it a know-nothing amendment. The American public has a \nright and a need to know the status of its national resources. We \nsurvey, catalog, and inventory our forests, our fisheries, our coal \nreserves, and other valuable living and non-living natural resources. \nWe should also allow for the study of our domestic offshore energy \nresources.\n  The information that we currently have concerning our oil and natural \ngas resources is limited, dated, and lacks the specificity required for \nthis important debate. This legislation will allow the Department of \nthe Interior to use the latest technology, except drilling, to update \nits resource estimates using all the available scientific data.\n  As we reexamine our growing energy needs for the future, the \ngeopolitical reality of our Nation's dependence on foreign oil becomes \nall the more disturbing. The demand for natural gas in this country \ncontinues to increase, while domestic production continues to decrease. \nDecreased production will result in American increased prices for \nnatural gas, fertilizers, agricultural chemicals and electricity.\n  The OCS survey is vital to our energy future, and to our ability in \nthe Senate to make energy decisions based on the best available \ninformation.\n  The energy industry in my home State of Texas and all throughout the \nNation has established a strong record on safety and environmental \nissues, and they are the most critical part of our continuing work to \nfind alternative sources for energy.\n  While we are debating this matter on the floor, Cuba has already \nlaunched well projects north of the island in the Gulf of Mexico. Just \nlast month, the Castro regime invited oil companies from other nations \nto drill, just miles away from our own international borders. We should \nnot restrict our Nation's knowledge and ability to make responsible \ndecisions regarding energy policy, while other nations plow ahead, with \nno U.S. oversight, no U.S. safety regulations, and no U.S. \nenvironmental standards.\n  With the prospect of energy challenges looming on the horizon, now is \nnot the time to ransom our sovereignty over our energy resources for \nthe sake of short term political gain.\n  These natural resources belong to the American people, and they \ndeserve an accounting of them. The debate over offshore drilling is a \ncritical one, and it deserves our full attention.\n  I oppose this amendment as imprudent and inappropriate. That is why \nit was defeated by a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate Energy \nCommittee. That is why it deserves to be defeated again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas for being \nbrief and to the point. I am also glad he went first because I could \nnot disagree more with what he said. It gives me a really good jumping-\noff place for my comments this morning.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Graham's amendment to strike \nsection 105 from the Senate Energy Bill, and I thank him and Senators \nFeinstein, Wyden, and Cantwell for their heroic efforts in the \ncommittee itself to remove this section so we would not have to have \nthis fight on the Senate floor.\n  The Senator from Texas called this amendment a know-nothing \namendment. I call it an amendment that stands up for American values. \nWhat could be more of an American value than protecting and honoring \nthe environmental legacy given to us by God, a legacy we must protect. \nIt is our duty to protect. Section 105, which I wish to strike, would \nrequire the Secretary of the Interior to conduct an inventory and \nanalysis of oil and gas reserves beneath the waters of the Outer \nContinental Shelf, including the moratorium areas. Let me repeat that. \nThis is such a radical proposal that it would allow harmful analysis to \ngo on, and I will explain why, beneath the waters of an area or areas \nin our country where they are so precious, they are so beautiful, they \nare so respected by the people we represent, that they have been \nsubjected to moratoria by this Congress for 20 years now.\n  By the way, that tracks how long I have been in Congress actually, \njust about. I have supported that all the time, and this provision \nundermines the premise behind these moratoria, which is to protect \nthese magnificent areas from activities such as the ones authorized in \nthis bill.\n  It may sound very simple to say, oh, we are going to analyze what \nresources lie off our coasts and in our ocean, but when we realize the \nkind of work that will go on--seismic surveys, sediment samplings, \nother destructive exploration technologies that harm ocean habitat and \nmarine life--it is worth getting upset about.\n  To this point, this bill is really an abomination. I do not know how \nelse to put it. I am known to be very direct. It brings back nuclear \nenergy, and I compliment the Presiding Officer today for his work to \ntry and strip the subsidies to the nuclear power industry from this \nbill. We do not even know what to do with the nuclear waste we have. It \nis dangerous. It lasts for thousands of years. We do not even know what \nto do with it, and now this Senate has decided to turn away from the \nWyden-Sununu amendment and say to nuclear power companies, before we \nknow what to do with this waste, we are going to back you up, we are \ngoing to give you a loan guarantee so if you want to build a nuclear \npowerplant, you can go get a $3 billion loan guarantee from the Federal \nGovernment. So if there is a crisis, if there is a problem, if the \nplant does not work, you are going to be bailed out by the taxpayers.\n  Well, on behalf of the taxpayers of California, we are a State that \nhas turned away from a couple of our nuclear powerplants because we \nhave had problems--and now we are encouraging it. That is what this \nbill does. This bill has a safe harbor provision for ethanol.\n\n[[Page S7743]]\n\nMaybe ethanol will be fine, but we are not sure. A blue ribbon panel in \nEPA said they are not sure. If there are problems, if people get sick, \nif children are harmed, there is a safe harbor for the companies making \nethanol. What a corporate give-away is this bill. And now we are \nturning our back on 20 years of bipartisanship and 20 years of \nleadership from Republican and Democratic Presidents and saying, go \ninto those precious areas in the ocean, drill your heart away and we \nare going to tell you, as the Senator from Texas said, oh, that is a \ngood thing for the country.\n\n  Wrong. It is a bad thing for our country. It is a bad thing for our \nchildren. It is a bad thing for their children because we would be \nundermining the protections for these valued, sensitive coastal areas \nand ignoring again this bipartisan moratoria we have had for years on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf.\n  By the way, we beat this back 2 years ago. I cannot wait to tell the \npeople of California what is happening. I am saddened by it, but I \ncannot wait to tell them because they need to hear it. This is another \nenvironmental rollback that is deadly serious. It was tried 2 years ago \nand it did not succeed, but I am not sanguine this time because we have \nhad changes in this particular body.\n  Two years ago, Senator John Kerry and I offered an amendment, which \nwas included in the manager's amendment, to strip this deadly language \nout and to preserve the moratorium, and it passed.\n  Now, I will tell my colleagues why my people in California are so \nadamantly opposed to drilling off our coast. A very long time ago, 34 \nyears ago, there was an incident that was so horrific that Californians \nwho were around then will never forget it, and their children are told \nstories. In 1969, disaster struck when a major oil spill occurred from \na platform 6 miles offshore from Santa Barbara, CA. Over 4 million \ngallons of oil poured into the ocean, contaminating the waters, killing \nthousands of animals and ruining over 200 square miles of Santa \nBarbara's coastline. Prior to that event, Santa Barbara's beaches were \nconsidered a recreational paradise with some of the most beautiful \ncoastline in our country. After the spill, these same beaches smothered \nwith a slick coating of oil, resulting in a loss of millions of dollars \nin tourism and recreation and broken hearts all over my State. Local \ngovernmental officials, community leaders, grassroots organizations, \nconservation groups, and citizens rallied for justice after the \ndestruction of their coast. They decided then that absolutely no more \ndrilling should be permitted off the coast.\n  Due to the Santa Barbara spill in California, there is strong and \nenduring support for the protection of our oceans and our coastlines, \nand any candidate for any office coming into my State saying we ought \nto go back to the days of drilling off that coast is not going to get \nthe support of Democrats, is not going to get the support of \nRepublicans, is not going to get the support of independents, and \neverybody else in between. They can sugar-coat it any way they want. We \nknow the truth. We saw it in Santa Barbara. We made a decision that any \npotential benefits that might be derived from future oil and gas \ndevelopment were not worth the risk of destroying our priceless coastal \ntreasures. I will show a picture of my coastline because it is worth \nlooking at.\n\n  My friends on both sides of the aisle who support this underlying \namendment, if they think they are helping the economy, they are not. \nThe economy of mine and other coastal States relies on a beautiful and \nclean environment. The economic benefits of our California beaches are \nvery clear. Two-thirds of California residents visit one of the State \nbeaches at least once a year. In 2001, there were at least 132 million \nvisits to California beaches by people from outside the State. These \nare your constituents. Maybe it is even you. Maybe you even came with \nyour family to our beaches. These visits generated $61 billion in total \nspending in my State. That is an economic boom.\n  There are some in this Senate who think the only economic boom to \ntheir States is drilling on precious areas. That is a good debate. But \nthe people of California have made this decision. They have decided \nthey do not want it. They understand the commercial fishing industry \nrelies on a beautiful unspoiled coast and ocean. It is a $554 million \nindustry with 17,000 jobs, and they say no to this bill; the shipping \nindustry, 8.6 billion and 179,000 jobs. We are talking tourism, we are \ntalking fishing, we are talking shipping, and we are saying no to this \nbill.\n  This Graham amendment will help us preserve that economy. These are \nhard economic times in our State. The last thing we need is to go back. \nTourism, beautiful beaches, a clean ocean, that is what my State is \nabout. We saw what happened in Santa Barbara. We made that decision. We \nhave permanently banned new oil and gas development in State waters. \nHow can we go out adjacent to State waters to the Outer Continental \nShelf and run the risk of destroying this value of our State? It is \nabout California's economy. It is also about a beautiful environment.\n  I will show a couple of other pictures of this breathtaking \nenvironment. This is our southern California coast. The picture we show \nnow is Malibu Beach.\n  We are talking about $61 billion in total spending each year because \nof our magnificent coast and our ocean. When it is added up, the \nunderlying bill is destructive to our environment, which Republicans, \nDemocrats, and Independents in my State agree must be preserved. It \nundermines our economy.\n  By allowing predrilling activities to occur, our coast is threatened, \ncommercial fishing jobs are at risk, fishing jobs are at risk, tourism \nis at risk, California's economy is at risk, and the beauty of \nCalifornia's coastline is at risk. That goes for every State along my \ncoast, be it Washington, Oregon, or California.\n  As I look back to the bipartisanship we have had with the President \nin the past, Republicans and Democrats, this is the first time we have \nseen this move.\n  What is the history of Federal moratoria? For two decades Federal \nwaters off the coast of California have been protected from additional \noffshore oil and gas development through a series of temporary bans. \nPresident George H.W. Bush signed an executive memorandum in 1990 which \nplaced the 10-year moratorium on new oil and gas leasing. He did not \ntry to go in there with seismic testing and destructive methods. He did \nnot get up and say, we better drill there and find out what is there. \nHe understood it. President Clinton understood it. He extended this \nmoratorium to 2012.\n\n  Section 105 of this Energy bill completely ignores this moratoria by \npromoting destructive exploratory drilling in the Outer Continental \nShelf. In a letter to me, the California Coastal Commission states the \nprovision ``would seriously undermine the longstanding bipartisan \nlegislative moratoria . . . that has been included in every \nappropriations bill for more than 20 years.'' We must defeat efforts to \nundermine the protection of our coast and the rights of coastal States \nand local governments to make decisions to protect their coasts. \nSection 105 of the Energy bill is intended for one purpose, I say to my \ncolleagues, and one purpose only. You can dress up a pig and you can \nput lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. In this case, it is to \npromote oil and gas development on our precious coast.\n  Republicans in my State don't want that. Democrats in my State don't \nwant that. Independents in my State don't want that. By allowing the \nSecretary of the Interior to use invasive, exploratory technologies, \nincluding the seismic surveys--sections 105 permits activities that \nhave detrimental impacts on the marine environment, including air \npollution from machinery and disturbance to the sea flora. While these \nseismic surveys sound innocent, let me explain what we are talking \nabout.\n  Huge boats with large acoustic equipment go out into the ocean, a \nhigh-pressure air gun sends out constant high-decibel explosive pulses \nthrough the water and deep into the sea floor. We know these sounds \nhave been reported to cause significant damage to fish and their \nability to locate prey and avoid predators. As a result, the survival \nof fish populations is threatened by this technology. That is why the \ncommercial fishing business in my State opposes this bill. These \nexplosive pulses are also within the auditory\n\n[[Page S7744]]\n\nrange of many other marine species, including whales. In fact, when \nthis technology was used in the Bahamas and off the coast of Mexico, it \ncaused whales to become disoriented and as a result to be fatally \nstranded on beaches.\n  Seismic surveys are accompanied by extraction of numerous samples \nfrom the sea floor. These samples are collected by dropping large \nhollow metal tubes from ships to vertically puncture the sea floor. \nReports from Environmental Defense show the collection of these samples \ndamages the ocean floor and harms the habitat of numerous species.\n  The Graham amendment is supported by the California Coastal \nCommission, in addition to the Natural Resources Defense Council, \nEnvironmental Defense, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Sierra \nClub, Coast Alliance, Ocean Conservancy, Oceana, and the League of \nConservation Voters.\n  This is a serious issue for the most populous State in the Union and \nfor the entire west coast. I urge my colleagues who say they care about \nwhat people believe, care about the values of the American people, to \nseriously look at the danger and the damage this is going to cause. We \nstripped it out of the appropriations bill a couple years ago, and it \nis back now. I hope my colleagues will strip it out again. If you do \nnot, there are going to be a lot of outraged citizens in this country \nwhen they find out what could happen from the underlying bill. I again \nurge colleagues to support this Graham amendment.\n\n  Since my colleague from Washington is in the Chamber, Senator \nCantwell, let me say to her--I mentioned this in her absence--how much \nI appreciated the heroic effort she made in the committee to strip this \nout of the bill. I hope we will be successful today.\n  I thank my colleague. I yield the remainder of my time to the \nmanagers of the bill, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I wish to comment on what I hope is the \nprogress of our Energy Policy Act of 2003 that is before us. It is a \npolicy that is essential to our Nation's energy security, to our \neconomic security. I think it will play a vital role in where we go \nwith energy.\n  This is comprehensive legislation that has to do with production, \nparticularly in the West; let's say domestic production. It has to do \nwith research, which is what this amendment is about. It has to do with \nunderstanding where we go in the future with alternative fuels. We take \na total look at where we are.\n  One important provision calls for an inventory of the Outer \nContinental Shelf and the resources there for the United States. This \nrequires the Secretary of the Interior to survey all the Outer \nContinental Shelf resources currently under production and under \nmoratoria, and to develop an inventory of those reserves in the areas \nthat are not in production. An analysis will utilize the latest \navailable remote sensing technologies, but the legislation specifically \nstates that drilling will not be permitted in conducting this \ninventory. The measure directs the Secretary of the Interior to submit \na report to Congress on the inventory 6 months after enactment of the \nbill.\n  Offshore production, of course, has played an important part in our \ndomestic picture. The western and central Gulf of Mexico have proven \nworld class areas for natural gas and petroleum production, accounting \nfor over 25 percent of domestic production.\n  It is believed substantial natural gas resources exist in the eastern \ngulf, Atlantic Ocean, and off the coast of California. However, \nexploration of these areas has been prohibited by previous Presidential \nmoratoria. Senator Graham's amendment now on the floor will strike that \ninventory from the Energy Policy Act of 2003.\n  Opponents contend the passage will violate the Presidential moratoria \nand open the door for development of coastal areas. This is completely \nuntrue. The sole purpose of the offshore inventory in S. 14 is to \ncollect data on domestic offshore oil and gas resources to fully \nunderstand the potential of these regions instead of making future \npolicy judgments on information that is outdated and incomplete.\n  A number of people are very interested in this. I understand that. \nBut I think we are being misled a little as to what it means. It is a \ncomprehensive scientific inventory. I think the public has a right to \nknow what the status of our national natural resources are for the \nfuture. We need to reexamine them because many of the assessments that \nwere done some time ago are not up to par in terms of current \ntechnology.\n  We need to do this. A number of organizations are opposed to the \namendment--the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, the American Farm Bureau Federation--simply because they \nare so dependent on energy in the future. This is something that really \naffects lots of people.\n  I have to say once again, it is an inventory of the resources that \nare available, not a license to produce.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I ask the Senator a question?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You mentioned various organizations that support this. \nI wonder if it might be fair to say that, regarding future jobs for \nAmerica, we might have some interest in knowing what our resources are. \nThose concerned about jobs for the future, might they also be \ninterested?\n  Mr. THOMAS. The Senator raises, of course, a basic question. As we \ntalk about energy, what we are talking about is the future of our \neconomy, in terms of jobs, in terms of doing the things we will want to \ndo economically and environmentally.\n  I have the same kind of feelings about my place in Wyoming. We have \nmountains and we have areas we are going to protect. But that does not \nmean we ought to avoid the idea of having a notion of where those \nresources are, and to be able to use some of them where they work \ntogether, preserving the environment.\n  Certainly the U.S. Chamber, certainly the National Association of \nManufacturers, are concerned about the future and the availability of \nenergy so we can create jobs and continue to build the future economy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for his remarks this morning.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, is here. He asked if he might \nhave time. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 17 and a half minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I think it appropriate I make a few \ncomments. My committee does have jurisdiction over any environmental \naspects of the OCS. I consider this to be significant. I think it is \nvery important for us. We hear all the stuff about the environment and \nwe hear some extremist groups who are saying they don't want this to \ntake place. There are some out there, maybe even some Senators, who \nmight believe this somehow is going to authorize exploration or \nauthorize drilling.\n  Section 105 of the bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to \nconduct an inventory and analysis of oil and natural gas resources in \nthe Outer Continental Shelf. It does not in any way authorize any type \nof exploration; it doesn't authorize any kind of drilling. It will \nprovide the American people, for the first time, using new technology--\nand we have new technology--a comprehensive overview of the country's \noffshore oil and natural gas resources.\n  This 3-D seismic technology--I have heard the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee talk about this modern technology. It was developed in the \n1990s and has allowed us to identify 100 trillion cubic feet more \nnatural gas in the Gulf of Mexico than was previously found.\n  We have surveys for the rest of the country's natural resources. We \nhave surveys of how many forests we have, how many trees we have, how \nmany fish we have, how much coal we have. Why is there so much \nresistance to knowing how many oil and gas resources or reserves are \nout there? How can we have a comprehensive national energy policy \nwithout knowing how much oil and gas the country has? That is really \nthe key to this.\n  I have criticized Republican and Democrat administrations alike for \nnot having a comprehensive energy policy. I remember, during the Reagan \nadministration, trying to get a comprehensive energy policy. We were \nnot able to\n\n[[Page S7745]]\n\ndo it. During the first Bush administration, we were not able to do it.\n  Consequently, back when I was so concerned about our dependence upon \nforeign oil for our ability to fight a war, during the Reagan \nadministration, our dependence was only 36 percent. Now it is 57 \npercent. So it has just gotten worse and worse.\n  Finally, I applaud the President for saying we are going to have a \ncomprehensive energy policy, and I applaud the Senator, the chairman of \nthe Energy Committee, for coming up with a well-thought-out plan. But, \nagain, how can we have a comprehensive policy if we don't even know \nwhat resources the Nation has?\n  Many colleagues are concerned that section 105 undermines the State's \nright to determine what happens in Federal waters off its shores.\n  How can that happen? It is just a study. In fact, not knowing what \noil and gas is off States' shores infringes upon a State's right to \nmake an informed decision. Indeed. The liberal mantra here is the right \nto know. Given that, how can they oppose knowledge? No State has the \nright to infringe upon interstate commerce. That would be \nunconstitutional. If legislators are successful in prohibiting the \naccess to the people's resources, then no amount of information about \nAmerica's oil and natural gas reserves is going to change that \nprotection.\n  Secretary of the Interior Norton, in a recent letter to my \ncolleagues, Senators Graham and Nelson, states:\n\n       The language does not affect the moratoria.\n\n  You have to understand that. I just hope the people of America are \nwatching this because we are really just saying we don't want the \nknowledge. We are facing a natural gas crisis. I don't think anyone is \ngoing to stand up here and say that we are not. This crisis is \nuniversally acknowledged through widespread awareness. This crisis has \nreally just begun in the past year or so.\n  In a wonderfully bipartisan way, Congress has come together to try to \nreduce America's reliance on foreign sources of energy, including oil \nand natural gas.\n  Limiting the American people's access to knowledge about the American \npeople's resources, let alone the resources themselves, is a guaranteed \nway to increase dependence on foreign sources of energy. It is sort of \nan ``ignorance-is-bliss'' strategy.\n  Also, many States are facing budget shortfalls. They turn to us for \noptions for addressing these shortfalls. The ones I have talked with \nare appreciative of the fact that we need to know what resources are \noff our shores.\n  Again, this amendment authorizes only a study and will allow us to \nmake good and informed decisions about resources. I can't imagine \nanyone being against something which is merely shedding light on what \nwe have and informing the people of America what the resources are so \nwe can intelligently address those resources in the future.\n  I certainly encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment which \nwould strike the people's right to know what kinds of resources are out \nthere.\n  Again, I repeat that it has nothing to do with exploration. It has \nnothing to do with drilling oil. All it deals with is finding out what \nour resources are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to support the Graham \namendment. I thank my colleague from California for speaking so \neloquently about how important it is for the entire west coast of the \nUnited States. I know Senator Graham is articulating those same \nconcerns in Florida. I am sure we will hear from Members of other parts \nof the country. I find this debate almost amazing--amazing in the sense \nthat Congress has enacted moratoria on drilling since 1982. In every \ninstance since 1982, Congress has responded and said we don't want to \nexplore for natural gas or oil off of our pristine coasts. So we go \nover this time and time again. Yes. We are going to go over it again \ntoday. People have raised these economic arguments. I can tell you what \nthe people in Washington State think.\n  We have a 7.4-percent unemployment rate. We want jobs. But I \nguarantee this is not where we think we are going to get jobs. In fact, \nwe want protection from our high energy costs. My ratepayers have had a \n50-percent rate increase. Why? Because we were gouged by Enron \ncontracts.\n  To say to the people of the Northwest that somehow your economy and \nyour future are going be taken care of because we are going to let you \ndrill off the coast of Washington is ludicrous. We want economic \nrelief. We want statutory relief from the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to do their job. We want them to basically say that the fat \nboys and these Enron schemes have been illegal and we are going to help \nyou get out of your high energy prices.\n  The fact that we are out here talking about this isn't really going \nto lead to drilling. Then why spend the taxpayers' dollars trying to \nstudy something we don't want to do. I don't want to drill off the \ncoast of Washington. I don't want to spend the taxpayers' money \nassessing that situation. I don't think we ought to spend the \ntaxpayers' money looking in the Great Lakes for oil. I don't know that \nwe want to go and say let us valuate putting a nuclear powerplant in \nNorth Dakota because it might be close to the Missouri River and a \nwater source.\n  There are a lot of issues we can explore. The question is, do we want \nto follow through on those policies? I believe the answer is absolutely \nno, as to our pristine coastline. That coastline has already been a key \npart of our economy on the west coast. We have many fishing industries, \nshellfishing industries, and tourism dollars that all rely on that \npristine coastline.\n  The Federal Government has entered into treaties with the tribes on \nshellfish and harvesting rights. Are we going to abrogate those Federal \nobligations that we have signed onto?\n  We also, as the Federal Government, implemented the Olympic Coast \nNational Marine Sanctuary which encompasses most of the waters off the \nNorthwest coast. It is a sanctuary for hundreds of species, including \nmarine mammals. These mammals include the majestic orca whale, whose 20 \npercent population decline over the past decade recently triggered a \n``depleted'' listing under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Now are \ngoing to say to the country that we think we should look at putting oil \nrigs and transportation of oil in an area that we, as a country, have \nalready designated as a pristine national monument?\n  If you want to know whether the people of my State are watching, they \nare watching. Guess what. They have a memory. They do remember. They \nremember thick carpets of oil, hundreds of dead birds and great shards \nof oil-blackened timber that followed the 1989 oil spill off of Grays \nHarbor. That disaster stained over 300 miles of coastline. An oil well \nblowout could be many times worse.\n\n  While some argue that simply studying this just gives us information, \nmy response is that we should not spend millions of taxpayer dollars \nthat could be put towards something else. My constituents won't accept \ndrilling rigs off the vibrant coastline of Willapa Bay, Neah Bay, or \nthe mouth of the Columbia River. Rigs are unsightly and the risk of an \necologically disastrous oil spill is just too high.\n  Instead of looking for oil and gas on the Outer Continental Shelf, my \nState is willing to do a variety of things.\n  We are still the home to the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, and we are \nspending billions of taxpayer dollars to clean up the nuclear waste. We \nare progressing on that in an aggressive fashion.\n  We have one of the largest wind farms in the West. We are trying to \nbe a leader in new energy technology. We are even willing to look at \nwave energy technology off the coast of Washington and in other areas \nwhere it might be more appropriate.\n  I am a big advocate of moving forward on natural gas in Alaska to \nmake sure we get a natural gas pipeline to give more natural gas \nresources to the lower 48 States. That is something which I think is \ncritically important. The Pew Ocean Commission has recently highlighted \nthe fragile nature of our oceans and coastal resources and recommended \nwe look at our oceans in a holistic manner.\n  I think that report, which came out less than 10 days ago, basically \nsays that we don't have our act together as it relates to our oceans \nand the health of our oceans.\n\n[[Page S7746]]\n\n  I find it very frustrating being from a State that has high \nunemployment and a State that has high energy costs. Those energy costs \nhave been costing us and no one is trying to help give us relief from \nthose contracts.\n  Public documents say there has been market manipulation. Now somebody \nthinks they are proposing to us some panacea of studying drilling off \nthe coast of Washington and you are going to have a great economy. It \nis a bunch of bunk.\n  What we need to do is what Congress has done since 1982, enact a \nmoratorium on drilling. Stand up and say it is not appropriate. Follow \nthe Bush administration, follow the Clinton administration, and follow \nthe previous Bush administration. I am not sure where this Bush \nadministration is, but basically say we don't want drilling off of our \npristine coastline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields to the Senator?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I understand the Senator from New \nMexico has 11 minutes remaining. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Madam President. I would like 5 of those \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, today I rise in opposition to Senate \nAmendment No. 884, offered by the Senator from Florida. Everywhere you \nturn these days you hear talk of a natural gas crisis facing this \ncountry. On May 21, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve testified \nbefore Congress that he was ``quite surprised at how little attention \nthe natural gas problem has been getting,'' he said, ``because it is a \nvery serious problem.'' Yesterday, while testifying before the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, he went on to add that the increase in \ngas prices--more than double what they were last year--have put \nsignificant segments of the North America gas-using industry--chemical, \nfertilizer, steel and aluminum--in a weakened competitive position \nagainst industries overseas.\n  What Mr. Greenspan is referring to is the looming gap between natural \ngas demand and supply in this country. Currently, we produce about 84 \npercent of the natural gas we consume. By 2025, the Energy Information \nAdministration, EIA, projects that imports of natural gas will provide \n22 percent of demand. Quite simply, we are facing the prospect of our \nnatural gas market following in the footsteps of our oil market where \nimports continue to account for a growing percentage of supply.\n  For years we have pursued a policy that is in conflict with itself. \nOn the one hand, we encourage the use of natural gas in this country to \nmeet our energy needs and environmental goals. It is viewed as a clean \nfuel to improve air quality and a low carbon-dioxide fuel to meet \nclimate change targets.\n  However, we have ignored the supply side of the equation. National \noutput has remained stagnant since 1995 but one of out of every two \nhomes in the United States is now heated by natural gas. The amount of \nnatural gas used to generate electricity has increased 33 percent in \nthe past 5 years and will likely grow an additional 60 percent by 2015.\n  So, we now find ourselves living in a state of denial when demand \noutstrips supply and volatile prices occur.\n  In my State of Louisiana, chemical plants, which use natural gas as \nboth a fuel and a feedstock, face record-high prices. Because of tight \nsupplies, the average natural gas price--NYMEX--for the first quarter \nof 2003 was $5.91 per million Btus. This represents a staggering 129 \npercent increase over the average natural gas price for the first \nquarters of the previous 10 years, which was $2.58.\n  For ammonia plants in particular, the cost of natural gas can \nrepresent 70 to 90 percent of the total cost of manufacturing its \nproducts. Since 1998, the number of Louisiana Ammonia Producers, who \naccount for approximately 40 percent of the U.S. production of ammonia, \nhas gone from 9 companies employing more than 3,500 employees to 3 \ncompanies employing less than 1,000.\n  Thanks to the good work of the Energy Committee, led by Chairman \nDomenici, I believe there are some provisions in this Bill, that if \nenacted, would stimulate natural gas production in the short term. For \nexample, I offered an amendment at committee that was accepted and \nwould encourage deep gas production from wells in shallow waters on \nexisting leases. Provisions such as this one can bring gas to market \nquickly.\n  While there are some conservation and efficiency measures we can take \nto try and slow high prices in the short term, we cannot continue to \npretend that the supply imbalance does not exist. Believe it or not, \nthe fight today is not over whether to produce more natural gas but \ninstead focuses on a mere study, albeit a critical one.\n  The proponents of the amendment before us would have you believe that \nenacting the inventory called for under section 105 of the bill would \nopen Pandora's Box and lead to oil and gas production everywhere on the \nOuter Continental Shelf, regardless of whether an area is currently \nunder moratoria.\n  The fact is the inventory will do nothing of the sort. Section 105 \nwill in no way affect existing moratoria on oil and gas activity in the \nOCS, nor will it diminish the rights of those states that oppose \ndrilling off their coasts. Section 105 does not provide for the use of \nexploratory wells. The real truth behind section 105 is simply to \ninform the American public about how much potential oil and natural gas \nthere is within these areas of the United States.\n  I believe that the American people should have the most up-to-date \nand accurate projections of these public assets. An amendment such as \nthe one pending before the Senate sends a signal to America's \nconsumers, homeowners and manufacturing industries that Congress is out \nof touch and not committed to addressing a problem that only continues \nto get worse.\n  The question might arise, why do we need to re-examine our offshore \nresources when many assessments of oil and natural gas resources off \nour coasts have been done? The answer is most, if not all, of these \nassessments relied solely on the geophysical and geological data \nyielded by company exploration and production efforts. In some areas, \nwhere moratoria have been in place for some time, the data is very \nold--10 years or more--and the estimates may no longer be accurate.\n  Since this frontier was officially opened to significant oil and gas \nexploration in 1953, no single region has contributed as much to the \nnation's energy production as the OCS. The OCS accounts for more than \n25 percent of our Nation's natural gas and oil production.\n  With annual returns to the federal government averaging between $4 to \n$5 billion annually, no single area has contributed as much to the \nfederal treasury as the OCS. In fact, since 1953 the OCS has \ncontributed $140 billion to the U.S. Treasury.\n  In light of these tremendous contributions, it is particularly \ninteresting to realize that almost all of our OCS production comes from \na very concentrated area of the OCS, the western half, which really \nmeans offshore Louisiana and Texas. Ninety-eight percent of the \nnation's offshore production comes from this half of the Gulf of \nMexico. In fiscal year 2001, offshore Louisiana accounted for almost 80 \npercent of total OCS gas production.\n  By taking this inventory, maybe we discover there are more resources \non the OCS than we originally thought or maybe we actually learn less \nis out there. Regardless, we owe it to ourselves to find out.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I want to reserve the remainder of our \ntime. However, I thank the distinguished Senator from Louisiana for her \nexcellent remarks. The real issue is knowledge: What should the \nAmerican people know about their future in terms of our own resources?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern over \nprovisions\n\n[[Page S7747]]\n\nincluded in the Senate Energy bill that threaten the existing moratoria \non leasing and preleasing activities related to oil drilling on Georges \nBank, off the coast of Maine, and other areas of the outer continental \nshelf.\n  Section 105 of the Energy bill requires the Department of the \nInterior to inventory all potential oil and natural gas resources in \nthe entire outer continental shelf. This provision would allow \npotentially damaging seismic technology in the vital fishing grounds of \nGeorges Bank.\n  Georges Bank is a magnificent American resource. The unusual \nunderwater topography and tidal activity of Georges Bank create an \nalmost self-contained ecosystem, unique within the ocean that surrounds \nit. It is one of the most productive fisheries in the world, where \nMainers and many others harvest cod, haddock, yellowtail flounder, \nscallops, lobsters, swordfish, and herring.\n  Mainers have fished Georges Bank for hundreds of years. Hundreds of \nsmall communities in New England depend on fish from Georges Bank for \neconomic support and their maritime-based way of life. In recent years, \nMaine's fishermen have made significant economic sacrifices to work \ntoward sustainable and healthy fish stocks. I am extremely worried that \nany drilling activities, even preleasing activities, could destroy \ntheir work.\n  An oil spill on Georges Bank would have catastrophic effects on the \nGeorges Bank ecosystem and the economies of the coastal communities of \nNew England. Georges Bank experiences some of the most severe weather \nin the world, and the frequent storms, strong currents, and high winds \nwould cripple any post-spill cleanup effort. For this reason, and \nbecause of its great biological value, many scientists, fishermen, and \nother persons concerned with and knowledgeable about the unique \necosystem of Georges Bank have urged that no drilling activities occur \nin this region.\n  I have long worked to protect Georges Bank from the potentially \ndevastating impacts of offshore oil and gas drilling. In 1999, when the \nGovernment of Canada was considering whether or not to drill on Georges \nBank, I introduced a resolution in the Senate that asked the Government \nof Canada to impose a moratorium on drilling on the Canadian side of \nGeorges Bank until 2012. I was very relieved when, several months \nlater, Canada did indeed impose such a moratorium. The United States \nalso has a moratorium on drilling Georges Bank until 2012.\n  This issue again arose in May of 2001, when the Outer Continental \nShelf Policy Committee recommended to the Secretary of the Interior \nthat she encourage congressional funding to assess the oil and gas \npotential of offshore areas covered by the moratorium. The \nrecommendations also included a suggestion to explore lifting parts of \nthe existing moratorium.\n  In response, I worked to include language in the fiscal year 2002 \nInterior Appropriations bill that would prohibit the use of funds for \noffshore preleasing, leasing, or related activity on Georges Bank. \nAlong with Senators Kerry, Kennedy, and Snowe, I cosponsored an \namendment that prohibits the Department of the Interior from spending \nany funds on leasing, preleasing, or related activities in Georges Bank \nand the entire North Atlantic, as well as the West Coast off \nCalifornia, Oregon, and Washington, and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Our \namendment was signed into law, and similar language has been included \nin subsequent Interior Appropriations bills.\n  I believe that Section 105 of the Energy bill is contradictory to the \nInterior Appropriations bill language and the expressed will of the \nSenate against the expenditure of funds for the use of preleasing \nactivities in Georges Bank. I am pleased to join Senators Graham, \nFeinstein, Dole, and many others in cosponsoring an amendment that will \nremove these provisions from the bill. I urge my colleagues to support \nour amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, would the Chair indicate how much time \nremains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 4 minutes 20 \nseconds; the Senator from Washington has 5 minutes, and the Senator \nfrom California, Mrs. Feinstein, has 13 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. So a total of 18 minutes on this side, 4 on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that the leader \nwants to vote at 11:15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My understanding is we would like to change the time to \n11:15, assure the time at 11:15.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time, \nafter whatever time expires that has already been allocated, be divided \nequally between the two sides.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Between now and 11:15?\n  Mr. REID. Not the time between now and 11:15. Whenever the time \nexpires--we have 18 minutes and you have 4 minutes; so 22 minutes--so \nit would be about 13 minutes would be allocated evenly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I trust, with the time being so much \nmore on their side, a Senator from that side will soon come to the \nfloor and talk.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I say to my friend, Senator Feinstein is due here \nmomentarily. Senator Graham is expected. But I think, in fairness to \nSenator Domenici, that their time--they should be here, so I will \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think that is fair, and I thank the Senator for \nsuggesting it.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, how much time \ndoes the Senator from California have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from California, if she \nneeds more time, there is time available. Does the Senator know how \nmuch time she will need?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I may need another 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the time remaining to the \nSenator from California be a total of 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid.\n  I wish to speak as cosponsor of the Graham-Feinstein amendment to \nremove the inventory of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas resources \nfrom the Energy bill. I deeply believe that this proposed inventory \nthreatens our coasts and should not be part of this Energy bill. The \nHouse already stripped the studies out of the Energy bill. The Senate \nshould do the same.\n  The Energy bill's current language requires a new inventory of all \nthe Outer Continental Shelf resources and a study of impediments to \nproduction. We oppose these studies because the purpose of the studies \nis really meant to undermine the moratoria which is in place. Many of \nthese moratoria have been in place with bipartisan support on both \ncoasts for 20 years.\n  Proponents of the inventory argue that it is meant to provide \ninformation and nothing more. However, the real intent is clear: The \nMinerals Management Service is specifically directed to inventory \nmoratorium areas that are not available for development. Inventorying \nthese areas does not make sense unless you want to overturn the \nmoratoria.\n  The provision's second study on impediments to production makes the \nintent of the studies even clearer. In section 105, the popular \nmoratorium that now protects our States' coastal resources is \ndisparaged as ``an impediment to production.'' An impediment is \nsomething to be removed. So this is a hint as to the intention of these \nstudies.\n  Perspective is important in this debate. The moratorium is there to \nprotect our coast, not just to impede production of oil and gas. Facts \nare that\n\n[[Page S7748]]\n\nwe do not need the information these studies would provide to make an \ninformed decision. We have inventoried the Outer Continental Shelf's \nresources before. In fact, the Minerals Management Service already \npublishes an update of this inventory every 5 years. We have a good \nidea what resources are out there, and we do not need additional \nstudies.\n  Californians are also too familiar with the consequences of offshore \ndrilling. An oilspill in 1969 off the coast of Santa Barbara killed \nthousands of birds, as well as dolphins, seals, and other animals. We \nknow this could happen again, and how well I remember that cleanup \neffort on those beaches.\n  A healthy coast is also vital to California's economy and our quality \nof life. One of our major economic areas is the visitor industry--\nconventions, tourists. People do not want to see oil rigs off the coast \nof California, and they do not come there for that purpose. The ocean-\ndependent industry is estimated to contribute $17 billion to our State \neach year. So the economics of what the ocean produces in its pristine \nstate are critical to our State.\n  In 1991, the California Department of Parks and Recreation found that \nalmost 70 percent of Californians participated in beach activities and \n25 percent of our population did some saltwater fishing. So \nCalifornians know what is at stake, and we made an informed decision: \nWe do not want drilling off our coast.\n  As Mike Reilly, chairman of the California Coastal Commission, said \nto me in a letter:\n\n       The energy bill's provision is directly contrary to \n     California's strong interest in safeguarding its precious \n     coastal resources from offshore oil and gas-drilling related \n     activities, and for that reason we oppose this study.\n\n  The California Coastal Commission is the State governmental agency in \ncharge of the coastline. I myself served on one of the regional boards \nof the Coastal Commission, so I know it well.\n\n  Even without the threat of future drilling, we would oppose \nconducting these studies in moratorium areas. We have moratoria to \nprotect our coasts. The studies would harm resources we want to \nprotect.\n  I wish to focus for a moment on the destructive studies required by \nthis provision. The provision's original language would have allowed \nfor exploratory drilling. I appreciate that the current version no \nlonger allows for exploratory drilling. However, the bill still \nrequires invasive study methods that will harm our coastal resources.\n  The provision specifically calls for 3-D seismic testing. One might \nask, What is that? This technology requires a sparker or air gun and \nloud repeated pulses of underwater sound. These sounds can be heard for \nmiles under water.\n  Seismic surveys harm marine mammals and have been linked to \nstrandings of whales on beaches on multiple occasions. Seismic testing \nalso hurts fish. Recent studies show these surveys damage the ears of \nat least some fish species, and that the damage may well be permanent. \nFish rely on their hearing for survival. Additional seismic testing \nwould threaten our fishery resources and our commercial fishing \nindustries. This is a $17 billion industry in California, so we cannot \nafford threats to our fisheries and our fishing industry.\n  The inventory would also likely include something called dart core \nsampling. Dart cores are collected by dropping large metal tubes from \nships. The tubes sink fast enough to penetrate the sea floor to a \nsubstantial depth, remove a column of rock, and then are retrieved to \nthe ship. This is suspiciously similar to drilling. So that is what is \ngoing to go on. This is not just a benign study of people sitting at \ntheir desks on land studying something. They are sinking these tubes \ndown to some depth, obviously to examine core samples to determine the \npresence of natural gas or oil.\n  Dart core sampling also damages organisms and habitat on the ocean \nfloor. The dart cores also create silt plumes that smother nearby \norganisms.\n  Protecting our coastlines is not a partisan issue. The Governors of \nboth Florida and California oppose these studies. Furthermore, the \nsuccessful effort to defeat the studies in the House was a bipartisan \neffort. A broad coalition of Senators, including the distinguished \nSenators from Florida and North Carolina, opposes the studies in this \nprovision. We should not override the wishes of the most affected \nStates and people to protect their own coastlines.\n  So I ask my colleagues to vote for our amendment to strike the Outer \nContinental Shelf study from the Energy bill. Directly following my \nremarks, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the League of \nConservation Voters dated June 10 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2003.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n\n re: support an amendment to S. 14 to protect sensitive coastal areas \n                       from oil and gas drilling\n\n       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is \n     the political voice of the national environmental community. \n     Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental \n     Scorecard, which details the voting records of members of \n     Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is \n     distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide, and \n     the press.\n       LCV urges you to support an amendment that will be offered \n     by Senators Graham (FL), Feinstein, Cantwell, Wyden, Nelson \n     (FL), Lautenberg, Boxer, Edwards, Kerry, Murray, Lieberman, \n     Leahy, Snowe, Dodd and Chafee to strike section 105 of S. 14. \n     This provision would undermine the existing bipartisan Outer \n     Continental Shelf (OCS) moratorium that currently protects \n     some of the nation's most sensitive coastal and marine areas.\n       Section 105 requires the Interior Department to inventory \n     potential oil and gas resources of the entire Outer \n     Continental Shelf (OCS), including the moratorium areas, \n     using seismic surveys, sediment sampling, and other \n     exploration technologies that can damage sea life and ocean \n     habitat. Section 105 also requires the Secretary to report to \n     Congress on ``impediments'' to the development of OCS oil and \n     gas, including the moratoria, and the role coastal states and \n     localities have played in stopping environmentally harmful \n     offshore oil-related activities. This lays the groundwork for \n     an attack on the moratoria, as well as on the rights of \n     coastal states and local governments to raise legitimate \n     objections to offshore development and related onshore \n     industrial development that affects their coasts.\n       Since 1982, Congress has included language in the Interior \n     Appropriations bill that prevents the Department of the \n     Interior from conducting leasing, pre-leasing and related \n     activities in areas under moratoria. President George W. Bush \n     included the traditional legislative moratorium language in \n     his FY 04 budget request.\n       Section 105 is clearly inconsistent with more than 20 years \n     of bipartisan legislative and administrative actions that \n     protect sensitive coastal areas around the country from \n     offshore oil and gas activity. Please support the Graham \n     amendment to strike this damaging provision when the energy \n     bill comes to the Senate floor, and please oppose this dirty, \n     dangerous energy bill.\n       LCV's Political Advisory Committee will strongly consider \n     including votes on this issue in compiling LCV's 2003 \n     Scorecard. If you need more information, please call Betsy \n     Loyless or Mary Minette in my office at (202) 785-8683.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deb Callahan,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That letter, of course, on behalf of the League, \nwhich has stood fast in defending and advocating important \nenvironmental issues solidly is in support of the Graham-Feinstein \namendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nremains now for debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes evenly divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If there are any Senators who wish to speak who favor \nthis amendment, we will give them some of our time if they want to get \ndown here and take a few minutes. It is a very interesting and exciting \nissue.\n  I will take a few minutes now. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Chair inform me when I have used 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so inform the Senator.\n\n[[Page S7749]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, a lot has been said about this. A lot is \nnot true. In a very few minutes, I will go through exactly what is true \nby reading specifically what the bill says and the interpretations that \nwe have.\n  I do not believe there is any right-thinking American, knowing the \ndangerous nature of our reliance upon both oil and natural gas, who \nwould not want to know tomorrow morning, if they could, how much in \nresources we have if we ever needed them. We only want to know about \ncertain ones. We do not want to know about those who might want to \ndrill out in the ocean. We just want to know about some of them. I \nthink every American would say: Tell us how much we own, and then later \non we will discuss whether it is worthwhile trying to use them.\n  The provisions in this bill do not lift the moratorium. It simply \nauthorizes the Secretary to conduct a study. This language prohibits \nthe use of drilling to obtain data, and it also directs the Secretary \nto use existing data. It is a prudent move to take an inventory of our \ndomestic resources and where they are located. Technology has changed \nsignificantly over the years, and resource data that were developed in \nthe 1970s are totally outdated. We did not have the advantage of 3-D \nseismic analysis, and MMS has never included 3-D data in its assessment \nof the Atlantic OCS resources.\n  Nearly 60 percent of our oil is imported today. Supply disruptions \nleft the world oil markets in short supply. Not too many years ago, it \nalso left lines in America where in New York they started waiting in \nlines at 4 in the morning. They got so mad at each other, they even \nshot each other because one was jumping ahead of the other in line. \nJust think of what would happen if that were the case and if then \nsomebody stood up on the floor of the Senate and said, well, if 10 \nyears ago that amendment would have passed and they would have taken an \ninventory, we could at least be taking a look to see whether we could \nuse our own oil that is in the ocean that we already know how to get \nout without destroying anything.\n\n  Experts agree that the country faces a crisis. Over time, \ntechnological advances have allowed us to identify additional oil and \ngas in areas where they once were thought to be in limited supply. In \n1995, the Federal Government estimated that the Gulf of Mexico \ncontained 95 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered natural gas. Five \nyears later, in 2000, which is not too long ago, that number was \nincreased to 193 trillion of undiscovered gas, an increase of 100 \npercent.\n  Restrictions on preleasing activities do not preclude environmental, \ngeological, physiological, economic engineering, or other scientific \nanalysis studies and evaluations. Congress passed its own drilling \nmoratoria. It included language in the conference report that \nspecifically provided for new studies. The statute says what I just \nstated, that restrictions on preleasing activities do not preclude \nenvironmental, geological, physiological, economic, and engineering \nactivities.\n  I am convinced that with the energy supply, a short supply in our \ncountry, the shortages in the 2000 and 2001 and the higher prices again \nthis year, we are going to need to take prudent steps.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is no surprise that informed people know what \nAmerica's concern is, such as the American Chemistry Council, American \nIron and Steel Institute, Council of Industrial Boiler Owners, National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Fertilizer Institute, the American \nGas Association, the Farm Bureau, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has also spoken out, not on this issue \nbut on natural gas prices and the shortage. He said: I am quite \nsurprised how little attention the natural gas problem has been getting \nbecause it is a very serious problem.\n  That is a true statement, and because of a committee that was asked \nto do work to plan a policy, we are doing something that Alan Greenspan \nsaid. He said he was surprised we are not doing more. We want to do \nmore. This more is a simplistic more. It is a let-us-know-what-we-have \nmore. That is all there is to it. Knowledge is better than no knowledge \nwhen it comes to problems. Knowledge of what you own is better than not \nknowing what you own, and that is the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \nvote is scheduled for 11:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time will expire at 11:15; that is correct.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would like to close on the \namendment that is sponsored by Senator Graham, and a number of other \nSenators, including this junior Senator from the State of Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, there are a lot of States that \nare quite concerned about this so-called inventory, or so-called \nsurvey, to be done with regard to oil and gas drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf off our respective States. Why are we concerned? In a \nbipartisan way, we have heard Senators from each of these coastal \nStates stand up in this debate that started last night and has \ncontinued through today tell the reasons, and they usually will boil \ndown to two reasons. I will give a third today.\n  The two reasons are usually: No. 1, the harm to our environment if \noil is spilled as a result of offshore drilling. In the experiences \nthis country has had, we clearly understand what that does to the \ncoastal environment.\n  There is a second reason that has been articulated in this debate, \nand it is that it will so devastatingly affect our State economies. In \nmost of our coastal States, the travel and tourism industry is \ninextricably entwined with the viability and the beauty of our beaches. \nIn the case of Florida, a coastline only exceeded by the coastline of a \nplace such as Alaska in number of miles, we have a $50 billion annual \ntourism industry. A lot of that is reflective upon the desirability of \npeople to enjoy our beautiful beaches.\n\n  So, too, in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. \nAnd so, too, with the extraordinary environment in New England, \nespecially in places such as Maine.\n  On the gulf coast of the United States, the Gulf of Mexico is \ngenerally divided into the eastern gulf, the central gulf, and the \nwestern gulf. There are 2,000 oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. All are \nin the central gulf off of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana and in \nthe western gulf off of Texas. Those particular States' populations \nsupport offshore oil drilling; on the eastern gulf, Floridians do not.\n  The Senate should listen to the coastal States. That is the first \npart of the argument. The second part of the argument is, where is the \noil and gas? The geology shows it is not in the eastern Gulf of Mexico \noff the State of Florida; it is where the oil wells are now in the \ncentral and western gulf.\n  We did a survey in the year 2000 and we are scheduled to do another \nsurvey in the year 2005, 2\\1/2\\ years from now. What is the rush? That \nis why we are suspicious. We think it is the inevitable push by the oil \ninterests playing out here, wanting to start drilling for oil and gas.\n  The debate articulated thus far is the environment and our economies. \nI mentioned a third reason. The third reason is the defense of this \ncountry, in the preparation of the defense of this country and the \ntraining that takes place off the coast of the United States. The \nmilitary cannot train with a carrier if there are oil rigs out there. \nSince the naval training facility at Vieques, Puerto Rico, is being \nshut down, a lot of that training is now off the east coast of the \nUnited States and the gulf coast. Specifically, a lot of that training \nwill occur off the coast of Eglin Air Force Base at Fort Walton Beach, \nthe Pensacola Naval Air Station at Pensacola, and Tyndall Air Force \nBase at Panama City. We are able to do this because of the advance of \ntechnology. You can virtually create the target area desired, although \nit is in unrestricted airspace over the waters--in this case, the Gulf \nof Mexico. Can we have that kind of training if there are oil and gas \nwells out there? The answer is no.\n\n[[Page S7750]]\n\n  The environment, the economy, and the preparation of our military to \nengage in the defense of this country are three obvious reasons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield the floor and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 884.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Liberman) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 44, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 221 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham (FL)\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Edwards\n     Lieberman\n       \n  The amendment (No. 884) was rejected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 824\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:15 p.m. \ntoday the Senate proceed to the consideration of calendar item No. 83, \nS. 824, FAA reauthorization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of \namendments that I will send to the desk be the only remaining first-\ndegree amendments in order to S. 14 other than any amendments which may \nbe pending at the time this agreement is entered; that any listed \nfirst-degree amendment be subject to second-degree amendments which \nmust be relevant to the first degree to which offered; and that if any \nfirst-degree amendment on the list is described as ``relevant,'' that \nthe definition of ``relevant'' be ``related to the subject matter of \nthe bill'' and/or ``energy related''; provided, further, that following \nthe disposition of the amendments which may be offered from the list, \nthe bill be read a third time; further, that the Senate then proceed to \nthe consideration of calendar No. 85, H.R. 6, the House Energy bill, \nand that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. \n14, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof; I further ask that H.R. 6 \nthen be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will suggest the absence of the quorum shortly, and we \nwill have a discussion in a few minutes among ourselves.\n  Mr. President, in terms of the course of the day, we would like to \nwork out the unanimous consent request just objected to, which had to \ndo with getting the amendments on both sides of the aisle, which we \nhave finally done after about a week and a half of discussion. That is \nreal progress. It allows us to focus and give some order to the range \nof issues that must be discussed on the Energy bill. They are all very \nimportant amendments.\n  It is absolutely critical that we come to an agreement on what those \namendments are so we can further that discussion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to ask a question about the issue \nof relevancy. That piqued my interest because we have had experience \nhere with respect to the definition of relevancy on amendments.\n  Could the majority leader explain it to me so that I understand the \nunanimous consent request that he had propounded dealing with \nrelevancy? I think there is some merit in the discussions going on to \ntry to get a list. I am not wanting to be destructive to that effort, \nbut I would like to understand the discussion about relevancy. That has \nbecome an increasingly important issue for many of us.\n  Mr. FRIST. Indeed, Mr. President. In response to my distinguished \ncolleague, the issue of relevance has become an issue. Therefore, in \nthe unanimous consent request I said, `` `relevant be related to the \nsubject matter of the bill' and/or energy related.'' That is really to \nadd what I think the Senator's concern is--is this relevancy going to \nbe so tight that something having to do with energy will be excluded? \nBy adding this clause, ``energy related,'' it is the understanding that \nwe will consider other amendments on the list.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield further, \nthat would satisfy my concerns, if I understand exactly what is \nintended by the leader. As I indicated, we have some concerns about the \nrelevancy issues and the determination of what is relevant. If the \nwording is as the majority leader suggested, that would satisfy my \nconcerns.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, do I \nunderstand correctly that there are 350 amendments pending?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Has anybody looked at those and decided which ones are \nrelevant?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, normally, we look at them when we get \nthem--both sides--and we make decisions and talk with the proponents \nand we winnow down the list. The answer is, not yet.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is my concern then, Mr. President. In all fairness \nto the Parliamentarian, the definition of relevancy, even as we define \nit may turn out to be a lot different when individual amendments are \nactually offered. I would object to the UC if it includes reference to \nrelevancy until we have had a chance to look and determine whether my \namendments or any others are irrelevant. Amendments have been written \nand a decision can be made.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection was already heard on the proffered \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, my understanding from the \nmajority leader is that it is not the relevancy determined by the \nParliamentarian, but they must be related to the subject of energy, \nwhich is infinitely a broader definition. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield, there is one other \nclarification I think is important, and that is we have had a lot to do \nwith putting the list together. There is no relevancy requirement for \nfirst-degree amendments. If it is stated as an amendment to the Energy \nbill, it can be on any subject matter. If it says relevant, then\n\n[[Page S7751]]\n\nwe will use, as the distinguished majority leader has noted, the \ncriteria he has laid out, subject generally to the energy issue.\n  So the relevancy requirement is only a requirement in those areas \nwhere relevancy is listed as a factor in the amendment itself. There is \nno relevancy with regard to first-degree amendments.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the leader, in reference to second-degree \namendments, is there a relevancy requirement?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there always has been on the first \ndegree to which they are offered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Once again, I renew the unanimous consent request that I \npropounded and the proposal as spelled out before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, first of all, I'll comment on this \nrelevancy issue. I believe there is an understanding among the managers \nand the leadership. So I am confident we will be able to take care of \nthe concerns just expressed.\n  With regard to the schedule, we will be turning to one more amendment \non energy, which Senator Campbell will be putting forward in a few \nminutes.\n  After that, at 12:15 today, we will be turning to consideration of \nthe FAA reauthorization. My intent is to complete this FAA \nreauthorization before we leave for the weekend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I briefly want to thank the leaders, \nparticularly the majority leader, for helping to get the last Senators \nto sign up. This means we will get an Energy bill that contains plenty \nof what people want. It has ethanol and, before we are finished, it \nwill have all of the what people want with reference to the \ncontinuation of wind and related energies.\n  This just means people will have every opportunity to look at \namendments, and they have listed everything under the sun. There will \nbe a chance to work on them. We thank everyone for cooperating. It \nlooks to me that, with the majority leader and minority leader helping \nus, after we return from the recess, we can complete this bill in a \nweek, based upon us finally having this list. I thank everybody.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 886\n\n(Purpose: To replace ``tribal consortia'' with ``tribal energy resource \n          development organizations,'' and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 886.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I will try to explain the amendment. \nIndian lands comprise approximately 5 percent of the land area in the \nUnited States but contain an estimated 10 percent of all energy \nreserves in the United States, including 30 percent of the known coal \ndeposits located in the western portion of the U.S.; 5 percent of the \nknown onshore oil deposits of the U.S.; and 10 percent of the known \nonshore natural gas deposits in the United States.\n  Coal, oil, natural gas, and other energy minerals produced from \nIndian land represent more than 10 percent of the total nationwide \nonshore production of energy minerals.\n  Even though in 1 year alone over 9.3 million barrels of oil, 299 \nbillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 21 million tons of coal were \nproduced from Indian land, representing $700 million in Indian energy \nrevenue, the Department of the Interior estimates that only 25 percent \nof the oil and less than 20 percent of all natural gas reserves on \nIndian land have been fully developed.\n  I have put up a pie chart to show the relationship of realized \nrevenue and potential or unrealized revenue.\n  Despite what we may read once in a while in the Washington Post or \nNew York Times about the so-called ``rich Indians'' and Indian \ngambling, it is also indisputable that Indians are the most \neconomically deprived group in the United States, with unemployment \nlevels far above the national average--in some cases well over 70 \npercent--and per capita incomes well below the national average.\n  The Labor Department just released the latest unemployment figures \nfor the United States, which were about 6.1 percent, and they say that \nis the highest in 10 years. If you think 6.1 percent is bad, try 70 \npercent. For every tribe that is doing pretty well, there are 10 that \nare just barely making it through their daily lives.\n  Indian country suffers from the highest substandard housing, poor \nhealth, alcohol and drug abuse, diabetes and amputations, and a general \nmalaise and hopelessness, even a high suicide rate among teenagers. \nGiven the vast potential wealth residing in energy resources which \ncould change this deprivation, it has long been a puzzle why these \nresources have not been more fully developed.\n  The answer lies partly in the fact that the energy research \ndevelopment is, by its very nature, capital intensive. Most tribes \nsimply do not have the financial wherewithal to fund extensive energy \nprojects on their own and so they must lease out their energy resources \nin return for royalty payments.\n  History also plays a big part in the evolution of this problem. \nToward the end of the 19th century, Indian tribes were forcibly \nrelocated to isolated areas and reservations where it was believed they \nwould not hinder the westward expansion of the U.S. Government.\n  The natural resources on those lands were taken into trust by the \nFederal Government, to be administered for the benefit of Indian \ntribes. The ostensible reason for the trust was the belief that Indians \nwere incapable of administering their own resources and would be \nsusceptible to land and resource predators.\n  A legal and bureaucratic apparatus was formed to administer this \ntrust, and over a century later this apparatus remains in place.\n  In her capacity as trustee of Indian resources, the Secretary of the \nInterior must review each and every lease of Indian trust resources to \nensure the terms of the lease benefit the tribe and that the trust \nasset is not wasted.\n  However, this review and approval process is often so lengthy that \npotential lessees or investors that otherwise would like to partner \nwith Indian tribes to develop their energy resources are reluctant to \nbecome entangled in the bureaucratic redtape that inevitably \naccompanies the leasing of tribal resources.\n  Hence, the framework that was originally designed to protect tribes \nhas also become a disincentive to the development of tribal resources.\n  This is a case now, of course, of what fit the 19th century does not \nfit the modern day, and the Indians have the ability and right to make \ntheir own decision.\n  To help remedy these problems, earlier this year I, along with \nSenator Domenici, introduced the Indian Tribal Energy Development and \nSelf-Determination Act of 2003 to provide assistance and encouragement \nto Indian tribes to develop their energy resources. This not only would \nhelp the tribal economy but it would help make us less dependent on \nforeign energy.\n  The assistance included the establishment of an Indian Energy Office; \ngrants, loans, and technical assistance; capacity building; and \nregulatory changes to the rules governing the leasing of Indian lands \nfor energy purposes.\n  At the same time, the other Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, \nintroduced his own Indian Energy bill, S. 424, that mirrored my bill. \nAfter several hearings and much debate, I merged the best of these two \nbills into a composite bill that came to be title III of the bill \nbefore us.\n  There are two major differences between the Bingaman bill, which was \noffered as a second-degree amendment yesterday, and our bill. That \nsecond-degree amendment was defeated, by the\n\n[[Page S7752]]\n\nway, as my colleagues know. If I had not withdrawn my amendment we \nwould not need to proceed any further than we did yesterday.\n  One of the most important features of title III of S. 14 is section \n2604 which deals with leases, business arrangements, and rights-of-way \ninvolving energy development and transmission.\n  Section 2604 establishes a voluntary process for those tribes that \nchoose it to help develop their energy resources. No tribe is required \nto participate. They do not have to if they do not wish to, but if they \ndo participate, under the process, an Indian tribe must first \ndemonstrate to the Secretary of the Interior that it has the technical \nand financial capacity to develop and manage its own resources. Once it \nmeets this burden, the tribe can negotiate energy resource development \nleases, agreements, and rights-of-way with third parties without first \nobtaining the Secretary's approval. That will not, however, circumvent \nthe NEPA process. It will simply transfer the responsibility of NEPA \ncompliance to the Secretary of the Interior.\n  By the way, this second chart points out very clearly under existing \nlaw that Indian tribes do not have to come under the jurisdiction of \nNEPA. If they use their own money on their own land, they are treated \nas State land, private land, or non-Federal land. They do not have to \ncomply with NEPA. Only if they go to outside investors to get \ninvestment money do they have to comply with NEPA.\n  This bill will provide streamlining to the leasing process that is \nnow burdened with this disparity in Federal regulation. Under current \nlaw, in order to be valid, all leases, business agreements, and the \nrights-of-way involving tribal trust or restricted lands must be \nsubmitted to and approved by the Secretary of the Interior.\n  Section 2604 provides tribes with the option of submitting to the \nSecretary a proposed government-to-government agreement, a ``tribal \nenergy resource agreement,'' called TERA, that will set forth mandatory \nprovisions for future leases, business agreements, and rights-of-way \ninvolving energy development on tribal lands.\n  If approved by the Secretary, the TERA will govern the future \ndevelopment of that tribe's energy resources. The TERA, by virtue of \nthis section, will require tribal leases and agreements to have certain \nbusiness terms, require compliance with all applicable environmental \nlaws, notice to the public, and consultation with the States as to the \npotential off-reservation impact.\n\n  That was one of Senator Bingaman's concerns yesterday, consultation \nwith off-reservation groups. That is covered in this amendment.\n  Remember, current law does not require tribes to comply with NEPA if \nthey use their own land. However, neither the TERA nor any provision of \ntitle III would operate to subject the tribe's decision to enter into a \nparticular energy lease or agreement to the provisions of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969. The Secretary, in deciding whether to \napprove the TERA, would be required to examine the potential direct \nimpacts of her decision under NEPA. The tribe would have to develop an \nenvironmental review process. It would have to follow it thereafter. \nThe tribe itself would not be subject to NEPA but, as I said, that \nresponsibility would be transferred to the Secretary.\n  There have been disincentives for poor tribes because they simply \ncannot afford to develop energy on their own land and thereby not \ncomply with NEPA. It does not diminish the NEPA process at all. Under \ncurrent law, if an Indian tribe chooses to develop its own energy \nresources using its own funds and, as I mentioned, there is no lease or \nSecretary approval, NEPA is not necessary.\n  It is not mineral development per se that triggers NEPA; it is the \nFederal action, the approval of the Secretary is what triggers NEPA.\n  I wish to mention there was also a concern that section 2604 would \nsomehow diminish tribal sovereignty. I know that was Senator Inouye's \nconcern. It dealt really with trust responsibility. But the amendment I \nam offering today does not weaken the Government's obligations to \nIndian tribes to absolve it of its duties.\n  I point out on page 14, line 18 to page 15, line 3. If my colleagues \ncannot clearly read this, I will read it for them:\n\n       (6)(A) Nothing in this section shall absolve the United \n     States of any responsibility to Indians or Indian tribes, \n     including those which derive from the trust relationship or \n     from any treaties, Executive Orders, or agreements between \n     the United States and any Indian tribe.\n       (B) The Secretary shall continue to have a trust obligation \n     to ensure that the rights of an Indian tribe are protected in \n     the event of a violation of federal law or the terms of any \n     lease, business agreement, or right-of-way under this section \n     by any other party to any such lease, business agreement, or \n     right-of-way.\n       (C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the United States \n     shall not be liable to any party (including any Indian tribe) \n     for any of the terms of, or any losses resulting from the \n     terms of, a lease, business agreement, or a right-of-way \n     executed pursuant to and in accordance with a tribal energy \n     resources agreement approved by the subsection (e)(2).\n\n  Subparagraph (C) is basically new. If the Secretary has no input at \nall in developing the agreement, then we are concerned that the Federal \nGovernment should have a liability component if they did not have \nanything to do with helping decide the issue.\n  In any event, I remind my colleagues that Native Americans are the \nonly group in the United States who believe that the Earth is their \nmother, and they certainly do not need to be told how to take care of \nthe Earth because it is in their religion. It is in their nature and \nhas been for thousands of years. It is in their culture. It is a \ncultural thing with which youngsters grow up. For that matter, they do \nnot need the Senate to tell them how to take care of the Earth either. \nAn Indian mandate to take care of the Earth comes from a higher order \nthan the Senate, and it is sometimes found insulting to be told that \nthey need the Government to oversee what their own religion and culture \nteach them from childhood.\n  That is why so many tribes do support the Campbell-Domenici \namendment, and I will list them, as I did the other day. A few more \nhave come in: The National Congress of American Indians, which \nrepresents over 300 tribes; the Council of Energy Resource Tribes, \nwhich represents 50 energy-producing tribes. We have a number of \nindividual letters from the Cherokee Nation, which is the largest \nIndian tribe in the United States; from the Chickasaw Nation, another \nvery progressive and highly respected tribe in Oklahoma; from the \nMohegan Tribe; from the Five Sandoval Indian Pueblos, which is in New \nMexico; the Jicarilla Apache Tribe; the Oneida Indian Nation; the \nEastern Shoshone Tribe of the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, which \nreceives a very large share of its governmental revenues from oil and \ngas production on its tribal lands; also from the National Tribal \nEnvironmental Council, an organization in Albuquerque, whose membership \nincludes over 180 tribal governments; the Southern Ute Indian Tribal \nCouncil; the Native American Energy Group; the United South and Eastern \nTribes, an organization consisting of 22 tribes located on the eastern \nseaboard from Maine to Florida. Also, support continues to come in. One \nnon-Indian group that has submitted support is the U.S. National \nChamber of Commerce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those letters of support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe record, as follows:\n                                              National Congress of\n\n\n                                             American Indians,\n\n                                                     June 2, 2003.\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: This letter is to offer general \n     support for the Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-\n     Determination Act of 2003 (Title III). Sine the release of \n     your mark in April, NCAI has been working feverishly to offer \n     a solution to the concerns expressed by tribal \n     representatives. NCAI engaged in this effort so that we could \n     provide general support for this significant piece of \n     legislation once these concerns were addressed. Through this \n     collaborative process, we believe this legislation has the \n     potential to enhance economic development initiatives and \n     will be of great benefit to economic development in Indian \n     country.\n       As you may be aware, concerns were raised by a number of \n     tribes and tribal advocates regarding some provisions of the \n     Chairman's mark for this measure. We shared in their concern \n     regarding provisions that significantly limit the United \n     State's liability and\n\n[[Page S7753]]\n\n     release the Secretary of Interior from any accountability to \n     Indian tribes for actions that she is required to undertake \n     pursuant to the legislation. Additionally, we were concerned \n     about the definition of ``tribal consortium'' which differed \n     greatly from the definition that is traditionally employed in \n     legislation affecting Indian tribes and offers federal money \n     to non-tribal entities that should be going to Indian tribes. \n     In addition to these two central concerns, we were not \n     satisfied with provisions pertaining to environmental review \n     and we had some general drafting-related issues.\n       Given these concerns, NCAI has convened several conference \n     calls with tribal representatives including the Navajo \n     Nation, Council of Energy Resources Tribes, and the \n     Intertribal Council on Utility Policy, and developed a series \n     of tribal recommendations for modifying Title III. We also \n     convened with your staff and Senate Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee staff to discuss the tribal \n     recommendations. Thereafter your staff held a conference call \n     for those same representatives and staffers from the Senate \n     Energy and Natural Resource Committee. Although we are \n     pleased that we were able to craft better language for the \n     trust responsibility provisions, we are still concerned with \n     some of the limitations.\n       Nonetheless, we realize that in this political climate, the \n     language as currently revised is likely the best compromise \n     that can be reached. We appreciate the effort of your staff \n     and other committee staffers to negotiate language that \n     attempts to address the tribal concerns in light of the \n     current political environment. Again, I want to underscore \n     that the tribal support comes from working with a group of \n     tribal representatives and organizations from diverse \n     perspectives, but not all perspectives. Because of this, our \n     revised version of your mark may not reflect the needs and \n     desires of all tribes who wish to utilize this legislation to \n     develop their energy resources.\n       We would like to thank you and your staff for all of their \n     hard work on this very important issue. I cannot stress \n     enough how grateful we are to your commitment to developing \n     legislative solutions to age-old problems in Indian country. \n     Title III is just one more example of how Indian tribes \n     benefit from your championship.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jacqueline Johnson\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Council of Energy Resource Tribes,\n\n                                         Denver, CO, June 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: On behalf of the 53 CERT member \n     Tribes, I am writing to express CERT's support for the Title \n     III Indian Energy provisions of S. 14.\n       As you know, there are some provisions in section 2604 of \n     the Title III of the bill as reported that has caused concern \n     among CERT member Tribes. Fortunately, we believe those \n     concerns have largely been addressed by language agreed to \n     between Committee staff and representatives of CERT and \n     several member Tribes. At this time, we believe we have \n     reached agreement that addresses the concerns of CERT and the \n     Southern Ute Indian Tribe, the Navajo Nation and the \n     Jicarilla Apache Nation. We expect you will hear from each of \n     those Tribes as well.\n       CERT has agreed to language that insures that the Tribal \n     Energy Resource Agreements (TERA) process is a voluntary, \n     opt-in program for development of Tribal energy resources. We \n     have also agreed to language to be certain that the public \n     comment opportunities go to the environmental and other \n     impacts of the development and not to the terms of the \n     business agreements themselves. CERT accepts the revised \n     language that better describes the Secretary's trust duties \n     under this section. Finally, the scope of the Secretary's \n     NEPA review of the TERA is settled.\n       While drafting final language for this section has been \n     somewhat difficult, we compliment the staff of both the \n     Senate Energy Committee and the Senate Indian Affairs \n     Committee for their dedication to resolving the remaining \n     differences between us on language relating to trust \n     protections and environmental issues.\n       Again, we are pleased to support Title III with these \n     changes to section 2604 and appreciate your steadfast support \n     of the right of Indian Tribes to gain a better measure of \n     control over the development of energy resources on their own \n     lands.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  A. David Lester,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Cherokee Nation,\n\n                                      Tahlequah, OK, June 2, 2003.\n     Hon.

Inouye,\n     Vice, Chairman, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman: It has come to my \n     attention that several changes have been made to Title III of \n     the Senate Energy bill. I understand that these changes will \n     reduce any risk to Tribes, and wish to offer the Cherokee \n     Nation's continued support of S. 14, the Energy Policy Act of \n     2003.\n       I thank the Committee for its hard work on this issue and \n     for incorporating tribal recommendations into the bill. Your \n     leadership is greatly appreciated.\n       Please feel free to contact my office if you have any \n     questions or comments, I may be reached at (918) 456-0671.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Chad Smith,\n     Principal Chief.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                         The Chickasaw Nation,\n\n                                            Ada, OK, June 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We support the inclusion of Title III, \n     as it is, in Senate Bill 14. Thoughtful development of our \n     tribal natural resources serves all Americans.\n       We are grateful for the opportunities and support Title III \n     provides to the Chickasaw Nation, and for all of Indian \n     Country, as we explore and develop our natural resources. The \n     language allows us to exercise our own progressive style in \n     development and regulation; yet, it provides for those tribe \n     which prefer the more traditional approach.\n       Having a voice in the U.S. Department of Energy will \n     highlight and expedite tribal energy issues. This is an \n     opportunity for every tribe to enter into the nation's \n     economic mainstream with the support of the federal \n     government.\n       Your help, and that of Senators Bingaman and Domenici, is \n     appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Bill Anoatubby,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            The Mohegan Tribe,\n\n                                     Uncasville, CT, June 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Mohegan Tribe supports the inclusion \n     of Title III in S. 14, the Energy Policy Act of 2003. \n     Offering flexibility and support in developing natural \n     resources throughout Indian Country, Title III creates \n     opportunities in which all Indian nations can benefit. We \n     also appreciate the hard work of Senators Domenici and \n     Bingaman in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mark F.

We appreciate all aspects of the language \n     and the flexibility it creates with obvious regard for the \n     individual strengths and needs of each tribe.\n       We are grateful to Senator Domenici and to Senator Bingaman \n     for their thoughtful hard work and leadership on our behalf.\n       Having Title III in the Energy bill provides every tribal \n     nation in this country an opportunity to enter into the \n     nation's economic mainstream through development of their \n     natural resources.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         James Roger Madalena,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Five Sandoval Indian Pueblos, Inc.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  The Jicarilla Apache Nation,\n\n                                          Dulce, NM, June 9, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Domenici: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Jicarilla Apache Nation (``Nation'') to express our general \n     support for the Indian Energy Title in S. 14. This \n     legislation will provide a strong policy directive for the \n     Department of Energy to formalize and institutionalize its \n     support of tribal energy development needs, and the \n     legislation will provide critical resources and tools for \n     Tribes to access for these purposes. We applaud your focus on \n     Indian energy and commitment to addressing the energy needs \n     of Indian Tribes in New Mexico and across the country.\n       Oil and gas development on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation \n     is critical to our tribal governmental operations. Our \n     Reservation is located on the eastern edge of the Sam Juan \n     Basin, the second largest gas field in the lower 48 states. \n     The Nation relies on revenue generated from the development \n     and production of our oil and gas to provide essential \n     government services to our members and other residents; \n     revenue from royalties and taxes accounts for over 90% of the \n     Nation's operating budget. Clearly, the legislation at hand \n     is extremely important to the Nation.\n       During the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \n     markup of the Indian Energy Title in late April, the Nation \n     expressed concerns with some of those provisions. In the past \n     month, the Nation joined a tribal workgroup which included \n     the National Congress of American Indian (NCAI), the Council \n     of Energy Resource Tribes (CERT), the Navajo Nation, the \n     Southern Ute Tribe and other tribal representatives in \n     developing language to address some of our mutual concerns. \n     The tribal workgroup presented and\n\n[[Page S7754]]\n\n     discussed our proposed language in several key discussions \n     with staff from both the Senate Indian Affairs and Energy & \n     Natural Resources Committee. We appreciate your efforts and \n     that of your committee staff to work with the Tribes and \n     be responsive to our concerns.\n       We arrived at a compromise that was deemed to be the most \n     political viable approach given that the energy bill is \n     currently being debated on the Senate floor and the fact that \n     the House has already passed its energy bill which does not \n     include a comprehensive Indian energy title. The Nation \n     believes that this collaborative effort addressed most of the \n     central concerns that we raised.\n       Specifically, the Nation's primary concern relate to \n     section 2406, the provisions on leases, business agreements, \n     and rights-of-way involving energy development or \n     transmissions. The policy goals of this measure, as stated in \n     Section 2602(a), would be ``to assist Indian tribes in the \n     development of energy resources and further the goal of \n     Indian self-determination.'' Section 2604 would establish a \n     voluntary program, through a Tribal Energy Resource Agreement \n     (TERA) submitted by a Tribe for approval by the Secretary of \n     the Interior. The TERA approach provides a mechanism for \n     participating Tribes to streamline the approval process for \n     energy development on Indian Reservations. While the Nation \n     does not take issue with these important objectives, we have \n     concerns about Section 2604's impact on the United States' \n     Indian trust responsibility.\n       For instance, Section 2604(7)(A) would absolve the \n     Secretary of any liability ``for any loss or injury sustained \n     by any party (including an Indian tribe or any member of an \n     Indian tribe) to a lease, business agreement, or right-of-way \n     executed in accordance with tribal energy resource agreements \n     approved under this subsection.'' Section 2604(7)(B) would \n     further bar an Indian Tribe ``from asserting a claim against \n     the United States on the grounds that the Secretary should \n     not have approved the Tribal energy resource agreement.'' The \n     Nation, along with NCAI, CERT, the Navajo Nation and others \n     strongly objected to these provisions because they would \n     significantly limit the United States' liability and release \n     the Secretary from any accountability to Indian tribes for \n     actions that she is required to undertake pursuant to the \n     legislation.\n       To address these concerns, the tribal workgroup first \n     proposed to delete the language that would bar an Indian \n     Tribe from asserting a claim against the Secretary for her \n     failure to abide by the statutory directive in the \n     legislation itself. Second, we proposed a more concrete \n     recognition of the general Indian trust responsibility and \n     language reaffirming the Secretary's specific trust \n     obligation ``to ensure that the rights of an Indian tribe are \n     protected in the event of a violation of federal law or the \n     terms of any lease, business agreement or right-of-way under \n     this section by any other party to any such lease, business \n     agreement or right-of-way.'' With regard to the release of \n     the Secretary's lability, we limited such release of \n     liability to ``any of the terms of, or any losses resulting \n     from the terms of, a lease, business agreement, or right-of-\n     way executed pursuant to and in accordance with tribal energy \n     resource agreements'' approved under section 2604(e)(2). Our \n     proposed language would limit the liability question to the \n     specific terms agreed to by a Tribe in the TERA itself, and \n     would not affect existing statutory and regulatory duties and \n     obligations of the Secretary in the management of trust \n     minerals and other assets. We understand that these \n     changes were deemed to be acceptable by Committee staff.\n       These changes are vitally important to the Nation's on-\n     going activities in auditing and overseeing royalty \n     collections of our oil and gas leases. The Nation has a \n     cooperative agreement with the Secretary pursuant to Section \n     202 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 \n     (FOGRMA), to carry out inspection, auditing, investigation, \n     enforcement and other oil and gas royalty management \n     functions. Under this statutory scheme, the Nation has taken \n     a lead role in performing these functions, and even has an \n     office set up in the Mineral Management Service (MMS) in \n     Dallas, Texas. The MMS provides operational costs to the \n     Nation under the 202 Agreement, and works closely with us to \n     ensure compliance with leases and the various statutory \n     royalty payment requirements. FOGRMA does not release the \n     Secretary from liability for the functions taken over by the \n     Nation, but rather embraces an approach that provides an \n     avenue for tribal self-determination while keeping the \n     federal Indian trust responsibility fully intact. If the \n     Nation were to consider entering into a TERA at some point in \n     the future, we would likely do so without releasing the \n     Secretary of her responsibility under the 202 Agreement. \n     Therefore, the language crafted by the tribal workgroup is \n     extremely important to ensure the vitality of these specific \n     FOGRMA provisions as well as relevant judicial decisions that \n     delineate the Secretary's obligations in the leasing of oil \n     and gas on our Reservation.\n       The Nation also endorses other revisions negotiated by the \n     tribal workgroup regarding the definition of ``tribal \n     consortium'' and the provisions pertaining to the \n     environmental review process. We believe our central concerns \n     have been satisfied to ensure that federal money authorized \n     by the legislation be directed to Indian Tribes and not to \n     non-tribal entities that may use Tribes as a front for these \n     purposes. We also worked to ensure that Tribes not be overly \n     burdened in the environmental review process and that public \n     notification and commenting requirements be limited to the \n     environmental document while ensuring that a Tribe's \n     proprietary and business dealings be protected from public \n     disclosure. With regard to our concerns about the \n     legislation's lack of capacity building assurance, the Nation \n     will continue to raise such concerns in the context of the \n     appropriations process to implement the legislation.\n       While not a part of the Indian Energy Title, the Nation \n     continues to pursue and support the enactment of a federal \n     tax credit for Indian oil and gas production to stimulate \n     additional domestic production. We supported your bill (S. \n     1106) in the 107th Congress to establish a federal tax credit \n     based on the volume of production of oil and gas from Indian \n     lands. This type of a credit would make our reserves more \n     competitive and increase the return on our nonrenewable trust \n     resources. Generating significant new revenue to tribal \n     mineral owners, in the form of tax credits, royalties, and \n     tribal taxes, tax incentives would stimulate tribal economies \n     and increase the overall domestic oil and gas supplies, \n     thereby reducing the United States dependency on foreign \n     sources of energy. We urge your continued support for this \n     measure during the floor consideration of the energy tax \n     provisions.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views. As always, \n     we appreciate your strong leadership and understanding of our \n     needs. Please contact me in Dulce at (505) 759-3242 if you \n     have any questions or need additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Claudia Vigil-Muniz,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Oneida Indian Nation,\n\n\n                                      Oneida Nation Homelands,\n\n                                        Veruna, NY, June 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Campbell: On behalf of the Oneida Indian \n     Nation of New York, I am writing in support of S. 14, \n     specifically Title III, the Indian Tribal Energy Development \n     and Self-Determination Act of 2003. This bill will \n     significantly strengthen the ability of Indian tribes to \n     develop the energy resources that are currently going \n     underutilized on their land.\n       Your legislation will create a mechanism to allow Indian \n     nations access to grants and low-interest loans from a newly \n     established Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs. The \n     legislation would allow certain tribes to cut through the red \n     tape that has discouraged third parties from investing in \n     Native American energy in the past.\n       In addition, under the legislation, federal agencies may \n     provide preference in Indian firms when purchasing energy; \n     this will help the new industry get started while also \n     promoting national energy self-sufficiency. Energy production \n     is a capital-intensive industry, and without the assistance \n     of your bill, too many tribes will remain mired in dismal \n     economic limbo.\n       The bill will help to bring electricity to the 14.2 percent \n     of Indian homes that now have none. And by encouraging the \n     vertical integration of tribal energy resources, the bill \n     will help to bring jobs to reservation communities, where \n     unemployment levels have reached as high as 70 percent.\n       The Oneida Indian Nation of New York appreciates your \n     leadership in tackling the myriad challenges facing Indian \n     Country. The Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-\n     Determination Act of 2003 is a positive step that not only \n     makes sound national energy policy but would provide Indian \n     nations with additional tools in their efforts to become \n     self-sufficient and self-determining.\n           Naki'wa,\n                                                   Ray Halbritter,\n     Nation Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 9, 2003.\n     Re supporting Campbell-Domenici amendment to Title III--\n         Indian Energy Title to S. 14, The Energy Policy Act of \n         2003.\n\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Senate Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici: On behalf of the Eastern Shoshone \n     Tribe of the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, I am writing \n     in support of the Campbell-Domenici amendment to the Indian \n     Energy Title in S. 14. Our Tribe participated in the tribal \n     workgroup effort which resulted in the amended language \n     embodies in this amendment. We appreciate your efforts and \n     that of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources and Indian \n     Affairs Committee staff to work with our tribal workgroup to \n     resolve some of the earlier controversial provisions.\n       The Eastern Shoshone Tribe and the Northern Arapaho Tribe \n     share the Wind River Reservation, which encompasses over 2.2 \n     million acres with significant quantities of oil and gas \n     reserves. The production of oil and gas reserves on the Wind \n     River Reservation is the primary source of revenue for the \n     Tribes accounting for over 90% of the Tribes' governmental \n     revenue. Accordingly, the Wind River Reservation Tribes have \n     a keen interest in supporting the enactment of comprehensive \n     energy legislation for Indian reservation development.\n       In summary, we believe that the Campbell-Domenici amendment \n     addresses our primary\n\n[[Page S7755]]\n\n     concerns regarding the United States trust relationship owed \n     to Indian Tribes in the context of mineral production, \n     protection of sensitive tribal business dealing, and a sound \n     environmental review process. Specifically, the amendment \n     eliminates language that would have barred an Indian Tribe \n     from asserting a claim against the Secretary for her failure \n     to abide by the statutory directive in the legislation \n     itself. The amendment also provides a specific affirmation of \n     the United States' trust responsibility and duty to ensure \n     that the rights of an Indian tribe are protected against \n     statutory or lease violations of leases executed pursuant to \n     secretarial approved Tribal Energy Resource Agreements \n     (TERA). Moreover, the Campbell-Domenici amendment \n     appropriately limits the release of the Secretary's liability \n     to the specific terms agreed to by a Tribe in the TERA \n     itself. Accordingly, this language would not affect existing \n     statutory and regulatory duties and obligations of the \n     Secretary in the management of trust minerals and other \n     assets. Finally, the Campbell-Domenici amendment addresses \n     our concerns that a Tribe's sensitive commercial business \n     dealing are protected from public disclosure and that Tribes \n     not be subject to overly burdensome environmental review \n     requirements.\n       The Eastern Shoshone Tribe remains concerned with capacity \n     building for Tribes interested in pursuing a TERA. Given the \n     immediate movement of the legislation, however, we do not \n     believe these concerns should prevent Congress from acting \n     favorably on the entire Indian Energy Title. We will urge \n     full support for tribal capacity during the appropriations \n     process.\n       I would also like to take this opportunity to apprise you \n     of our efforts with Senator Thomas to secure an amendment in \n     the energy tax title for a federal tax credit for oil and gas \n     produced on Indian lands. This provision is similar to the \n     bill, S. 1106, you introduced in the 107th Congress which \n     would structure the credit based on the volume of production \n     of oil and gas from Indian lands. This type of a credit would \n     make our reserves more competitive and increase the return on \n     our nonrenewable trust resources. The proposal would not only \n     generate new revenue to tribal mineral owners, it would also \n     stimulate tribal economies and contribute to the Nation's \n     domestic oil and gas supply. We are awaiting the revenue \n     estimate from the Joint Taxation Committee, and we urge your \n     continued support for this proposal during the floor debate \n     on energy tax provisions.\n       In closing, I want to again express our appreciate to you, \n     and recognize the efforts of Senator Thomas, in moving \n     forward with the historic piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Vernon Hill,\n     Chairman, Eastern Shoshone Tribe.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   National Tribal\n\n\n                                        Environmental Council,\n\n                                    Albuquerque, NM, June 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Senator Ben Nighthorse-Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nighthorse-Campbell: On behalf of the National \n     Tribal Environmental Council, we are writing in support of \n     the Title III Indian Energy Provisions in S. 14.\n       The National Tribal Environmental Council is a not-for-\n     profit organization with a membership comprised of over 180 \n     tribal governments. As such, we strongly support the \n     principle embodied in the authorizing language of the \n     amendment that Tribes can develop their energy resources in a \n     manner that respects the ecological integrity of their \n     reservation environments as well as their sacred sites, \n     cultural resources, historical, archeological resources and \n     other cultural patrimony.\n       We condition our support of Title III to acknowledge that \n     we are aware of the serious concerns of the Navajo Nation \n     that this legislation has the potential to legislate the \n     recent Supreme Court decision against their interests. We \n     respectfully request you consider clarifying the legislative \n     history to reflect the fact that the Secretary must continue \n     to act in the best interests of the Indian tribe, as was \n     similarly included in the Indian Minerals Development Act of \n     1982.\n       Another concern we have with the provisions of Sec 2604 of \n     the Title III is not the delegation of federal authority \n     based on the voluntary opt-in program but the potential for \n     the federal responsibility to transfer to the tribes without \n     the commensurate resources to ensure an adequate the tribal \n     regulatory infrastructure.\n       As you know, tribal governments have been struggling but \n     succeeding in their efforts to develop complex and tribal-\n     specific environmental programs with very limited resources. \n     Maintaining the trend of increasingly sophisticated and \n     consistent implementation of tribal environmental processes \n     and standards on a national scale is dependent on increased \n     funding. Adding additional needs to the tribal governments at \n     this time--without adequate funding--is cause for concern. \n     This is a concern, however, that we will voice as part of the \n     appropriations process and it should not be viewed as \n     undermining our support for the Senate amendments to S. 14.\n       Thank you for this opportunity to support this important \n     initiative for Indian Country and for your on-going efforts \n     to recognize and include Indian Country in these important \n     national policy debates.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David F. Conrad,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Southern Ute Indian\n\n\n                                               Tribal Council,\n\n                                        Ignacio, CO, May 27, 2003.\n     Re Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination \n         Act of 2003; S. 14, Title III.\n\n     Chairman Pete V. Domenici,\n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici: Approximately one month ago, the \n     Southern Ute Indian Tribe submitted a statement of \n     conceptual, but qualified, support for the Indian Tribal \n     Energy Development and Self-Determination Act of 2003. Our \n     Tribe's activities have shown that tribal energy development \n     can provide tremendous economic development opportunities for \n     tribes while simultaneously assisting the Nation in meeting \n     its energy demands. For tribes that have demonstrated the \n     capacity to represent themselves effectively in energy \n     development activities, we have long-advocated legislation \n     that would provide the option of bypassing the stifling \n     effects of the Bureau of Indian Affairs approval requirements \n     applicable to tribal leases, business agreements and rights-\n     of-way. The reference legislation addressed this very matter, \n     however, as Section 2604 of Title III emerged from the Senate \n     Committee of Indian Affairs and the Senate Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources, it contained a number of \n     provisions that were objectionable to the Indian community.\n       Over the last month, committee staff members and \n     representatives of tribes and Indian organizations have \n     engaged in an intense dialogue about the problems in the \n     draft legislation, and, as a result of their tireless \n     efforts, proposed amendments have been developed that would \n     eliminate the problems previously identified. A list of those \n     proposed amendments is attached for reference purposes. Among \n     the different matters resolved to our satisfaction have been \n     the following: (i) confirmation that Section 2604 is a \n     voluntary program available to Tribes on an opt-in/opt-out \n     basis; (ii) inclusion of pre-approval public notice and \n     comment opportunities regarding the environmental impacts of \n     a proposed tribal mineral lease, business agreement or right-\n     of-way, but preservation of the confidentiality of the \n     business terms of such documents; (iii) acceptable balancing \n     of the limitations on and ongoing responsibility of the \n     Secretary to perform trust duties associated with a \n     participating tribe's activities undertaken pursuant to this \n     legislation; and (iv) confirmation of the appropriate scope \n     of NEPA review that would be associated with the Secretary's \n     decision to approve a Tribal Energy Resource Agreement \n     (``TERA''), which is the enabling document permitting a tribe \n     to proceed with independent development of mineral leases, \n     business agreements, or rights-of-way. Again, we helped \n     develop and wholly support these amendments.\n       During the course of debate on this legislation, some have \n     suggested that Section 2604 will eliminate effective \n     environmental protection on affected tribal lands. We want to \n     assure the members of the Senate that this is not the case. \n     Energy resource development by a tribe generally carries with \n     it a deep commitment to preserving one's backyard. Tribal \n     leaders are directly accountable to their members for \n     preserving environmental resources. In the Four Corners \n     Region, it is not unusual for private landowners or BLM \n     lessees to comment enviously on the environmental diligence \n     employed by our Tribe in the development of our energy \n     resources. We renew our invitation to members of the Senate \n     to visit our Reservation and see first-hand our energy \n     resource projects.\n       In conclusion, with the referenced amendments, we strongly \n     support S. 14, Title III. We urge other members of the Senate \n     to also support this legislation, and we commend those who \n     have worked toward its development and passage.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                      Howard D. Richards, Sr.,\n\n                                            Chairman, Southern Ute\n     Indian Tribal Council.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Native American\n\n\n                                            Energy Group, LLC,\n\n                                    Ft. Washakie, WY, May 7, 2003.\n     Senator Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: Native American Energy Group (NAEG) \n     is an Indian owned company working with tribes and allottees \n     throughout the country to determine how best to develop oil \n     and gas reserves and help provide for the energy security of \n     this country while also protecting the interests of mineral \n     owners. The recent Indian provisions of the Energy Bill are a \n     big step in the right direction to accomplish positive \n     results for the Indian people of this country.\n       One of the areas of contention is the environmental area \n     with many people stating that these provisions will gut the \n     NEPA process. While this is a legitimate concern, nowhere \n     have I read or heard that this is the intent of these \n     provisions. In fact recent language in the Bill clearly \n     denotes compliance with all applicable tribal and federal \n     environmental laws. Even without this new language though my \n     understanding was always that the intent was not to gut \n     environmental laws. Tribal governments with energy resources \n     are pro-development but by the same\n\n[[Page S7756]]\n\n     token they are also pro-environment. This may seem a \n     dichotomy of sorts but my read on this bill is that the \n     language will strengthen tribal sovereignty, develop tribal \n     capacities and make tribal and allotted oil and gas \n     operations more accountable with less impacts. In addition, \n     the federal trust oversight will not be diminished which is \n     always a concern of tribal governments.\n       NAEG appreciates the work and coordination that goes into \n     an effort of this magnitude and you and your staff are to be \n     commended for the recent provisions as presented in the bill. \n     The history and discussions surrounding this bill recognize \n     the importance of bringing tribes into the mainstream of the \n     energy picture of this country and providing the mechanisms \n     for the technical, administrative and legislative efforts to \n     occur.\n       The research your staff has undertaken in support of this \n     bill very well explains the amounts of energy resources \n     situated on tribal and allotted lands. This largely untapped \n     resource can be a boost for this country as we seek to \n     provide jobs and diversify our economy, while helping America \n     meet its energy needs. Please share with the rest of the \n     Senate Indian Committee our support for these endeavors and \n     if there is any information we can provide to assist you in \n     your work please do not hesitate to call me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Wes Martel,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  United South and\n\n\n                                         Eastern Tribes, Inc.,\n\n                                      Nashville, TN, June 9, 2003.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman: I am writing on \n     behalf of the United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc. (USET), \n     an intertribal organization comprised of twenty-four \n     federally recognized tribes from twelve states. I am writing \n     in support of the Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-\n     Determination Act of 2003, Title III and its inclusion in S. \n     14, the Energy Policy Act of 2003.\n       We understand that tribal energy development can provide \n     tremendous economic development opportunities for our member \n     tribes while simultaneously assisting tribes in meeting \n     energy demands. Our tribes are aware that other tribes have \n     concerns regarding the provision of Title III to which tribal \n     input has been solicited and received to address the issues.\n       Our tribes support the compromises reached by the parties \n     and we call upon the leadership of the committee to further \n     engage and respond to tribal concerns. We hope that \n     compromises on the remaining outstanding points may be \n     reached whereby all of Indian Country can support inclusion \n     of Title III in S. 14.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James T. Martin,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2003.\n     To the Members of the United States Senate:\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation, representing more than three million businesses \n     of every size, sector, and region, supports an amendment to \n     S. 14, the Energy Policy Act of 2003, offered by Senators \n     Domenici and Campbell. This amendment would add an Indian \n     Energy title to the bill that facilitates energy exploration \n     on Indian lands while ensuring the same level of \n     environmental protection as is provided in the state in which \n     the lands are located.\n       The Domenici-Campbell amendment is a sensible component of \n     a comprehensive national energy policy. While Indian land \n     accounts for five percent of the land area of the U.S., it \n     contains 30 percent of the nation's identified coal deposits, \n     five percent of its oil deposits, and 10 percent of its \n     natural gas reserves. However, the Department of the Interior \n     estimates that less than one quarter of these assets have \n     been developed. This amendment will spur domestic energy \n     development by removing bureaucratic obstacles on Indian \n     lands and by providing grants and loan guarantees for \n     building the necessary energy infrastructure.\n       An amendment to the Domenici-Campbell amendment is \n     anticipated that would require a tribe to comply with the \n     National Environmental Policy Act each time it enters into an \n     energy project with a private sector company. Such an \n     amendment is simply an attempt to force a tribe into \n     undertaking an environmental impact statement as if it was a \n     federal government agency. If such an amendment passes, it \n     will subject tribes to years of bureaucratic study followed \n     by years of litigation, notwithstanding the fact that the \n     project has complied with all federal and state environmental \n     permitting laws.\n       Our nation will need 43 percent more energy in the next \n     twenty years and will need it from all sources, including \n     coal, oil, gas, nuclear, and alternative fuels. These tribal \n     territories are sovereign and the federal government must \n     allow them the means for adequate economic development so \n     they can participate in the many benefits of our nation, \n     including the right to economic self-determination.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urges you to support the \n     Domenici-Campbell amendment that would increase domestic \n     energy supplies in an environmentally compatible manner and \n     reject all weakening amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know we will be back on this bill. I \nnote that the Indian tribes and organizations listed are not in full. \nWe have additional ones since this was prepared, and they will be added \nin due course.\n  I compliment the distinguished Senator, Mr. Campbell. I am pleased to \nbe his cosponsor, and I say for those who are going to now look at this \nbill, I hope our Indian leaders also are aware that there will be those \nwho look at it from the standpoint of how can they make it more \ndifficult for the Indian people to be able to develop their resources. \nThat is what some of the time and effort will be spent on during the \nintervention between this bill and its final vote. How can \norganizations that do not want the Indian people to produce their raw \nmaterials into energy and resources, thus jobs and opportunity for the \nIndian people, get their hands on this bill and try to offer amendments \nto try to harm this bill? I am certain some will do that.\n  We will be vigilant, we will be aware, and we are asking the Indian \nleaders who support this to inform their Senators that this is the bill \nthey want as part of America's policy on energy. We are asking every \nIndian leader to advise those Senators who have been with them in the \npast to support this bill. This bill is their bill. It is for their \nfuture. It is for jobs and money and resources for them. We need them \ntelling their Senators that this is the bill they want. If they do \nthat, come July we will have a real Fourth of July celebration for the \nIndian people, for in a sense they will be free, free to develop their \nresources, where heretofore their hands have been tied.\n  There will be those during the intervening time who will look for \nways to put more ties and strings back into the Campbell bill. We want \nto tell our Indian leaders to tell their friends in the Senate they do \nnot want that; they do not want changes to this bill that will make it \nharder for them to develop their resources in partnership, singularly \nor otherwise, with other Americans.\n  This amendment is the product of many hours of negotiation and \ncooperation among the interested tribes, the Indian Affairs Committee \nand the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  I am also pleased that this amendment enjoys the support of numerous \ntribes including the Jicarilla Apache Nation, the Cherokee Nation, the \nSouthern Utes, the Chickasaw Nation, the Native American Energy Group, \nthe National Congress of American Indians, Dine Power--a Navajo \nCorporation, the Council of Energy Resource Tribes, which represents \nnearly 50 energy producing tribes and The National Tribal Environmental \nCouncil, which represent 180 tribe,\n  I am pleased that Indian tribes across the country will play an \nimportant role in our national energy plan. By passing this \nlegislation, we will streamline the tribal leasing process that outside \nparties have more incentive to partner with tribes in developing energy \nresources and provide investment in critical energy infrastructure on \nIndian land.\n  Indian lands contain some of the richest energy reserves in the \nNation. Although Indian land accounts for only 5 percent of the land \narea of the U.S. it contains: 30 percent of identified coal deposits; 5 \npercent of our nation's oil; and 10 percent of our natural gas, which \nis in very tight supply.\n  Despite the fact that reserves are present, the Department of the \nInterior estimates that only 20 to 25 percent of these assets have been \ndeveloped.\n  Energy projects are capital intensive and most tribes do not have the \nfinancial capability to develop the resources.\n  Tribes face an additional burden in attracting partners and that is a \nresult\n\n[[Page S7757]]\n\nof the paternalistic lease approval system that requires the Secretary \nof the Interior to approve all tribal leases. This delays action and \ncreates investment uncertainty.\n  In an attempt to resolve this out-of-date process, the Indian Affairs \nCommittee and the Senate Energy Committee have taken key elements of \nboth Senator Campbell's legislation S. 522 and Senator Bingaman \nproposal, S. 424.\n  The title adopts Senator Bingaman's proposal to create the Office of \nIndian Energy Policy and Programs within the Department of Energy. This \noffice will provide grants and loan guarantees to tribes to facilitate \nthe development of their energy resources and infrastructure.\n  Section 303, of this title will change the existing lease agreements \nbetween the Secretary of the Interior and tribes to allow tribes to \nenter into a lease or agreement without the approval of the Secretary \nso long as those leases or business agreements conform to regulations \npromulgated by the Secretary.\n\n  The section establishes a process by which a tribe may submit a plan \ngoverning leases and rights-of-way to the Secretary for approval. It \nalso requires the tribe to demonstrate to the Secretary that the plan \nincludes provisions regarding lease and contract terms, environmental \nregulation, and public notification and comment.\n  I think that is very important to note that this entire proposal is \nvoluntary. Let me repeat that. This proposal is completely voluntary. \nTribes will not be forced to adopt this proposal if they feel it would \nnot benefit the tribe as a whole.\n  We have numerous letters from tribes who support the proposal and I \nam confident they will benefit. However, any tribe that opposes this \nproposal probably will not participate and can continue to operate \nunder the status quo.\n  This amendment also protects the environment. I think the statement \nof President Joe Shirley of the Navajo Nation before the Senate Indian \nAffairs Committee accurately captures the environmental \nresponsibilities all tribes must comply with. President Shirley stated,\n\n       Tribes may already promulgate regulations that are more, \n     but not less, stringent than Federal regulations governing \n     the same subject matters (environment). The following is a \n     list of some of the federal statutes that already control \n     regulations for land use, both State and tribal: National \n     Environmental Policy Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, \n     Endangered Species Act, Federal Land Management and Policy \n     Act, National Historic Preservation Act, Native American \n     Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Surface Mining \n     Control and Reclamation Act and the Indian Mineral Leasing \n     Act.\n\n  Clearly, the tribes must fully comply with our environmental \nstatutes.\n  Following markup of S. 14, the Indian Affairs and Energy Committees \nhave worked to address concerns regarding the trust responsibilities \nbetween tribes and the Secretary of the Interior. These agreed-upon \nchanges make up the amendment Senator Campbell has offered.\n  This amendment deserves the strong support of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute for Senator Campbell \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico, who \nis a stalwart supporter of this movement.\n  There is no question, if we do not take this back up between now and \nJuly, if there is a second degree offered at that time, we will be \ngiving the opponents of this bill--instead of giving Indians an \nopportunity to get up off their knees and get some jobs--an opportunity \nto gin up some opposition. I think that is what the delay is for. I \nappreciate the support of the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7757-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7757-S7820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AVIATION INVESTMENT AND REVITALIZATION VISION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since 1990, the United States has lost more than \n     600,000 aerospace jobs.\n       (2) Over the last year, approximately 100,000 airline \n     workers and aerospace workers have lost their jobs as a \n     result of the terrorist attacks in the United States on \n     September 11, 2001, and the slowdown in the world economy.\n       (3) The United States has revolutionized the way people \n     travel, developing new technologies and aircraft to move \n     people more efficiently and more safely.\n       (4) Past Federal investment in aeronautics research and \n     development have benefited the economy and national security \n     of the United States and the quality of life of its citizens.\n       (5) The total impact of civil aviation on the United States \n     economy exceeds $900 billion annually--9 percent of the gross \n     national product--and 11 million jobs in the national \n     workforce. Civil aviation products and services generate a \n     significant surplus for United States trade accounts, and \n     amount to significant numbers of America's highly skilled, \n     technologically qualified work force.\n       (6) Aerospace technologies, products and services underpin \n     the advanced capabilities of our men and women in uniform and \n     those charged with homeland security.\n       (7) Future growth in civil aviation increasingly will be \n     constrained by concerns related to aviation system safety and \n     security, aviation system capabilities, aircraft noise, \n     emissions, and fuel consumption.\n       (8) The United States is in danger of losing its aerospace \n     leadership to international competitors aided by persistent \n     government intervention. Many governments take their funding \n     beyond basic technology development, choosing to fund product \n     development and often bring the product to market, even if \n     the products are not fully commercially viable. Moreover, \n     international competitors have recognized the importance of \n     noise, emission, fuel consumption, and constraints of the \n     aviation system and have established aggressive agendas for \n     addressing each of these concerns.\n       (9) Efforts by the European Union, through a variety of \n     means, will challenge the United States' leadership position \n     in aerospace. A recent report outlined the European Union's \n     goal of becoming the world's leader in aviation and \n     aeronautics by the end of 2020, utilizing better coordination \n     among research programs, planning, and funding to accomplish \n     this goal.\n\n[[Page S7777]]\n\n       (10) Revitalization and coordination of the United States' \n     efforts to maintain its leadership in aviation and \n     aeronautics are critical and must begin now.\n       (11) A recent report by the Commission on the Future of the \n     United States Aerospace Industry outlined the scope of the \n     problems confronting the aerospace and aviation industries in \n     the United States and found that--\n       (A) Aerospace will be at the core of America's leadership \n     and strength throughout the 21st century;\n       (B) Aerospace will play an integral role in our economy, \n     our security, and our mobility; and\n       (C) global leadership in aerospace is a national \n     imperative.\n       (12) Despite the downturn in the global economy, Federal \n     Aviation Administration projections indicate that upwards of \n     1 billion people will fly annually by 2013. Efforts must \n     begin now to prepare for future growth in the number of \n     airline passengers.\n       (13) The United States must increase its investment in \n     research and development to revitalize the aviation and \n     aerospace industries, to create jobs, and to provide \n     educational assistance and training to prepare workers in \n     those industries for the future.\n       (14) Current and projected levels of Federal investment in \n     aeronautics research and development are not sufficient to \n     address concerns related to the growth of aviation.\n\n        Subtitle A--The Office of Aerospace and Aviation Liaison\n\n     SEC. 621.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe Senator McCain will arrive \nmomentarily to manage this legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask what the pending Senate business is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 824.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Hollings, \nSenator Lott, and Senator Rockefeller, for their hard work on this very \nimportant legislation. Senator Lott and Senator Rockefeller held \nextensive hearings in the Aviation Subcommittee. They have come up with \na product that has addressed many of the concerns and very important \nissues associated with aviation. I believe what they have done is a \nvery agreeable product.\n  I note that our friends on the other side of the Capitol have \ncompleted their work on this bill, so if we could complete this \nlegislation and go quickly to conference, I think we could have this \ndone pretty quickly.\n  I am pleased the Senate is now considering S. 824, the Aviation \nInvestment and Revitalization Vision Act, AIR-V. This legislation was \nintroduced by Senators Lott Hollings, Rockefeller, and myself on April \n8, 2003, and approved by the Senate Commerce Committee on May 1, 2003.\n  I don't think that anyone could have predicted 100 years ago, when \nthe Wright Brothers first flew their Wright Flyer over Kitty Hawk, NC, \nthat air travel would become such a significant part of our Nation's \neconomy. Aviation has evolved from the first controlled flight that \ntraveled about 120 feet, to a system that has reached more than 550 \nmillion enplanements annually. Air travel has revolutionized the world. \nWe are becoming a global culture for which air travel has contributed \nsignificantly. The United States has played a critical role in the \nexplosion in air travel, with nearly two-thirds of world aviation \ntravelers taking off or landing on U.S. soil.\n  Mr. President, 4 years ago, the Congress approved the Aviation \nInvestment Reform Act for the 21st Century, known as AIR-21. That \nreauthorization measure provided for far reaching changes to our \nFederal aviation policies, coupled with significant investment in \naviation. We increased airport spending by significant amounts and \ngreatly improved our aviation system. At the same time, a great deal \nhas happened in aviation during the past few years. The airlines have \ngone through several cycles of good and bad times.\n  The tragic events of September 11, 2001, forced a major restructuring \nof aviation transportation security. As a result of September 11 and \nother economic factors, Congress has twice voted to provide the airline \nindustry aid totaling $8 billion in cash and the potential for $11 \nbillion in other benefits. We have taken unprecedented actions to help \nensure the continued viability of the airlines. I recognize that \nintervening events have been the cause of many of the industry's \nproblems, which is why I was a strong supporter of these initiatives. \nHowever, I do believe that the industry must being to\n\n[[Page S7780]]\n\nsolve its own problems and not come back to Congress when confronted \nwith new challenges.\n  It is time for Congress to now focus its efforts on the Federal \nAviation Administration. We must continue to ensure the safety and \nefficiency of our aviation system. We must address the continued \nmodernization of our air traffic control system. We must continue our \noversight of the FAA so that it continues to move towards more \nefficient operation. We must continue the expansion of our \ninfrastructure. And, we must continue to strive to promote the security \nof our traveling public.\n  I believe the legislation before us, S. 824, the Aviation Investment \nand Revitalization Vision Act, AIR-Vision, meets these objectives. This \nbill would reauthorize FAA programs for 3 years and continue the \ninvestments in the aviation system that began under AIR 21. \nSpecifically, it would authorize funding for FAA Operations at $7.6 \nbillion for fiscal year 2004; $7.7 billion for fiscal year 2005; and \n$7.9 billion for fiscal year 2006, and it would authorize funding for \nthe Airport Improvement Program at $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2004; \n$3.5 billion in fiscal year 2005; and $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2006. \nThe bill also authorizes $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2004; $2.97 \nbillion in fiscal year 2005; and $3 billion in fiscal year 2006 for the \nAirway Facilities Improvement Program and requires a report on major \nFAA modernization programs.\n\n  The funding levels in this bill do not require any new or increased \ntaxes or user fees. The taxes currently paid by air travelers and \nothers into the Aviation Trust Fund are in place through fiscal year \n2007 and are sufficient to pay for this bill.\n  We also must ensure that the FAA manages its resources wisely. The \nbill includes provisions, first proposed by former FAA Administrator \nGarvey and endorsed by the current Administrator, to improve FAA \nmanagement. The FAA's management of its programs, especially its \nmodernization efforts, continue to be of particular interest to \nCongress. I note that the FAA has finally hired its first Chief \nOperating Officer, Russ Chew, three and one-half years after the office \nwas authorized. This bill would provide additional clarification of the \nFAA's Chief Operating Officers' responsibilities for managing the FAA's \nair traffic control system.\n  The bill would create a process to enhance airport capacity at \ncertain large hub airports that significantly add to delays in the \nnational aviation system by ensuring that these airports' needs are \ncontinually reviewed. It also attempts to streamline the environmental \nreview process by coordinating the reviews by different agencies. This \nis important as this process is sometimes used to unnecessarily delay \nairport expansion.\n  The bill makes several improvements and reforms to services to small \ncommunities and the essential air service program by continuing \nprograms created in AIR-21 to incentivize communities to take a greater \nownership role in their service. It also allows the communities \nflexibility to opt out of the program in return for payment or to look \nat alternate services for the community.\n  The bill extends the small community air service development pilot \nprogram, established in AIR-21, until 2006, and provides funding of \n$27.5 million per year during the 3 year extension. It also clarifies \nthat 40 communities per year may participate in the program and that no \ncommunity may participate twice. This program has been well-received \nfor the innovative ideas that have sprung from it regarding the \nprovision of and payment for air service to small communities, and we \nbelieve it is important for the program to continue in the near term.\n  Regarding competition, the bill instructs the Secretary of \nTransportation to study competition and airline access problems at hub \nairports. Specially, the Department of Transportation is to look at \ngate usage and availability, and the effects of pricing of gates and \nother facilities on competition and access. Within 6 months, the \nSecretary's findings, conclusions, and recommendations are to be \nsubmitted to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation and the House of Representatives Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure.\n\n  In addition, the bill requires that airports which deny applications \nby an air carrier for access to gates or other facilities submit to the \nSecretary notification of the denial and a report explaining the \nreasons for the denial and a time line, if any, for when the request \nwill be accommodated.\n  For security, the bill establishes the Aviation Security Capital Fund \nwhich is financed with $500 million annually in security service fees \nwhich are already collected by the Transportation Security \nAdministration. The fund will be administered by the TSA and the TSA \nwill make grants to airports to assist with capital security costs. The \nfund will allocate 40 percent to hub airports; 20 percent to medium hub \nairports; 15 percent to small hub airports; and 25 percent is to be \ndistributed at the Secretary's discretion to address security risks. At \nthe same time, the bill protects the AIP funding from continued raids \non what was created for capital improvement funding, but which in \nrecent years has been used for security funding.\n  The bill also directs the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to study the effectiveness of the aviation security system. \nWithin 6 months, the Secretary's findings, conclusions, and \nrecommendations are to be submitted to the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives \nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The Secretary is \ndirected to redeploy the department's resources based on the results of \nthe study.\n  For aviation modernization, the bill establishes a new Office of \nAerospace and Aviation Liaison within the DOT. This office will be \ncharged with coordinating aviation and aeronautics research programs, \nactivities, goals, and priorities within the Federal Government. Areas \nof responsibility include air traffic control, technology transfer from \ngovernment programs to private sector, noise, emissions, fuel \nconsumption, and safety. This office will work with the FAA and the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration to ensure that aviation \nand aerospace research is coordinated and funds are well spent.\n  This bill also establishes a National Air Traffic Management System \nDevelopment Office within the FAA with the mission of developing a next \ngeneration air traffic management system plan for the United States. \nThis plan is required to focus on transforming the national airspace \nsystem to meet air transportation mobility, efficiency, and capacity \nneeds beyond those currently included in the FAA's Operational \nEvolution Plan in an effort to build on existing capabilities while \nimproving the security, safety, quality, and affordability of the \nsystem.\n  Finally, we have developed a manager's amendment which has been \nagreed to by myself and Senator Lott, Hollings, and Rockefeller. It \nincludes a number of technical changes and improvements recommended by \nthe executive agencies affected by this bill. It also includes some \nsubstantive changes to the bill, including: extending whistle blower \nprotections to the employees of contractors doing business with the \nFAA; requiring that the GAO periodically report to Congress on the \neconomic state of the airline industry and on airline executives' \ncompensation; clarifying that the war risk insurance provision only \napplies to U.S. air carriers; moving the new security capital fund from \nthe FAA to the TSA; and removing the provision adding additional \n``outside the perimeter'' slots at Reagan National Airport.\n  I yield to my colleague from South Carolina and perhaps the Senator \nfrom Mississippi.\n  I say to my colleagues, if they are prepared to bring forward an \namendment, we would like to consider that quickly and move forward with \nthe amending process as it would be our intention to try to finish this \nlegislation this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nthat will reauthorize the programs of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration for the next 3 years, S. 824, the Aviation Investment \nand Revitalization Vision Act, AIR-V. I would like to thank Chairman \nMcCain, Senator Lott and Senator Rockefeller for their hard\n\n[[Page S7781]]\n\nwork in helping to craft this bipartisan bill that seeks to address the \nneeds of the Nation's air transportation system.\n  The troubled state of the aviation industry has made FAA \nreauthorization a high priority of the 108th Congress. From the start, \nthe Senate Commerce Committee pursued an ambitious schedule, and held \nseveral hearings on this matter in the first few months of the year. \nOur focus on this matter permitted all involved parties to express \ntheir concerns about the aviation system in the United States, and \nhelped us develop a constructive approach to improve the work of the \nFAA as we move into an unclear future. We have crafted a strong bill \nthat focuses properly on safety, security, efficiency and environmental \nfriendliness in the realm of aviation.\n  AIR-V is a good starting point, but we have a long way to go make \ncertain that the FAA's budget adequately supports the agency's ability \nto oversee an increasingly complex system to ensure safe flying. Recent \nreports have pointed to the FAA's laxity on plane maintenance as \nairlines have increasingly farmed out repair work to trim more \nexpensive in-house operations over the past decade. The Department of \nTransportation Inspector General found that major air carriers paid \ncontractors $2.9 billion for maintenance in 2001, which was 80 percent \nmore than in 1996. While maintenance responsibility has shifted, the \nFAA's policies have not, and the DOT IG is currently conducting an \naudit of repair stations and the FAA's oversight of them. We must take \nsteps to provide FAA needed funding to improve outdated oversight, \nmonitor gaps in overseas repair service, and update training methods \nwhich have not changed significantly in almost 50 years. It is vital \nthat we adequately fund to FAA's budget to ensure the safest aviation \nsystem possible.\n  The impact of the aviation industry on our Nation is clear. Prior to \nSeptember 11, 2001, the total impact of civil aviation on the national \neconomy exceeded $900 billion and 11 million jobs, representing 9 \npercent of the U.S. gross domestic product. Since that time, the \nairline industry has faced consecutive years of record multibillion \ndollar losses while our national economy continues to struggle. This \nhas made reauthorization of the FAA that much more critical, and I \nbelieve AIR-V strikes the proper balance among key FAA programs to \nadvance our Nation's air transportation system.\n  After September 11, 2001, Congress created the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, which has taken charge of a massive \nrestructuring of transportation security, which has led to a greater \nconfidence in the traveling public. Even with the vast downturn in \naviation traffic over the past couple of years, the FAA's Aerospace \nForecast anticipates that enplanements in the U.S. are expected to \nincrease over the next 10 years by roughly 50 percent, with as many as \n1 billion passenger boardings expected annually by 2013.\n  Knowing of the expected growth in airline traffic, we must press our \nefforts to make system-wide improvements that will allow the U.S. \naviation industry to flourish in the coming years and beyond. Air-V \npromotes airport development with increased funding for the Airport \nImprovement Program, and additional support for vital components of the \nNational Airspace System through the designation of certain essential \nundertakings as ``national capacity'' projects. When the Bush \nAdministration's FAA reauthorization proposal was unveiled it was \ncriticized by Aviation Week for not providing enough long-term support \nfor AIP at a time when the FAA is in a tight budget situation and the \nNation's airports are looking for increased funding to pursue needed \nprojects to improve their facilities. AIR-V also takes steps to resolve \nthe bleeding of hundred of millions of dollars from AIP for security \npurposes and seeks to expedite the installation of EDS machines at \nairports across the country while diverting none of the AIP funds away \nfrom important infrastructure projects through the creation of an \nAviation Security Capital Fund to be financed with $500 million \nannually in security service fees to allow TSA to make grants to \nairports to assist with capital security costs.\n\n  I have had increasing concerns that the European Community will \ncontinue its bold efforts to surpass the American aerospace industry in \nthe coming years. We must recognized the importance of the FAA's \nResearch, Engineering and Development program in maintaining our \nposition as the worldwide leader in the aviation and aerospace \nindustries. AIR-V will significantly increase funding for the R,E \nprogram with the understanding that long term planning will be needed \nto keep up with the rapidly changing dynamic of this industry. The EC \nhas already introduced a ``2020 plan'' aimed at surpassing America--\nFAA, NASA and our aerospace industry--as the world's aerospace leaders \nwithin the next two decades. We must respond to this challenge with an \nemphasis on technology, and public-private cooperation that will ensure \nour advantage over the EC by strengthening our R,E programs and U.S. \neducation and interest in aerospace.\n  I am pleased that key components of S. 788, the Second Century of \nFlight Act, legislation I introduced along with Senators Brownback, \nRockefeller, Inouye, Cantwell, and Kerry have been included in this \nreauthorization effort. Among the most important steps that the bill \ntake to promote FAA, R,E is the creation of a national office to \ncoordinate aviation and aerospace research activities within the U.S. \nGovernment tasked with coordinating programs and developing goals to \nfacilitate the nation's R,E technologies, and a national office to \nfocus on a next generation air traffic management system. Of equal \nimportance is the establishment of a new educational program to train \nthe next generation of aeronautics engineers and mechanics. According \nto the Commission Report on Aerospace, more than a quarter of the U.S. \nscience, engineering and manufacturing workforce will be eligible to \nretire in the next 5 years. This workforce initiative is aimed at \nincreasing participation of U.S. students in fields related to \naerospace and aviation safety through the use of grants and \nscholarships for service to ensure the growth of interest in the United \nStates and increase the talent pool of American students.\n  To ensure that the U.S. continues to have the safest aviation system \npossible we must also make improvements to the FAA's Facilities and \nEquipment program which contains financing for the purchase, \ninstallation and construction of equipment and facilities required to \nmaintain the NAS. Through this bill we should boost the F program so \nthat it will be a better complement to the improved AIP program in \npreparation for increased passenger levels. However, we must consider \nways to make further advances to this program to ensure our ability to \nprovide crucial enhancements to the safety of our aviation system.\n  AIR-V will have an enormous impact on the future of our entire air \ntransportation system, and makes a strong statement about the direction \nthat we want our air transportation system to go. Please support this \neffort and work with us to help the FAA take real steps forward and \nmaintain our strength in aviation for the future.\n  I yield to our distinguished leader who really held the hearings and \nled for this particular measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the distinguished Senator from South Carolina for \nthose comments. He and Senator McCain certainly have been very \ninterested in this important issue. A couple of hearings we had on this \nlegislation were in the full committee because of the importance of the \nissues involved.\n  I also particularly thank Senator Rockefeller, who is the ranking \nmember on the Aviation Subcommittee, for his work and his cooperation \non this legislation. This is truly bipartisan legislation: Senator \nMcCain, Senator Hollings, Senator Rockefeller and I all have worked on \nit. Where we have had problems we have been able to work out most of \nthem. I think we have a really good product.\n  I want to say at the beginning we are hoping to move this legislation \nthrough rapidly. Hopefully we could even complete it today. We have a \nfew issues that have not been resolved yet. Two or three of them may \nrequire votes. We ask our colleagues to come to the floor, let's have a \ndebate and, if we have to, we will have a vote. There are not that many \namendments that I think would actually require a vote.\n\n[[Page S7782]]\n\n  I also want to emphasize the importance of this legislation. Because \nwe have moved it fast, and because we have been able to get an \nagreement worked out to bring it to the floor, and because we may be \nable to handle it in a brief period of time, it should not diminish at \nall the importance of passing this legislation. Transportation in \nAmerica is unique. If we are going to have a strong economy, we have to \nhave good transportation systems--not just roads and bridges, which are \nvery important, and not just a good railroad system, freight and \npassenger, and not just good ports and harbors, but we also need a \nstrong aviation system in America.\n  We all know the industry has been having difficult times for a \nvariety of reasons. In some cases it was bad management decisions. \nObviously all of them have been affected by high fuel costs. There have \nbeen some difficult management-labor decisions. But also probably no \nother industry was as dramatically and directly affected by 9/11 as the \naviation industry. Aircraft were involved on that infamous day, used as \nweapons of destruction, as missiles--both in New York and, of course, \none plane that hit the Pentagon and the one that went down in \nPennsylvania. We saw the industry basically shut down that day--for \ndays. We are still having fallout, the ramifications of that day and \nthose decisions in terms of access to airports, including Washington \nReagan National. General aviation is still dealing with the problems as \na result.\n  There is no question the industry has had difficulties and some of \nthose difficulties have been related to 9/11. Government decisions were \nmade that needed to be made. We had to deal with security \nconsiderations on our airplanes and at our airports. So a lot of costs \nhave been put on the industry that have caused them additional \nproblems.\n  We have taken action immediately after 9/11, of course, to provide \nsome assistance to the aviation industry. We did it again in the \nsupplemental appropriations this year. But this is the third step and \nin some respects maybe the most important step in helping the airline \nindustry, helping aviation get back to where they can see blue skies \nand begin to make profits and provide the kind of service the American \npeople are entitled to.\n  I do think it is important we get this bill done, that we get into \nconference and see if we can come to a reasonable and relatively quick \nagreement with the House. That will allow this bill to be completed \nbefore we get into the time-consuming and very important TEA-21 \nextension, and the appropriations process.\n  This bill's title is Aviation Investment and Revitalization Vision \nAct--AIR-V. Our intent is to go all the way from stabilizing the \nindustry, giving them dependability and reliability of what they can \nexpect from FAA, from the Airport Improvement Program, to all the \ndifferent programs that are involved in aviation including service to \nsmall communities. I think we do have the fundamental provisions we \nneed to make sure that happens. We will ensure the Airport Improvement \nProgram will continue uninterrupted for the next 3 years. We also are \ngoing to make sure the funds that go into Airport Improvement Programs \nare actually used for their original purpose, and that is to improve \nour airports, the runways, the terminals, and the services our \nconstituents need and deserve.\n  On that note, this legislation also no longer allows AIP funds to be \nused for security mandates. Up to this point approximately $500 million \nhas been skimmed off the top of the AIP fund to pay for security \nmandates that the Federal government placed on our local airports. The \nTransportation Security Administration--TSA--predicts that an \nadditional $500 million will be needed to complete these capital \nimprovements that have been deemed necessary for security purposes. \nThis bill proposes that these unfunded mandates be paid for by \ndirecting the passenger security fee into a separate fund to cover \nthese costs. The first $500 million of these fees that is collected \nwill be directed to this fund.\n  This legislation also looks at excessiveness at TSA. It will require \nTSA to do a study to look at the efficiency of their employees and then \nredeploy them as necessary based on the results of the study. I am \npleased that TSA is already reassessing their workforce. While it is \nnot the goal of this Congress to have less than adequate security at \nany airport, it is important for TSA to recognize the areas in which \nthey have gold-plated security.\n  In another effort to help the industry, this legislation also makes \npermanent a provision already in the annual appropriations bill that \nrequires TSA to pay fair market value for the space they occupy at \nairports. The bill also keep AIP funding at the fiscal year 2003 level \nfor FY04, but changes the match requirement from 10 percent to 5 \npercent for that 1 year. AIP funding will then be increased by $100 \nmillion for the out years. This is very important to local communities \nthat are hard pressed to make that local match, because their funds \nhave been depleted due to these unfunded mandates. AIR-V also maintains \nthe budget firewalls that were put in place during the debate over Air-\n21. These firewalls require that the trust fund continues to be spent \ndown.\n  Of particular importance to my home state of Mississippi is language \nin this legislation that continues the authorization of the Small \nCommunity Pilot Program. This provision will allow 40 new communities \nto be eligible to receive one-time money each year. This is a good \nprogram that requires innovative thinking on the part of airports and \ntheir local communities.\n  Another important issue to rural States such as mine and Senator \nRockefeller's is the Essential Air Service Program. The two of us \nintroduced legislation that works to improve this program, while not \nimplementing the drastic change the administration has pushed. In \nshort, it provides incentive to the local communities to get involved \nin determining the quality and type of air service their community \nreceives. We have included that legislation in this bill.\n  Transportation infrastructure spending is important, and it is one of \nmy top priorities. I want to continue the Republican congressional \nmajority's commitment to transportation infrastructure. Our Nation's \ngrowing economy demands attention to this issue. Passage of this bill \nwill be a step in that direction.\n  I say again, in Senator McCain's presence, I appreciate his attention \nto this and his interest and his desire to move forward. Without his \ntenacity we would not be here now. I believe we have a good bill that \nwe can complete in short order.\n  I am glad to yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his kind \ncomments.\n  Mr. President, we are awaiting the appearance of Senator Lautenberg, \nwho has an amendment we will be considering shortly. Until then, I \nremind my colleagues we would like to move forward with amendments.\n  I understand that Senator Cochran may have an amendment, and several \nothers. But I don't think there are many. We could go ahead and move \nforward as quickly as possible with the legislation.\n  Pending their arrival, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 889\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 889.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is a managers' amendment which we \nhave developed working with Senators Lott, Hollings, and Rockefeller. \nIt includes a number of technical changes\n\n[[Page S7783]]\n\nand improvements recommended by the executive agencies affected by the \nbill. It also includes some substantive changes, including \nwhistleblower protections for the employees of contractors doing \nbusiness with the FAA; requiring the GAO to periodically report to \nCongress on the economic state of the airline industry; airline \nexecutives' compensation; clarifying that the war risk insurance \nprovision only applies to U.S. air carriers; moving the new security \ncapital fund from FAA to TSA; and removing a provision--I emphasize \n``removing''--a provision that was added in the markup concerning \noutside-the-perimeter slots at Reagan National Airport.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, these particular modifications have been \nchecked through by both the chairman and ranking member of our Aviation \nSubcommittee. Let the Record show that the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, our ranking member, is at an \nimportant Finance Committee markup at the moment with respect to \nprescription drugs and Medicare. I have checked it through with him, \nand it has been checked through on this side. We ask for support of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 889) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to alert my colleagues that I \nintend to offer an amendment to this bill this afternoon. I have talked \nto several people about it. I will not take a lot of time. I don't \nintend to delay the bill at all. But there is an important piece of \npolicy in this legislation.\n  Before I explain it, I should congratulate my colleagues, Senator \nMcCain, chairman of the full committee, and Senator Hollings, ranking \nmember, for their work on this bill. It is really important for us to \ncomplete this legislation. Hopefully, perhaps we can complete it today, \nin fact.\n  On page 145, there is an aviation security capital fund of $500 \nmillion. I think that is an important fund which it establishes in the \nDepartment of Transportation. I think that is perhaps transferred in \nthe managers' amendment in fact to homeland security.\n  This capital fund provides funds for the security needs at airports \naround the country, and for investment in the construction and \ninfrastructure for security purposes.\n  All of us know in the shadow of 9/11 and the terrorist attacks that \noccurred in our country that security, especially aviation security, is \ncritically important.\n  This provision, as important as it is, however, has a local match \nrequirement. My great concern is that this money will not be invested \nin aviation security because many communities and States around the \ncountry simply won't have the capability of coming up with the local \nmatch. That is why we put money in legislation previously. In the tax \nbill that passed the Congress, we included a substantial amount of \nmoney to try to help State and local governments, many of which are \nflat on their backs financially. They are having trouble funding their \nown needs.\n  I think having a security capital fund is very important. But having \nthat fund available only if there is matching money available for it \nlocally will mean that much of it will not be spent, much of it will \nnot be invested, and much of it will not contribute anything to this \ncountry's security.\n  What I propose to do on this occasion, because it deals with \nsecurity, which is a national issue, and because the State and local \ngovernments are in a pretty precarious fiscal position, is eliminate \nthe local match so we could expect that this money would be invested. \nThe construction and the infrastructure that will be completed with \nthis money will contribute, in fact, to aviation security in this \ncountry.\n  I have visited with my colleague, the Senator from Mississippi. I \nthink he has some persuasive reasons for not eliminating the local \nmatch. But, on the other hand, I think there is a persuasive argument \nthat the only way we will see this money truly invested in airports \naround the country is if we eliminate the local match.\n  Perhaps I should offer this amendment now and have it pending. I have \nto chair a luncheon in a few minutes and will have to leave the floor.\n  If it is all right with the chairman and ranking member, I will offer \nthe amendment. We will have it pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 890\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 890.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To delete the matching requirement for airport security \n                   related capital investment grants)\n\n       On page 146, beginning with line 20, strike through line 8 \n     on page 147.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from North Dakota \nhas to leave at this time. We will be glad to discuss this amendment at \nhis convenience, hopefully later this afternoon, and perhaps we can get \nsomething worked out on it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have explained my amendment already. \nWhat I would like to do is work with my colleagues, Senator McCain, \nSenator Lott, Senator Hollings, and others. I think this is an \nimportant amendment. I am not suggesting this be a precedent forever, \nfor all time. At this moment, in this place, for this reason, I believe \nif we want to invest $500 million in aviation security in this country, \nit is likely the only way that will be invested is to eliminate the \nState and local match. I think there are good reasons to do that. So if \nI can work with my colleagues in the next several hours, I hope we can \nmake some progress on this amendment.\n  I do want to make one final point. It is not my intention in any way \nto hold up this bill. I do not expect this would be a lengthy debate, \nin any event. I would agree to a short time agreement. But my hope is \nperhaps we could support this by a voice vote at some point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Lautenberg is in the Chamber to \noffer an extremely important amendment. He will be ready to do that in \na matter of a few minutes.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 891\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 891.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To clarify the apportionment of funds from the Aviation \n                         Security Capital Fund)\n\n       On page 146, line 17, insert ``origination and \n     destination'' before ``emplanements''.\n       On page 146, line 19, insert ``origination and \n     destination'' before ``emplanements''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the events of September 11, 2001, have been \ncatastrophic on the aviation and travel industry. And that is an \nunderstatement. I strongly supported the formation of the \nTransportation Security Administration because I believed then and \nbelieve now it is critical that the public has confidence in the safety \nand security of our airports and airlines.\n  This enhanced security will save jobs, protect Americans' ability to \ntravel freely and safely, and boost business for the travel and tourism \nindustries.\n  The need for capital security costs, such as explosives detection and \nscreeners, should be based on real need. Unfortunately, the formula in \nthis bill that allocates grants in the aviation security fund to assist \nwith capital security costs is not based on real needs. It does not \naccurately account for the number of passengers who must be\n\n[[Page S7784]]\n\ncarefully screened as they enter airport terminals at their point of \norigin. That is where delays occur and additional security equipment is \nalways badly needed.\n  My amendment corrects the language in section 402 of this bill that \nallocates funding for capital security costs based on ``emplanements.'' \nThis is wrong.\n  My amendment would change the formula for allocating funding in the \naviation security fund from ``emplanements'' to ``origination and \ndestination emplanements.''\n  My amendment allocates resources to airports that are screening the \nlargest number of passengers and not at airports where passengers \nsimply connect to another flight. As an example: Someone flies from New \nYork to Chicago and they have a connection to go to Des Moines, IA. \nThey don't leave the airport. The problem in Las Vegas is people come \nto Las Vegas. They go downtown or to the strip and then they come back \nand have to get back through all the screening. That is where the need \nshould be, for people who enter and leave the airport not simply the \nfact that people land at the airport.\n  My amendment would allocate resources, as I said, to airports that \nare screening the largest number of passengers, and not at airports \nwhere passengers simply connect to another flight.\n  At large hub airports many passengers simply change flights. They \ndon't enter and leave the terminal where security is most needed. These \npassengers have already been screened.\n  This is especially important in Las Vegas but it is a bigger issue. \nIt is important that we prevent another terrorist attack on our \nairlines. Terrorists will search for the weakest link in our security \nand try to exploit it.\n  Capital security resources must be allocated fairly and equitably and \ncorrectly. Las Vegas McCarran Airport has the second largest number of \norigination and destination passengers in the entire Nation, second \nonly to LAX. This means that McCarran processes more people through TSA \nsecurity checkpoints than every other airport, except Los Angeles.\n  Under the present formula, other airports would get far more security \nresources even though they screen fewer passengers. McCarran clearly \nneeds more resources than many hub airports where a great number of \npassengers emplane but do not need to be screened.\n  Nothing could be worse for the Nation than allocating its precious \nsecurity resources in the wrong manner. We need additional security at \norigination and destination airports--and we need it now--where \npassengers are actually screened. We do not want resources allocated \nwhere they are unnecessary, especially at a time when Congress is \nasking TSA to get its costs under control.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ensign be added \nas a cosponsor of this amendment with the Senator now speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment for the \nsafety of the flying public and the health of our economy. We need to \nput our security resources in the right place. Let's keep the skies \nsafe.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have spoken----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding, from talking with you and your \ncolleague, that at McCarran Airport--for example, on a Sunday--a 3-hour \ndelay is a routine kind of experience. That is a normal experience \nrather than an exception, which is remarkably different from almost \nevery other airport in America. Is that true?\n  Mr. REID. That is absolutely right. It is based upon the formula I \nhave just given.\n  I say to the managers of this bill--the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee and the ranking member of the Commerce Committee--I have \nspoken to their staffs, I have spoken to them, as has Senator Ensign. \nWe have been given an assurance by these two fine men and their staffs \nthat this is something the conference will look at as soon as the bill \nleaves this body. The staff will start reviewing this.\n  They have a concern now that they may not have adequate figures to \njustify what Senator Ensign and I are saying. We want them to have \nadequate numbers so that what we are saying is valid.\n  We want, as I have indicated in my statement, there to be a fair \nallocation of resources. We believe, as the Senator from Arizona has \nindicated, that Las Vegas is a very unique place. It is not like \nChicago O'Hare. It is not like the airports in New York. It is similar \nto what we have in Phoenix. Phoenix has a problem similar to us. I \nbelieve Phoenix would benefit from the formula I am suggesting.\n  But I have been given an assurance, as I have indicated, by the two \nmanagers of this very important committee, that they will do what they \ncan in conference to allocate the resources fairly.\n  The language I have in this amendment may not be perfect. There may \nbe some need to look at other issues to have a fair apportionment of \nthese resources.\n  So based upon the assurances I have been given by the two managers of \nthis bill, I will withdraw this amendment, on behalf of Senators Reid \nand Ensign, and look to the good offices of these two gentlemen to make \nsure that, for our country, there is a fair allocation of resources.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before the Senator from Nevada leaves the Chamber, I \nwould like to ask him another question.\n  So that my colleagues will understand this problem--and it is a \nserious one--if I fly from here to the Atlanta Airport, or the Dallas/\nFort Worth Airport, which I will do tomorrow, and then change airplanes \nbut stay within the terminal, not having to go through security again, \nand then I go on to the Phoenix, AZ, airport, that, for the purposes \nof the present formula, would be counted as the same as someone who \nenters an airport, flies and lands at another airport, leaves that \nairport, and then later on has to reenter the airport to leave that \narea.\n\n  In other words, what we are saying is, we have a formula now where \nsomeone who remains within the airport and does not have to go through \nsecurity is basically counted the same as a person who does have to go \nthrough security.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So that, obviously, is an incredible burden if you have \nto put every passenger through security where a large majority of them, \nparticularly at hub airports, do not have to send passengers through \nsecurity. Is that basically the problem we are trying to confront here?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right. We have places, such as at \nMcCarran Airport, where, if we had additional help, we could move \npeople into the airport more quickly but we simply don't have the TSA \npeople to do that. We have some of our hub airports where, as the \nSenator has indicated, they have people standing around looking at each \nother because they are not having people coming in and out of the \nairport like we have at McCarran.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator, I think your concern is legitimate. \nI think the formula needs to be changed. We will work on it.\n  First, we will get a letter over to communications with TSA and tell \nthem we need to look at this formula again. I have been told they are \nalready doing that, but I want to assure the Senator from Nevada, we \nwill try to do everything in our power to address this clear inequity \nthat exists in the formula as we go to conference.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say one additional thing before I sit down. I do \nnot have the opportunity very often to talk about the good work of the \ncommittee but, as far as this Senator is concerned, some of the best \nwork of this committee is to allow flights from National Airport to Las \nVegas, to Phoenix, to Salt Lake. I would suggest that the Senator from \nArizona--and I am sure he will check with his staff--I think he might \nfind a better flight than going from Dallas to Phoenix.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada. But I have done many \nfoolish things in my life--many. One of those that ranks up in the top \n10 is when I was being accused by the local newspaper for attempting to \nseek some\n\n[[Page S7785]]\n\nrelief from the perimeter rule in hopes that I might then have the \nconvenience of flying direct from Reagan National Airport to Phoenix. I \nswore I would never fly direct from Reagan National Airport. Many years \nhave gone by, and I had hoped that people's memories had grown dim on \nthat, but now I will probably have to go another 5 years since the \nSenator has raised that.\n  Mr. REID. Well, the statute of limitations has run.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada is correct. The \nmoney is for security, and a security check is what we are trying to \nfund, finance. It just hasn't been vetted at FAA. It is very logical to \nthis particular Senator that the Senator from Nevada is correct, and I \nwill make every effort in the conference to change the particular \nformula or rather embellish the word emplanement, so as to get \ndestinations and takeoffs considered as going just through the security \nand the money be allocated thereof.\n  So I assure the Senator from Nevada that I will support it in every \nway I can.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 890\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while discussions are taking place on other \nissues or amendments, I wanted to go back and comment briefly on the \nstatement by Senator Dorgan and his amendment.\n  First of all, I appreciate his membership on the committee and his \ninterest in this aviation hearing. Most of the time we agree on how we \ncan be helpful to the aviation industry. I appreciated the fact that he \nsaid he thought it was important we have this revolving fund for TSA \nsecurity. There are those who are going to speak against that fund \nlater today.\n  The appropriators feel as if the fund is not a positive thing, that \nit is taking funds from their bottom line. My concern is, if we have \nthese fees collected for airport security and there is no specification \nthat it go into that area, then it may be spread all over the place. If \nyou go into port security, Coast Guard, or any number of programs--\nwhich may be very important and may be needed--if fees are collected \nfor a purpose, they should not be spread out into other areas. It is \nlike the highway trust fund. You collect gasoline taxes for highways, \nand to let it be spent for airports or ports--that is not the intended \npurpose and what people think they are paying for.\n  This fund is not intended in any way to get into the appropriators' \njob. They have a tough job. I know my colleague from Mississippi and \nSenator Stevens will work hard to help our homeland security. We will \ncontinue to work to see if we can come up with some compromise \nagreement that will accommodate all concerned. Our goal is to just make \nsure we have these fees that are collected for airport security and \nsecurity for the TSA used for that purpose.\n\n  With regard to the local share, I have a State that, obviously, is \nnot a wealthy State. We have a limited number of airports. Several of \nthem are relatively small. So any kind of cost share is not easy for \nthem, plus the airline industry will tell you very quickly that in a \nlot of airports--particularly the bigger ones--any kind of a local cost \nshare, the airlines will wind up having to pick up the cost because \nairports cannot get money from the local government. So they will say, \nall right, we have to get it from the airlines and they will pass it on \nto the airlines. That is a legitimate concern. It is really not fair.\n  I know it is not easy for the local airports sometimes to get a \nmatch. But we are talking about a small match here. Even if we can have \nthe match 10 percent, it would still have the principle that the local \ngovernments are doing their share. Airports and airline service is a \nvery important part of the economy in these smaller towns. It creates \njobs, helps attract industry, and it is a big plus. Yet the cities or \ncounties, even the big cities--Detroit, Chicago, New York--get \ntremendous benefits from their international airports, but they don't \nwant to participate or pay any of the costs. Of course not. The trend \nin America is just let the Federal Government do it. Let the Federal \nGovernment do it all. Let the Federal Government pay for all of the \nairport costs, pay for all the housing costs, pay for all of the \nfarming costs--just let the Federal Government do it. That is why we \nare going to have a $500 billion deficit this year, and probably the \nsame next year, and it may come down some in 2005, but it is still \ngoing to be really ugly. Let Uncle Sam do it.\n  All I am saying is, let the local communities do a little bit, \nparticipate some, help a little in the cost of this huge benefit. I \npromote local airports in my State, such as Tupelo, Meridian, Golden \nTriangle, Biloxi, Pine Belt, and others. We have small airports that \nmean a lot. For them to help a little bit looks to me like a good idea. \nSo I realize maybe that is not the way to do things around here. I am \narguing on principle and some degree of responsibility for everybody to \npay a little bit. Why should the Federal Government always have to pay \nthe first and the last dollar?\n  We will work with Senator Dorgan, a very valuable member of the \ncommittee. I understand his concerns in these smaller communities. But \nthe problem is not really the smaller communities; it is actually the \nbigger airports that will be inclined to pass them along to the \nairlines. I realize they have plenty of burdens of their own.\n  I wanted to respond and make it clear why I feel that some small \namount of local participation is a responsible thing to do. It makes \ngood, common sense. We may have a way to work it out. I wanted to get \nthat on the record before we got too far away from Senator Dorgan's \nremarks.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 892\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The pending amendments are set \naside and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 892.\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate with respect to air fares \n                provided to members of the Armed Forces)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . AIR FARES FOR MEMBERS OF ARMED FORCES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that each United States air \n     carrier should--\n       (1) make every effort to allow active duty members of the \n     armed forces to purchase tickets, on a space-available basis, \n     for the lowest fares offered for the flights desired, without \n     regard to advance purchase requirements and other \n     restrictions; and\n       (2) offer flexible terms that allow members of the armed \n     forces on active duty to purchase, modify, or cancel tickets \n     without time restrictions, fees, or penalties.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. \nFrankly, I would like to see it in law, but I am not sure whether it \nwould be constitutional and in keeping with existing law.\n  Basically, it says that the airlines should do whatever they can to \nmake sure that members of the Armed Forces can get the lowest fare even \nif they are late; that they will offer them the lowest fare available; \nand that when there are cancellations or other reasons they have to \nchange their travel plans, the airlines will show the flexibility that \nwill afford them the lowest possible cost for their airfare.\n  We have a lot of transience amongst the men and women in the military \nand their families, not just being transferred from one place to \nanother but, generally speaking, they are not based where they grew up \nand where their families or friends are located.\n  There are a lot of men and women in the military who make use of the \nairlines and many times on short notice. We are simply urging the \nairlines to show the kind of patriotism that is necessary to provide \nthese very low income Americans the ability to move from one place to \nanother.\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\n  I might add, this amendment was offered by Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison on the DOD authorization bill as well. I hope the airlines \nwill react positively to this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman and \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison for this initiative. It is well deserved. \nWhether or not it can be worked out--as the Senator indicates, we hope \nit can be. It has been cleared on our side, and I urge its adoption.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 892.\n  The amendment (No. 892) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 893\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I commend the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee for moving this reauthorization \nforward. It is critical. The FAA is an essential part of our travel and \naviation system. I encourage its consideration promptly.\n\n  A principal issue these days in aviation is security. How do we best \nprotect those who are flying and those who are working in the \nairplanes, the cockpit crew, the cabin crew? How do we best protect all \nof those people? Well, we review the passenger lists. We review the \nbaggage. We look at what anybody brings aboard. One of the things that \ndoes not always get the attention it deserves is what happens with the \nFAA. What kind of people are they? Are they up to snuff in their \ntraining? Have we a reservoir, a reserve, of people who are trained and \nready to take over when we are looking forward to a fairly large \nretirement possibility for those people who came in after some of the \nlabor problems were resolved?\n  I send an amendment to the desk to make certain that FAA is going to \nbe able to maintain its integrity, and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the pending \namendments are set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 893.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from transferring \n  certain air traffic control functions to non-governmental entities)\n\n       On page 193, after line 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 624. TRANSFER OF CERTAIN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL FUNCTIONS \n                   PROHIBITED.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Transportation may not \n     authorize the transfer to a private entity or to a public \n     entity other than the United States Government of--\n       (1) the air traffic separation and control functions \n     operated by the Federal Aviation Administration on the date \n     of enactment of this Act; or\n       (2) the maintenance of certifiable systems and other \n     functions related to certification of national airspace \n     systems and services operated by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration on the date of enactment of this Act or flight \n     service station personnel.\n       (b) Contract Tower Program.--Subsection (a)(1) shall not \n     apply to a Federal Aviation Administration air traffic \n     control tower operated under the control tower program as of \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       On page 69, after the item relating to section 623, insert \n     the following:\n\nSec. 624. Transfer of certain air traffic control functions prohibited.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I rise to offer a critical safety and security \namendment to this FAA bill. My amendment would ensure that the air \ntraffic control system and its personnel remain a government function.\n  There is an attempt underway right now in the executive branch to \nopen up air traffic control to private contractors. I believe we in the \nCongress must put a stop to this. There are some areas where it makes \nsense to contract work out to private entities, but air traffic control \nis not one of them. The safety of our skies should not be put in the \nhands of the lowest bidder. We should not be looking to buy security on \nthe cheap.\n  I believe those who operate and maintain our air traffic control \nsystem are almost like a wing of the military. They keep us safe. They \npolice our skies.\n  On September 11, 2001, we had a tragic day for all Americans. In my \nState of New Jersey, nearly 700 people lost their lives. As my \ncolleagues know, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta ordered all \naircraft in the U.S. airspace grounded that day. They wanted those \nairplanes safely out of the sky. It was a massive undertaking.\n  I have a visual of 9/11 at 12:30 p.m. The assault took place around \nthe 9 hour. This is a picture of the traffic, each one of these \ndenoting an airplane, that was in the sky at 12:30. Many planes had \nalready landed, but there were still thousands in the air, as we can \nsee. The bulk of this traffic was in the East, as it was still early \nmorning on the west coast. My home State of New Jersey is all but \ncovered in air traffic in this picture.\n  In the next visual, we will see what the skies looked like roughly an \nhour later, at 1:45. We see some reduction in the cluster, but there \nare still hundreds, if not thousands, of airplanes in the sky. Planes \nare being rapidly grounded in the Northeast, and they are headed to the \npoints in the Midwest to try to land safely, to take care of their \npassengers.\n  We have the next picture, which is only half an hour later, and look \nat this. Look at how empty the space, on a relative basis, is compared \nto where it was. The first one, this is now 3 to 3\\1/2\\ hours after the \nterrible assault on our buildings and our people took place. There is a \ncluster. We cannot even see the ground. But the air traffic controllers \nwent to work, the system went to work, and now at 2:15, an hour and \nthree-quarters later, they have cleared the skies, which is not an \ninsignificant job.\n  We did not have one accident that day. We had the attacks with the \naircraft on the towers, but all other aircraft that were in the sky \nthat day got to the ground safely. People were able to call their \nfamilies and say: Do not worry about me. I was flying. I am here. I am \nsafe. I am well. I will be home tonight. I will be home this weekend. \nTo the children: Daddy is alive and well, and we will be there.\n  We can see a massive number of planes were landing in that last half \nhour. Meanwhile, we can see the clusters of airplanes circling major \nairports, waiting for clearance to land, making sure the separations \nwere maintained. The airports were at Dallas, Fort Worth, Atlanta, \nKansas City, Denver, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Minneapolis-St. Paul. \nThat was the extent of the impact of this attack and the need to \ndisperse the airplanes in the sky. And out west, Phoenix, Salt Lake \nCity, Las Vegas, NV, Los Angeles, San Francisco, all of these planes \nlanded safely in an amazingly short amount of time.\n\n  Let's look at the picture at 3:45. The sky almost looks clear, and \nthank goodness. Those were tense moments for everybody, for those who \nsaw the smoke coming out of the Trade Center buildings and noted the \nabsence of these two giant towers that were built, this testimonial to \nman, gone.\n  We did what we had to in the rest of the country to make sure those \nplanes got on the ground safely. There were still some government \nplanes in the air. We can see the military aircraft in the blue--they \nare a little hard to discern--as they patrolled the near empty skies.\n  On September 11, those who operated our Federal air traffic system \ndemonstrated great heroism and dedication. Air traffic controllers \nacross the Nation performed heroically as they guided thousands of \naircraft out of the sky.\n  I wish to point out a bit of a technicality. They think of the air \ntraffic control group sometimes as just the\n\n[[Page S7787]]\n\npeople in the tower who have the microphones at that moment, but we \nhave specialists who keep this equipment going, and it is a complicated \nnetwork. We have those flight service people who are on the ground \ngiving advice, watching the separation, making sure that the system is \nin an orderly condition. It is a package. It is one part of it. It is \nvery obvious that we in this body need lots of people around to make \nthe system work, such as our staff people who are very good. We could \nnot take part of them and have them working for one entity while we \nworked for another. It would not make sense, especially if there is a \nmoment of need when the owner of the company says we are cutting back \non some of the company benefits. It does not work. This is a unified \nsystem.\n\n  In my home State, from the tower of Newark International Airport, the \nair traffic controllers looking out the window could see the World \nTrade Center on fire as they worked to return tens of thousands of \nAmericans to the ground safely. Like many public servants on that day, \nthey were heroes, along with the police and firefighters and other \nemergency personnel. These public employees gave 110 percent of their \nability to secure the safety of the American people.\n  In the aftermath of these tragic events, our people demanded one \nthing in particular of their government. They wanted government \npersonnel, not private contracting firms, to perform security screening \nof baggage at our Nation's airports. If the American people demanded \nthat baggage screeners become Federal employees at substantially \nincreased salaries, this was an enormous cost burden we picked up. We \ntook it out of the hands of the private sector, away from the airlines, \nto say: You were not buying security appropriately; you were not \nspending the money needed to keep the people interested, trained, and \nfunctioning.\n  Why in the world, if we wanted the baggage screeners to become \nFederal employees, would we contract out air traffic control to the \nlowest bidder? It does not make sense. One bag getting through at the \nwrong time could be a terrible tragedy. But one airplane in the wrong \nplace at the wrong time would dwarf many of the opportunities others \nhave to attack an airplane with a piece of baggage.\n  The safety and security of the American people should not be the \nresponsibility of the lowest bidder. It is a core responsibility of our \nGovernment. To be able to muster the forces we need for our military \nendeavors, we have to know the people in the towers and their support \nsystem are always on the job, that they are reliable, that there is no \ndispute between a company or corporate headquarters and the need of the \npeople.\n  That is why it is so shocking the FAA is being asked to take steps to \nprivatize air traffic control in this country. It makes no sense, \nespecially after September 11. It is the opposite of what the public \nwants.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. My questions and my comments are related to your subject.\n  First of all, I appreciate Senator Lautenburg and what he is doing \nhere. I understand his point. I indicated to him on the committee we \nwould work with him and see if we could come up with compromise \nlanguage that we could agree to. Unfortunately, we could not get that \ndone. However, the Senator knows I have tried to act in good faith. I \nknow he has, too. I appreciate that.\n  My concern is, I, like you, have concern about privatizing the air \ntraffic controllers themselves. I also have sympathy for the flight \nweather service people because, in effect, in some areas I am familiar \nwith, they are the air traffic controllers. But the amendment, as I \nunderstand it, and I think the Senator admitted, goes beyond demanding \nthe tower or demanding the actual person looking at the screen and the \nflight weather service, it does expand to the other employees who are \nemployed in the area--the service people, the repairmen, and perhaps \neven further than that.\n\n  My question is, is that a fact? Would your amendment expand beyond \nthe professional air traffic controller or even the FWS employee and \nother employees? Could you perhaps specify some of the areas that might \nbe covered, just for the edification of myself and the other Senators.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from Mississippi is a sincere advocate of \nsafety in our skies and has been very supportive of introductions of \ntechnology. The Senator has had a long period of service as chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Aviation. There is mutual respect.\n  We are including all parts of the FAA, of the controller system, \nsystems specialists, and the safety inspectors. As I tried to \ndemonstrate, it is a whole unit. One thing and is quite apparent. Very \noften when you have an organization the size of FAA, when functions are \nparceled out, very often the segment you have taken out--look at \nrailroads where you have different unions that control different parts. \nIf one of those unions has a disagreement with the management or with \nthe operations of the company, they go out and can tie the whole thing \nup.\n  Keeping this team together--the nurses in the operating room, the \norderlies, all those people, beside the doctor and the guy now who is \nthe person developing the equipment that in many cases now is doing the \nsurgery--is all one thing. Would you think of splitting off parts of \nthat and saying one part ought to be here, one part ought to be there? \nI think not. We include them all. We say this is one integrated system.\n  I come out of the technology business--of course, it was 20 years \nago--but there are certain buttons you have to push to connect \neverything. You have to make sure the equipment is working properly. If \none asks the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens--and I \ntake this from recall so I am not giving his statement--he talked about \nthe value of the flight service people in the State of Alaska and \nremote places. The Senator from Mississippi said it himself; very often \nthey turn into controllers.\n  It is our intention to keep this package together. If we want to talk \nabout it at another time in the future, certainly I would like to do \nso.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will continue to yield, we will continue to \nwork on this. I know Senator McCain will have something to say about it \nlater. Regardless of how it works here, we will continue to work \ntogether.\n  I want to make note of the fact for the record that Secretary Mineta \nhas determined that air traffic control is a core function of the FAA \nand as such the administration would not consider outsourcing beyond \nthe current contract tower program. I note that is a program that is in \nplace, the contract towers, and it has broad general support. Twenty-\nfive percent of all takeoffs and landings, mainly general aviation in \nthe United States, occur at these traffic towers. There is an example \nof how contracting out has been done and is working.\n  We will continue to work with the Senator. While I have some sympathy \nwith what the Senator is trying to do as the amendment presently \nexists, it is too broad and I would have to oppose it.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We are leaving out the contract tower program. We do \nnot touch that at all. Those are special situations, smaller airports \nwhere more is demanded from the operation than can be given as part of \nthe FAA. We have no problem with those.\n  The amendment we offer now is smaller in scope than my original bill. \nIt covers only air traffic control, separation functions, system \nspecialists, and flight service station controllers.\n  There is a world far larger than that, that could be included which \nwe have not included.\n  The administration has already changed the designation of air traffic \ncontrol from ``inherently governmental'' to ``commercial.'' It is more \nthan a technical change. It opens the door to privatizing the air \ntraffic control system.\n  We currently have the best air traffic control system in the world, \nwith 15,000 dedicated Federal air traffic controllers who guide home \nsafely more than 2 million passengers a day. They are expert \nprofessionals who perform under pressure every day to keep our skies \nsafe.\n  Air traffic controllers play a major role in homeland security. When \nPresident Bush gave his State of the Union speech this year, it was the \nflight service station air traffic controllers who\n\n[[Page S7788]]\n\nsent alerts to pilots around here to avoid the expanded no-fly zone \naround Washington. We wanted to keep the President safe. We wanted the \nsecurity to be maintained. It takes a certain skill and dedication and \nexperience to make sure it gets done, that it gets done in a timely \nfashion.\n  When the Space Shuttle Columbia tragically exploded in the skies over \nTexas, it was the air traffic controllers who directed the aircraft \naway from the falling debris field.\n  These men and women perform a critical function. Our security ought \nnot be up for bid. Some claim privatization will save money, but we \nhave to take a look at other countries' experiments with air traffic \ncontrol privatization. When you do, you see financial messes and safety \nhazards. Australia, Canada, and Great Britain have all privatized \nsystems that are now in crisis. Costs have gone up and safety has gone \ndown. Since Great Britain adopted privatization, near misses have \nincreased. That means near misses in the sky. When I told someone this, \nhe said, You mean people missed more flights? I said, No, no, airplanes \nmissing one another. Near misses have increased by 50 percent, and \ndelays have increased by 20 percent. The British government has already \nhad to bail out the privatized air traffic control company twice.\n  Look at this quote from a Member of the British Parliament.\n\n       The privatization of the UK's air traffic control system \n     was a grave mistake, and one that the United States can still \n     avoid making. British Air Traffic Controllers are among the \n     best in the world, and they fought tooth and nail to keep ATC \n     in the public sector. They insisted that the sale of the \n     National Air Traffic Services--NATS--would lead to a collapse \n     in morale, the unwise introduction of inadequate and \n     unreliable equipment, and an increasing danger of \n     catastrophic accidents. The Government did not listen and \n     went ahead. They were wrong and the air traffic controllers \n     were right.\n\n  This is from Gwyneth Dunwoody, a British MP in the House of Commons.\n  Why should we jeopardize the public's safety in the skies? We have \nthe best system in the world now. Why should we risk making it more \ndangerous and costly. We should not repeat the mistake other countries \nhave already made.\n  I want to make clear to my colleagues my amendment does not affect \nthe expansion of the contract tower program. That is one that is \ncontracted out away from the FAA, typically in smaller communities, and \nthat service seems to function very well. It has been in place a long \ntime. That program, which affects the small visual-flight-rules \nairports, can be expanded to any of the 4,000 airports that are \neligible. My amendment only affects FAA towers.\n\n  Our luggage is important, important enough to be screened by trained \nFederal workers. But once you are up in the sky, it seems the \nadministration believes your safety should be in the hands of the \nlowest bidder. It makes no sense.\n  My amendment declares air traffic control functions to be \n``inherently governmental'' and therefore it means they ought to stay \nwith the Government and they are therefore not eligible for \noutsourcing.\n  I want to point out the Member of the British Parliament, Gwyneth \nDunwoody, the MP, is the equivalent of our distinguished Senator McCain \nin this body. So we have a considered opinion from someone who has the \nresponsibility and has been through it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support safety and security in our skies by \nvoting for the amendment, keeping the FAA as a body in the hands of the \nGovernment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment and I think we \nought to understand this amendment does more than tie FAA's hands with \nrespect to air traffic control management. It would prevent a host of \nbroader measures as well. Certain FAA responsibilities are best \nfulfilled by contract, using a combination of Government and private \nservices, as is the case today.\n  Congress gave the FAA unique procurement authority for exactly this \nreason and the amendment would compromise that authority. For example, \nthe FAA's air traffic control systems are increasingly composed of \ncommercial components and software that build upon privately developed \ncomputer programs. If this amendment passes, the FAA's costs to \nmaintain and install its systems would most likely increase \nsignificantly as the FAA tries to acquire needed data rights to \nmaintain the equipment or forgoes the advantages of using commercial \nproducts.\n  Furthermore, the FAA would pay ever-escalating training costs to \nprovide its workforce with the changing skills needed to maintain \nmultiple systems.\n  The amendment prevents the FAA's ability to reduce its operating \ncosts by contracting out certain operations--such as providing weather \ninformation to pilots. Congress has been very critical of the FAA's \ncontinually increasing operating costs. This amendment would take a \nvery important tool for controlling costs away from the FAA.\n  The FAA is currently conducting a competition to evaluate the \nperformance of its 61 flight service stations, which provide needed \nservices, such as weather briefings, to general aviation pilots. The \nFAA expects that the competition will identify innovations and lead to \ngreater value for America's pilots at a lower cost to the taxpayer. The \nbottom line is that the legislation would stop this study--a study that \nencourages the FAA.\n  Finally, this amendment prevents the FAA from expanding the existing \ncontract tower program. This program allows smaller airports to \ncontinue to have air traffic control where an FAA tower might not be \nfully justified.\n  The Transportation Department's Inspector General has examined this \nprogram. He found that contract towers are just as safe and effective \nas FAA towers and on average cost $800 thousand a year less. This \namendment would prohibit any other existing towers from becoming \ncontract towers.\n  FAA continues to operate about 71 towers that are similar in traffic \nand complexity to towers currently in the contract program. For \nexample, in Virginia, the tower at Manassas Regional Airport, which has \ngeneral aviation only, is FAA-operated but the tower at \nCharlottesville-Albemarle Airport, which has frequent commercial \nservice, is a contract tower. Converting these towers could save the \nFAA about $57 million dollars per year in operating costs and free up \n900 controllers that could be used in more complex facilities and help \nmeeting the pending wave of controller retirements.\n  The Administration is adamantly opposed to this amendment or any \nother provisions that would reduce the FAA's flexibility and ability to \ncontrol costs. In a letter to the House, Secretary Mineta indicated \nthat he will recommend a veto of any bill that contained provisions \nsimilar to this amendment.\n  We will hear today a lot of discussion about how admirably the air \ntraffic controllers performed on September 11, and it is true. It is \nabsolutely true. They did a magnificent job. It is also true that the \nair traffic controllers in Canada worked extremely well with their \npartners, the counterparts in the U.S., and they are not government \nemployees. They are privatized air control providers.\n  All of us appreciate the enormous contributions and terrific jobs \nthat our air traffic controllers did, and do. The question is, Will the \nadministration be able to have the flexibility necessary to do such \nthings as contract towers that operate without the complexities and \ndifficulties that are associated with major air traffic control \ncenters?\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated June 12 from the Office \nof Management and Budget, Statement of Administration Policy, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2003.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n       s. 824--aviation investment and revitalization vision act\n\n       The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. \n     824. Like the Administration's proposal, S. 824 would \n     authorize federal aviation programs without increasing taxes \n     or fees on an industry that has been severely impacted since \n     the attacks on September 11th. The bill contains important \n     environmental provisions including voluntary\n\n[[Page S7789]]\n\n     air quality initiatives; environmental streamlining elements \n     for safety and airport capacity projects, and a more flexible \n     use of the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) noise setaside. \n     The bill also adopts structural changes to the Federal \n     Aviation Administration (FAA) that were included in the \n     Administration's bill, as well as important clarifications in \n     the area of judicial review of both airport environmental and \n     agency acquisition decisions.\n       The Administration will work with Congress to ensure, in \n     the version of the bill presented to the President, that: (1) \n     spending during the authorization period conforms to the \n     amounts requested by the Administration; (2) environmental \n     streamlining provisions include safety projects and are \n     optimized to promote their intended goals; (3) the Aviation \n     War Risk Insurance program remains focused on aircraft used \n     to support U.S. military and foreign policy objectives; (4) \n     responsibility for transportation security expenditures is \n     consolidated in the Department of Homeland Security and fees \n     collected for security activities are not diverted to \n     purposes other than the provision of direct security \n     services; (5) the appointment of members and the operation of \n     any committees or commissions created by the bill are \n     consistent with the appointments clause of the Constitution \n     and the President's constitutional authority to supervise the \n     unitary executive branch and make recommendations to \n     Congress; (6) any provision for airline collaboration or \n     coordinated capacity reduction preserves competition to the \n     maximum extent possible; (7) maximum flexibility is provided \n     in the use of AIP funds for security costs, noise set-aside \n     and emissions research and mitigation; (8) provisions \n     regarding the use of space by the FAA at airports do not \n     impose costs which preclude the continued provision of \n     essential services by FAA; and (9) mandates which might \n     interfere with the FAA's ability to optimize its organization \n     or research programs are minimized.\n       The Administration is aware that an amendment may be \n     offered to S. 824 that would inappropriately prohibit the \n     conversion of any FAA facilities or function from the Federal \n     Government to the private sector. Such restrictions are \n     unnecessary and would hinder the FAA's ability to manage the \n     air traffic control system. If such an amendment were \n     included in the final legislation presented to the President, \n     his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n\n                         pay-as-you-go-scoring\n\n       The Budget Enforcement Act's Pay-As-You-Go requirements and \n     discretionary spending caps expired on September 30, 2002. \n     The Administration supports the extension of these budget \n     enforcement mechanisms in a manner that ensures fiscal \n     discipline and is consistent with the President's Budget. OMB \n     scoring of the bill is under development.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will not bother with the entire letter \nexcept to say that the administration strongly supports passage of the \nbill. It talks about all the good things which will happen as a result \nof the bill, most of which we have already covered. I am sure we will \ncover it again. But it also says the administration is aware that an \namendment may be offered to S. 824 that would inappropriately prohibit \nconversion of any FAA facilities or functions from the Federal \nGovernment to the private sector. They say that such restrictions are \nunnecessary and would hinder the FAA's ability to manage the air \ntraffic control system; and, if such an amendment were included in the \nfinal legislation presented to the President, his senior advisers would \nrecommend that he veto the bill.\n  I very much dislike having all the work that has been done on this \nlegislation for literally months be negated by one amendment. Although \nit may be emotionally an important issue, I would hate to see that \nprovision destroy all the hard work and important programs that are \nincluded in this bill.\n  I don't know what the plans are for the other side. We would \nobviously like to have a vote on the Lautenberg amendment. I think \nthere are negotiations going on and conversations concerning that. In \nthe meantime, I note the presence of the Senator from Texas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I \nalso thank the Senator from South Carolina for making sure that we have \nan FAA reauthorization bill on the floor in a timely manner.\n  There has been so much impact on the aviation industry over the last \n2 years that I think we have had to refocus our efforts from capacity \nissues which we were trying to address before 9/11 to now security \nissues. Certainly, the parts of the bill that deal with capacity are \nstill here. I think it is warranted that we look ahead. The aviation \nindustry is going to come back, and we need to make sure we have the \nexpedited environmental procedures for building new runways and help \ncommunities be able to meet the needs of increased demand when that \noccurs. If we can do that before a crisis, it will help us allow \nairports to grow in an environmentally positive way. In a way, that can \nbe handled by the community effectively.\n  I think this bill is a good bill. I have worked on it as the former \nchairman of the Aviation Subcommittee and now as a member of the \nAviation Subcommittee. I think it is very important that we look at the \nmajor issues of security.\n  I commend the committee for keeping the Security Trust Fund, which I \nthink is so important. People pay a ticket tax for security. I want to \nmake sure this ticket tax goes for security purposes. That is what this \nbill does. If we start having a shoestring for the Transportation \nSecurity Agency, they are going to start cutting corners, and we are \nnot going to have an airtight system that a number of us want to \nensure. We have a safer aviation system today than we had on 9/10 in \n2001. We want to make sure it stays that way. We should not let our \nguard down. The kind of enemies there are today are looking for \nvulnerabilities, and we are not going to allow them to have that.\n\n  I think that is why this reauthorization discusses and handles the \nsecurity issues, the capacity issues, and the issues of air traffic \ncontrol and safety all in a way that I think is quite positive.\n  I appreciate the chairman of the committee and the ranking member \nworking to get this bill out. It came out of our Commerce Committee, \nand I look forward to supporting it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened carefully to comments made \nby our leader, the distinguished colleague from Arizona. I want to say \nthat there are places where the contract tower process can be used. \nThere are some 4,000 airports across the country where the contract \ntower program might apply. I have no objection to those smaller \nairports converting to that system. But we are grandfathering those \nthat are presently FAA controlled to continue in that vein to make sure \nthat the system is intact, and that the integrity of the functioning is \nas planned. If there is a point in time at some future date when we \nwant to look at this, I am more than willing to discuss it. But I want \nto know exactly what the implications are to the total system, and not \nsimply look at this as a financial gain because in the long run, the \nfinancial gains are ephemeral. We saw it in the British experience. We \nsaw it in the Canadian experience.\n  The Senator from Arizona talked about how nobly the controllers from \nCanada performed on 9/11. Yes, we give them credit for that. But still \nin all, their system falls into higher costs all the time, and it is in \nfinancial despair, if I can use the terminology. We believe we take \ncare of the issues concerned.\n  I think we would like to see what our colleagues have to say about \nthat. In due time, I hope we will bring it to a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for \noffering this amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor. This amendment \nwill bar the use of funds to privatize the functions of the air traffic \ncontrol system in the United States, which will ensure that air traffic \ncontrol will remain a Government function under the control of the \nFederal Aviation Administration.\n  I believe that there are few functions of Government more inherent to \nour responsibility than guaranteeing the safety and security of \nconsumers of transportation in our country. Since September 11, 2001, \nwe have worked to increase the Federal role in improving air security. \nAir traffic control is essential to our Nation's security and it is \nvital that we keep air traffic control within the Government's function \nin order to ensure a safe aviation system on a day-to-day basis. It is \nalso vital in the case of a terrorist attack. This was\n\n[[Page S7790]]\n\ndemonstrated vividly on September 11, when central Government control \nof air traffic proved essential in quickly clearing our skies and \npossibly preventing further casualties.\n  Furthermore, it is clear that the intention of those who oppose this \namendment is to open the door for privatization of air traffic control. \nThis would be a disaster. An extensive Columbia University study that \nlooked at air traffic control privatization in other countries found \nthat there are no operational or economic advantages to privatizing air \ntraffic control. In fact, there is some evidence that suggests \nprivatization can lead to an increase in incidents, as fewer \ncontrollers are used in an attempt to cut costs. For example, \nprivatization in Canada has led to an operational irregularity rate \ntwice ours despite the fact that their air system is 7 percent the size \nof ours. Privatization may also increase costs. The British Government \nhas twice had to bail out its privatized system for $131 million, about \ntwo-thirds of what they originally sold it for.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment in order to \nensure the continued safety of our aviation system. Let us focus on how \nto improve our air traffic control system without compromising safety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside so I may offer an amendment to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if my friend from Mississippi would not \nmind, the Senator from Wyoming has a brief statement counter to the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  So that we can be agreeable, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the Senator from Wyoming, we set aside the Lautenberg \namendment for the purpose of the Senator from Mississippi proposing an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the President, and I thank the Senator from \nMississippi. I will not take long. In fact, I just came from a markup \nin health care. I was very much interested in the discussion that was \ngoing on here. We are all involved, of course, in one way or another in \nair traffic control. I am a former private pilot and have experienced a \ngreat deal over the years. I don't fly anymore because I don't get \nenough opportunity to be safe. Nevertheless, I have listened.\n  First of all, I am very much interested in doing all we can in \ngovernment to modernize and make it as efficient as can be. That is \nwhat the administration seeks to do in various kinds of activities, \ntaking a look at those to see if there is something that can be done \ngovernmentally. If they can do it just as well or better in the private \nsector, there ought to be some competition for that. I believe that. I \nbelieve that very strongly.\n  I am always sort of surprised at the efforts made to keep the \ngovernment from doing that. If they study it and come up with the right \nanswer, I think that is a good idea, instead of saying we ought not to \nbe doing any of those things.\n  I am an advocate of trying to have competition to see how we can do \nthe best thing.\n  Currently, the FAA is reviewing the jobs done by the flight services \nstaff to determine if these jobs could indeed be done better by the \nprivate sector.\n  I think most everyone knows that President Bush and his Secretary \nhave no intention of having private competition for the air traffic \ncontrollers.\n  What we are talking about here is the flight service function, which \nis quite different. Currently provided for in general aviation, of \ncourse, is that pilots currently review it to see if flight service \nfunctions could be modernized by allowing the private sector to provide \nsome of these services.\n  So it seems to me that is reasonable. And to come in with an \namendment that says you cannot take a look at doing something better is \na surprise to me.\n  The commercial airlines rely on the private sector for weather and \nall kinds of things. There is really no reason to think that is \nsomething that is done better by Government people than it is by \nprivate sector people. Who is flying the airplane, for example? That is \nwhere the real test comes.\n  So it seems to me we ought not to adopt this kind of an amendment. \nRemember, this is a current A-76 study that is underway. It is a study, \nand we ought to give that an opportunity to happen.\n  The FAA has categorized air traffic controllers as noninherently \ngovernmental. They have shielded the air traffic controllers from the \nA-76 study.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield for a question?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I asked if the Senator from Wyoming \nwould yield for a question.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Sure. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask if the Senator from Wyoming is aware of the \nfact that some $20 million has already been spent on a survey or a \nstudy of this process?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am not aware of that. Are you aware of the outcome?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No.\n  Mr. THOMAS. No.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The outcome is one we see that says perhaps we ought \nto put the security of the FAA out to the cheapest bidder. I am aware \nthat is where it comes out. And can the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming explain why it is we took this very comfortable, privately \nmanaged sector of our aviation system, the baggage screeners, and \nbrought them into Government at three times the wage they were working? \nThere are 33,000 or 28,000 of those people.\n  Mr. THOMAS. May I answer the question, please?\n  I do know why that is, and I would think you do, too.\n  We decided it right here. I voted against it. I voted for having the \nprivate sector continue. That is why it was done, because it is a \npolitical thing, and you know it and I know it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am delighted--I always enjoy the comments of my \nfriend from Wyoming. We talk the same language in New Jersey.\n  But to say it was a political decision, then it sounds relatively \nmeritoriousless. But I hear people say things are better with the folks \nworking for Government. Of course, we have started to lay off a lot of \nbaggage screeners already. And so, to me, the chances of baggage \nscreening being of the same danger as changing the system that now----\n  Mr. THOMAS. Is there a question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am sorry. Forgive me. I did not mean \nto use the time of the Senator from Wyoming. I was just trying to \nrespond to his answer.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I understand, and you will probably have an opportunity \nto do that. Let me respond to what you are saying.\n  You talk about how much better it is. I think if you had spent that \nmany billions of dollars doing it on the other side, it perhaps would \nhave been better as well.\n  So I urge Senators to not accept this amendment and to let us \ncontinue to have a study of what might better be done rather than \nsaying, flatly, we cannot even take a look at a possible modernization.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 898\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement \npropounded by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending amendments be set aside, and I send an \namendment to the desk and ask it be reported. The amendment is at the \ndesk.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I missed the \nunanimous consent request. What is it? What is the request?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The request is that the pending amendments be set aside \nand that I may be permitted to offer an amendment to the bill.\n  Mr. REID. I would agree to that if we have a time set for a vote on \nthe Lautenberg amendment. Other than that, because I don't want his \namendment to----\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. When would the Senator like to have that vote?\n  Mr. REID. We would like to have it as soon as possible.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that pending the \ndiscussion of the Cochran amendment, we move then to a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Well, I know we have two of our most senior Members here \ninvolved in this debate, Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd, and they \nusually do not talk for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I do not \nintend to talk long. I do hope we can permit Senator Byrd to make a \nstatement on this amendment. I do not know how much time he would need \nfor that purpose.\n  Mr. BYRD. Five minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator says 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I say, we are prepared to accept the amendment by \nSenator Cochran.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] for himself and \n     Mr. Byrd, proposes an amendment numbered 898.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide authorization for an Aviation Security Capital \n                                 Fund)\n\n       On page 145, beginning with line 8, strike all down through \n     and including line 24 on page 147, and insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 402. AVIATION SECURITY CAPITAL FUND.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--There may be established within the \n     Department of Homeland Security a fund to be known as the \n     Aviation Security Capital Fund. There are authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Fund up to $500,000,000 for each of the \n     fiscal years 2004 through 2007, such amounts to be derived \n     from fees received under section 44940 of title 49, United \n     States Code. Amounts in the fund shall be allocated in such a \n     manner that--\n       ``(1) 40 percent shall be made available for hub airports;\n       ``(2) 20 percent shall be made available for medium hub \n     airports;\n       ``(3) 15 percent shall be made available for small hub \n     airports and non-hub airports; and\n       ``(4) 25 percent may be distributed at the Secretary's \n     discretion.\n       ``(b) Purpose.--Amounts in the Fund shall be available to \n     the Secretary of Homeland security to provide financial \n     assistance to airport sponsors to defray capital investment \n     in transportation security at airport facilities in \n     accordance with the provisions of this section. The program \n     shall be administered in concert with the airport improvement \n     program under chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code.\n       ``(c) Apportionment.--Amounts made available under \n     subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) shall be apportioned \n     among the airports in each category in accordance with a \n     formula based on the ratio that passenger enplanements at \n     each airport in the category bears to the total passenger \n     enplanements at all airports in that category.\n       ``(d) Matching Requirements.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Not less than the following percentage \n     of the costs of any project funded under this section shall \n     be derived from non-Federal sources:\n       ``(A) For hub airports and medium hub airports, 25 percent.\n       ``(B) For airports other than hub airports and medium hub \n     airports, 10 percent.\n       ``(2) Use of bond proceeds.--In determining the amount of \n     non-Federal sources of funds, the proceeds of State and local \n     bond issues shall not be considered to be derived, directly \n     or indirectly, from Federal sources without regard to the \n     Federal income tax treatment of interest and principal of \n     such bonds.\n       ``(e) Letters of Intent.--The Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, or his delegate, may execute letters of intent to \n     commit funding to airport sponsors from the Fund.\n       ``(f) Conforming Amendment.--Section 44940(a)(1) of title \n     49, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       `(H) The costs of security-related capital improvements at \n     airports.'.\n       ``(g) Definitions.--Any term used in this section that is \n     defined or used in chapter 417 of title 49 United States Code \n     has the meaning given that term in that chapter.''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I also note that Senator Byrd is a \ncosponsor of the amendment. I appreciate very much hearing the \nassurance of the Senator from Arizona that this amendment will be \naccepted, so I am not going to talk long. I do not want to talk our way \nout of getting this amendment accepted, but I do briefly want to say \nwhat it does, and then I will be happy to yield to Senator Byrd for \nwhatever comments he would like to make.\n  This amendment seeks to amend section 402 of the bill. Section 402 \ncreates a new entitlement program, in effect, and it is a capital fund \nprogram that would permit the Transportation Security Administration to \nuse up to $500 million--the first $500 million collected each year from \nthe emplanement fee; $2.50 per passenger that is now collected under \ncurrent law--and transfer those funds to the Department of \nTransportation for administration of this capital fund.\n  The Department of Transportation could then allocate those funds to \nairports for security improvements. There are provisions in the \namendment about how much hub airports would be entitled to--40 percent; \n20 percent to medium hub airports, and the like. But the problem with \nit is the CBO says that, unlike the arrangement under current law, \nwhere the Transportation Security Administration spends these funds for \nairport screeners and other activities under the jurisdiction of the \nTransportation Security Administration, it would no longer be able to \nhave those activities offset by the funds that are collected from the \npassengers, which means we would have to appropriate additional money \neach year to pay for those purposes that are now being paid for out of \nthe emplanement fund that is designated and earmarked for that purpose \nnow.\n  So what we are doing is saying, it is OK to set up this new capital \nfund, and it is OK to authorize the Transportation Security Agency to \ncollect the money and make it available, but we need to make that \nsubject to appropriations. That is the point because we are going to \ndivert money from the Department of Homeland Security for this new \npurpose, and we have a letter from Secretary Ridge explaining that. I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of his letter dated June 11 to me be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of the \n           Secretary,\n                                                    June 11, 2003.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Administration appreciates the \n     continued support of Congress for improvements in the \n     security of the Nation's civil aviation system and supports \n     Senate passage of S. 824, the Aviation Investment and \n     Revitalization Vision Act (Air-V). However, the \n     Administration opposes a provision in S. 824 that would \n     divert fees collected for security activities for purposes \n     other than the provision of direct security services.\n       With the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Congress identified \n     the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the focal point \n     of the federal government's homeland security efforts, with \n     the mission of preventing terrorist attacks and reducing the \n     nation's vulnerability to terrorism. While the Department \n     welcomes and appreciates the assistance of other agencies in \n     improving security, any diversion of security fees, such as \n     that proposed in S. 824, would directly undermine the \n     Department's ability to fulfill its mission. Air-V would \n     establish an Aviation Security Capital Fund that is both \n     outside the control of the Department and funded by diverting \n     $500 million per year of passenger and air carrier security \n     fees collected by the Transportation Security Administration \n     (TSA). This would diminish the Department's funding capacity. \n     As you know, the direct annual costs of operating the \n     aviation security system are not fully offset by these fees, \n     and diverting fee revenue for other purposes clearly weakens \n     the intended financing structure of TSA set forth in the \n     Aviation and Transportation Security Act. Diversion of the \n     fees into a fund outside of DHS undermines the ability of the \n     Administration to apply these resources to the most pressing \n     security needs.\n       The Administration looks forward to working with Congress \n     to ensure that the version of the bill presented to the \n     President eliminates this objectionable provision.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection, from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program, to the submission of these views for the \n     consideration of the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Tom Ridge.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am hopeful we can go forward. I \nappreciate very much the assurance of the Senator from Arizona that the \namendment will be included in the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and the\n\n[[Page S7792]]\n\nChairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator \nCochran, in offering this amendment today. At the same time, I deeply \nregret the fact that we are being forced to have to come to this floor \nand offer this amendment.\n  S. 824 contains a brand new $500 million entitlement program. This \nlegislation would earmark $500 million of existing aviation security \nfees for grants to airports for construction.\n  The Transportation Security Administration was created by the \nCongress in response to the attacks of September 11. It was a failure \nof our airport screening procedures that allowed 19 men to board \ndomestic airliners with weapons and turn four planes into instruments \nof death and destruction. With the creation of the Department of \nHomeland Security, the TSA was transferred from the Department of \nTransportation to the new Homeland Security Department. The \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, which is so ably \nchaired by the senior Senator from Mississippi, is charged with funding \nthe TSA--one of many agencies now in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  The President's Fiscal Year 2004 budget request for the TSA assumes \nthat $2 billion and $70 million in aviation security fees will go to \nthe TSA to meet its security requirements. These fees are used to fund \nthe thousands of screeners at our airports, for purchasing security \nequipment such as explosives detection equipment, and for the Federal \nAir Marshals program, all of which help secure our airports and the \nmillions of travelers who use them. The provision in this bill that \nSenator Cochran and I are seeking to modify would take $500 million of \nthose fees that the President has requested for the TSA and instead \nearmark the $500 million for a new entitlement program for airport \nconstruction grants.\n  This new mandatory program purports to ``solve'' an airport security \nconstruction problem. However, the provision actually creates a \nhomeland security problem. The provision will create a $500 million \nhole in the TSA budget--a hole that the Homeland Security Subcommittee \nwill be unable to fill without creating other holes in our homeland \nsecurity budget.\n  How should we fill that $500 million hole? Should we take Border \nPatrol agents off our Southwest border? Should we cut port security \nprograms? Should we further slow down the Coast Guard's modernization \nprogram? Should we reduce the numbers of inspectors at our ports of \nentry on our borders and increase the waiting time for agricultural \nproduce to enter the U.S. from Mexico and Canada? Should we cut grants \nto our States and cities to equip and train first responders? These are \nthe very real choices we on the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee will have to face if the provision in this bill is \npermitted to pass.\n  I sympathize with the dilemma facing the members of the Commerce \nCommittee. They are attempting to relieve the security construction \nburden facing our Nation's airports. I support these airport security \nprograms and have provided funds in the past to begin to meet these \nairport security needs. However, the President did not request one dime \nfor airport security construction in his budget, not one dime. So if \nthis provision became law, we would need to cut $500 million from \nhomeland security priorities requested by the President.\n  Our amendment is a simple one. Instead of creating a new entitlement \nprogram, instead of creating a colossal new $500 million earmark, \ninstead of putting airport construction grants at the front of the \nline, ahead of border security, port security or first responder \ngrants, this amendment would simply turn this new $500 million program \ninto an authorization. It would allow the Senate to use the \nappropriations process to make careful choices among the competing \nhomeland security priorities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us on this amendment and strike this \nill-advised provision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are ready to accept the amendment on \nthis side.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It has been cleared on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 898) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will yield briefly, I thank the Senator from \nArizona and the comanager on this side of the aisle for their accepting \nthe amendment. I think it is a real service.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand it is the agreement of the \nSenator from Nevada that we will have a vote at 2:30 on the pending \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I have a small modification, a technical amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 889, as modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a modification of amendment No. 889 \nat the desk. It is a technical correction concerning the sale of \nairline tickets that was inadvertently included in the managers' \npackage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       On page 10, strike lines 11 through 18\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the Lautenberg amendment No. 893 occur at 2:30 today, with \nno amendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote; further, \nthat the remaining time until 2:30 be equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to mention to my colleagues that we \nare moving along on the amendments on this side. I know there is an \namendment by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, which I hope we can \nconsider rather quickly. It is a very interesting amendment on raising \nthe age from 60 to 65. There are several amendments by Senator Burns.\n  I say to my friend on this side that I think we can probably agree to \nat least a majority of them. I know of no other amendments that would \nbe pending on this side. If there are, we hope that during the vote \nthat takes place at 2:30 we can get pending amendments at least brought \nto our attention so we can schedule them. I still believe there is a \nvery good opportunity to finish this legislation tonight.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 891, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that my amendment No. 891 which I \noffered earlier today be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Lautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 893.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. Reid. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords), and the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman), are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\n  The result was announced --- yeas 56, nays 41, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 222 Leg.]\n\n                              YEAS --- 56\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham (FL)\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Edwards\n     Jeffords\n     Lieberman\n  The amendment (No. 893) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To establish age limitations for airmen)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following new section:\n\n     SECTION 521. AGE LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     beginning on the date that is 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act--\n       (1) section 121.383(c) of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, shall not apply;\n       (2) no certificate holder may use the services of any \n     person as a pilot on an airplane engaged in operations under \n     part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, if that \n     person is 65 years of age or older; and\n       (3) no person may serve as a pilot on an airplane engaged \n     in operations under part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, if that person is 65 years of age or older.\n       (b) Effective Date.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     provisions of this section shall take effect on the date that \n     is 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Interim limitation.--During the period that begins on \n     the date that is 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act and ending on the date that is one year after such date--\n       (A) subsection (a)(2) shall be applied by substituting \n     ``64'' for ``65''; and\n       (B) subsection (a)(3) shall be applied by substituting \n     ``64'' for ``65''.\n       (c) Certificate Holder.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``certificate holder'' means a holder of a certificate \n     to operate as an air carrier or commercial operator issued by \n     the Federal Aviation Administration.\n       (d) Reservation of Safety Authority.--Nothing in this \n     section is intended to change the authority of the Federal \n     Aviation Administration to take steps to ensure the safety of \n     air transportation operations involving a pilot who is 60 \n     years of age or older.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to say this is \na noncontroversial amendment which everyone is for.\n  That is not true. But it is a very old subject. I say that in two \nways.\n  It is a subject that has been around for a long time and one that \nneeds to be addressed one way or another.\n  Second, I am offering an amendment that passed out of the Commerce \nCommittee last year. It does one very simple thing. Currently, the age \nlimit for a commercial pilot is age 60. That was established some 40 \nyears ago. The life expectancy since that time has increased by about \n12 years. There is no medical reason that anyone has ever put forward \nwhy a pilot should have to stop flying at age 60. Quite frankly, I know \npilots who are too old to fly at age 50. I am an exception. I am age \n68, and I am a better pilot than I was 40 years ago. But age is \narbitrary. There are no two people alike.\n  For that reason, age 60 being an arbitrary number and having been \naround for some 40 years, my preference would be not to have any age \nlimit at all. Frankly, I think we should have very strong, stringent \nmedical requirements. That is in the law today. And we should have very \nstrong proficiency requirements. That is in the law today. So long as a \nperson is able to do that, that person should be able to continue. But, \nrealistically, I believe people are going to say, well, that could lead \nup to very old ages--even my age. They do not want that to happen.\n  So we are putting an arbitrary age limit of 65 so we can at least \nlook at it for a period of time. There have been a lot of studies. \nJohns Hopkins University School of Hygiene did a study as to what age \nsomeone would not have the proficiency in flying an airplane. They came \nback and said age has absolutely nothing to do with it. There are other \npredictors that are much more important. In fact, some studies have \nshown that airline pilots exceed population norms for physical health \nand mental ability. I believe that is true because they are required to \ntake physicals on a regular basis.\n  I am a commercially rated pilot. I have been for some 40 years. I can \ntell you from personal experience in my particular case. Some of you in \nthis Chamber will remember this. I had an experience just a couple of \nyears ago with a single-engine airplane where the front end of the \nairplane came off in flight. Normally, with that situation you are \nthrough. However, drawing upon experience, I was able to determine \nwhere the new stalling speed was, which was three times what the \nstalling speed normally would be for that aircraft, and come back and \nmade somewhat of a crash landing, I guess, only because I didn't have \nany gears down there. But, nonetheless, quite frankly, I wonder if I \nwould have been able to do that before.\n  At this time, I would like to yield the floor so I can see what type \nof opposition is here today.\n  I would like to tell you that everyone is for it. Quite frankly, \nALPA, the Airline Pilots Association, is not for it. There is a very \ngood reason. It is not a safety reason. It is not an age reason. It is \na monetary reason. I have a great deal of respect for younger pilots \nwho are commercial pilots working for the\n\n[[Page S7794]]\n\nairlines. By getting rid of older pilots, that leaves more upward \nmobility. That is true. I think that is one of the reasons they are \nopposed to it. In fact, I think that is the only reason they are \nopposed to it. Many of the airlines are for it, and some are against \nit. Some of them are in opposition to my amendment as an economic \nissue. As a pilot becomes older, he is paid more money. Consequently, \nthe payrolls in an ailing industry would go up. I am sensitive to that. \nI have weighed that carefully and have determined this is the best \nthing.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take such time as I may consume on \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I intend to oppose the amendment. In many ways, I regret \nopposing my friend from Oklahoma. He is quite a remarkable pilot. I \nhave had the opportunity to ride with him. I believe he flew around the \nworld in a single-engine airplane at one point.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It was actually a twin-engine plane.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Nonetheless, he is a pilot who has flown around the \nworld. He knows a bit about flying.\n  I learned to fly at one point in my life. I know something about the \nwonders of it. I know something about the time the instructor steps out \nof the plane and says: It is your turn. Take it up alone. That is one \nof the moments in your life you will always remember.\n  The issue here is about an age limit for commercial pilots. I don't \nstand here as an expert on this subject. I don't expect there is an \nexpert in the Senate on this subject. The question of the age rule is a \nquestion that the FAA has dealt with, and they have dealt with it \nrepeatedly.\n  The history of this rule goes back many years. It is a rule that has \nbeen around for a long while. It was established by the FAA as a matter \nof safety. I know this rule has actually been considered by the Senate \npreviously as well.\n  At one point during its consideration in the Senate, it was \nconsidered and proposed that we had a shortage of pilots, and, \ntherefore, we should remove this age restriction and increase it some. \nOf course, now we have exactly the opposite. We have many pilots who \nare furloughed and laid off and would like to come to work. That is not \nthe issue. The issue is one of safety.\n  I think the FAA has always erred on the side of safety. I expect that \nall of us want them to err on the side of safety.\n  My judgment about this is that the decision about age requirements \nfor commercial pilots ought to be left to the regulatory agency, the \nFAA. They are the experts in this area. We are not. They know more \nabout this subject than we do.\n  I just feel uncomfortable substituting our judgment, with an \narbitrary number, for the judgment of the FAA.\n  Let me say I am sure the Senator from Oklahoma would agree, the FAA \nhas the opportunity and the discretion and the ability right now this \nafternoon to make that age change, if they wish to do that. The FAA has \nthe authority under law, as I understand it, to change the rule as they \nsee fit. They have continuously, however, kept the 60-year age rule \nbecause they want to maintain the highest degree of safety in air \ntransportation.\n  There have been a number of studies dealing with this issue. In 1979, \nCongress mandated a study conducted under the auspices of the NIH. In \n1990, the House Committee on Public Works asked the Office of \nTechnology Assessment to examine the medical aspects of the Federal \nrequirement that airline pilots retire at age 60 and to assess the \nstate of the art medical risk assessment. There have been a number of \nthese studies.\n  I chose not to go into the conclusions of all the studies except to \nsay that the FAA, in reviewing the body of information in those \nstudies, decided that they believed the 60-year age retirement rule was \nappropriate.\n  Again, in April 2000, the FAA reaffirmed its position and decision to \nmaintain the 60-year retirement age. That decision was appealed to the \ncourts actually in 2001, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals \nupheld the FAA's decision.\n  Once again, I say I am not an expert. I would expect, perhaps, the \nSenator from Oklahoma would make the same statement. The question of \nsafety and the question of the proper retirement age given medical \ncircumstances with respect to commercial flight and the commercial \nlicense that one needs to fly is a decision that is enormously \ncomplicated. It is a decision that has been studied and restudied by \nthe FAA folks whose job it is to provide the assurance of safety. I \nfrankly am comfortable with whatever decision they make.\n  If they were to decide this afternoon, look, we have studied this \nfrom six more angles and here is what we have concluded, and it came up \nwith a different number, that would be fine with me. But I must say, I \nam not comfortable with the Senate arbitrarily deciding there is a \nnumber that we know better than the FAA which represents the risk \nassessment with respect to this mandatory retirement age. For that \nreason, I regret I have to oppose the amendment.\n  Again, let me finish by saying this is not a new subject and not a \nnew debate. We may not know much more about it than we did the last \ntime we debated it, but I believed then and believe now it is \nappropriate to allow the Federal Aviation Administration--the \nregulatory agency that has the experts and has the charge to make these \ndecisions--to make this judgment.\n  Again, it is my contention, if they decided this afternoon to \nincrease that mandatory retirement age, that would be fine with me. And \nthey have that capability under current law to do so, but they have not \nbecause they believe it not advisable. I think the Senate would be well \nadvised to listen to the FAA on this subject.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I have a great deal of \nrespect for the Senator from North Dakota, and some of the things he \nsays certainly do make sense. I would have to say this, though. There \nis not a bureaucracy out there that, now and then, does not have to be \nprodded a little bit because it is the very nature of a bureaucracy not \nto change. They do not want to change.\n  Not long ago, I had a bill, on which I believe the Senator from North \nDakota supported me, called the emergency revocation bill. It took 3 \nyears before we got the votes to pass it. It was something that should \nhave been done, I believe, by the FAA; and I think most of them would \nagree. Many of them in the field have told me since then that it was \nsomething they should have done. They are very busy, they have their \nhands full, and probably the furthest thing from their minds is making \na change.\n  When it gets down to age, when you talk about 60, age 60, when this \nrule was put in, is the same as age 72 today. Everything that is tied \nto an index--whether it is retirement, Social Security--they all have \nincreased in age, except this one issue.\n  As far as safety is concerned, I do not think the FAA would tell you \nthe arbitrary age of 60 or 65 is going to relate to safety. But what \nthey relate to safety is the medical and proficiency requirements, \nwhich are very stringent. And the older you get, I suggested to my \nfriend from North Dakota, the more stringent they become, because I \nhave had to live through this myself.\n  On the argument that there is not a shortage of pilots, now we are \ngoing through a temporary phase. I think, as everyone in this Chamber \nknows, we are going through a rebuilding process of our military, and \nthe supply and demand of pilots is something that is going to change. I \njust hope that does not influence a person into making that decision on \na vote.\n  I say to the Senator, he is right, safety is the big issue. But we \ncan show--and have testimony, a lot of which I have already talked \nabout--that safety is not related to age; it is related to medical \nconditions and proficiency.\n  With that, I yield the floor to see if there are those who want to be \nheard. If not, I will yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have been on the Commerce Committee for \nquite a few years, not nearly as long as my friend from South Carolina, \nbut\n\n[[Page S7795]]\n\nlong enough to know that this issue has been around for a long time.\n  When it was first presented to me, it was presented to my office by a \ngroup of pilots who were nearing the age of 60. And they said: Gee, we \nare in great shape. We fly planes that have two pilots in the cockpit. \nWe would be willing to take three or four physicals every year if \nnecessary. We all know people are living longer. We know that fewer and \nfewer people smoke. We have rigorous physicals.\n  I said: Gee, it makes good sense to me. And as I grow older, it makes \neven more sense to me, I might add to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  But here is the problem. The airlines do not want it because they do \nnot want to pay senior pilots the amount of money they have to pay \nthem, and so they want to get rid of them at age 60 and bring in lower \nsalaried pilots. And, of course, then, incredibly, the younger members \nof ALPA, the Airline Pilots Association, want the old geezers gone so \nthey can move up more rapidly. It is really kind of an incredible \nscenario, when you think about it.\n  We all know that people live longer and are healthier longer. And the \nSenator from Oklahoma probably knows when this rule went into effect. I \nam not sure.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Forty years ago.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Forty years ago. The demographics have changed, and \neverything else has changed. It argues for at least allowing pilots to \nfly longer.\n  By the way, I might say, also--again, maybe I have a little senior's \nbias here--more experienced pilots are better pilots. And if they are \nin good health, and there are two of them in almost every commercial \nairliner, why in the world are we opposed to allowing them to fly \nlonger? Southwest Airlines supports the efforts. SWAPA and other \norganizations and individuals allow pilots to fly commercial jet \naircraft beyond age 60. JetBlue supports it. The low-cost airlines all \nsupport it. The most expensive airlines, the more established ones--\nmost of them are rotating in and out of bankruptcy because of their \noutstanding management practices--are opposed to it.\n  So this is really a no-brainer, Mr. President. We should allow these \npilots to serve longer and fly longer and be able to realize an income \nthat comes from serving these airlines and the American public for a \nlong time.\n  Having said that, we will probably lose because right now, ALPA, the \nAirline Pilots Association, and the executives and lobbyists for the \nmajor airlines are on the phone saying: Don't do this. This could be \nreally dangerous.\n  It is hard for me to believe that someone 61 years old, who passed a \nphysical, who is flying with another qualified pilot, plus, in many \ncases, a flight engineer, is in any way a danger. Not only that, in \ncase there is some kind of emergency, that pilot is probably better \nqualified to handle that emergency by virtue of that pilot's experience \nthan a much younger individual would be.\n  So I will clearly be supporting the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma. I appreciate his courage in bringing up this issue. Maybe \nsomeday we will be able to allow these young men and women to serve \npast age 60 if they are physically and mentally qualified to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nArizona. I would suggest that this is exactly like the bill that came \nout of the Commerce Committee last year or the year before, the 107th \nCongress. I really believe it is time for us to do this. I know where \nthe pressures are against it.\n  If there is no one else on the other side who wants to be heard, I \nwill yield back.\n  Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make one final point.\n  It is not quite so simple to say it is ALPA, the airlines. The fact \nis, the Federal Aviation Administration, the FAA, has the authority \ntoday to make a decision about increasing this retirement age. It has \nchosen not to, I assume because the experts there have taken a look at \nthe OTA study, the accident rates, and whole series of things.\n  I agree, people are living longer, better lives. I have an 81-year-\nold uncle who runs in the Senior Olympics. He runs the 400 and the 800 \nat age 81. People are living longer. I understand all that.\n  The issue is, what the proper age is for retirement of commercial \nairline pilots is not a function of the Senate, making a judgment on \nthe floor of the Senate. In my judgment, it is a function of people who \nknow, the medical experts at the FAA, looking through the data and \nmaking a considered judgment on behalf of the American people of what \nconstitutes their best safety.\n  So that is the basis of this position. It is not, in my judgment, \nabout ALPA or the airlines, it is just saying, look, whatever the \njudgment is, let it be, but let's have the experts make it. That is my \nwhole point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think we have responded to everything \nthe Senator from North Dakota has said. I would only say that there are \na lot of forces out there against it. But every argument that is \nagainst it, that is a legitimate argument, is an economic argument.\n  I believe everyone in this Chamber has to understand that what was \nbeing age 60, 40 years ago, is not the same as being age 60 today. And \neverything else, every other schedule we have written into law, has \nchanged more than this amount during that 40-year period.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield as much time as the Senator from \nMississippi wants from the time remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12 minutes 55 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. I don't believe I will need the entire time. I will take a \nfew minutes to say that, in this case, I do feel the need to oppose \nthis amendment by Senator Inhofe. Our Commerce Committee has discussed \nthis issue several times in the past and at various times we have gone \ndifferent ways on it. In this case, I think you need to look at how we \ngot where we are.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration has the responsibility that is \nmandated to ensure aviation safety. In 1959, they concluded, after \nconcerns developed of potential detrimental effects of aging and the \nrisk of acute and incapacitating medical conditions, that commercial \npilots need to be required to retire at age 60. Today I believe there \nis sufficient evidence to keep that rule. There is not enough evidence \nto reverse that. There is a case here where I believe most of the \nairlines, although not all, support keeping it at 60. There is no \nquestion that the representatives of the pilots prefer to keep it at \n60. So you have an agreement.\n  Also, I do feel as if, particularly in the aviation area, there is a \nneed right now to have some opportunity for retirement at 60, to bring \nin newer, young pilots or, as a matter of fact, to decide they don't \nneed all those pilots. This is a unique time in the aftermath of 9/11, \nwhere at this time I am inclined not to think we should raise the age \nto 65, whereas sometime down the road I might be so inclined.\n  I do worry about age discrimination. As I get older, I worry about it \nmore than I used to. I think in this case, with medical science and the \nacknowledgement of the current situation in the industry, we should \nkeep it at 60.\n  I don't like to be on the other side of my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, but I think, all things considered, we should stick with \nwhat the rule has been.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the three arguments used by the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi are, first, economic. The \npilots' union is opposed to it. I said that in my opening statement. \nThere is a justified reason for that. If I were a young pilot and a \nmember of the union, I might feel the same way because they want more \nupward mobility. As far as the airlines are concerned, yes, they are \ngoing to have to pay a little more. The average older pilots have \ngreater salaries and benefits. These are economic reasons.\n  I think we should consider these reasons but I don't want anybody \nvoting on this and believing in their heart that they are doing it for \nsafety or because of the supply and demand of pilots. We all know that \nwill change; we\n\n[[Page S7796]]\n\nknow that with the restructuring of our military.\n  As I said, if it is a good age--first, it should not be an age at \nall. It ought to be based on medical tests and proficiency tests. If 40 \nyears ago 60 was a good age, 65 would be better now.\n  We will have a chance to look at this. I think there are a lot of \npeople who would like to see a realistic approach to this. I think we \nused the same thing for 40 years and certainly it is justified to raise \nthat at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator talked about a proficiency test. We would not \nhave difficulty if the FAA could find a device that is appropriate to \ndeal with that. I think they have evaluated that for a long period of \ntime and have not been able to come to that conclusion. I don't think \neven those of us who would agree with your amendment believe there is a \nmagic number here. I am not qualified to set the number.\n  I am not suggesting that it is ever appropriate to increase the age \nlimit. I would prefer someone with the capabilities of the FAA to \nevaluate the medical histories to be able to do that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. In terms of proficiency tests, I am a flight instructor. \nI test people, and I think everybody doing that takes into \nconsideration age, and they are more stringent with them as they get \nolder.\n  Again, a person could be more proficient at age 70 than at age 40. \nThis happens to some people. That is why age should not be the \ndetermining factor; proficiency and health should be. Certainly, \neconomic factors should not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Are they prepared to yield back their time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We yield back our time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from MA \n(Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith).

Reserving the right to object, I want to clarify there were \nno time agreements included, just the order that they would discuss the \namendments briefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 906\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     and Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n     Specter, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Pryor, \n     Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Grassley, \n     proposes amendment No. 906.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To preserve the essential air service program)\n\n       Beginning on page 138, line 15, strike all through page \n     142, line 11.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about the \nBingaman-Inhofe amendment to preserve the Essential Air Service \nProgram. Our amendment is cosponsored by Senators Snowe, Jeffords, \nCollins, Specter, Harkin, Clinton, Schumer, Pryor, Ben Nelson, Lincoln, \nand Grassley. I thank them for their support.\n  I first want to compliment Commerce Committee Chariman McCain, \nAviation Subcomittee Chairman Lott, and Ranking Members Hollings and \nRockefeller for their good work on this bill to reauthorize FAA. The \nbill the Senate is now considering, S. 824, will do much to assure the \nsafety and security of the traveling public.\n  I am also pleased S. 824 includes a number of provisions that will \nhelp improve commercial air service in rural areas, including a \nreauthorization of the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot \nProgram.\n  However, we do take issue with one provision in this bill that would \nfor the first time impose new costs on some communities that \nparticipate in the EAS program.\n  As the bill now stands, some communities would be required to pay to \ncontinue to receive scheduled air service I believe this arbitrary \nproposal could eliminate scheduled air service from many rural \ncommunities. Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted to eliminate \nall mandatory cost sharing language from the FAA reauthorization bill. \nI hope the Senate will do the same.\n  Congress established the Essential Air Service Program in 1978 to \nensure that communities that had commercial air service before airline \nderegulation could continue to receive scheduled service. Without EAS, \nmany rural communities would have no commercial air service at all.\n  All across America, small communities face ever-increasing hurdles to \npromoting their economic growth and development. Today, many rural \nareas lack access to interstate or even four-lane highways, railroads \nor broadband telecommunications. Business development in rural areas \nfrequently hinges on the availability of scheduled air service. For \nsmall communities, commercial air service provides a critical link to \nthe national and international transportation system.\n  A recent study from the Department of Agriculture, titled ``How \nImportant is Airport Access for Rural Businesses'' underscores the \nimportance of commercial air service to rural communities. In a survey \nof rural businesses, access to airport facilities and air service was \nfrequently cited as one of the top problems for businesses in most \nrural counties. Air facilities, services, and fares were also found to \nbe important to tourist-related and service businesses in rural areas. \nNot surprisingly, airport access was one of the least cited concerns of \nmanufacturers in large- and medium-sized cities.\n\n[[Page S7797]]\n\n  The Essential Air Service Program currently ensures commercial air \nservice to over 100 communities in thirty-four states. EAS supports an \nadditional 33 communities in Alaska. Because of increasing costs and \nthe current financial turndown in the aviation industry, particularly \namong commuter airlines, about 28 additional communities have been \nforced into the EAS program since the terrorist attacks in 2001.\n  Congress already limits the eligibility of the EAS program to \ncommunities more than 70 miles from a major airport. In addition, the \namount of the subsidy must be less than $200 per passenger for \ncommunities less than 210 miles from a major airport. These \nrequirements serve to limit the cost to the government of the EAS \nprogram. In fact, in the past two years, about a dozen airports, \nincluding one in New Mexico, have been eliminated from EAS because the \ncost per passenger has exceeded the limit. We feel the additional \nrequirements imposed in this bill are not appropriate and could force a \nnumber of communities to lose their commercial air service.\n\n  In my State of New Mexico, five cities currently rely on EAS for \ntheir commercial air service. The communities are Clovis, Hobbs, \nCarlsbad, Alamogordo and my hometown of Silver City. In each case \ncommercial service is provided to Albuquerque, the State's largest city \nand business center.\n  I hope that all Senators recognize the vast distances between \ncommunities in my State. If you drive, Hobbs is 320 miles from \nAlbuquerque, Carlsbad is 283 miles, Silver City 233, Clovis 216, and \nAlamogordo 210 miles. None of these cities are on interstate highways, \nso the driving times to Albuquerque can be 4, 5, and even 6 hours. \nCommercial air service is the only practical way to make the trip for \nbusiness people or community leaders going to Albuquerque or to the \nnearby state capital in Santa Fe. Though so called ``hub'' airports may \nbe located a hundred miles away in another state, it is just not \npractical to drive the long distance to another airport in order to fly \nto Albuquerque. However, that's exactly what is likely to happen if the \nCongress imposes new costs on our communities to maintain their \ncommercial air service.\n  As I understand it, under the proposal in this bill communities in 16 \nstates could be affected by the mandatory cost-sharing requirements in \nthe Senate bill. These States are, Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, \nGeorgia, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, \nNew York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Vermont.\n  The House-reported bill--H.R. 2115--also requires some rural \ncommunities to pay or lose their commercial air service. We believe \nthis ill-conceived proposal could not come at a worse time for small \ncommunities already facing depressed economies and declining tax \nrevenues.\n  The Governor of my state of New Mexico, Bill Richardson, said in a \nletter to me supporting this amendment: The cost sharing provision has \nthe potential to affect the economic welfare of small communities in \nover 35 states---particularly those in New Mexico.\n  I also have a letter of support from the New Mexico State Aviation \nDirector, Mike Rice, who said this: This significant additional \nfinancial burden would have profound negative impacts on both current \nsir service and economic development efforts in several of our cities. \nChanges to current EAS funding could very well jeopardize existing air \nservice in our state.\n  Mayor Donald Carroll of Alamogordo, writes that it is improbable that \nfunding will be available to locally subsidize air service. He also \nnotes that the city is actively working with the commercial carrier, \nRio Grande Air, to increase enplanements.\n  The National Association of Development Organizations says:\n\n       During these challenging economic times, Congress should be \n     working to improve and enhance air service to rural and \n     underserved communities, instead of adding new requirements \n     that would further isolate hundreds of our nation's smaller \n     communities.\n\n  I'm not entirely sure that the proposal to charge the communities to \ncontinue their air service has been thoroughly thought out. \nThe chairman's report on this bill from the Commerce Committee \nindicates that the Secretary will select 10 EAS communities to pay for \ntheir air service. However, the way I read the reported bill, only a \none city in each of 8 states would be required to pay. Now, the \nchairman has offered an amendment that ups that total to 16 states with \nabout 27 communities that could be impacted.\n\n  At the same time, the bill isn't clear on what exactly is a ``hub'' \nairport. As I understand it, the FAA compiles one set of data on annual \nenplanements, but the Department of Transportation currently uses a \ndifferent set of data from the department's Bureau of Transportation \nStatistics to determine eligibility for EAS. These data produce a \ndifferent list of ``hub'' airports, which could change which airports \nwould be required to pay, simply because of the source of the data the \ngovernment chooses to use. Finally, new cities are coming into the EAS \nprogram, so that additional states could have cities that would be \nrequired to pay for their air service.\n  Just one last point on the impacts of this proposal. I think we \nshould make clear this isn't about saving the Government a lot of \nmoney. We estimate the payments from the communities would amount to \nless than $2 million a year out of a $113 million annual program.\n  Advocates of this proposal may claim they've made it as easy as \npossible for the communities to provide the mandatory 10 percent match. \nI just don't believe these alternatives will be all that effective. I \nunderstand, none of the five EAS cities in New Mexico currently charge \nthe commercial carrier any fees to land at the airport. In this way, \nour cities are already contributing to the cost of their commercial air \nservice.\n  I think we all appreciate the current concerns about the aviation \nindustry and the EAS program. Ridership levels to rural cities are \ndown. Meanwhile operating costs continue to increase, resulting in \nticket prices that fewer people can afford. There are too many commuter \naircraft flying at less than half capacity. Clearly, some improvements \nare needed.\n  But what are some better options? Well, I think senators need only \nlook in this same bill for the answer. In my view the bill already \nincludes a number of excellent improvements in the EAS program that I \nbelieve will significantly enhance commercial air service in rural \ncommunities.\n  For example, section 352 of the bill authorizes a new Marketing \nIncentive Program to increase ridership, reduce the Federal subsidies, \nand improve service. Section 353 provides for a number of pilot \nprograms to help communities improve their commercial air service. One \noption is to allow communities to receive service with a smaller \nairplane. In my State, Alamogordo has decided to try service with a \nnine-passenger plane. In addition, communities may opt to convert their \nEAS service to alternative transportation, which might include bus or \nvans. I think these ideas represent a better approach to improving \ncommercial air service in rural areas. I support these proposals and \nwant to thank the chairman and ranking member for including them.\n  The choice here is clear: If we do not preserve the Essential Air \nService Program today, we could well see the end of all commercial air \nservice in rural areas. The EAS program provides vital resources that \nhelp link rural communities to the national and global aviation system. \nOur amendment will help ensure affordable, reliable, and safe air \nservice remains available in rural America.\n  The House of Representatives has already voted to eliminate the \nmandatory cost sharing language from the FAA reauthorization bill. I \nhope all Senators will vote for this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a listing of the communities that could \nbe affected and a letter of support for the amendment by the Governor \nof New Mexico, a letter of support for the amendment from the Director \nof the New Mexico Aviation Division of the New Mexico Department of \nTransportation, a letter from the Mayor of Alamogordo, NM, and a letter \nfrom the National Association of Development Organizations, all in \nsupport of this amendment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7798]]\n\n\n\n                                 TABLE I--100 MILES FROM A SMALL OR HUB AIRPORT\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                State                          EAS city          Distance to small hub   Distance to hub airport\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama..............................

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I am writing regarding S. 824, the \n     Aviation Investment and Revitalization Vision Act that \n     reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration. Although \n     several aspects of this reauthorization bill are to be \n     commended, I am opposed to one specific provision, which \n     calls for a 10 percent cost-sharing requirement for selected \n     Essential Air Service (EAS) communities. This provision has \n     the potential to affect the economic welfare of small \n     communities in over 35 states--particularly those in New \n     Mexico.\n       During my tenure in Congress I understood the importance, \n     which the EAS program played within our small communities by \n     preserving the scheduled air service and ensuring that these \n     communities would retain a link to the national air \n     transportation system. As Governor, I recognize the economic \n     benefits associated with this program, which is integral to \n     the economic development of our small rural communities.\n       The language calling for the Secretary to arbitrarily \n     select 10 EAS communities that are within 100 miles of a hub \n     airport and requiring them to pay a 10 percent cost share for \n     a three year period is not only unfair but unpractical given \n     the current economic conditions in states and within the \n     airline industry. It is my hope that you will work with your \n     colleagues in the Senate to amend this language, which only \n     serves to impose new costs on EAS communities.\n       Last March, I announced the formation of a task force to \n     improve and increase intrastate air service, and air cargo \n     activity in New Mexico. Air service to and within New Mexico \n     is vital to strengthening our economy and those of our \n     communities. Your leadership and support for the EAS program \n     as well as the Small Community Air Service Development \n     Program will go along way to improving and increasing air \n     service in New Mexico.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Bill Richardson,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 New Mexico Aviation Division,\n\n                                        Santa Fe, NM, May 8, 2003.\n     Reessential air service rule changes.\n     Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I am writing to express my \n     opposition to proposed Essential Air Service (EAS) rule \n     changes (Section 353) of Senate Bill 824, the FAA \n     Reauthorization legislation. While this bill does have many \n     favorable aspects, Section 353 contains major program funding \n     changes. As written, affected EAS pilot program communities \n     would be required to assume ten percent (10%) of their \n     subsidy costs for a three year period. This could very easily \n     cost a community $80,000--$90,000 per year! If approved, this \n     significant additional financial burden would have profound \n     negative impacts on both current air service and economic \n     development efforts in several of our cities (Alamogordo and \n     Hobbs) that would be affected. Any changes to current EAS \n     funding could very well jeopardize existing air service in \n     our state.\n       The timing of this change could not have come at a worst \n     time for us. Just recently, Governor Bill Richardson \n     established a high level task force (three Cabinet \n     Secretaries) to determine ways to improve intra-state air \n     service for New Mexicans. I am concerned that the basic \n     foundation of the EAS program, as we know it, could be \n     further weakened by these types of rule changes, and in turn \n     defeat our Governor's initiative.\n       I am well aware of the need to adjust the current EAS \n     program but firmly believe that both the states and \n     communities participating in the program should have an input \n     to the reconstruction process.\n       I am respectfully requesting your assistance in removing \n     the EAS Local Program cost sharing provisions from Senate \n     Bill 824.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        John D. ``Mike'' Rice,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     New Mexico Aviation Division.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           City of Alamogordo,\n\n                                     Alamogordo, NM, May 15, 2003.\n     Re essential air service rule changes.\n\n     Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the City of Alamogordo, \n     I am writing to express my concerns and opposition to the \n     proposed Essential Air Service (EAS) rule changes (Section \n     353) of Senate Bill 824, the FAA Reauthorization Legislation. \n     Although this bill has many favorable aspects, the program \n     funding changes are not an alternative for the City of \n     Alamogordo and the surrounding communities the airport \n     serves. In pertinent part, Section 353(4)(A) would require \n     the City of Alamogordo to assume ten percent (10%) of the \n     subsidy cost or approximately Eight-Five Thousand Dollars \n     ($85,000) annually for the next three (3) years.\n       This change could not have come at a more inappropriate \n     time for the City. With City revenues declining from a \n     depressed economy, and capital desperately needed to repair \n     Alamogordo's water problems, it is improbable funding will be \n     available to locally subsidize air service. The airport \n     relies solely on City revenue to operate since eighty-eight \n     percent (88%) of Otero County land is Federally and Tribally \n     owned and generates no revenue for the City. However, we have \n     taken measures which we believe will ultimately permit air \n     service in Alamogordo to be a stand alone enterprise. As you \n     know, Alamogordo was the first EAS community nationwide to \n     request smaller commercial aircraft in an effort to stabilize \n     federal subsidy and ticket costs. Additionally, our air \n     carrier, Rio Grande Air, reduced fares by sixty percent (60%) \n     last month in an effort to increase enplanements at the \n     airport. We have noted a marked increase in ridership since \n     implementation of this low fare. If the EAS rule changes are \n     passed as proposed, the City of Alamogordo may be forced to \n     discontinue commercial air service and thus, sacrifice all \n     Airport Improvement Program (AIP) entitlement/grant funds.\n       Otero County is below the State average for median income. \n     The County has no passenger train service and is not located \n     near a freeway making the airport and air service a vital \n     link to the national transportation system.\n       I am respectfully requesting your assistance in removing \n     the EAS local program cost sharing provisions from Senate \n     Bill 824.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Donald Carroll,\n                                              Mayor of Alamogordo.\n\n[[Page S7799]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    Development Organizations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the National \n     Association of Development Organizations (NADO), I am writing \n     to express our strong support for your amendment to preserve \n     rural air service as part of the FAA reauthorization bill (S. \n     824).\n       The national transportation network functions properly when \n     it helps form vital social and economic connections. This is \n     especially true in small metropolitan and rural America where \n     distance and a scattered population make these connections \n     even more important. The national aviation system is \n     essential not only for linking people to jobs, health care \n     and family in a way that enhances their quality of life, but \n     also for contributing to regional economic growth and \n     development by linking business to customers, goods to \n     markets and tourists to destinations.\n       Within the transportation system, the aviation network \n     plays an enormous role in transporting goods and people. In \n     2001, 542 million people flew domestically and another 52 \n     million flew internationally on US carriers, according to the \n     US Department of Transportation. Unfortunately, since the \n     deregulation of the aviation industry in the late 1970s the \n     availability of affordable and reliable air service in most \n     rural and small metropolitan areas has dramatically declined.\n       During these challenging economic times, Congress should be \n     working to improve and enhance air service to rural and \n     underserved communities, instead of adding new requirements \n     that would further isolate hundreds of our nation's smaller \n     communities. While the Essential Air Service (EAS) program is \n     small by Washington standards, we believe it offers vital \n     resources for linking rural communities to the national and \n     global aviation systems. By adopting your amendment, the US \n     Senate would be reinforcing its support of maintaining \n     affordable, reliable and safe air service to rural America.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Aliceann Wohlbruck,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Bingaman-\nInhofe amendment to strike language requiring certain communities \nenrolled in the Essential Air Service to provide a local cost-share.\n  We are asking our towns and communities, our local governments, \nhardest hit by difficult economic times to suddenly find thousands of \ndollars in their already overstretched budgets to replace a significant \nsource of Federal funding, for a critical economic function.\n  In this time of economic uncertainty, rural communities are \nstruggling to maintain their daily ways of life. With an added burden \nplaced upon them, survival and the opportunity for further rural \ndevelopment will be nearly impossible.\n  Local airports and the commercial air service they provide are \nextremely important to small towns, and a strong component of a State's \neconomy. By enacting a cost-share provision, we run the risk of losing \nthese airports, and cutting off a vital economic lifeline to rural \nAmerica.\n  In my State, airports in Jonesboro, Hot Springs, and Harrison provide \naffordable and reliable service to over 10,000 customers a year. The \nEAS funding they receive is a sound investment in our State's \ntransportation network. Cost share provisions, however, could put those \nairports out of business.\n  We are already putting enough strain on our small towns and local \ngovernments. We do not need to add to that by eliminating a vital \nsource of funding for a vital function. This amendment would prevent \nthat from happening, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 906) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 903\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Boxer, \nto offer the Arming Cargo Pilots Against Terrorism Act as an amendment \nto this bill. This amendment closes a loophole to better protect our \nhomeland against terrorists. As a result of the airplane hijackings on \nSeptember 11, 2001, Congress took the appropriate action to prevent the \nuse of airliners being used as missiles. Last year, large majorities of \nthe Senate and House of Representatives voted to arm both cargo and \npassenger pilots who voluntarily went for stringent training as part of \na program of homeland security which was in the Homeland Security bill. \nArming these pilots served to protect the pilots and crew, passengers, \nand those on the ground from ever being victims of another airline \nhijacking. It was the right thing to do.\n  However, during conference of the Homeland Security bill, the cargo \npilots were yanked out of the bill. This amendment will return them and \nclose the loophole created when they were left out last year.\n  This provision enjoys broad support and has already passed the Senate \nas part of the Air Cargo Security Act earlier this year.\n  Obviously, I would not be offering it had not the bill gotten tied up \nin conference and we need another vehicle to get it back to the House, \nso that is the reason we are offering it on this bill.\n  Not too many people realize that cargo space is usually not secured \nas well as passenger space. There are no air marshals, there are no \npassengers to help protect against terrorists, and there are sometimes \ninvasions of privacy on these planes. In fact, someone from North \nDakota actually broke the security and entered an aircraft. Thank God \nshe was found out before the aircraft took off.\n  We would like this to be added to this bill so we can get it back to \nthe House and a new conference. The whole area of cargo aircraft is not \nsecured by the TSA and many other people who secure passenger terminals \nor commercial flights. I hope we can agree and get this bill over to \nthe House.\n  I hope the rest of my colleagues here in the Senate will support this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question? Isn't it the case \nthe Senator has added language that indicates that nonlethal weapons--\n--\n  Mr. BUNNING. Nonlethal weapons, and totally voluntary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I support the amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. They are called Tasers.\n  Mr. BOXER. Mr. President, this amendment is to close a loophole in \nthe Federal Flight Deck Officer program.\n  Last year, in response to the September 11 attacks, I worked along \nwith our former colleague Senator Bob Smith to pass the Arming Pilots \nAgainst Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act, which allowed passenger and \ncargo pilots who volunteer and receive special training to have guns in \nthe cockpit as a last line of defense.\n  The bill passed the Senate 87-6 as an amendment to the Homeland \nSecurity bill.\n  Unfortunately, during the Homeland Security conference, cargo pilots \nwere left out of the program.\n  This amendment will close this dangerous loophole in the law and add \nan important new layer to our homeland security by allowing cargo \npilots to participate in the Federal Flight Deck Officer program.\n  With less security than passenger aircraft, cargo planes are tempting \ntargets for terrorists. These planes do not have strengthened cockpit \ndoors, Federal Air Marshals, trained cabin crew, or alert passengers on \nboard.\n  Cargo planes are usually more vulnerable on the tarmac than passenger \naircraft. Most cargo planes are parked in remote areas with relatively \neasy access; many operate at airfields that do not have the same level \nof security as passenger airports.\n  Late last year in Fargo, ND, a mentally unbalanced woman walked \nacross a runway, boarded a cargo aircraft, entered the cockpit, and \nasked the crew to fly her to California.\n  Just think what a terrorist could do. A terrorist could hijack a \ncargo plane and fly it into a building, nuclear power plant, or other \ntarget on the ground.\n  Cargo pilots must be given a last line of defense to keep terrorists \nfrom gaining control of their aircraft.\n  We need to close this gap in our homeland security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7800]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] for himself and \n     Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 903.\n\n  The amendment is as follows.\n\n(Purpose: To amend title 49, United States Code, to allow the arming of \n                       pilots of cargo aircraft)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. __. ARMING CARGO PILOTS AGAINST TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Arming \n     Cargo Pilots Against Terrorism Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During the 107th Congress, both the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed measures that \n     would have armed pilots of cargo aircraft.\n       (2) Cargo aircraft do not have Federal air marshals, \n     trained cabin crew, or determined passengers to subdue \n     terrorists.\n       (3) Cockpit doors on cargo aircraft, if present at all, \n     largely do not meet the security standards required for \n     commercial passenger aircraft.\n       (4) Cargo aircraft vary in size and many are larger and \n     carry larger amounts of fuel than the aircraft hijacked on \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (5) Aircraft cargo frequently contains hazardous material \n     and can contain deadly biological and chemical agents and \n     quantities of agents that cause communicable diseases.\n       (6) Approximately 12,000 of the nation's 90,000 commercial \n     pilots serve as pilots and flight engineers on cargo \n     aircraft.\n       (7) There are approximately 2,000 cargo flights per day in \n     the United States, many of which are loaded with fuel for \n     outbound international travel or are inbound from foreign \n     airports not secured by the Transportation Security \n     Administration.\n       (8) Aircraft transporting cargo pose a serious risk as \n     potential terrorist targets that could be used as weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       (9) Pilots of cargo aircraft deserve the same ability to \n     protect themselves and the aircraft they pilot as other \n     commercial airline pilots.\n       (10) Permitting pilots of cargo aircraft to carry firearms \n     creates an important last line of defense against a terrorist \n     effort to commandeer a cargo aircraft.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     members of a flight deck crew of a cargo aircraft should be \n     armed with a firearm and taser to defend the cargo aircraft \n     against an attack by terrorists that could result in the use \n     of the aircraft as a weapon of mass destruction or for other \n     terrorist purposes.\n       (d) Arming Cargo Pilots Against Terrorism.--Section 44921 \n     of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``passenger'' each place \n     that it appears; and\n       (2) in subsection (k)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) by striking ``or,'' and all that follows; and\n       (ii) by inserting ``or any other flight deck crew \n     member.''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) All-cargo air transportation.--For the purposes of \n     this section, the term air transportation includes all-cargo \n     air transportation.''.\n       (e) Time for Implementation.--The training of pilots as \n     Federal flight deck officers required in the amendments made \n     by subsection (d) shall begin as soon as practicable and no \n     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (f) Effect on Other Laws.--The requirements of subsection \n     (e) shall have no effect on the deadlines for implementation \n     contained in section 44921 of title 49, United States Code, \n     as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 903) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is my amendment the amendment pending before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not pending but it is in order.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask it be considered at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, the amendment is now \npending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 890\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I visited with my colleagues Senator Lott \nand Senator McCain on this amendment. I believe they are prepared to \naccept it. This deals with the creation of an aviation security capital \nfund. Many of us know both revenues and passenger boardings are down in \nairports. We have gone through a pretty difficult time. The creation of \nthis aviation security capital fund is very important in order for \nthese funds to be invested in what that will make aviation safer and \ndeal with the security issues we intend to have dealt with with this \nfund.\n  I think it appropriate at this point to waive the local match, State \nand local match, which I believe in most cases cannot be raised because \nof the circumstances I mentioned earlier.\n  I believe accepting this amendment will give us the assurance that \nthis investment in security will be made across this country. It will \nbe a wise investment. I think it ought not be borne by the carriers at \nthis point, nor the local airports that can least afford it.\n  I appreciate very much the fact this will now be accepted by the \nSenate. I want to especially say thanks to the Senator from \nMississippi. We have talked about this, I suppose, 10 times in recent \ndays. He is a tireless advocate for what makes sense for our aviation \nsystem in this country. Of course, he is chairing the subcommittee here \nin the Senate on those issues.\n  I thank him for his cooperation in allowing us to move forward with \nthis amendment at this stage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Has Senator Dorgan completed his remarks?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think the order was for Senator Inhofe to be next, but \nsince he is not here, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to speak \nat this time, despite the previous agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, certainly I always enjoy working with \nSenator Dorgan on these issues. I think he has a legitimate point.\n  He does note that we need a fund to make sure these security fees go \nfor the purpose they were intended. But he does think, at least in this \ninstance because of the security aspect, we should waive the local \nrequirement.\n  It should also be noted that, in fact, local communities, \nparticularly with bigger airports, are probably not going to get or \ncould not get a cost share, and, even if they did in some ways, it \nwould be passed on to the airlines, therefore undermining a lot of what \nwe are trying to do now.\n  We are trying to get the priorities set where the people who are \ngetting certain parts of the security should be the ones who pay for \nit, and we shouldn't always try to find a way to pass it off to the \nairlines. Sometimes it is a Federal responsibility. In other instances, \nother people--I think also local governments--should have some part of \nthis pie. But we agreed for a variety of reasons to accept Senator \nDorgan's amendment.\n  But I want colleagues to know and the American people to know the \nBingaman amendment does the same thing but in a different category. I \nthink, in fact, it is even worse. In the essential air service area, \nwhere special help goes to small airports and a lot of rural airports--\nthat affects airports in West Virginia, North Dakota, and probably in \nmy State of Mississippi--with this additional Federal assistance to \nkeep airports functioning, there would be some small local match. The \nadministration recommended, by the way, that we eliminate the EAS \nproblem; or, if we had EAS, you have the local match required for all \nof the airports.\n  The language in the bill specifies that there would be 10 airports \nwhere we would have this local match to see how it would work, and if \nit would work.\n  We now are agreeing to accept the Bingaman amendment because right \nnow, I think out of concern for local communities and trying to have \nthis essential air service, the amendment would probably pass.\n  But I want to say, again, I think for us to set the precedent and \nrequire not even a dollar from local communities when they are getting \nadditional security, particularly where they are getting essential air \nservice which is vital to their communities and which is important from \nan economic standpoint for the local cities and counties to put up no \nmoney--and in the case of the Dorgan amendment--at least in the bigger \nairports, it could create definite problems in terms of costs being \npassed on to the airlines. In this case, it is\n\n[[Page S7801]]\n\njust a question of these local communities not wanting to have to share \nat all.\n  I think we should continue to look at some small amount--10 percent \nor 5 percent, some amount of local share.\n  But for now, we will accept it. We will continue to work on these \nissues. It is important for us to get this important legislation \ncompleted so that the airlines, the airports, general aviation, and the \nAmerican people will know what they can count on in terms of the \nFederal Aviation Administration and their programs over the next 3 \nyears. I thank my colleagues for allowing me to interject my remarks at \nthis point.\n  I believe Senator Inhofe is next in order to speak.\n  I yield the floor, unless Senator Dorgan would like me to yield to \nhim. Does he want to get action on his amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator to yield for a \nmoment.\n  I think there is great merit in local matching, by and large, because \nyou need local support. We ought not just create pools of money here in \nthe Congress to send out around the country unless there is evidence of \nlocal support.\n  The Senator from Mississippi made the point, and I think it is an \nimportant point.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the American \nAssociation of Airport Executives, and a letter from the Air Transport \nAssociation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: We are writing to express our support \n     for an amendment that you may offer to the S. 824, the \n     Aviation Investment and Revitalization Vision Act, that will \n     help airports in North Dakota and throughout the country pay \n     for their increased capital security costs.\n       As you know, S. 824 includes would establish an aviation \n     security capital fund to pay for installation of Explosive \n     Detection Systems (EDS) and other capital security costs at \n     airports. Specifically, the bill calls for $500 million every \n     year between 2004 and 2007 to pay for the security capital \n     costs. The funds would be derived from revenue generated by \n     the $2.50 passenger security fee.\n       Airports Council International-North America and The \n     American Association of Airport Executives strongly support \n     the creation of an aviation security capital fund. Without a \n     separate source of funds to pay for capacity security \n     projects, airports will be forced to continue divert their \n     Airport Improvement Program funds, which they traditionally \n     use for much-needed safety and capacity projects.\n       The Senate proposal calls for large- and medium-hub \n     airports to pay a 25 percent match, and smaller airports to \n     pay a 10 percent match. While we are grateful that S. 824 \n     would create the aviation security capital fund, we strongly \n     support your proposal to eliminate the matching requirement. \n     Installing explosive detection machines is a federal national \n     security mandate, and we think the federal government should \n     reimburse airports for those and other new security costs.\n       Airports like others in the aviation industry have been \n     struggling since September 11. It would be difficult for \n     airports to cover the proposed match at a time when their \n     revenues and passenger boarding are down, and their costs \n     have skyrocketed due to a host of unfunded federal security \n     mandates. Again, we strongly believe that airports should not \n     be forced to divert critical safety and capacity funds to pay \n     for security.\n       Moreover, airports are reluctant to pass additional costs \n     on to airport users including airlines that are facing their \n     own financial challenges. Since September 11, airports around \n     the country have been taking numerous steps to reduce costs \n     in an effort to pass those savings on to the airlines. \n     Eliminating the matching requirement is just one more way \n     that airports can help their partners in the aviation \n     industry.\n       Thank for your leadership on this and other aviation \n     issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Z. Plavin,\n       President, ACI-NA.\n     Charles Barclay,\n       President, AAAE.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: On behalf of ATA member airlines, I am \n     writing in support of your efforts to remove the ``local \n     match'' requirement in the Security Capital Fund found in the \n     Senate FAA reauthorization bill. Your amendment will ensure \n     that airport security projects will not be subject to an \n     unworkable funding scheme.\n       As you are aware, the Aviation and Transportation Security \n     Act of 2001 imposed sweeping security mandates on the \n     airlines and airports, many of which were unfunded. Today, in \n     this constrained, unsettled financial environment, our \n     members continue to incur substantial costs to meet these \n     mandates. While the airlines have been and will continue to \n     fully support efforts by the U.S. Government, particularly \n     the Transportation Security Administration, to assume primary \n     responsibility for aviation security, the airlines simply \n     cannot continue to absorb additional costs. Sufficient \n     federal funding for mandated airport security projects, such \n     as installation of Explosive Detection Systems and additional \n     law enforcement personnel makes common sense and is \n     absolutely critical.\n       If, as is provided in the current bill, local airports must \n     provide 25% matching funds at large and medium hub airports \n     and 10% matching at smaller airports, the airports (also \n     experiencing declining reserves) will have no option other \n     than to pass through these costs to the airlines. On top of \n     existing security costs, airlines will see significant \n     increases in airport rates and charges, as well as other \n     airport costs, to fund these mandatory contributions. \n     Although the airlines, of course, support security \n     enhancements, the industry can ill afford hundreds of \n     millions of dollars in additional unfunded mandates as the \n     aviation system struggles to survive economically.\n       Thank you for your efforts on this critical issue. I look \n     forward to working with you as we work to maintain a viable, \n     safe, and efficient air transportation system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James C. May.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the American Association of Airport \nExecutives and the Air Transport Association, and others, have told us \nit is unlikely we would see the security investment--after all, this is \nnational security--we would not see the security investment in airport \nimprovement and safety with this money if we did not waive the local \nmatch.\n  I continue to believe we ought to make this habit forming. The value \nexpressed by the Senator from Mississippi is on the mark in many cases. \nI appreciate very much the ability to work this out and be able to move \nthis amendment. If appropriate, I think it has been agreed to by both \nsides. I ask if we can have the amendment considered at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? Without objection, \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 890) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 894 and 895 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have two technical amendments. They have \nbeen agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes amendments \n     numbered 894 and 895 en bloc.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments en bloc are as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the provisions dealing with security measures for \n                   general aviation and air charters)\n\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 405.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment \nthat will close a serious loophole regarding foreign flight student \ntraining that was created in the Aviation Security Act of 2001. This \namendment has passed the Senate twice on other bills since I first \nintroduced it in the 107th Congress.\n  This amendment is another important step toward fully protecting the \nUnited States and all Americans from terrorists who intend to use our \naviation system to commit future attacks.\n  We must continue to be vigilant in protecting our Nation. This \namendment addresses a deep concern regarding foreign citizens coming to \nthe United States to receive pilot training on all sizes of aircraft. \nThis concern clearly is shared by the administration. In fact, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, released an advisory on May 1, \n2003 titled ``The Continuing Threat to Aviation'' citing that al-Qaida \noperatives may ``attempt to use charter or general aviation aircraft to \nconduct future attacks because of their availability, less stringent \nprotective measures, and destructive potential.'' The advisory \ncontinued on to say that ``[c]harter aircraft also may be attractive \nbecause terrorists may only need an established line of credit to gain \naccess to an aircraft and because some agencies allow the use of \ncustomer pilots.'' Finally, and of greatest concern, the DHS warns that \n``[r]eliable information . . . indicated al-Qaida might use experienced \nnon-Arab pilots to rent three to four light aircraft under the guise of \nflying lessons.'' This threat to our national security is real and \ncannot be understated. I ask unanimous consent that the Department of \nHomeland Security advisory be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Department of Homeland Security Advisory 03-019--Security Information \n                  for General Aviation Pilots/Airports\n\n       This advisory was produced by the Department of Homeland \n     Security based on information and analysis from the Terrorist \n     Threat Integration Center received during the last 24 hours.\n\n\n                   the continuing threat to aviation\n\n       Al-Qaida has long considered attacking U.S. Homeland \n     targets using light aircraft. Recent reliable reporting \n     indicates that al-Qaida was in the late stages of planning an \n     aerial suicide attack against the U.S. Consulate in Karachi. \n     Operatives were planning to pack a small fixed-wing aircraft \n     or helicopter with explosives and crash it into the \n     consulate. This plot and a similar plot last year to fly a \n     small explosive-laden aircraft into a U.S. warship in the \n     Persian Gulf demonstrate al-Qaida's continued fixation with \n     using explosive-laden small aircraft in attacks. General \n     aviation aircraft that were loaded with explosives to enhance \n     their destructive potential would make them the equivalent of \n     a medium-sized truck bomb.\n       Al-Qaida may attempt to use charter or general aviation \n     aircraft to conduct future attacks because of their \n     availability, less stringent protective measures, and \n     destructive potential. The group has a fair sized pilot cadre \n     and the use of small aircraft requires far less skill and \n     training than some larger aircraft.\n       Charter aircraft also may be attractive because terrorists \n     may only need an established line of credit to gain access to \n     an aircraft and because some agencies allow the use of \n     customer pilots. Security procedures typically are not as \n     rigorous as those for commercial airlines and terrorists \n     would not have to control a large number of passengers.\n       Reliable information obtained last year indicated al-Qaida \n     might use experienced non-Arab pilots to rent three or four \n     light aircraft under the guise of flying lessons.\n       In consideration of the above information, the Department \n     of Homeland Security asks members of the General Aviation \n     community to report all unusual and suspicious activities. If \n     your observe persons, aircraft, and operations that do not \n     fit the customary pattern at your airport, you should \n     immediately advise law enforcement authorities.\n       Your immediate action is requested for these items:\n       Secure unattended aircraft to prevent unauthorized use.\n       Verify the identification of crew and passengers prior to \n     departure.\n       Verify that baggage and cargo are known to the persons on \n     board.\n       Where identification systems are in place, ensure employees \n     wear proper identification and challenge persons not doing \n     so.\n       Increased vigilance should be directed toward the \n     following:\n       Unknown pilots and/or clients for aircraft or helicopter \n     rentals or charters.\n       Unknown service/delivery personnel.\n       Aircraft with unusual or unauthorized modifications.\n       Persons loitering in the vicinity of aircraft or air \n     operations areas.\n       Persons who appear to be under stress or the control of \n     other persons.\n       Persons whose identification appears altered or \n     inconsistent.\n       Persons loading unusual or unauthorized payload onto \n     aircraft.\n       NOTE: All charter operators subjected to the 12-5 rule, \n     Standard Security Program and the Private Charter Security \n     Program, are reminded to ensure compliance with these \n     security requirements.\n       Persons should immediately report such activity to local \n     law enforcement and the TSA General Aviation Hotline at 866-\n     GASECUR (866-427-3287).\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Unfortunately, we all have seen what can \nhappen when people come to our country with the specific intent to do \nus great harm. It has become painfully clear that many of the September \n11 hijackers learned to fly the planes they used as deadly weapons at \nflight schools here in the United States, some in my home State of \nFlorida.\n  Section 113 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which \nwas enacted in the 107th Congress, requires background checks of all \nforeign flight school applicants seeking training to operate aircraft \nweighing 12,500 pounds or more. While this provision should help \nprevent September 11 style\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\nattacks by U.S. trained pilots using hijacked jets in the future, it \ndoes nothing to prevent different types of potential attacks against \nour domestic security. To rectify this problem, I introduced S. 236 \ntogether with Senators Corzine, Enzi, Feinstein, and Thomas earlier \nthis year.\n  Small aircraft can be used by terrorists to attack nuclear \nfacilities, carry explosives, or deliver biological or chemical agents. \nFor example, if a crop duster filled with a combination of fertilizers \nand explosives were crashed into a filled sporting event stadium \nthousands of people could be seriously injured or killed. We cannot \nallow this to happen. We need to ensure that we are not training \nterrorists to perform these activities. We cannot allow critical \nwarnings to go unheeded.\n  This bill will close an important loophole and answer these critical \nwarnings by extending the background check requirement to all foreign \napplicants to U.S. flight schools, regardless of the size aircraft they \nseek to learn to fly. It also transfers the entire security background \ncheck program from the Department of Justice to the Department of \nHomeland Security, specifically to the Transportation Security \nAdministration. It is my expectation that the Transportation Security \nAdministration, which provided excellent advice in the fine tuning of \nthis legislation, will apply a stringent level of background screening \nto all foreign nationals who seek flight training here in the United \nStates. We cannot allow anyone to slip through the cracks. We cannot \naid anyone who intends to do harm to Americans and to our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 909) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 910\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, this amendment takes care of the EAS \neligibility up in Vermont.\n  This has been checked through.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for Mr. \n     Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 910.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide a 1 year extension of essential air service to an \nairport whose eligibility was terminated due to the impact of decreased \n                              air travel)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . 1-YEAR EXTENSION OF EAS ELIGIBILITY FOR COMMUNITIES \n                   TERMINATED IN 2003 DUE TO DECREASED AIR TRAVEL.\n\n       Notwithstanding the rate of subsidy limitation in section \n     332 of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 2000, the Secretary of Transportation may \n     not terminate an essential air service subsidy provided under \n     chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code, before the end \n     of calendar year 2004 for air service to a community--\n       (1) whose calendar year ridership for 2000 was sufficient \n     to keep the per passenger subsidy below that limitation; and\n       (2) that has received notice that its subsidy will be \n     terminated during calendar year 2003 because decreased \n     ridership has caused the subsidy to exceed that limitation.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me check with my distinguished \ncolleague from Mississippi. This is a Jeffords amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wanted to make sure I understood what this \namendment is. I had not had a chance to look at it. It is not specific \nto a particular airport or a particular State.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. It does change the formula on how these funds will be \nspent. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Eligibility; that is right.\n  Mr. LOTT. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 910) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 911\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To expand aviation capacity and alleviate congestion in the \n                   greater Chicago metropolitan area)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 217.

The letter of intent \n     application shall be considered upon completion of the \n     environmental impact statement and benefit cost analysis in \n     accordance with Federal Aviation Administration requirements. \n     The Administrator shall consider the letter of intent \n     application not later than 90 days after receiving it from \n     the applicant.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, does the Senator from Arizona approve of \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? \nWithout objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 911) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 912\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, I send an amendment to the desk on the study of \nthe shuttle services at Reagan National Airport. It merely requires a \nstudy with respect to housing of gates used by the shuttle services, \nand as to whether or not that is feasible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for Mr. \n     Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 912.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require a study on the housing of the gates used by \n shuttle services within the same terminal at Ronald Reagan Washington \n                           National Airport)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC--. LOCATION OF SHUTTLE SERVICE AT RONALD REAGAN \n                   WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT.\n\n       The Airports Authority (as defined in section 49103(1)) of \n     title 49, United States Code) shall in conjunction with the \n     Department of Transportation conduct a study on the \n     feasibility of housing the gates used by all air carriers \n     providing shuttle service from Ronald Reagan Washington \n     National Airport in the same terminal.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if there is no further debate----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Dodd amendment \nstudies the situation at National Airport where there is some distance \nbetween both airlines that conduct shuttles along the east coast.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I can see why Senator Dodd might want that looked at as \nhe grows older, shuttling himself back and forth from one end of Reagan \nNational Airport to the other, which is a bit of a trial. And I \ncertainly am in support, having undergone that unique experience.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Particularly becoming a recent father, he is wearing \ndown.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is right. Having to carry a small child with him has \nbecome a bit of a burden. So on behalf of Senator Dodd, and all of us \nwho are aging, I ask that this amendment, which asks the airlines to \ntake a look at the possibility of making these shuttles closer \ntogether, be adopted. I think it is appropriate and I support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If there is no further debate, without objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 912) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding we have a number of \nadditional amendments which have been agreed to but have not been \npresented at this time. If the staffs of the Members who have these \namendments we have discussed and have agreed to--one is a Nelson \namendment. That has already been accepted. One is a Feinstein \namendment. We are in agreement with it, but it has not been formally \noffered. One is a Specter amendment that we are considering now, a \nBurns amendment concerning general aviation, a Murkowski amendment \nconcerning decision on a tower. We would like to consider those \namendments as soon as possible, if the sponsors of those amendments \nwould come here, while we are preparing to debate a Specter amendment \nat this time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 913\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 913.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To permit Jackson Hole Airport to adopt certain noise \n                          reduction measures)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 521. EXEMPTION FOR JACKSON HOLE AIRPORT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding chapter 475 of title 49, \n     United States Code, or any other provision of law, if the \n     Board of the Jackson Hole Airport in Wyoming and the \n     Secretary of the Interior agree that Stage 3 aircraft \n     technology represents a prudent and feasible technological \n     advance which, if implemented at the Jackson Hole Airport, \n     will result in a reduction in noise at Grand Teton National \n     Park--\n       (1) the Jackson Hole Airport may impose restrictions on, or \n     prohibit, the operation of Stage 2 aircraft weighing less \n     than 75,000 pounds, with reasonable exemptions for public \n     health and safety;\n       (2) the notice, study, and comment provisions of subchapter \n     II of chapter 475 of title 49, United States Code, and part \n     161 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, shall not apply \n     to the imposition of the restrictions;\n       (3) the imposition of the restrictions shall not affect the \n     Airport's eligibility to receive a grant under title 49, \n     United States Code; and\n       (4) the restrictions shall not be deemed to be \n     unreasonable, discriminatory, a violation of the assurances \n     required by section 47107(a) of title 49, United States Code, \n     or an undue burden on interstate commerce.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``Stage 2 \n     aircraft'' and ``Stage 3 aircraft'' have the same meaning as \n     those terms have in chapter 475 of title 49, United States \n     Code.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is a very short, simple amendment. \nWhat it deals with is Teton National Park. I think it is probably the \nonly park in the country that has in it a commercial airport.\n  Some years ago, the airport and the park agreed they could limit \nnoise in the park. They had done so with commercial airlines, but they \nhave not been able to do so with private jets. This would give them \nthat authority.\n  It has been approved by the Park Service, by the Interior Department, \nand we would like very much to have the authority for them to be able \nto deal with the noncommercial jets and the noise they create in Teton \nNational Park.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Thomas for his sponsorship \nof this amendment. One of the greatest problems we have today in \nAmerica is aircraft noise over national parks. We have been fighting it \nin the Grand Canyon, trying to balance the needs of commercial \naircraft--not only those taking off and arriving but air tours--and \nthat of preserving the incredible park experience.\n  I thank Senator Thomas for his effort to try to bring about the \nrestoration of that marvelous experience in one of our Nation's crown \njewels.\n  I support the amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Department of the Interior and the \nPark Service approved the amendment. We also support its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 913) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 915\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 915.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of Title V, add the following new section:\n       (g) Measurement of Highway Mileage for Purposes of \n     Determining Eligibilty for Essential Air Service Subsidies.--\n       (1) Determination of eligibility.--Subchapter II of Chapter \n     417 of title 49, United States Code, (as amended by \n     subsection (f) of this bill) is further amended by adding at \n     the end the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 41746. Distance requirement applicable to eligibility \n       for essential air service subsidies\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall not provide \n     assistance under this subchapter with respect to a place in \n     the 48 continguous States that--\n       ``(1) is less than 70 highway miles from the nearest hub-\n     airport; or\n       ``(2) requires a rate of subsidy per passenger in excess of \n     $200, unless such place is greater than 210 highway miles \n     from the nearest hub airport.\n       ``(b) Determination of Mileage.--For purposes of Lancaster, \n     Pennsylvania, the highway mileage between a place and the \n     nearest hub airport is the highway mileage of the most \n     commonly used route between the place and the hub airport. In \n     identifying such route, the Secretary shall--\n       ``(1) promulgate by regulation a standard for calculating \n     the mileage between Lancaster, Pennsylvania and a hub \n     airport, and\n       ``(2) identify the most commonly used route for a community \n     by--\n       ``(A) consulting with the Governor of a State or the \n     Governor's designee; and\n       ``(B) considering the certification of the Governor of a \n     State or the Governor's designee as to the most commonly used \n     route.''.\n       ``(b) Conforming Amendment.--The analysis for subchapter II \n     of chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code, (as amended \n     by subsection (f) of this bill) is further amended by \n     inserting after the item relating to section 41745 the \n     following new item:\n\n``41746. Distance requirement applicable to eligibility for essential \n              air service subsidies.''.\n       (h) Repeal.--The following provisions of law are repealed:\n       ``(1) Section 332 of the Department of Transportation and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000 (49 U.S.C. 41731 \n     note).\n       (2) Section 205 of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment \n     and Reform Act for the 21st Century (49 U.S.C. 41731 note).\n       (3) Section 334 of the Department of Transportation and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 (section 101(g) of \n     division A of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999) (Public Law 105-277; \n     112 Stat. 2681--471).\n       (i) Secretarial Review.--\n       (1) Request for review.--Any community with respect to \n     which the Secretary has, between September 30, 1993, and the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, eliminated subsidies or \n     terminated subsidy eligibility under section 332 of the \n     Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 2000 (49 U.S.C. 41731 note), Section 205 \n     of the Wendell H.

Mr. President, this amendment is an accommodation and \ncompromise worked out after discussion with the chairman of the \ncommittee and the chairman of the subcommittee. I have already filed \namendment No. 904, which is part of the record. This amendment goes to \nthe issue of providing essential air services to Lancaster, \nPennsylvania. The existing law provides that essential air services \nshall be provided if there is a distance of 70 miles or more to the hub \nof a major airport.\n  Lancaster is 66 miles from the Philadelphia International Airport, if \nyou travel along Route 30, which is the old Lincoln Highway, where \nthere is a traffic light every other block with the most extraordinary \ncongestion. Nobody who travels from Lancaster to the Philadelphia \nAirport takes congested Route 30. The commonly used route is to take \n222 to the turnpike and then to the Schuylkill Expressway, and that is \na distance of some 80 miles. So the route that any rational person \nwould use would be the 80-mile route, not the 66-mile route.\n  We have worked with the Department of Transportation for several \nyears in trying to work out this arrangement, but they have refused to \nlisten to reason. The City of Lancaster took an expensive appeal to the \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and the Court felt bound to \nhonor the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation, even though \nthe discretion was very unwisely used. The Court found itself \nconstrained to let the Secretary determine it.\n  The amendment I had intended to offer, which has been denominated as \n904, provides that the determination of the appropriate mileage would \nbe determined by the Governor or by the Metropolitan Planning \nOrganization. A concern was expressed as to that--to have the State \nmake a determination as to what would be done with the Federal \nexpenditure of funds. Well, that is not all the time, but I am not \ngoing to belabor that argument because we have an accommodation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield to me at this point?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I note that I have looked at this situation and I am going \nto support what this amendment is trying to do. I think, in this case, \nthis area he is referring to has been disadvantaged. We do not want to \nand do not intend to start down the line of making an exception here \nand there. This is a case where, clearly, you have been disadvantaged \nby the way it has been interpreted.\n  I appreciate the Senator being willing to work out a fair solution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I \ndid have the opportunity to meet with a group of his fellow citizens \nfrom Lancaster. They made a very compelling case on the burden they \nbear. I think this is a fair and equitable solution. I thank the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, to complete the discussion here regarding \ngiving these essential air services to Lancaster, they had one small \nairline that serviced Lancaster. They withdrew because, in the absence \nof a modest subsidy, they could not serve Lancaster anymore. In an era \nwhen we are helping airlines with loan guarantees and bailouts and so \nmany other provisions, this is really minimal.\n  This amendment, as provided, will take care of Lancaster. If I may \nsay for the record--if I may have the attention of the Senator from \nMississippi, the chairman of the subcommittee, who will be principal \nconferee--this provision will be fought for in conference. In the \nHouse, the matter has been handled by Congressman Joe Pitts, a very \nable Congressman who represents the area including Lancaster. I am sure \nCongressman Pitts will be amenable to this amendment, which gives \nfurther assurance and protection to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. So it is \nin the context of this assurance of our tough position in conference, \nwhich ought to prevail, that I have agreed to this accommodation.\n  I thank the Senator from Mississippi and I thank the Senator from \nArizona for working out this issue. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for supporting \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I associate myself with the last remarks \nof Senator Hollings. Like the Senator from South Carolina, I thank the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 915) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our cloakroom has indicated that Senators \nhave had an all-day-long notice that we are trying to complete this \nbill today. Statements have been made on the floor by the managers many \ntimes to that effect.\n  On the Democratic side, the only amendments we know of that people \nwish to offer are by Senators Feinstein, Inouye, Hollings, and Senator \nRockefeller has an amendment. Other than those, we don't know of any \nother amendments on our side.\n  On the other side, I have been told there is a Burns amendment, a \nMurkowski amendment, and a Stevens amendment. Other than that, I don't \nknow of any other amendments.\n  My point is, within a relatively short period of time, we will ask \nunanimous consent that these be the only amendments in order. If people \nare out there with amendments, they should come forward in the next \ncouple of minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in about 10 minutes, if that is OK--that \nwill give plenty of time for people who have additional amendments--I \nwill propose that we have a unanimous consent that no further \namendments be in order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I supplement what the Senator from Nevada \nsaid. I have already given notice that I have another amendment. If I \nmay inquire of the manager, the Senator from Arizona. I am prepared to \nproceed at this time with the amendment.\n  If I may have the attention of the Senator from Arizona, is it \nagreeable that I may call up my amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 905\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 905, which has \nbeen filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, \n     Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Dayton, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 905.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide safety and security with respect to aviation \n                            repair stations)\n\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 405. FOREIGN REPAIR STATION SAFETY AND SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n       (2) Domestic repair station.--The term ``domestic repair \n     station'' means a repair station or shop that--\n       (A) is described in section 44707(2) of title 49, United \n     States Code; and\n       (B) is located in the United States.\n       (3) Foreign repair station.--The term ``foreign repair \n     station'' means a repair station or shop that--\n       (A) is described in section 44707(2) of title 49, United \n     States Code; and\n       (B) is located outside of the United States.\n       (4) Under secretary.--The term ``Under Secretary'' means \n     the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security of \n     the Department of Homeland Security.\n       (b) Applicability of Standards.--Within 180 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall issue \n     regulations to ensure that foreign repair stations meet the \n     same level of safety required of domestic repair stations.\n       (c) Specific Standards.--In carrying out subsection (b), \n     the Administrator shall, at a minimum, specifically ensure \n     that foreign repair stations, as a condition of being \n     certified to work on United States registered aircraft--\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\n       (1) institute a program of drug and alcohol testing of its \n     employees working on United States registered aircraft and \n     that such a program provides an equivalent level of safety \n     achieved by the drug and alcohol testing requirements that \n     workers are subject to at domestic repair stations;\n       (2) agree to be subject to the same type and level of \n     inspection by the Federal Aviation Administration as domestic \n     repair stations and that such inspections occur without prior \n     notice to the country in which the station is located; and\n       (3) follow the security procedures established under \n     subsection (d).\n       (d) Security Audits.--\n       (1) In general.--To ensure the security of maintenance and \n     repair work conducted on United States aircraft and \n     components at foreign repair stations, the Under Secretary, \n     in consultation with the Administrator, shall complete a \n     security review and audit of foreign repair stations \n     certified by the Administrator under part 145 of title 14, \n     Code of Federal Regulations. The review shall be completed \n     not later than 180 days after the date on which the Under \n     Secretary issues regulations under paragraph (6).\n       (2) Addressing security concerns.--The Under Secretary \n     shall require a foreign repair station to address the \n     security issues and vulnerabilities identified in a security \n     audit conducted under paragraph (1) within 90 days of \n     providing notice to the repair station of the security issues \n     and vulnerabilities identified.\n       (3) Suspensions and revocations of certificates.--\n       (A) Failure to carry out effective security measures.--If \n     the Under Secretary determines as a result of a security \n     audit that a foreign repair station does not maintain and \n     carry out effective security measures or if a foreign repair \n     station does not address the security issues and \n     vulnerabilities as required under subsection (d)(2), the \n     Under Secretary shall notify the Administrator of the \n     determination. Upon receipt of the determination, the \n     Administrator shall suspend the certification of the repair \n     station until such time as the Under Secretary determines \n     that the repair station maintains and carries out effective \n     security measures and has addressed the security issues \n     identified in the audit, and transmits the determination to \n     the Administrator.\n       (B) Immediate security risk.--If the Under Secretary \n     determines that a foreign repair station poses an immediate \n     security risk, the Under Secretary shall notify the \n     Administrator of the determination. Upon receipt of the \n     determination, the Administrator shall revoke the \n     certification of the repair station.\n       (4) Failure to meet audit deadline.--If the security audits \n     required by paragraph (1) are not completed on or before the \n     date that is 180 days after the date on which the Under \n     Secretary issues regulations under paragraph (6), the \n     Administrator may not certify, or renew the certification of, \n     any foreign repair station until such audits are completed.\n       (5) Priority for audits.--In conducting the audits \n     described in paragraph (1), the Under Secretary and the \n     Administrator shall give priority to foreign repair stations \n     located in countries identified by the United States \n     Government as posing the most significant security risks.\n       (6) Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the Under Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Administrator, shall issue final \n     regulations to ensure the security of foreign and domestic \n     repair stations. If final regulations are not issued within \n     180 days of the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Administrator may not certify, or renew the certification of, \n     any foreign repair station until such regulations have been \n     issued.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Boxer, Durbin, and Dayton. Senator Inhofe had \nindicated some support, but I think he has a little different approach, \nso I am going to proceed with it on this basis.\n  The amendment provides for foreign aircraft repair stations to be \nsubject to the same provisions as domestic air stations.\n  What we have at the present time is a very different set of standards \nfor foreign repair stations than are in effect for domestic stations. \nIn foreign stations, for example, there need not be drug and alcohol \ntesting. In foreign stations, there are not the kinds of requirements \nand regulations as to the maintenance for safety, and there are no \nrequirements as to security.\n  I realize this kind of an amendment may result in some higher costs, \nhowever, I believe these costs are warranted in the interest of the \ntraveling public so there is an adequate assurance of safety. If you do \nnot have the kinds of requirements that are in effect by the FAA in the \nUnited States, then we do not have the maintenance of the same kind of \nsafety standards.\n  With respect to foreign competition, I think it is a fair requirement \nto say that you are not requiring ``Buy American,'' but you are saying \nthat the people in the United States who provide these services ought \nto have the same sort of security standards, the same sort of \nmaintenance standards, and the same sort of drug testing or alcohol \ntesting as in foreign standards. So this goes beyond the idea of \nprotectionism. These requirements that are in effect in the United \nStates are to provide for the safety of the traveling public. If it \ncosts X dollars to provide for the safety of the traveling public, then \nI think that is what we ought to do, and that is the gravamen and the \nthrust behind this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 914 To Amendment No. 905\n\n(Purpose: To require the Administrator of the FAA to conduct a study of \n              safety standards at foreign repair stations)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk \nand ask it be read in its entirety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 914 to amendment No. 905:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       (  ) Study.--Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of \n     this section--\n       (1) the Administrator shall conduct a study of the need to \n     establish a program to ensure that foreign repair stations \n     meet the conditions and standards described in subsection \n     (c);\n       (2) report the results of that study, together with the \n     Administrator's recommendations and conclusions, to the \n     Congress within 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act; and\n       (3) the Administrator shall not issue regulations under \n     subsection (h).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me explain why I offered this amendment. \nSenator Specter raises some very legitimate concerns, and we need to \nknow what the situation is with regard to safety standards and the \nconditions of the workers in these foreign repair stations.\n  First, I was not aware of this amendment or the committee was not \naware of this amendment until about an hour ago. We have not had a \nchance to find out more about what the ramifications are, the need for \nit, or what we need to do. We have had no hearings on this matter.\n  There is no question we need to make sure these foreign repair \nstations for airlines are good ones and the workers at these stations \nmeet certain qualifications. They are doing good work basically.\n  I am offering this amendment on behalf of Senator Inhofe who has some \nexperience in this area, has been to some of these foreign repair \nstations and has some concerns. Being a pilot himself, having served on \nthe committee of jurisdiction in the House, this is something we would \nlike to know his feelings about and make sure of what the situation is \ntoday.\n  He thought, though, we needed to look into it and understand what is \nhappening. For instance, we may, by doing this, be imposing more \nrequirements on these foreign repair stations that do not need certain \nlaws or regulations in the various countries. We may be taking actions \nthat would drive up costs. We may be taking actions that would have a \ndramatic impact on our own domestic airlines, which, by the way, some \nof the most profitable routes are overseas routes. This is a reason \nNorthwest was Northwest Orient. There is no question American, Delta--\nthe big airlines--do have very important overseas routes.\n  I would like to know if they think they are getting good service. \nWhat problems and what costs are going to be the result of this action?\n  That is what I say to Senator Specter. It is a legitimate concern. We \nmay need to do something more in this area, but I would like to know \nwhat the ramifications are before we actually put this requirement in \nplace.\n  This amendment, as I understand it and as it has been read, says the \nAdministrator has to have a study of the need to establish this program \nto ensure that foreign repair stations meet the conditions of standards \ndescribed in other sections of the law, that they report the results of \nthat study, together with the Administrator's recommendations and \nconclusions, to the Congress within a specified period of time. This is \nnot just an open-ended generic thing. That would also give us\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\ntime on the committee to ask questions of all those impacted by the \nrequirement.\n  I think this is a good solution to a problem we should not ignore, \nbut before we act we need to know what the impact is going to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the Specter amendment \nto S. 824, the Aviation Investment and Revitalization Vision Act, that \nwould address safety and security issues at foreign aircraft repair \nstations working on U.S. aircraft.\n  For a number of years, I have been working with the AFL-CIO's \nTransportation Trades Department and its mechanic unions)--the \nInternational Association of Machinists, the Transport Workers Union, \nand the International Brotherhood of Teamsters--to close the safety \nloopholes that many foreign stations present.\n  I would like to submit for the Record a letter I received from these \nunions expressing their continued opposition to unsafe foreign \nstations.\n  I would also like to submit for the Record a letter recently sent \nfrom the AFL-CIO and its Transportation Trades Department to the \nAdministration highlighting their concerns about the security at \nforeign stations.\n  As these letters clearly demonstrate, we have legitimate concerns \nwith regard to the current rules governing certification and oversight \nof foreign stations. For these reasons, I am cosponsoring the Specter \namendment and urge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned letters, dated April \n10, 2003, and May 22, 2003, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Norman Y. Mineta,\n     Secretary of Transportation, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Marion Blakey,\n     Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, \n         DC.\n\n     Hon. James M. Loy,\n     Under Secretary for Security, Transportation Security \n         Administration, Arlington, VA.\n       Dear Secretary Mineta, Administrator Blakey and Admiral \n     Loy: On behalf of the 13 million members of the AFL-CIO and \n     the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO (TTD) we urge \n     you to take immediate action to temporarily revoke the \n     certification of certain foreign-based aircraft repair \n     stations until such time as thorough security audits are \n     conducted by responsible agencies and rules are put in place \n     to ensure that these stations do not pose an imminent \n     national and aviation security risk. As you know, there are \n     currently over 600 foreign aircraft repair stations, \n     certified under 14 CFR Part 145 (Subpart C), that are \n     permitted to work on U.S. registered aircraft. Because of the \n     unique combination of national security and economic \n     conditions that currently exist in the aviation industry, as \n     outlined below, we believe that the Department of \n     Transportation (DOT), the Federal Aviation Administration \n     (FAA), and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) \n     are required to act upon this petition in the interest of \n     aviation safety.\n       It is well known that this nation continues to be the \n     target of terrorist intentions both domestically and abroad. \n     In fact, the U.S. State Department and other government \n     agencies have frequently warned about threats occurring \n     outside the U.S. but directed at U.S. citizens and interests. \n     We are concerned that certified foreign aircraft repair \n     stations that are eligible to work on U.S. aircraft, could \n     provide terrorists with an opportunity to jeopardize U.S. \n     aviation safety without having to physically enter this \n     country. At a time of heightened alert around the globe, our \n     government must do everything possible to protect against \n     terrorist agents infiltrating foreign repair stations and \n     sabotaging air operations headed back to the United States.\n       While there is no publicly known evidence that terrorists \n     have pursued this agenda, it makes little sense for the Bush \n     Administration to leave it to chance. In fact, the DOT's \n     Inspector General recently announced that as part of a larger \n     audit of air carriers' use of aircraft repair stations, it \n     found security vulnerabilities at stations located at \n     commercial and general-aviation airports and off airport \n     property. While the IG recommended that the TSA conduct risk-\n     based security assessments as a first-step in determining the \n     actions needed to address repair station security, we would \n     maintain that until the security ``fitness'' of foreign \n     stations can be assured, their FAR 145 rights to work on U.S. \n     aircraft should be suspended.\n       The security risks posed by foreign stations is compounded \n     by the unprecedented financial distress faced by the \n     commercial aviation industry. Two major carriers have \n     declared bankruptcy, others have announced severe workforce \n     and service cuts, and virtually every airline has been forced \n     to institute dramatic cost cuts to satisfy lenders and to \n     keep flying. In this environment, U.S. carrier will \n     undoubtedly pursue, over the strong objections of the \n     International Association Machinists and Aerospace Workers, \n     the Transport Workers Union and the International Brotherhood \n     of Teamsters, the outsourcing of major overhaul and other \n     repair work to lower cost, potentially substandard third \n     party contractors including those based overseas. A real life \n     illustration of these concerns are the management rights \n     secured by Northwest Airlines in its 2001 collective \n     bargaining agreement with its mechanics union under which the \n     airline can contract out almost 40 percent of repair and \n     overhaul work to outside contractors around the globe. In \n     fact, Northwest Airlines already relies on a Singapore-based \n     repair operation for significant overhaul work on its DC-10 \n     aircraft and the carrier could use the freedoms it secured in \n     its 2001 collective bargaining agreement for mechanics to \n     ship significantly more of that work abroad. And with the lax \n     FAA oversight and surveillance of unknown security procedures \n     at many foreign stations, the potential for terrorist \n     security breaches grows as these stations see more work from \n     the U.S.\n       It is interesting that in the pursuit of aviation security \n     the FAA and the TSA recently issued rules that require the \n     FAA to revoke the airman certificate, which includes a Part \n     65 mechanic certification, of any individual who the TSA \n     determines poses a threat to aviation security. But from a \n     practical standpoint these rules will only affect mechanics \n     at domestic stations since only domestic stations, and not \n     foreign stations, are required to have FAA-certified \n     employees on premise. Furthermore, there are a number of \n     oversight activities that occur at domestic facilities, both \n     formally and informally, that simply do not occur at foreign \n     facilities.\n       Indeed, the AFL-CIO, TTD and its mechanics union affiliates \n     have long been concerned that foreign aircraft repair \n     stations can receive FAA certification and then work on U.S.-\n     registered aircraft without meeting the same safety and \n     security standards imposed on domestic facilities and their \n     employees. In addition to regulatory differences, we know \n     that the oversight of foreign stations pales in comparison to \n     the surveillance performed on domestic stations, especially \n     those managed within major air carrier operations. For \n     example, FAA inspectors, represented by the Professional \n     Airways Systems Specialists (PASS), do not have the same type \n     of access to foreign stations as they do with domestic \n     facilities. This reality is complicated by the fact that \n     insufficient FAA inspector staffing levels do not allow for \n     proper oversight of stations located outside the U.S. Given \n     this situation, it is troubling that the effective date for \n     modifications to Part 145 was recently and inexplicably \n     postponed at the request of industry trade groups and that \n     such postponement was granted without giving the public any \n     notice or opportunity to comment.\n       For these reasons we urge the DOT, the FAA, and the TSA to \n     issue an emergency order to temporarily prevent certain \n     foreign stations certified under 14 CFR Part 145 from working \n     on U.S. aircraft or components. The FAA should use these \n     temporary revocations to conduct thorough security audits of \n     foreign stations and to promulgate rules that impose security \n     procedures at these facilities. In particular, the FAA should \n     focus on ensuring that mechanics and other workers who come \n     into contact with U.S. aircraft or components do not pose \n     a security risk and that other precautions are taken to \n     ensure the integrity of the aircraft maintenance work \n     performed. We would suggest that Joint Aviation Authority \n     members and certain countries that have current Bilateral \n     Aviation Safety Agreements with the U.S. may already meet \n     many of the security standards needed and would not need \n     to have their FAR 145 rights suspended while rules are \n     being drafted.\n       As you know, the Secretary of Transportation is charged \n     with the responsibility of ``assigning and maintaining safety \n     as the highest priority in air commerce.'' 49 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 40101(a)(1). Furthermore, when the Administrator is of \n     the ``opinion that an emergency related to safety in air \n     commerce requires immediate action, the Administrator, on the \n     initiative of the Administrator or on complaint, may \n     prescribe regulations and issue orders immediately to meet \n     the emergency . . .'' 49 U.S.C. Sec. 46105(c). We would \n     maintain that a unique confluence of factors described above \n     create a situation that necessitates federal government \n     action in the public interest and to maintain aviation \n     safety.\n       Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter and \n     we look forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard L. Trumka,\n       Secretary-Treasurer, AFL-CIO.\n     Sonny Hall,\n       President, Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Transportation Trades\n\n\n                                          Department, AFL-CIO,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: On behalf of the Transportation Trades \n     Department, AFL-\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\n     CIO (TTD) and its aircraft mechanics unions, we write to ask \n     for your assistance in protecting the safety and security of \n     our aviation system and the jobs of thousands of aircraft \n     mechanics due to deficient federal government policy and \n     efforts by the major airlines to cut costs through \n     outsourcing of maintenance and heavy overhaul work to \n     foreign-based repair stations.\n       As an original cosponsor of the Aircraft Repair Station \n     Safety Act (S. 1089) in the 105th Congress, legislation \n     strongly supported by AFL-CIO unions, we know that you are \n     well aware of this problem and we appreciate your leadership \n     in protecting aviation safety and U.S. jobs. As we have \n     discussed with you over many years, the Federal Aviation \n     Administration (FAA), pursuant to 14 CFR Part 145 (Subpart \n     C), allows foreign stations to receive certification to work \n     on U.S. aircraft even though these stations do not have to \n     meet the same standards as those located in this country. \n     While AFL-CIO mechanics unions have long argued that this \n     situation threatens mechanics' jobs and the safety of the \n     flying public, the current drive by air carriers to ship work \n     overseas, combined with unique security concerns at these \n     stations, has exacerbated this problem and your help is \n     urgently needed to address this issue.\n       We know that U.S. carriers will pursue, over the strong \n     objections of the International Association of Machinists and \n     Aerospace Workers, the Transport Workers Union and the \n     International Brotherhood of Teamsters, outsourcing of major \n     overhaul and other repair work to lower cost and potentially \n     substandard third party contractors based overseas. In fact, \n     Northwest Airlines, secured the right in its 2001 collective \n     bargaining agreement with its non-mechanics union (AMFA) to \n     contract out almost 40 percent of repair and overhaul work to \n     outside contractors in Singapore and around the globe. While \n     the mechanics at Northwest are not members of our unions, we \n     are deeply concerned that the carrier will continue to \n     exploit these harmful contract concessions to the detriment \n     of all the nation's professional aircraft mechanics, the vast \n     majority of which are our members. Mechanics at other \n     airlines will face increasing pressure to adopt the dangerous \n     practices of Northwest-AMFA that permit almost four out of 10 \n     jobs to be shipped to foreign contractors. Unless Congress \n     steps in aggressively, aviation safety and security will \n     suffer and the jobs of thousands of workers will be at risk.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to work with us to address \n     this issue as part of the FAA Reauthorization bill that will \n     be considered by the full Senate in the coming weeks. \n     Together, we can protect the flying public and in the process \n     ensure the future of America's highly skilled and \n     professional aircraft mechanics. Thank you for your attention \n     to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert Roach,\n       General Vice President, International Association of \n     Machinists and Aerospace Workers.\n     Sonny Hall,\n       International President, Transport Workers Union.\n     Don Treichler,\n       Director, Airline Division, International Brotherhood of \n     Teamsters.\n     Edward Wytkind,\n       Executive Director, Transportation Trades Dept., AFL-CIO.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the second-degree amendment proposed by \nthe Senator from Mississippi is an improvement over where the record \nstands at the present time, however, I think it does not go far enough. \nWhen he states that he does not know the consequences of my amendment, \nI would disagree with him.\n  The amendment provides that there will be standards on the level of \ninspection, which are of the same type as now promulgated by the \nFederal Aviation Administration. So if you have that level of \ninspection, which they have now, there is no question as to its not \nbeing onerous, or at least if it is onerous, it is onerous now, \nhowever, it is the same.\n  We should have drug and alcohol testing as a very minimal requirement \nso we know specifically what is involved there. We know people who are \ndrug addicts or who are unduly influenced by alcohol to be carrying on \nthese inspections.\n  When it comes to the third factor, security, the amendment I have \nproposed calls for ensuring the security of maintenance and repair work \nconducted on U.S. aircraft and components at foreign repair stations by \nthe Under Secretary in consultation with the Administrator.\n  Those security arrangements are going to be determined by the \nDepartment of Transportation. We certainly can rely on them. I think \nthe issue has been joined. I think we understand what is involved.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask that the vote be delayed until such \ntime--\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield without losing his right to the \nfloor? The two leaders want these votes to be stacked. They are in a \nvery important Finance Committee meeting which is going on now. I ask \nthis be set aside for a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also note that Senator Boxer wishes to \nspeak on this amendment for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we withhold \nthe vote until such time as the two leaders decide on a time, which I \ndo not think will be very long. We have a couple of other amendments \nwhich are pending that we could dispose of, I would imagine, within the \nnext 10 or 15 minutes.\n  Also, I ask unanimous consent that no further amendments be \nconsidered at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The pending amendments on our side are a Stevens \namendment, a Burns amendment, and a Santorum amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we want to have a list just as quickly as my \nfriend from Arizona. We do need to have floor staff look at the subject \nmatter of these amendments because we do not know what they could be. \nWe can take the 10 minutes the Senator from Arizona suggested--the only \naddition I know we have is an amendment by Senator Kohl--and have our \nstaffs look at these amendments while Senator Boxer is speaking for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Following that, I think we would be in a position to look at the \namendments and order the closure of the amendment process.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel be added as a \ncosponsor of amendment No. 906.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as part of the agreement, it is my \nunderstanding that the Senator from California will be recognized for \nup to 10 minutes. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No agreement has been propounded.\n  Mr. REID. Did not the Senator from Arizona ask unanimous consent that \nthe vote be put over until later and that request was propounded at \nthat time? I thought the agreement was that the Senator from California \nwould speak on the amendment that was just set aside for a vote for 10 \nminutes. I ask the Senator from California, would that be appropriate?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sorry. I was concentrating on my remarks.\n  Mr. REID. Is 10 minutes sufficient time for the Senator?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Santorum be added \nas an original cosponsor on the Lancaster amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I understand Senator Lott has second-\ndegreed Senator Specter's amendment, of which I am a proud cosponsor, \nwith a study. Something can be studied and studied but, frankly, this \nwould gut what we are trying to do in our amendment. I do not mind a \nstudy, but I think the time for studying this has passed.\n  I want to show my colleagues an important op-ed that appeared in the \nUSA Today on June 9: ``Evidence Points to FAA's Laxity on Plane \nMaintenance.''\n  It specifically cites the overseas gaps that are happening. There are \n629 foreign repair stations certified by the FAA to service U.S. \naircraft. They point out that they may not be strictly\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\nmonitored because of their distance from U.S.-based airline operations, \nincreasing the potential risk for error.\n  That is an opinion of an expert on safety, Michael Barr, director of \nthe University of Southern California's aviation safety program.\n  I think all of us want to see safety. One obvious place is making \nsure that we cut down on the number of aircraft that are overhauled \nabroad. That is why I think Senator Specter's amendment is so \nimportant, for the safety and security of the flying public. We all \nhave worked very hard in the Commerce Committee to improve our aviation \nsecurity, and I do believe our system is more secure than it was.\n  We have much more to do. My colleagues have heard me speak about the \nimportance of the missile defense system, against shoulder-fired \nmissiles, and there will be a lot more on that subject. But while we \nare improving our security at our airports in this country and rooting \nout potential threats among employees in the United States, meaning \nemployees who work for the airlines, there are no security regulations \nor standards for foreign repair stations that work on U.S. aircraft.\n\n  I know the Senate is rushing to get through with this very important \nbill, but there is a huge gap in our aviation security. There is a huge \nsafety concern that I have that Senator Specter's amendment will \nremedy. It is important to remember that foreign repair stations work \non planes that not only fly internationally but planes that serve \ndomestic routes as well.\n  There is a huge gap in our aviation security, and foreign repair \nstations do not have the same standards. Senator Lott wishes to study \nthis matter, and I am glad he wishes to study it, but we all know that \nthe underlying amendment is the one that would bring about the changes. \nThe underlying amendment would require foreign repair stations to meet \nthe same safety standards required at domestic repair stations.\n  Specifically, under the Specter amendment, foreign repair stations \nwould have to institute a drug and alcohol testing program of its \nemployees if they want to work on American aircraft.\n  I say to my friends in the Senate, the people at these foreign \nstations are not even tested for drugs and alcohol, but American \nworkers are required to have drug and alcohol tests.\n  There is no drug and alcohol testing program of employees on these \nforeign repair stations. We demand it in our own country. Our employees \ngo through it and we do not have it at these foreign repair stations. \nWe want these foreign repair stations to agree to FAA inspections.\n  In addition, the Under Secretary of Homeland Security must complete a \nsecurity review and audit of all foreign repair stations. The foreign \nrepair stations must address security issues identified by the Homeland \nSecurity Department within 90 days, and if they do not prove to the FAA \nand to the Homeland Security Department that they are not meeting our \nheightened security needs, FAA must revoke the certification of that \nrepair station.\n  After all of the work that has been undertaken to improve our \naviation security, and I must say on both sides of the aisle we have \nseen this work, we must not allow this loophole to continue. We do not \nknow who is working on our planes at foreign repair stations, and I \nwould hate to be a Senator who voted to study the issue but not to move \nquickly to solve the problem if, God forbid, there is an accident \nbecause some employee in a foreign repair station was either inebriated \nor high on drugs or perhaps even was terrorist connected.\n  We owe the American people safe and secure skies, and I think the \nSpecter amendment is critical to preventing terrorism and unnecessary \naccidents. My colleagues want a study? Then they are saying they do not \nthink this is a problem.\n  Evidence points to FAA's laxity on plane maintenance, and if we do \nnot adopt Senator Specter's amendment, I think we are making a big \nmistake. These planes not only fly internationally but nationally.\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry. Are we going to vote on Senator \nLott's second degree at a time certain?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CORNYN). The yeas and nays have been \nordered on that amendment but no time has yet been set for that vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Another question. If that fails, will we then be voting \non the Specter amendment? And have the yeas and nays been ordered on \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be the normal course of business, \nbut the yeas and nays have not yet been ordered on the Specter \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not in order at this time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry. This is a request to have the yeas \nand nays on the second-degree amendment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You already got that. This is on the Specter amendment, \nthe yeas and nays on the Specter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. We are waiting for the unanimous consent request to be \ntyped. I hope during that period of time we will have six or seven more \npeople calling for amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment so Senator Burns can be recognized for his two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 900, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee and \nthe chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member. I submitted \ntwo amendments. One has to do with general aviation and reimbursement \nto organizations that suffered losses due to September 11. We took care \nof the airlines and a lot of service industries in and around airports, \nbut we forgot and left out one very important part of the American \naviation scene, very important to my State of Montana, those people \ninvolved in general aviation, in other words, the charter business, as \nthey were impacted, too, and received no reimbursement in any way to \nrecover the damages or the losses they may have incurred.\n  We have talked about this. I ask the amendment which is at the desk \nto be considered. It has been amended and worked on by both sides of \nthe aisle. There is agreement on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 900, as modified.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide grants to reimburse general aviation entities for \n    the security costs incurred and revenue foregone as a result of \n            terrorism and the military action against Iraq)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ------.

It has been worked on by both sides and I ask for its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment numbered 900, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 900), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BURNS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 899\n\n  Mr. BURNS. The second amendment I have has to do with recommendations \nconcerning air travel agents who have been part of a report requested \nof the Transportation Department. This is only language that requires \nthe Department of Transportation to recommend the changes they see as a \nresult of this report. I ask it be considered at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 899.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Transportation to transmit to \n Congress a report on any actions that should be taken with respect to \n  recommendations made by the National Commission to Ensure Consumer \n    Information and Choice in the Airline Industry on travel agents)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

I ask the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there no further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BURNS. By the way, it has been cleared by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nnumbered 899.\n  The amendment (No. 899) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. I appreciate the leadership on both sides of the aisle for \nconsideration of the amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. I call attention to \nthe Senate that Special Operations is hosting a reception for Members \nof the Senate and staff tonight from 5:30 to 7:30 in room 106 of the \nDirksen Building. General Holland would be honored if Members could \nstop by. My Defense Subcommittee visited General Holland and saw many \nof the things that are going to be on display in 106 Dirksen. There \nwill be members of the armed services who worked with the unified \ncommands, Marines, Army, Navy, Air Force. Individual members of the \nservice who actually participated in Afghanistan and Iraq are there to \nexplain to Members of the Senate and staff some of the engagements they \nwere involved in.\n  I think every Member and members of the staff would find it very \ninteresting.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To provide for air quality in aircraft cabins)\n\n       Strike section 664 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 664. AIR QUALITY IN AIRCRAFT CABINS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration shall undertake the studies and analysis \n     called for in the report of the National Research Council \n     entitled ``The Airliner Cabin Environment and the Health of \n     Passengers and Crew''.\n       (b) Required Activities.--In carrying out this section, the \n     Administrator, at a minimum, shall--\n       (1) conduct surveillance to monitor ozone in the cabin on a \n     representative number of flights and aircraft to determine \n     compliance with existing Federal Aviation Regulations for \n     ozone;\n       (2) collect pesticide exposure data to determine exposures \n     of passengers and crew;\n       (3) analyze samples of residue from aircraft ventilation \n     ducts and filters after air quality incidents to identify the \n     contaminants to which passengers and crew were exposed;\n       (4) analyze and study cabin air pressure and altitude; and\n       (5) establish an air quality incident reporting system.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 30 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall transmit to \n     Congress a report on the findings of the Administrator under \n     this section.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment \nto improve the air quality on commercial aircraft.\n  In 1986, in response to a National Research Council Report, the FAA \ntook several actions to improve aircraft cabin air quality on flights, \nincluding banning smoking on nearly all domestic flights. However, over \n15 years later, many cabin air quality issues remain and new health \nquestions have been raised by passengers and crew.\n  More recently, the National Research Council released a study of the \nair quality on commercial airline flights\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\nthat was funded by the Federal Aviation Administration. The National \nResearch Council found that:\n  There is no operational standard for the ventilation of an aircraft \ncabin, but that such an operation standard should be established to \nensure that passenger aircraft are properly ventilated;\n  Passengers have been exposed to airborne contaminants while onboard \naircraft, and that such contaminants can originate outside and inside \nthe aircraft, and within the aircraft's environmental control system \nitself;\n  The environmental control system on a passenger aircraft can become \ncontaminated with engine oils, hydraulic fluids, or deicing fluids and \nthose fluid contaminants can enter the passenger cabin through the air \nsupply system;\n  Contaminants in the air of a passenger aircraft may be responsible \nfor acute and chronic health effects in crew and passengers;\n  Reduced partial oxygen levels in aircraft air may adversely affect \nhealth-compromised passengers, particularly those with cardiopulmonary \ndisease;\n  Aircraft passengers may be exposed to ozone during flight, and \nstudies suggest that ozone concentrations on some flights can exceed \nthe Federal Aviation Administration and Environmental Protection Agency \nozone levels;\n  Air that contains elevated ozone concentrations is associated with \nairway irritation, decreased lung function, exacerbation of asthma, and \nimpairments of the immune system;\n  Since carbon monoxide is an indicator of mechanical fluids \ncontaminating the air supply, the FAA should require aircraft to \ninstall monitors and establish procedures for responding to elevated \nlevels of carbon monoxide; and\n\n  The FAA should establish a passenger aircraft air quality and health \nsurveillance program to determine compliance with existing FAA \nregulations and document health effects and complaints so that data is \ncollected in a way that allows analysis of the relationship between \nhealth effects and aircraft air quality.\n  The amendment I rise to introduce today addresses several findings on \ncabin air quality. It incorporates the original House language plus two \nadditional provisions.\n  The House language is as follows:\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration shall undertake the studies and analysis \n     called for in the report of the National Research Council \n     entitled ``The Airliner Cabin Environment and the Health of \n     Passengers and Crew.''\n       (b) Required Activities.--In carrying out this section, the \n     Administrator, at a minimum, shall--\n       (1) conduct surveillance to monitor ozone in the cabin on a \n     representative number of flights and aircraft to determine \n     compliance with existing Federal Aviation Regulations for \n     ozone;\n       (2) collect pesticide exposure data to determine exposures \n     of passengers and crew; and\n       (3) analyze samples of residue from aircraft ventilation \n     ducts and filters after air quality incidents to identify the \n     contaminants to which passengers and crew were exposed.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 30 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall transmit to \n     Congress a report on the findings of the Administrator under \n     this section.\n\n  My amendment builds on the above language by adding the following two \nprovisions:\n  Authorizes an FAA study to analyze cabin air pressure and altitude; \nand\n  Requires the FAA to establish an air quality incident reporting \nsystem.\n  Poor air quality in flight cabins poses a health risk for the flying \npublic and crew members who spend most of their working hours onboard \ncommercial aircraft. Passengers should feel confident that they are not \nendangering their health when they fly, and airline industry workers \nshould not feel their health is threatened as they earn a living. I \nhope you will join me in supporting this legislation. And finally I \nwant to thank Senator McCain and Senator Hollings for allowing me to \nintroduce this amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This has to do with air quality of new equipment that \nhas been cleared.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from California.\n  The amendment (No. 917) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 918\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. On behalf of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nthe clerk to report. It has to do with the small carrier sharing and \nthe war supplemental.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for Mr. \n     Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered 918.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require air carriers that received a refund of passenger \n  security fees under title IV of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, 2003, to pass-through to their code-share partners \nthat portion of the refund attributable to such fees collected and paid \n                           by those partners)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PASS-THROUGH OF REFUNDED PASSENGER SECURITY FEES TO \n                   CODE-SHARE PARTNERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Within 30 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, each United States flag air carrier that \n     received a payment made under the second proviso of first \n     appropriation in title IV of the Emergency Wartime \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Pub. L. 108-011; 117 \n     Stat. 604) shall transfer to each air carrier with which it \n     had a code-share arrangement during the period covered by the \n     passenger security fees remitted under that proviso an amount \n     equal to that portion of the remittance under the proviso \n     that was attributable to passenger security fees paid or \n     collected by that code-share air carrier and taken into \n     account in determining the amount of the payment to the \n     United States flag air carrier.\n       (b) DOT Inspector General Oversight.--The Inspector General \n     of the Department of Transportation shall review the \n     compliance of United States flag air carriers with subsection \n     (a), including determinations of amounts, determinations of \n     eligibility of code-share air carriers, and transfers of \n     funds to such air carriers under subsection (a).\n       (c) Certification.--The chief executive officer of each \n     United States flag air carrier to which subsection (a) \n     applies shall certify to the Under Secretary of Homeland \n     Security for Border and Transportation Security, under \n     penalty of perjury, the air carrier's compliance with sub-\n     section (a).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Hawaii, \nSenator Inouye, and the Senator from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask it be reported. It has to do with credit \ncards, when one of the carriers is in default and the other carrier has \nto pick up or honor the tickets. Since there is a peculiar situation, \nthis is taking care of that situation. It has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] for Mr. \n     Inouye and Mr. Voinovich, proposes an amendment numbered 919.\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the criteria for air carriers to honor tickets for \n                           suspended service)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 305.

If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 919) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Stevens is here to offer an \namendment.\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\n  First, before that, I ask unanimous consent that following the \ndisposition of the previously mentioned amendments, which we will \nmention in a minute, the bill be read for the third time, and further, \nthe Senate then proceed to the consideration of H.R. 2115, the House \ncompanion bill; provided further that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 824, as amended, be inserted in lieu \nthereof; further, that the bill then be read the third time and the \nSenate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, with no intervening \naction or debate. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following that \nvote the Senate then insist on its amendment, request a conference with \nthe House, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the \npart of the Senate with a ratio of 5 to 4. I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the vote, S. 824 be placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding the only amendments also remaining \nare an amendment by Senator Stevens, an amendment by Senator Santorum, \na Finance Committee amendment, and an amendment by Senator Murkowski.\n  Mr. REID. And Senator Harkin?\n  Mr. McCAIN. An amendment by Senator Harkin.\n  I ask unanimous consent that no amendments be considered other than \nthose I just described.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the subject matter of the \namendments has been discussed on both sides so there are no surprises \nas to the subject matter of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 920\n\n(Purpose: To codify the requirement that United States air carriers be \n           effectively controlled by United States citizens)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 920:\n       At the end of title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 521. AIR CARRIER CITIZENSHIP.\n\n       Section 40102(a)(15)(C) of title 49, United States Code is \n     amended by inserting ``which is under the actual control of \n     citizens of the United States,'' before ``and in which''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my amendment codifies the existing \nrequirement that U.S. air carriers be effectively controlled by U.S. \ncitizens. It will ensure reciprocity with countries in the European \nUnion which codified a comparable requirement.\n  The United States has enforced an effective control standard for \ndecades.\n  DOT's Inspector General recently identified seven factors that DOT \nhas relied on to determine whether an airline is effectively controlled \nby foreign entities.\n  The I.G. identified ``significant contracts'' as one of the key \nfactors in this process.\n  A DOT administrative law judge is currently considering whether this \nshould be applied to a situation where 7 year guaranteed cost-plus \ncontracts that provide virtually all of a carrier's business are \nsignificant contracts leading to foreign control.\n  Ironically, in this same proceeding one carrier has argued that the \neffective control test should not apply at all because it has not been \ncodified.\n  My amendment will codify the existing standard. It leaves the \ninterpretation of effective control up to DOT, but the department can \ndraw from its decades of precedents to reach these conclusions. It is \ncritical that DOT closely examine the effective control of this \ntransaction.\n  If the present arrangement is allowed to stand, DOT will set a \nprecedent which allows foreign governments to compete with U.S. \ncompanies for business which, by statute, is reserved to U.S. carriers.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to highlight some changes that Senator \nStevens made to this amendment in response to concerns expressed by the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  Senator Stevens changed the term ``effective control'' in his \namendment to ``actual control'' to more accurately represent the test \nthat DOT uses in these types of reviews.\n  In addition, Senator Stevens removed the limitation of ``at all \ntimes'' regarding the actual control test it conform with current DOT \npractices.\n  DOT has represented to me that these changes accurately reflect the \ncurrent state of law regarding citizenship and assures me that this \namendment will not in any way affect their determination of what \nconstitutes a citizen of the United States.\n  I would not have agreed to this amendment without these changes and \nan understanding that this is simply a reflection of current law. The \nterms that I have agreed to will not be altered in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 920) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 907\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 907.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk \ngives the Federal Aviation Administration a year to complete the study \nof the consolidation of the Anchorage Terminal Approach Control, \nTRACON, with the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center at the \ncenter's existing facility.\n  The current physical location will be facing significant demands this \ndecade. In order to expand TRACON's current control room, it needs to \nbe housed in a larger facility. What we are asking is a year to give \nthe FAA ample time to complete this study while the Ted Stevens \nInternational Airport is undergoing expansion.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 907) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Closure of an airport without providing sufficient note.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this has to do with the notice, the 60-\nday notice of the closing of an airport. It has been cleared on both \nsides. I think.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment with Senators Inhofe \nand Grassley that simply requires that an airport on the National Plan \nof Integrated Airport Systems, (NPIAS), cannot be closed down without \ngiving the FAA 30 days' notice.\n  That list includes over 3,000 airports including all commercial \nairports and many of the airports only used by general aviation, that \nis nonscheduled private aircraft so important to the efficient \noperation of businesses across our nation.\n  Chicago's Meigs Field was included in this integrated system of \nairports until it was dug up in the middle of the night with no notice \non March 30, leaving a number of airplanes trapped at the unusable \nfacility. The city government made a unilateral decision to shut down \nthe airport by bulldozing the landing strips, runaway, and taxiways. \nThat action by the city was dangerous and at least one aircraft \ncarrying State employees had to be turned away from the airport since \nnotification that the airport was now closed had not been provided in \nadvance.\n  I do not dispute that it is within the purview of a local government \nor other operator evaluate the infrastructure needs of an area and move \nto close an airport. But, I do believe that they need to give \nreasonable notice of that intention. I would also note that almost \nevery airport on the NPIAS system has received FAA funding for \nfacilities and equipment.\n  This provision is not retroactive and would not affect the city of \nChicago for the closure of Meigs Field.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 921) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 922\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an issue of great \nimportance to the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the \noperations at two airports important to all Senators, and to the issue \nof local control.\n  I support the managers' amendment and the legislation before the \nSenate today. This is an important bill. I was very concerned when this \nbill passed the Senate Commerce Committee with an amendment that \nincreased the number of flights at Reagan National Airport by 12. Those \nflights were designated to fly beyond the so-called ``perimeter''--a \nrule that restricts the length of flights at Reagan National to a \nmaximum 1,250 miles.\n  Through the managers' amendment today, the language increasing \nflights at Reagan National has been dropped. I appreciate the chairman \nof the Commerce Committee's willingness to work with me to see that \nthis provision was not included in the final bill on the Senate floor.\n  I have several very serious concerns about congress increasing the \nnumber of flights beyond the perimeter at National Airport, all of \nwhich were detailed in a letter I submitted to the majority leader on \nMay 9, 2003.\n  There is a critical principle at stake here that cannot be overlooked \nby the Senate. The right of the people of Virginia to decide what is \nbest for their communities without unwarranted Federal intrusion is at \nstake here. The responsibility for operating the airports at Reagan \nNational and Dulles is up to the local and regional airport authority, \nnot Congress. Yet each time this body considers FAA reauthorization, we \nmust revisit attempts at Federal intrusion on an issue of local \ncontrol. There is an extremely delicate balance between how Reagan \nNational is designed to operate in conjunction with the international \nhub at Dulles Airport. Congressional intervention, even in the form of \na few more flights, disrupts that balance and creates a slippery slope \nthat undermines this region's ability to determine for itself what is \nin our own best interests.\n  I believe that a permanent solution to this continual Federal \nintrusion into local affairs needs to be found. The Senate and House of \nRepresentatives should strengthen the mandate we have already given to \nthe local airport\n\n[[Page S7815]]\n\nauthority to make decisions on whether to increase flights at Reagan \nNational or not, especially with respect to flying beyond the \nperimeter.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I would be glad to yield to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator. As you know, I voted against this \namendment when it came before the Senate Commerce Committee. I agree \nwith the Senator from Virginia that we should not change the slot rules \nat National whatsoever. It is foolhardy and is bad aviation policy. We \nshould not change the rules just because of politics. They have served \nthe local community well, enabling the expansion of Dulles while \nprotecting those that live near the airport. Short hauls leave from \nNational, and long hauls from Dulles. We may not like to drive all the \nway out to Dulles, but we built, with Federal airport grant moneys, \nthat highway dedicated to access to Dulles. We used the law to plan for \ngrowth. We should not change it now at the behest of some. I yield back \nto the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield time?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I yield time to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I also rise in \nsupport of the managers' amendment, and particularly for dropping the \nprovision on adding long-haul flights at National Airport. The current \naviation system, as it has evolved, is an intricately connected web of \nhubs, spokes, and direct flights. Some airlines thrive on the hub and \nspoke network, and some derive the ability to operate by flying \ndirectly between communities. However, I want to make clear a point on \nwhy it is so important that we maintain this balance between National \nAirport and Dulles Airport that was maintained by Congress in 1987, \nwhen we leased the facilities to the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAuthority. The slot rules have been in place since 1968 and should not \nbe changed now.\n  When the Interstate Highway System was developed in the 1950s, many \ncommunities located in the path of the new interstates suddenly \nprospered by being directly connected to the rest of the Nation. \nCommunities that were once sound economic entities, but were left miles \nfrom any access to the interstate system suffered, shuttered their \ndoors and many times just barely survived. The same is true in the \naviation system. Not every community in this country can maintain an \nairport. Not every community can enjoy the economic benefits of a hub. \nBut hub economics dictate that feed from small- and medium-sized \ncommunities is necessary for them to survive.\n  National Airport is an important asset for those, like my \nconstituents in West Virginia, who are trying to reach the capital \nregion. Obviously, however, it can never become an international hub. \nThe airport has only one runway and no ability to expand. National \nAirport serves a good and valuable purpose. My greatest concern is that \nby changing National Airport, Congress will hurt this area's ability to \nserve small- and medium-sized communities on the east coast, including \nmy home State, West Virginia. The slot rule and perimeter rule were put \nin place at National Airport to maintain its important function while \nat the same time allowing the DC area to create a major international \nhub serving both Europe and South America. I would look forward to \nworking with the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, the ranking \nmember Senator Hollings and Senators Allen and Warner to find a \npermanent solution to this issue. I yield back to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia and appreciate his \nsupport.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I yield to the senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. Let me just say that I associate \nmyself with the remarks of Senator Allen. Three years ago, during \ndebate over this same bill, I stood on the floor of the Senate and \nfought this battle. I hope that we are not doing this again a few years \ndown the road. I understand that despite the best efforts of \ncounterparts in the House, Congressmen Wolf, Davis, Moran and Delegate \nNorton, the House of Representatives has unfortunately approved an FAA \nreauthorization bill that would increase flights at Reagan National by \n12 slots beyond the perimeter and 8 slots within the perimeter. I thank \nmy colleague from Virginia and join him in agreeing to work with the \nCommerce Committee chairman and ranking member to see that this issue \nis resolved once and for all at Reagan National Airport. I yield back \nto my friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I appreciate the Senator's comments. In sum, let me just \nsay that this issue is very important to the people of the Commonwealth \nof Virginia. We have a long and proud tradition of protecting our \ninterests and our ability to govern our own actions. I fought those \nbattles every step of the way in my public life--from my service in the \nVirginia House of Delegates until now. It is my responsibility as an \nelected official of the Commonwealth of Virginia to adhere to \nprinciples, fight for the will of Virginia, and protect the sovereignty \nof our people and their rights. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to strongly \nsupport the Aviation Investment and Revitalization Vision Act.\n  I want to first applaud the tremendous leadership on this bill from \nmy chairman on the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and Senator \nHollings, the ranking member.\n  This legislation reaffirms our Government's critical commitment to a \nsafe, efficient, and state-of-the-art airline system for the 21st \ncentury--a commitment that is crucially important to my home State.\n  The Seattle-Tacoma International Airport is the principal airport for \nthe Northwest region, making it the Nation's 16th largest passenger \nairport, with over 26.5 million passengers annually on almost 40 \ndifferent airlines going in and out of the Seattle-Tacoma airport.\n  Washington State is also the home to the ninth largest airline in the \ncountry, Alaska Airlines, which employs over 10,000 people and is one \nof the few airlines in the country actually posting growth rates over \nthe last few years. In addition, Alaska is nationally recognized for \nits leadership to incorporate technology into its business model.\n  As the proud home of Boeing's commercial aviation division, \nWashington State leads the Nation in large civil aircraft \nmanufacturing.\n  With Boeing and hundreds of smaller businesses in aerospace and \naviation, we have over 75,000 workers designing and manufacturing the \npresent and future of U.S. aircraft industry.\n  Obviously, a solid, well functioning, state-of-the-art national air \ntraffic system and a strong domestic aircraft manufacturing capability \nare critical to my State and our Nation.\n  I am proud to say that this bipartisan legislation takes tremendous \nsteps towards this goal in several ways.\n  First, this bill increases funding for airport infrastructure \ninvestments that will help our Nation's airports make the improvements, \nupgrades and expansions necessary to meet our Nation's airline demands \nin the 21st century.\n  The bill also increases the funding that will be used to upgrade the \nFAA air traffic control system, to ensure that our traffic controllers \nare given the resources they need to continue getting planes where they \nneed to go--in the safest and most efficient manner.\n  In addition, this bill addresses a critical resource need facing our \nNation's airports since 9/11 increased security updates. The \nlegislation not only provides $500 million in funding for security \nenhancements, but it ensures that this funding is not taken from the \nairport trust fund money that is already committed to make important \nstructural upgrades and airport improvements.\n  Last, in what I think is one of the most important contributions of \nthis bill, the legislation includes a dramatic expansion in our \nNation's commitment to aviation research and safety.\n  Mr. President, a renewed commitment to research and development in \nthe aerospace industry is absolutely necessary--and we need it now.\n\n[[Page S7816]]\n\n  The Final Report of the Commission on the Future of the United States \nAerospace Industry argued that current Federal aerospace R is \n``insufficient and unfocused'' and recommended in the Federal \nGovernment significantly increase its investment in aerospace research \nto foster an efficient, secure, and safe aerospace transportation \nsystem.\n  We must clearly recognize that if we are not willing to make the \ncommitments to retain leadership in this realm, our allies on the other \nside of the Atlantic certainly are willing to take our place--in fact, \nthis effort has become European policy.\n  Indeed, the European Commission has declared in its ``STAR-21'' \nreport that it is willing to explore ``all available means'' to ensure \nthe competitiveness of the European aerospace sector--including Airbus.\n  This support to the European aerospace sector comes in the form of \nsubstantial research and development, but also in direct product \ndevelopment grants, concessionary financing, and other direct \nsubsidies.\n  While we have chosen, as a matter of Government policy, not to pursue \nsuch direct subsidies or provide assistance for product development, we \nhave been able to help the research and development effort through a \nvariety of research programs that both of your agencies have pursued.\n  It is time for the United States to reinforce our Nation's place as a \nleader in the aerospace sector--an industry is an absolutely crucial \ncomponent of our domestic industrial base.\n  For this reason, I am very proud that this bill includes provisions \noriginally introduced by Senator Hollings, that would establish an \nOffice of Aerospace and Aviation Liaison in the Department of \nTransportation that will draw upon staff from FAA, NASA, DHS, DOD, DOC, \nand other appropriate agencies to coordinate Federal research programs, \nas well as establish goals and priorities for research.\n  Such an office will be well equipped to meet the challenge of the \nAerospace Commission and bring direction and coordination to our \nFederal support for long-term research and innovation.\n  In addition, this bill authorizes almost $3 billion over the next 3 \nyears for FAA and NASA research priorities. This is a dramatic \nexpansion of the research agenda, almost five times more than \npreviously authorized funding--previous authorization was approximately \n$600 million over 3 years.\n  As part of these research provisions, I am particularly proud to have \nworked with the committee to include funding and authority for future \nwork on the durability and maintainability of advanced materials, such \nas composites.\n  These next generation materials have been called the aluminum of the \nfuture. Indeed, given their strength, durability, lightweight and \nunique properties, composites are currently used in most major defense \naircraft.\n  Composites not only make for stronger, safer materials but also \nlighter and more efficient aircraft.\n  Already, the Boeing Company has increased its use of composites in \nthe production of the 777 and Airbus is also using composites in its \nplanes. Additionally, Boeing has plans for even greater use in the \nproduction of the next generation of commercial airplanes.\n  In addition to authorizing funds for general research in advanced \nmaterials, this legislation would direct the FAA Administrator to \nestablish a ``Center for Excellence'' that would harness the great \nengineering research in materials science at path-breaking institutions \nlike the University of Washington, which has taken great strides in \npursuing work on how to advance the maintainability and durability of \nadvanced materials and composites in large civilian aircraft.\n  While we know that these materials hold tremendous potential, we need \nto be absolutely sure that they are safe and that we have the \ntechnologies and processes necessary to maintain the materials and \nensure their durability.\n  Such a center, which I have drafted in partnership with the \nUniversity of Washington's Department of Engineering, would address \nthese issues by facilitating close, working collaboration among \nindustry, the FAA's Transportation Division, and academic institutions, \nto ensure that research matches the practical manufacturing needs.\n  This center will advance efforts to capitalize on the potential of \nthis field.\n  In closing, Mr. President, as a government, we need to step up to the \nplate to ensure that our aerospace industry remains competitive and \ncapable of leading the world toward the future for aerospace.\n  This bill takes an important step in affirming our Nation's \nleadership in the areas of safety, research, infrastructure, and \nsecurity, and I am proud to support it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the FAA \nAuthorization Act. However, I must express my serious concerns that two \nsections in the bill on streamlining, sections 47701 and 47703, may be \ninterpreted in a manner that the committee never intended. The purpose \nof these sections is to cure delays that have occurred because of \ninteragency wrangling and bureaucratic disputes. These sections call \nfor the relevant agencies to undertake concurrent planning and \nenvironmental reviews for critical airport projects in order to ensure \nthat the projects move forward expeditiously. They are not designed to \ncircumvent NEPA and should be so used.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Senate's \nFederal Aviation Administration, FAA, reauthorization bill, S. 824, the \nAviation Investment and Revitalization Vision Act. Further, I share \nSenate Commerce Committee Chairman McCain's and Ranking Member \nHollings' goal of enacting this legislation before the end of this \nfiscal year. If airports are going to plan for the future, Congress \nmust avoid being forced into passing a series of stopgap measures that \nmake such planning difficult.\n  This legislation addresses the most critical component of FAA \nreauthorization--how to finance the operation and development of the \nnearly 3,500 airports eligible for Federal assistance. S. 824 \nauthorizes a total of $10.5 billion over 3 years for the Airport \nImprovement Program, AIP, a critical program that funds airport safety \nand capacity projects, among other programs. Additionally, this bill \nauthorizes $23.2 billion for FAA operations through fiscal year 2006.\n  At the same time we address the overall aviation funding challenges, \nI am pleased that this bill takes on the individual issues that go to \nthe heart of securing commercial aviation against another terrorist \nattack. Installing Explosives Detection System, EDS, machines into \nairports is a necessity that we must grapple with and is part of a \nbroader debate on the appropriate level of AIP funding that should go \ntowards security-related projects. During fiscal year 2002, airports \nused over $561 million, or 17 percent of all of AIP funds, for security \nprojects--this compared with an annual average of less than 2 percent \nthrough fiscal year 2001. As such, it is encouraging that S. 824 \ncreates an annual $500 million Aviation Security Capital Fund to help \nairports cope with post-9/11 security requirements like EDS \ninstallation. Funding for this capital fund would come out of the \nsecurity fees currently levied by the Transportation Security \nAdministration, TSA, and not AIP grant funding.\n  S. 824 would also extend the Government's authority to issue war-risk \ninsurance through fiscal year 2006, which would save the airlines more \nthan $800 million annually. The recently enacted fiscal year 2003 Iraq \nsupplemental bill authorized a 1-year extension of the program--through \nthe end of fiscal year 2004--but by extending it through 2006, we can \nprovide a small measure of financial stability to the airlines and not \nhave to keep coming back every 6 months to revisit the issue.\n  To try to improve FAA management, S. 824 establishes a committee of \noutside experts to oversee the operation and modernization of the air \ntraffic control system--which has tripled in cost to an estimated $7.6 \nbillion since 1996. This bill also contains provisions designed to \nexpedite the process for construction of airport capacity and safety \nprojects, by allowing DOT to designate certain airport expansion \nproposals as National Capacity Projects, which would receive dedicated \nresources and expedited procedures for environmental reviews. This \nprovision is intended to address the fact that, as the General \nAccounting Office, GAO, has reported, it takes anywhere between 10 and \n14 years for new\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\nrunways to be built--and this has an adverse effect on efforts to \nincrease the aviation system's capacity.\n  As we consider this bill, I want to turn to the issue of small \ncommunity air service. As we work to address the larger aviation \nissues, we cannot forget the challenges that small communities in \nMaine, and throughout the Nation, face in attracting and retaining air \nservice. I have always believed that adequate, reliable air service in \nour Nation's rural areas is not simply a luxury or a convenience. It is \nan imperative. And quite frankly, I have serious concerns about the \nimpact deregulation of the airline industry has had on small- and \nmedium-sized cities in rural areas, like Maine. The fact is, since \nderegulation, many of these communities, in Maine and elsewhere, have \nexperienced a decrease in flights and size of aircraft while seeing an \nincrease in fares. More than 300 have lost air service altogether.\n\n  Many air carriers are experiencing an unprecedented financial crisis, \nand the first routes on the chopping block will be those to small- and \nmedium-sized communities. This will only increase demand for the two \nexisting Federal forms of assistance, Essential Air Service and the \nSmall Community Air Service Grant Program.\n  Given the challenge faced by small communities in retaining their \nexisting air service, I was pleased that, during our May 1 markup, the \nCommerce Committee unanimously accepted two amendments I authored to \naddress this issue. The first amendment would create a new Small \nCommunity Air Service Ombudsman within DOT. The ombudsman's mission \nwould be to work with carriers and communities to develop air service. \nThis provision is intended to give small communities a seat at the \ntable as DOT crafts national air transportation policy.\n  The second amendment approved by the committee creates a National \nCommission on Small Community Air Service. The 9-member commission \nwould report back to Congress after 2 years to describe the problems \nfaced by small communities with regard to access to commercial air \nservice and suggest legislative solutions. I believe that, given the \ncomplexity of the issue, having all of the stakeholders sit down and \nconsider what can and can't be done will be extremely helpful as \nCongress exercises its aviation oversight authority.\n  I also wanted to address the Essential Air Service, EAS, provisions \nin the bill. EAS provides subsidized air service to 125 small \ncommunities in the country--including 4 in Maine--that would otherwise \nbe cut off from the Nation's air transportation network. As approved by \nthe committee, S. 824 reauthorized and flat-funds the program for 3 \nyears, and includes certain changes to the program, which are \ndrastically scaled back from what the administration proposed earlier \nthis year for EAS ``reform.'' The administration had called for EAS \ntowns to provide up to 25 percent matching contributions to keep their \nair service. The committee bill creates a number of new programs to \nhelp EAS communities grow their ridership, including a marketing \nincentive program that would financially reward EAS towns for achieving \nridership goals. With regard to local cost-sharing--the centerpiece of \nthe administration's EAS proposal--the Commerce bill would create a \npilot program to allow for a 10 percent annual community match at no \nmore than 10 airports within 100 miles of a large airport.\n  While the cost-sharing provisions in the committee bill are much less \nstrict than the administration proposal, and could only be applied to \nan EAS community under certain specific conditions, I remain concerned \nabout the concept of requiring EAS towns--some of which are cash \nstrapped and economically depressed--from kicking in hundreds of \nthousands of dollars annually to keep their air service. For example, \nif Augusta or Rockland, ME, were to be chosen for the cost-sharing \npilot program, they would have to come up with over $120,000 annually \nto retain their air service.\n  As such, I strongly supported Senator Bingaman's amendments to strike \nthe cost-sharing section from the bill and am pleased that it has been \napproved. The EAS program is not perfect, and Congress certainly need \nto do all we can to keep subsidy levels as low as possible. I look \nforward to working with members of the Commerce Committee and the \nSenate on the issue, but I believe that requiring cost sharing in \ntoday's aviation environment is clearly a wrong headed approach.\n  In short, when considering this legislation, I believe that we need \ndo all we can to help small communities maintain their access to the \nnational transportation system during these difficult times.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I am hopeful that my colleagues will \njoin me in taking this step toward strengthening and improving Federal \naviation policy today. S. 824 enhances the Federal investment in our \nNation's aviation system, and the funding in the bill is critical to \nthe development of America's airports, big and small. Furthermore, \nquick passage of this 3-year legislation is key to allow airports to \nplan for the future. As such, I am pleased to support it.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Arizona, to bring before you S. 824, the \nAviation Investment and Revitalization Vision Act, which reauthorizes \nthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and its programs for the next \n3 years.\n  The reauthorization of the FAA is a vitally important piece of \nlegislation that the Senate must pass this year. It is the first real \neconomic stimulus bill that the Senate has considered this year.\n  I cannot emphasize the importance of a vibrant and strong aviation \nindustry. It is critical to our Nation's long-term economic growth. It \nis also vitally important to the economic future of countless small and \nlocal communities that are linked to the rest of the nation and world \nthrough aviation.\n  The significance of aviation to our economy cannot be overstated. \nOver 10 million people are employed directly in the aviation industry. \nFor every job in the aviation industry, 15 related jobs are produced. \nThe aviation industry accounts for over $800 billion of our gross \ndomestic product.\n  The growth of the modern aviation system has created vast economic \nefficiencies such as just in time delivery, allowed the air cargo \nindustry to grow exponentially, and has opened up the world to millions \nof Americans.\n  Just as the aviation industry is a catalyst of growth for the \nnational economy, airports are a catalyst of growth for their local \ncommunities. Airports create over $500 billion in economic activity and \ndirectly employ 1.9 million people. Almost 2 million people and 38,000 \ntons of cargo pass through our nation's airports each day. In my State \nof West Virginia, aviation represents $3.4 billion of the State's gross \ndomestic product and directly and indirectly employs over 51,000 \npeople.\n  Aviation also links our Nation's small and rural citizens and \ncommunities to the national and world marketplace. My home State of \nWest Virginia has been able to attract firms from Asia and Europe \nbecause of reliable access to their West Virginia investments.\n  Without access to an integrated air transportation network, small \ncommunities can not attract the investment necessary to grow or allow \nhome grown businesses to expand. A modern and adequately funded network \nis fundamental to making sure that all Americans can participate in the \neconomy.\n  No question exists that since the tragedy of September 11, aviation \nin this country has been permanently changed.\n  When the Senate debated the last FAA reauthorization bill, capacity \nand competition issues were at the forefront of that debate. We have \nseen a decrease in the demand for air travel, hundreds of thousand of \naerospace and aviation employees have lost their jobs and the economic \npain has rippled through the economy. We will not have an economic \nrecovery in this country until we have a recovery in the aviation \nindustry.\n  Even though these issues seem less important today, they will again \nbecome serious challenges for the industry. In the drive to expand our \naviation infrastructure to meet future needs, the resources for \naviation security will also have to increase. More passenger and cargo \nwill add strains to aviation security.\n  Now is the time to make the investments in air traffic modernization \nand airport development and research. Aviation security must be ready \nto\n\n[[Page S7818]]\n\nhandle the future growth that will occur. We must also continue to \ndevelop new aviation security processes and technologies to meet future \nchallenges.\n\n  The legislation before us builds upon our commitment to improving the \naviation infrastructure of the nation that started with the landmark \nAviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century. I believe that \nthis legislation meets the challenges facing the FAA and the aviation \nindustry in the years ahead.\n  This bill focuses on improving our nation's aviation safety and \nsecurity, airport and air service development, and aeronautical \nresearch. While my distinguished colleague has provided an excellent \noverview of the bill, I would like to highlight some areas of the bill \nthat I believe are particularly important.\n  In this bill, we have created a stable stream of funding for security \nupgrades at our Nation's airports. Not only will these funds allow \nairports to improve security they will allow airports to improve the \nefficiency of these security measures.\n  In addition, the legislation provides for increases in funding for \nairport safety and capacity projects, which are a true economic \nstimulus.\n  I am very proud that the bill expands upon our commitment to making \nsure small and rural communities have access to air transportation \nservices.\n  Finally, we have authorized a significant increase in aeronautical \nand aviation research in order to preserve America's leadership in \nthese industries.\n  No higher goal exists than the safety and security of the Nation's \nairports and airspace. Over the past 18 months, we have worked every \nday to improve security in our airports and on our airplanes. However, \nuntil this bill, we have fallen short on providing funding to make sure \nour Nation's airports have the resources available to make the required \nimprovements.\n  Airports estimate that they have $3 billion in unmet security \ninfrastructure needs. The administration's Homeland Security proposal \ndid not include any provisions to address this huge need. Airports have \nbeen forced to tap their expansion and development funds to pay for \nsecurity. It makes no sense to raid funds for safety improvements for \nsecurity improvements. The security of our Nation is a Federal \nresponsibility and the Federal Government must pay for it.\n  One of the most important provisions in this bill is the creation of \na $500 million fund, financed by security fees established by the \nAviation and Transportation Security Act to assist airports with \ncapital security costs. This new fund will also stop the diversion of \nairport development funds meant for safety and capacity enhancements. \nWe will be able to pay for new security requirements while \nsimultaneously improving safety and expanding capacity.\n  Even in these difficult budgetary times, we were able to modestly \nincrease the Airport Improvement Program funding, which will provide \nthe economy a real stimulus through direct and indirect job creation. \nAirport development is economic development as airports are economic \ndevelopment for their local communities. It is estimated that U.S. \nAirports are responsible for nearly $507 billion each year in total \neconomic activity nationwide. Investment in airport infrastructure is a \nreal economic stimulus that creates both immediate jobs and long-term \neconomic development.\n  In order to facilitate airport development, I am pleased that this \nbill includes much of the text of the legislation that Senator \nHutchison and I worked on last Congress to streamline and expedite the \nairport development process. This country needs to expand its airport \ninfrastructure. Without a substantial increase in this area, aviation \ndelays would increase resulting in billions of dollars of costs to the \neconomy.\n  Today, we also meet the challenge of making sure our small and rural \ncommunities have access to the nation's air transportation network. I \nam very concerned that air carriers have abandoned small and rural \nmarkets disproportionately when reducing their service levels. We \ncannot let these communities go without adequate and affordable air \nservice--their future depends upon it.\n  I am enormously pleased that the bill extends and expands the Small \nCommunity Air Service Development Program, which I fought for in AIR \n21. One hundred forty communities applied for 40 available grants under \nthis initiative. This program has assisted these 40 communities, \nincluding Charleston, WV, in attracting new air service. This program \nhas proven an innovative and flexible tool for communities to address \nair service needs. Under our legislation, another 120 communities will \nbe able to participate.\n  Many of our most isolated and vulnerable communities whose only \nservice is through the Essential Air Service Program have indicated \nthat they would like to develop innovative and flexible programs \nsimilar to those communities who received Small Community Air Service \nDevelopment grants to improve the quality of their air service.\n  It is for this reason that I, along with Senator Lott, developed the \nSmall Community and Rural Air Service Revitalization Act of 2003, which \nhas been included in this legislation. The legislation reauthorizes the \nEssential Air Service (EAS) program and creates a series of new \ninnovative pilot programs for EAS communities to participate in to \nstimulate passenger demand for air service in their communities.\n  Under the bill, communities are given the option on continuing their \nEAS as is or they may apply to participate in new incentive programs to \nhelp them develop new and innovative solutions to increasing local \ndemand for air service. The EAS Marketing and Community Flexibility \nPrograms would provide communities new resources and tools to implement \nlocally developed plans to improve their air service. By providing \ncommunities the ability to design their own service proposals, a \ncommunity has the ability to develop a plan that meets its locally \ndetermined needs, improves air service choices, and gives the community \na greater stake in the EAS program.\n  Small and rural communities are the first to bear the brunt of bad \neconomic times and the last to see the benefits of good times. The \ngeneral economic downturn and the dire straits of the aviation industry \nhave placed exceptional burdens on air service to our most isolated \ncommunities. The Federal Government must provide additional resources \nand tools for small communities to help themselves attract adequate air \nservice. The Federal Government must make sure that our most vulnerable \ntowns and cities are linked to the rest of the nation. This legislation \nauthorizes the tools and resources necessary to attract air service, \nrelated economic development, and most importantly expand their \nconnections to the national and global economy.\n  This bill meets the challenges facing our aviation system--increasing \nsecurity, expanding airport safety and capacity, and making sure our \nsmallest communities have access to the network. We can all be proud of \nthis bill.\n  Finally, I would like to again thank Senator McCain, Senator Lott, \nand Senator Hollings for all their hard work and commitment to \ndeveloping and securing passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand we are waiting for the \npossibility of one other amendment. Other than that, we will be \nprepared, at the discretion of the leaders, to vote on the second-\ndegree amendment to the Specter amendment, and then we would be \nprepared to go to final passage.\n  In anticipation of that, I would like to thank all who have been \ninvolved with this legislation, and specifically my dear friend from \nSouth Carolina. He and I have worked side by side for many years on \nmany issues that have come before the Commerce Committee. I thank him \nfor his usual extreme courtesy, consideration, and efficiency.\n  I thank the staff on both sides for their excellent work.\n  Also, I thank Senators Lott and Rockefeller who really did the hard \nlabor in bringing this legislation to the floor of the Senate. Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Lott worked assiduously during numerous \nhearings with a full appreciation and understanding of the impact this \nlegislation has on the United States of America. I thank all of them.\n  Again, I thank our loyal staff for all the great work they have done.\n\n[[Page S7819]]\n\n  I look forward to swift passage of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me also thank the distinguished \nchairman of our committee who has led the fight on the floor today. He \ndid a most efficient job.\n  With respect to, of course, Senator Lott and Senator Rockefeller of \nthe Subcommittee on Aviation of the Commerce Committee, they are the \nones who did the lion's share of the work with the hearings and \npreparing us so that we could handle this with expedition today.\n  I thank staff on both sides.\n  Let me add this for my good friend, the Senator from Mississippi. I \nhappen to favor the Specter amendment for the simple reason that I \ncannot understand the Federal Aviation Administration requiring rules \nof safety for repair facilities in the United States but not requiring \nthose same rules of safety for repair facilities by the U.S. \ncontractors for U.S. aircraft. I just can't get that separation in my \nmind. I have listened closely. I hate to not come down on the side of \nthe Senator from Mississippi because he has been our chairman and has \nled the way all day here.\n  I say that publicly because, on the Democratic side of the aisle, \nthere could be those who would favor language and the admonition of the \nSenator from Mississippi in the perfecting amendment.\n  Senator Boxer has spoken in behalf of Senator Specter's amendment. I \nhappen to favor it. Usually we note at the desk the disposition on this \nside. I don't want to mislead.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, with the \nagreement of both sides, that Senator Stevens be recognized to offer \none final amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 923\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 923.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend section 41703 of title 49, United States Code, to \n  support the United States presence in the global air cargo industry)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 521. UNITED STATES PRESENCE IN GLOBAL AIR CARGO \n                   INDUSTRY.\n\n       Section 41703 is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(e) Cargo in Alaska.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For the purposes of subsection (c), \n     eligible cargo taken on or off any aircraft at a place in \n     Alaska in the course of transportation of that cargo by any \n     combination of 2 or more air carriers or foreign air carriers \n     in either direction between a place in the United States and \n     a place outside the United States shall not be deemed to have \n     broken its international journey in, be taken on in, or be \n     destined for Alaska.\n       ``(2) Eligible cargo.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the \n     term `eligible cargo' means cargo transported between Alaska \n     and any other place in the United States on a foreign air \n     carrier (having been transported from, or thereafter being \n     transported to, a place outside the United States on a \n     different air carrier or foreign air carrier) that is \n     carried--\n       ``(A) under the code of a U.S. air carrier providing air \n     transportation to Alaska;\n       ``(B) on an air carrier way bill of U.S. air carrier \n     providing air transportation to Alaska; or\n       ``(C) under a term arrangement or block space agreement \n     with an air carrier.''.\n       (D) under the code of a U.S. air carrier for purposes of \n     transportation within the U.S.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment deals with protecting \nexisting jobs and creating new jobs on the ground in Alaska in \nconnection with the airport I am honored to have named after me.\n  Mr. President, as I say, this amendment is about jobs--protecting \nexisting jobs and creating new jobs on the ground in Alaska.\n  Anchorage is the top-ranked cargo airport in North America: 600 wide \nbody cargo carriers per week; 19 airlines providing all-cargo main deck \nfreighter service through Anchorage; 9 hours by air from 95 percent of \nthe industrialized world; 3000 miles from Tokyo; 3000 miles from New \nYork city; 4000 miles from London; 4000 miles from Frankfurt; 4400 \nmiles from Hong Kong.\n  Foreign airlines provide much of this international cargo lift to and \nfrom the U.S. through Anchorage. Federal law allows these planes to \nland in Alaska, creating an enormous number of jobs on the ground.\n  But Federal law, as currently interpreted, does not allow U.S. \ncarriers to use excess capacity on their foreign partners to move \ninternational cargo from Anchorage to the lower 48. The foreign carrier \nmust make the full trip by itself. It is prohibited from transferring \ncargo to or from a U.S. carrier flying the international leg of the \njourney.\n  Anchorage is under attack from foreign cargo hubs seeking to exploit \nthis weakness. Cities such as Tashkent, Kharbarovsk, and Anadyr in Asia \nand Calgary and Vancouver in Canada are aggressively pursuing the cargo \ncarriers that Anchorage now serves.\n  We are losing U.S. jobs to foreign countries because of it.\n  This amendment will reverse that decline.\n  American carriers, both cargo carriers and passenger carriers, which \naccept cargo will make use of this amendment in various ways: \nrelocation of sort and transfer operations from Asia back to the United \nStates; enhanced service to U.S., Asian, and European cities; increased \nopportunities for integrated logistics products sold by U.S. companies; \nmore opportunities to strengthen U.S. carriers through international \npartnering.\n  This requires a narrow modification of title 49.\n  My amendment does not create more flights by foreign carriers. It \ndoes not reduce the number of flights flown by U.S. carriers. All cargo \nmoving under this authority must be shipped on a U.S. codeshare or \nsimilar arrangement, such as a U.S. waybill.\n  It preserves and creates American jobs in the increasingly important \nglobal air cargo sector.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 923.\n  The amendment (No. 923) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with regard \nto the amendment that was proposed on behalf of Senators Inouye and \nVoinovich, that Senator Voinovich's name be deleted from that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe Lott second-degree amendment take place at 5:45, immediately \nfollowed by either a voice vote or recorded vote on the underlying \nSpecter amendment, followed by final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnominations on today's Executive Calendar:\n  No. 223 and on the Secretary's Desk, PN443 and PN182.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Nomination of John W. Woodcock to be United States District Judge for \n                         The District of Maine\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, \nExecutive Item No. 223 is the nomination of John Woodcock to be a \nDistrict Judge for the District of Maine. I am very pleased to rise \ntonight to speak on his behalf. Maine's senior Senator, Olympia Snowe, \nand I are very proud to have recommended John for this prestigious \nposition on the Federal bench.\n\n  I have known John Woodcock for many years. John, in fact, recruited \nme several years ago to serve as a trustee on the board of the Eastern \nMaine Medical Center, which he has chaired for 23 years. This is \ntypical of John's service to his community. He has devoted countless \nhours volunteering his time and energy to his alma mater, Bowdoin \nCollege; Eastern Maine Charities; the Maine State Commission on Arts \nand Humanities; the Good Samaritan Agency; and the Bangor Children's \nHome, to name just a few.\n  The Woodcock family has a proud tradition of public service that \nspans generations. In fact, two of John's sons have served as members \nof my staff.\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\nJack currently serves on my Governmental Affairs Committee staff, while \nPatrick works as a college intern in my Bangor office. I once remarked \nto John--and repeated it at the Judiciary Committee hearing, which the \nPresiding Officer chaired that day--that his sons' hard work and \nprofessional demeanor were proof that the apple does not fall far from \nthe tree. After the hearing, John wrote to me, in his typically \ngracious and unassuming and self-effacing way, and said in his mind the \ntree has always been his wife, Beverly.\n  Lest John's modesty hide his extensive accomplishments, let me take \njust a moment to share with my colleagues his qualifications to be a \nFederal judge.\n  John began practicing law nearly 30 years ago and has built a \ndistinguished career as a litigator. He has served as an assistant \ndistrict attorney for the State of Maine and has worked in private \npractice as an associate and as a partner of several law firms in the \ngreat State of Maine.\n  In 1991, he joined several colleagues to form the Bangor law firm of \nWeatherbee, Woodcock, Burlock & Woodcock.\n  During his career, John has served as lead counsel in 47 separate \nappeals to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court on issues ranging from \ntrust law to criminal law.\n  John has also taken an active role in improving the standards of the \nlegal profession, serving, for example, on the Maine Supreme Judicial \nCourt's Advisory Committee on Professional Responsibility. As a member \nof this committee, John worked to draft a series of aspirational goals \nto help guide lawyers who elect to advertise with their professional \nobligations in this area.\n  Those of us who are familiar with John Woodcock's sterling character \nand stellar legal career were not surprised when the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously \nrated him as ``well qualified''--the highest possible rating. Indeed, \nit would be difficult for Senator Snowe and I to come up with another \ncandidate better suited to serve as a Federal judge in the State of \nMaine.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee also voted unanimously to approve his \nnomination on June 5.\n  Mr. President, John has the legal excellence, the temperament, and \nthe integrity to serve on the Federal bench. I have every confidence he \nwill faithfully follow the law as interpreted by higher courts and that \nhe will bring justice to the parties before him.\n  I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support John Woodcock's \nnomination for a Federal district court judgeship, and I urge my \ncolleagues, in voting this evening, to confirm this terrific \nindividual.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Senate \nconfirmation of Mr. John A. Woodcock, Jr. of Hamden, ME, as Federal \njudge for the United States District Court for the District of Maine in \nBangor.\n  John's roots run deep in the Bangor community. His family has been \nthere for generations, and John attended John Bapst High School in the \nheart of downtown. He began his law career in Bangor 26 years ago, and \ntoday he is with the Bangor law firm of Woodcock, Weatherbee, Burlock, \nand Woodcock, having argued 46 cases before the Maine Supreme Judicial \nCourt. He has served on the Maine Supreme Court Advisory Committee on \nProfessional Responsibility, while also giving of himself personally to \nthe community.\n  Indeed, for about 25 years he has served on the board of Eastern \nMaine Healthcare Systems and is now president of Eastern Maine Medical \nCenter's Board of Directors. Among other involvements, over the last 7 \nyears John has also served as the attorney-coach for the Hampden \nAcademy Mock Trial Team.\n  Mr. Woodcock is well-qualified for this position, as evidenced by the \nunanimous decision of the Senate Judiciary Committee to favorably \nreport his nomination to the full Senate on June 5, 2003. Moreover, the \nAmerican Bar Association unanimously named John as ``well qualified''--\nmeaning, ``The nominee is at the top of the legal profession in his or \nher legal community, has outstanding legal ability, breadth of \nexperience, the highest reputation for integrity, and either has \ndemonstrated, or exhibited the capacity for, judicial temperament.''\n  In Maine, the Federal Judicial Nomination Advisory Committee that \nSenator Collins and I assembled--with over 270 combined years \npracticing law--selected John Woodcock as their top recommendation. And \nformer Senator and Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen has said of John \nthat, ``In his years of practice, John has developed a statewide \nreputation as a skilled litigator and an effective counselor. He has \ndeep experience in litigation at trial and appellate levels and is well \nregarded throughout the Maine Bar.''\n  As I told the Judiciary Committee when I had the privilege of \nintroducing John to the committee at his hearing on May 22, Maine's \nU.S. District Court has a long history, as one of the first such courts \nestablished in 1789. Should Mr. Woodcock be confirmed, he would become \nonly the 16th judge appointed to the court by the President of the \nUnited States over its 213-year history. Moreover, the position for \nwhich Mr. Woodcock has been nominated is the lone Federal judge \nposition in northern Maine. With John's record and qualifications, he \nhas the depth of experience, the temperament, and the integrity \ndemanded by the gravity of the office for which he has been chosen. He \nwill uphold and enhance not only Maine's tradition of exceptional trial \njudges, but he will also reflect the finest ideals and expectations of \nour Federal judiciary.\n  As I also told the Judiciary Committee, from a layman's point of \nview--the best trial judges are distinguished by their ability to \nbalance several, sometimes competitive personal dynamics. They balance \nbroad lie exposure with specific courtroom experience, raw legal \naptitude with common sense, patience with firmness, and intellectual \ncuriosity with focused decision-making. John Woodcock embodies all of \nthose traits and characteristics, and with his substantial and broad \nlegal and courtroom experience, as well as his keen intellect and \nperspective, solid character, and outstanding reputation, I am most \nproud to recommend to my colleagues that he be confirmed as Federal \njudge for the United States District Court for the District of Maine.\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of Secretary Cohen's letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The Cohen Group,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Orrin: I have recently learned that John A. Woodcock, \n     Jr., who has been nominated for a U.S. District judgeship for \n     the District of Maine, is scheduled to appear before the \n     Committee on the Judiciary on May 22, 2003. Senator Olympia \n     Snowe recommended Mr. Woodcock for this position in \n     conjunction with the support of Senator Susan Collins.\n       I have known John Woodcock for many years. He is a native \n     of my hometown, Bangor, and attended my alma mater, Bowdoin \n     College, graduating in 1972. He attended the University of \n     Maine School of Law, graduating in 1976, and has been \n     continuously engaged in the practice of law ever since.

Woodcock to be a United States \nDistrict Judge for the District of Maine. Mr. Woodcock possesses over \n25 years of litigation experience and will serve his country well as a \nFederal judge.\n\n[[Page S7822]]\n\n  After graduating from the University of Maine Law School in 1976, Mr. \nWoodcock joined the law firm of Stearns, Finnegan & Needham where he \npracticed general civil litigation until 1980. From 1977-1978, Mr. \nWoodcock was a part-time assistant district attorney. While in the \ndistrict attorney's office, he handled all criminal appeals from two \ndifferent counties to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court and was the lead \nprosecutor in approximately 20 criminal jury trials. In 1980, Mr. \nWoodcock joined Mitchell & Stearns until forming the smaller law firm \nof Weatherbee, Woodcock, Burlock & Woodcock in 1991, where he currently \npractices general civil litigation.\n  During his career, Mr. Woodcock has been involved in 47 separate \nappeals to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court on issues ranging from \ncriminal law to trust law. Mr. Woodcock has volunteered his time as a \nmember of several community boards and he is also the attorney-coach \nfor the local high school mock trial team.\n  After reviewing his record, the ABA gave Mr. Woodcock their highest \nrating of unanimously well qualified. The committee also received a \nletter from former Clinton administration Secretary of Defense William \nCohen praising Mr. Woodcock's skills as a litigator. He writes, ``I \nhave known John Woodcock for many years. . . . The U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Maine has a long practice of excellence in its \njudicial appointments and the nomination of John Woodcock is in every \nway consistent with that tradition.''\n  I will submit a copy of this letter for the Record. These are words \nof high praise and I applaud Mr. Woodcock on his many accomplishments. \nI am certain he will bring great credit to the Federal bench and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this highly qualified nominee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the above-mentioned letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   The Cohn Group,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2003.\n     Hon.

Woodcock, \n     Jr., who has been nominated for a U.S. District judgeship for \n     the District of Maine, is scheduled to appear before the \n     Committee on the Judiciary on May 22, 2003. Senator Olympia \n     Snowe recommended Mr. Woodcock for this position in \n     conjunction with the support of Senator Susan Collins.\n       I have known John Woodcock for many years. He is a native \n     of my hometown, Bangor and attended my alma mater, Bowdoin \n     College, graduating in 1972. He attended the University of \n     Maine School of Law, graduating in 1976, and has been \n     continuously engaged in the practice of law ever since. In \n     his years of practice, John has developed a statewide \n     reputation as a skilled litigator and an effective counselor. \n     He has deep experience in litigation at trial and appellate \n     levels and is well regarded throughout the Maine Bar.\n       John has also given his time and energies unstintingly to \n     local civic groups. He has recently completed more than 20 \n     years of service on the board of the Eastern Maine Medical \n     Center, an institution vital to providing quality health care \n     in northern and eastern Maine. John is married to Beverly \n     Woodcock and they have a fine family of three boys, Jack, \n     Patrick, and Chris. Jack now works on the Governmental \n     Affairs Committee for Senator Collins.\n       The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine has a \n     long practice of excellence in its judicial appointments and \n     the nomination of John Woodcock is in every way consistent \n     with that tradition. I recommend him to you with enthusiasm \n     and without reservation.\n       With best personal regards, I am,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William S. Cohen.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we vote to confirm John A. Woodcock, \nJr. to a lifetime appointment on the United States District Court for \nthe District of Maine. With this confirmation we will have helped fill \nthe sole vacancy on that court. That vacancy, which arose early this \nyear when Judge Carter took senior status, is important to the people \nof Maine and New England. I have been glad to work with the Senators \nfrom Maine to expedite the confirmation of this nominee and provide \nbipartisan support. I congratulate the nominee and his family.\n  The Senate has now confirmed 132 judges nominated by President Bush, \nincluding 26 circuit court judges. One hundred judicial nominees were \nconfirmed when Democrats acted as the Senate majority for 17 months \nfrom the summer of 2001 to adjournment last year. After today, 32 will \nhave been confirmed in the other 12 months in which Republicans have \ncontrolled the confirmation process under President Bush. This total of \n132 judges confirmed for President Bush is more confirmations than the \nRepublicans allowed President Clinton in all of 1995, 1996 and 1997--\nthe first 3 years they controlled the Senate process for President \nClinton. In those 3 full years, the Republican leadership in the Senate \nallowed only 111 judicial nominees to be confirmed, which included only \n18 circuit judges. We have already exceeded that total by 19 percent \nand the circuit court total by 40 percent with 6 months remaining to us \nthis year. In truth, we have achieved all this in less than 2 years \nbecause of the delays in organizing and reorganizing the Senate in \n2001. The Judiciary Committee was not even reassigned until July 10, \n2001, so we have now confirmed 132 judges in less than 2 years.\n  In the first half of this year, the 32 confirmations is more than \nRepublicans allowed to be confirmed in the entire 1996 session, when \nonly 17 district court judges were added to the Federal courts across \nthe nation. In the first half of this year, with 9 circuit court \nconfirmations, we have already exceeded the average of 7 per year \nachieved by Republican leadership from 1995 through the early part of \n2001. That is more circuit court confirmations in 6 months than \nRepublicans allowed confirmed in the entire 1996 session, in which \nthere were none confirmed; in all of 1997, when there were 7 confirmed; \nin all of 1999, when there were 7 confirmed; or in all of 2000, when \nthere were 8 confirmed. The Senate has now achieved more in fewer than \n6 full months for President Bush than Republicans used to allow the \nSenate to achieve in 4 of the 6 full years they were in control of the \nSenate when President Clinton was making judicial nominations. We are \nmoving two to three times faster for this President's nominees, despite \nthe fact that the current appellate court nominees are more \ncontroversial, divisive and less widely-supported than President \nClinton's appellate court nominees were.\n  If the Senate did not confirm another judicial nominee all year and \nsimply adjourned today, we would have treated President Bush more \nfairly and would have acted on more of his judicial nominees than \nRepublicans did for President Clinton in 1995-97 or the period 1996-99. \nIn addition, the vacancies on the Federal courts around the country are \nsignificantly lower than the 80 vacancies Republicans left at the end \nof 1997 or the 110 vacancies that Democrats inherited in the summer of \n2001. We continue well below the 67 vacancy level that Senator Hatch \nused to call ``full employment'' for the Federal judiciary. Indeed we \nhave reduced vacancies to their lowest level in the last 13 years. So \nwhile unemployment has continued to climb for Americans to 6.1 percent \nlast month, the Senate has helped lower the vacancy rate in Federal \ncourts to an historically low level that we have not witnessed in over \na decade. Of course, the Senate is not adjourning for the year and the \nJudiciary Committee continues to hold hearings for Bush judicial \nnominees at between two and four times as many as it did for President \nClinton's.\n  For those who are claiming that Democrats are blockading this \nPresident's judicial nominees, this is another example of how quickly \nand easily the Senate can act when we proceed cooperatively with \nconsensus nominees. The Senate's record fairly considered has been \noutstanding--especially when contrasted with the obstruction of \nPresident Clinton's moderate judicial nominees by Republicans between \n1996 and 2001.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nnominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations considered and confirmed en bloc are as follows:\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\n                             the judiciary\n\n       John A.

Mr. President, last night at about this time we passed \na Burma sanctions bill 97 to 1, which I hope sent a strong message to \nthe thugs who are running the country at the moment that someday--and \nhopefully someday soon--they will have to honor the results of the 1990 \nelection, won overwhelmingly by Aung San Suu Kyi and her party.\n\n       As I suspect the military junta may be trying to decipher \n     what took place in Washington yesterday, I thought I would \n     take a moment or two to help them out.\n\n  The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly condemned and sanctioned the State \nPeace and Development Council, SPDC, for its May 30 attack against Suu \nKyi and her supporters and for its continued repressive actions that \nviolate the human rights and dignity of the people of Burma.\n  I also had an opportunity to talk today to Secretary Colin Powell, \nwho is going out to Phnom Penh to the ASEAN Regional Forum next week, \nand I think they can anticipate a strong message from him when he is \nout in the region at that time.\n  Fifty-seven Senators cosponsored the legislation that passed last \nnight to impose an import ban, expand visa restrictions, and freeze \nSPDC assets in the United States. Ninety-seven Senators voted to \nrepudiate the actions of the Burmese junta.\n  This was a vote for freedom in Burma that demonstrated unequivocal \nsupport for Suu Kyi and all democrats in that country.\n  The generals in Rangoon should take note that a provision was \nincluded in the bill that guarantees that every year Burma will come up \nfor discussion and debate in Congress. Every single year, we will have \nan opportunity to take a look at the fate of freedom in that country.\n  It is my hope we will not need that opportunity. It is my hope that \nSuu Kyi and other democrats will be governing Burma and that the only \ndebate on the floor will be about the level of foreign assistance \nAmerica should provide to a newly free Burma.\n  If this hope is not realized, within a year we will again discuss the \npersistent rapes of minority girls and women, the use of child and \nforced labor, and the manufacturing and trafficking of narcotics.\n  If the junta continues its repressive rule, we will again examine the \nnumber of political prisoners languishing in Burmese jails, efforts \ntaken to counter an exploding HIV/AIDS infection rate, and \nopportunities to further democracy and the rule of law throughout the \ncountry.\n  If, however, American leadership translates into a full court press \non junta, we might be able to celebrate a new dawn for democracy for \nthe people of Burma.\n  The comments of Secretary of State Colin Powell in the Wall Street \nJournal today are both welcomed and promising.\n  As I indicated earlier, he is going to the ASEAN regional meeting \nnext week, and I think the regime in Burma is going to hear a good deal \nmore about the U.S. position on their behavior and activities.\n  He said this:\n       By attacking Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters, the \n     Burmese junta has finally and definitively rejected the \n     efforts of the outside world to bring Burma back into the \n     international community. Indeed, their refusal of the work of \n     Ambassador Razali and of the rights of Aung San Suu Kyi and \n     her supporters could not be clearer. Our response must be \n     equally clear if the thugs who now rule Burma are to \n     understand that their failure to restore democracy will only \n     bring more and more pressure against them and their \n     supporters.\n\n  Secretary Powell must work tirelessly to secure the release of Suu \nKyi and all other democrats who continue to be detained by the SPDC. \nU.N. Special Envoy Razali's brief meeting with her does not assuage my \nfears that she is under intense pressure or that her supporters \ncontinue to be tortured or killed. She and her supporters should be \nreleased immediately and unconditionally.\n  In the future, it might behoove Razali to temper his enthusiastic \ncomments to more accurately reflect the climate of fear in Burma. He \nfailed to secure Suu Kyi's release, and I am surprised that he did not \nsay more to condemn the outrageous actions of the thugs in Rangoon.\n  Let me close by thanking my colleagues--and their staffs--for their \nsupport of this legislation. I could ask for no better allies than \nSenators Feinstein and McCain on this issue, and I look forward to \ncontinue to work with them to free Suu Kyi and bring democracy to \nBurma. Senators Frist, Lugar, Biden, Baucus, Grassley, Hagel, and \nBrownback also deserve recognition for their support of freedom in \nBurma. The people of Burma will count on our support in the future--and \nwe should not, and must not, fail them.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of Secretary Powell's op-ed and an \neditorial from today's Baltimore Sun on Burma be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 12, 2003]\n\n                          Standing for Freedom\n\n\n                          get tough on rangoon\n\n                          (By Colin L. Powell)\n\n       United Nations Special Envoy Razali Ismail has just visited \n     Burma and was able to bring us news that Aung San Suu Kyi, a \n     Nobel Peace Prize winner and the leader of a peaceful \n     democratic party known as the National League for Democracy, \n     is well and unharmed. The thoughts and prayers of free people \n     everywhere have been with her these past two weeks. Our fears \n     for her current state of health are now somewhat lessened.\n       On May 30, her motorcade was attacked by thugs, and then \n     the thugs who run the Burmese government placed her under \n     ``protective custody.'' We can take comfort in the fact that \n     she is well. Unfortunately, the larger process that \n     Ambassador Razali and Aung San Suu Kyi have been pursuing--to \n     restore democracy in Burma--is failing despite their good \n     will and sincere efforts. It is time to reassess our policy \n     towards a military dictatorship that has repeatedly attacked \n     democracy and jailed its heroes.\n       There is little doubt on the facts. Aung San Suu Kyi's \n     party won an election in 1990 and since then has been denied \n     its place in Burmese politics. Her party has continued to \n     pursue a peaceful path, despite personal hardships and \n     lengthy periods of house arrest or imprisonment for her and \n     her followers. Hundreds of her supporters remain in prison, \n     despite some initial releases and promises by the junta to \n     release more. The party's offices have been closed and their \n     supporters persecuted. Ambassador Razali has pursued every \n     possible opening and worked earnestly to help Burma make a \n     peaceful transition to democracy. Despite initial statements \n     last year, the junta--which shamelessly calls itself the \n     State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)--has now refused \n     his efforts and betrayed its own promises.\n       At the end of last month, this rejection manifested itself \n     in violence. After the May\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\n     30 attack on Aung San Suu Kyi's convoy, we sent U.S. Embassy \n     officers to the scene to gather information. They reported \n     back that the attack was planned in advance. A series of \n     trucks followed her convoy to a remote location, blocked it \n     and then unloaded thugs to swarm with fury over the cars of \n     democracy supporters. The attackers were brutal and \n     organized; the victims were peaceful and defenseless. The \n     explanation by the Burmese military junta of what happened \n     doesn't hold water. The SPDC has not made a credible report \n     of how many people were killed and injured. It was clear to \n     our embassy officers that the members of the junta were \n     responsible for directing and producing this staged riot.\n       We have called for a full accounting of what happened that \n     day. We have called for Aung San Suu Kyi to be released from \n     confinement of any kind. We have called for the release of \n     the other leaders of the National League for Democracy who \n     were jailed by the SPDC before and after the attack. We have \n     called for the offices of the National League for \n     Democracy to be allowed to reopen. We are in touch with \n     other governments who are concerned about the fate of \n     democracy's leader and the fate of democracy in Burma to \n     encourage them, too, to pressure the SPDC.\n       The Bush administration agrees with members of Congress, \n     including Sen. Mitch McConnell, who has been a leading \n     advocate of democracy in Burma, that the time has come to \n     turn up the pressure on the SPDC.\n       Here's what we've done so far. The State Department has \n     already extended our visa restrictions to include all \n     officials of an organization related to the junta--the Union \n     Solidarity and Development Association--and the managers of \n     state-run enterprises so that they and their families can be \n     banned as well.\n       The United States already uses our voice and our vote \n     against loans to Burma from the World Bank and other \n     international financial institutions. The State Department \n     reports honestly and frankly on the crimes of the SPDC in our \n     reports on Human Rights, Trafficking in Persons, Drugs, and \n     International Religious Freedom. In all these areas, the \n     junta gets a failing grade. We also speak out frequently and \n     strongly in favor of the National League of Democracy, and \n     against the SPDC. I will press the case in Cambodia next week \n     when I meet with the leaders of Southeast Asia, despite their \n     traditional reticence to confront a member and neighbor of \n     their association, known as Asean.\n       Mr. McConnell has introduced the Burmese Freedom and \n     Democracy Act in the Senate; Reps. Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos \n     have introduced a similar bill in the House. We support the \n     goals and intent of the bills and are working with the \n     sponsors on an appropriate set of new steps. Those who follow \n     this issue will know that our support for legislation is in \n     fact a change in the position of this administration and \n     previous ones as well. Simply put, the attack on Ms. Suu \n     Kyi's convoy and the utter failure of the junta to accept \n     efforts at peaceful change cannot be the last word on the \n     matter. The junta that oppresses democracy inside Burma must \n     find that its actions will not be allowed to stand.\n       There are a number of measures that should now be taken, \n     many of them in the proposed legislations. It's time to \n     freeze the financial assets of the SPDC. It's time to ban \n     remittances to Burma so that the SPDC cannot benefit from the \n     foreign exchange. With legislation, we can, and should, place \n     restrictions on travel-related transactions that benefit the \n     SPDC and its supporters. We also should further limit \n     commerce with Burma which enriches the junta's generals. Of \n     course, we would need to ensure consistency with our World \n     Trade Organization and other international obligations. Any \n     legislation will need to be carefully crafted to take into \n     account our WTO obligations and the president's need for \n     waiver authority, but we should act now.\n       By attacking Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters, the \n     Burmese junta has finally and definitely rejected the efforts \n     of the outside world to bring Burma back into the \n     international community. Indeed, their refusal of the work of \n     Ambassador Razali and of the rights of Aung San Suu Kyi and \n     her supporters could not be clearer. Our response must be \n     equally clear if the thugs who now rule Burma are to \n     understand that their failure to restore democracy will only \n     bring more and more pressure against them and their \n     supporters.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, June 12, 2003]\n\n                        Time for Tyrants to Fear\n\n       A year ago, when the military junta illegally controlling \n     Manmar last released its democratically elected leader, Aung \n     San Suu Kyi, from house arrest, the generals promised a \n     dialogue aimed at national reconciliation.\n       True dialogue in the nation once known as Burma would lead \n     to a decided weakening, if not the total loss, of the \n     generals' power, so that hasn't happened.\n       And as of yesterday, Ms. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize \n     laureate, remained back in detention after a violent \n     government attack late last month on her and her supporters--\n     and even after a Untied Nations envoy spent days trying to \n     gain her release.\n       Given that Myanmar's military also has a long record of \n     slave labor and drug trafficking, what more do responsible \n     nations need to now get tougher with this regime?\n       With that in mind, these days are critical--starting with \n     passage late yesterday of a U.S. senate bill to ban imports \n     from Myanmar, seize the regime leaders' U.S. assets and bar \n     U.S. visas for them.\n       This ban should give greater weight to heightened U.S. \n     diplomatic effort to isolate these despots.\n       Virtually all Senate leaders from both parties, led by \n     Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell and California Democrat \n     Dianne Feinstein, supported the ban. Maryland Sens. Barbara \n     A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes were among its many co-\n     signers, Mr. Sarbanes having signed on just yesterday after \n     activists complained he hadn't.\n       A House subcommittee has approved a similar bill. \n     Everything possible should be done to see that this ban--\n     affecting a quarter of Myanmar's exports, worth about $350 \n     million a year--becomes law soon.\n       But even just Senate passage of the ban gives Secretary of \n     State Colin L. Powell a bigger stick when he attends a \n     meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \n     in Cambodia next week--a gathering at which the United States \n     needs to lean even harder on Thailand and Japan to back off \n     aiding this terrible regime.\n       Time is well past for allowing Myanmar's generals to \n     enslave their own people. As Senator McConnell said yesterday \n     in calling for the import ban vote: ``It's time for tyrants \n     to fear in Burma.''\n       The import ban likely won't bring down these generals in \n     itself. But it provides a key tool in building an effective \n     worldwide movement--with roles for ASEAN, the European Union \n     and the United Nations--to end their illegal reign.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, also the Travel Goods Association of \nAmerica today came out for the legislation and for an import ban as \nwell. This is an important organization related to this whole issue of \nimport restrictions--an organization that potentially would benefit \nfrom continuing imports from Burma. But they said they don't want to \nmake money off of this regime. They, too, have announced their support \nfor a ban today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a press release indicating their support \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nTGA Announces Support for A Total Ban On U.S. Travel Goods Imports From \n         Burma--Applauds Passage of Legislation by U.S. Senate\n\n       Princeton, NJ, June 12, 2003.--Travel Goods Association \n     (TGA) President Anne L. DeCicco announced today that, due to \n     the on-going cruel and repressive nature of the ruling regime \n     in Burma, TGA--the national trade association of the travel \n     goods industry (luggage, handbags, briefcases, backpacks, \n     flatgoods, etc.)--has called for an immediate and total ban \n     on U.S. travel goods imports from that nation (SEE POLICY \n     STATEMENT BELOW). Furthermore, TGA appauds Rep. Tom Lantos \n     (D-CA) and Rep. Peter King (R-NY), and Diane Feinstein (D-CA) \n     and their colleagues in both the House and Senate, for \n     introducing The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 \n     into both houses of the United States Congress. The bills \n     call for a ban on all imports from Burma until it can be \n     determined that the ruling Burmese government has made \n     substantial and measurable progress to end its human rights \n     abuses. The legislation passed the Senate on June 11, 2003 in \n     a 97-1 vote.\n       ``The government of Burma continues to abuse its citizens \n     through force and intimidation, and refuses to respect the \n     basic human rights of its people. TGA believes this \n     unacceptable behavior should be met with condemnation from \n     not only the international public community, but from private \n     industry as well,'' said DeCicco.\n       According to the U.S. government's ``2002 Country Report on \n     Human Rights Practices'' on Burma, the Burmese government has \n\n     ``. . . continued to restrict workers rights, ban unions, and \n     use forced labor for public works and for the support of \n     military garrisons. Other forced labor, including child \n     labor, remain a serious problem despite recent ordinances \n     outlawing the practice.''\n       Additionally, in 2000, the International Labor Organization \n     (ILO)--for the first time in its history--called on all ILO \n     members to impose sanctions on Burma.\n       ``TGA is pleased to learn that Congress, led by the U.S. \n     Senate's historic vote on Wednesday, is taking an important \n     step towards ending the human rights crisis that is happening \n     in Burma today. We hope that Congress' efforts are only the \n     first step towards international condemnation and sanctions \n     on Burma through the United Nations,'' commented TGA Chairman \n     Tom Sandler of Samsonite Corporation. He continued, ``TGA, \n     through its trade policy, promotes best practices to ensure \n     that travel goods are produced in a socially responsible \n     manner by encouraging its members to operate under programs \n     that are compliant with applicable labor laws. Thus, the \n     association and its membership fully support the legislation \n     introduced by Reps. Lantos and King, as well as Senators \n     McConnell and Feinstein and calls upon the U.S. House of \n     Representatives to follow the Senate's lead in the swift and \n     immediate passage of such important legislation.''\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\n       The necessity for Congressional action is highlighted by \n     the recent attacks of the country's ruling military junta on \n     Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma's pro-\n     democracy opposition, and her supporters. These attacks \n     illustrate that Burma's regime has grown more oppressive than \n     ever, despite worldwide condemnation.\n       TGA International Committee Chairman Michael Korchmar of \n     the Leather Specialty Company, noted that, ``TGA also wants \n     to recognize and applaud the efforts of its own members that \n     have already imposed bans on U.S. imports of Burmese travel \n     goods from their own firms. Thanks in large part to the \n     efforts of TGA members, U.S. imports of travel goods from \n     Burma fell an incredible 74 percent between 2001 and 2002.'' \n     Furthermore, TGA applauds the efforts of numerous U.S. and \n     international governmental and non-governmental organizations \n     to force Burma to respect the basic human rights of its \n     citizens.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Travel Goods Association,\n\n                                     Princeton, NJ, June 12, 2003.\n\n                Policy Statement on Burma, June 12, 2003\n\n       The Travel Goods Association (TGA)--the national trade \n     association of the travel goods (luggage, briefcases, \n     handbags, backpacks, flatgoods) industry--hereby expresses \n     its strong support for a full and immediate ban on U.S. \n     travel goods imports from Burma and strongly encourages the \n     U.S. government to:\n       Impose an immediate and total ban on U.S. imports of travel \n     goods from Burma;\n       Maintain this ban until Burma's rulers demonstrate that \n     they respect and enforce basic human and labor rights for its \n     own citizens;\n       Continue both unilaterally and through multilateral \n     organizations to exert diplomatic, economic, and political \n     pressure on Burma to respect and enforce basic human rights \n     for its own citizens; and\n       Sign into law current legislation in Congress to impose \n     such sanctions.\n       The TGA supports a U.S. ban on Burmese travel goods because \n     Burma's military regime has:\n       Consistently rejected international demands to stop \n     government-sanctioned forced and child labor practices \n     against its own people;\n       According to the U.S. government's ``2002 Country Report on \n     Human Rights Practices'' on Burma, ``. . . continued to \n     restrict worker rights, ban unions, and used forced labor for \n     public works and for the support of military garrisons. Other \n     forced labor, including forced child labor remained a serious \n     problem, despite recent ordinances outlawing the practice;'' \n     and\n       Repeatedly failed to comply with internationally recognized \n     conventions on labor, including forced and child labor. Due \n     to its ``widespread and systematic'' use of forced labor, the \n     International Labor Organization (ILO) in 2000, for the first \n     time in its history, called on all ILO members to impose \n     sanctions on Burma.\n       Through its trade policy, TGA:\n       ``Promotes best practices to ensure that goods are produced \n     in a socially responsible manner,'' by ``Encouraging TGA \n     members to operate under programs that foster socially \n     responsible production practices compliant with applicable \n     labor and environmental laws and regulations; Encouraging the \n     United States, other governments and foreign trade \n     associations to recognize and support programs designed to \n     achieve these goals; and Pursuing policies that encourage \n     development of human rights and democratic values in \n     countries in which TGA members conduct business and \n     discourage trade with countries that promote or support \n     terrorism.''\n       Strongly supports the travel goods industry's use of \n     effective social responsibility programs;\n       Applauds and supports the efforts of TGA member companies \n     that have already imposed bans on U.S. imports of Burmese \n     travel goods for their own firms;\n       Recognizes and applauds the efforts of numerous U.S. and \n     international governmental and nongovernmental organizations \n     to force Burma to respect the basic human rights of its \n     citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7825-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, although our attention today is focused on \nthe persistent attacks against U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq and the \nescalation of the bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians, it is \nimperative that we not ignore the challenges we continue to face in \nAfghanistan.\n  In southeast Afghanistan, U.S. soldiers continue to battle with the \nremnants of al-Qaida and the Taliban, whose fighters have managed to \nregroup across the border inside Pakistan. Despite hundreds of millions \nof dollars in U.S. aid, the national impact has been difficult for many \nAfghans to see. Afghanistan is such a large, inaccessible, impoverished \ncountry that it will take many billions of dollars over many years to \nrecover from decades of war, and that will be possible only if adequate \nsecurity exists to implement these programs. Security will remain \nelusive as long as political and economic power outside of Kabul \ncontinues to be wielded by regional warlords.\n  An article by Carlotta Gall in yesterday's New York Times provides a \nsobering description of the continuing challenges in Afghanistan. I \nhope officials at USAID, the State Department, the Defense Department, \nand OMB took the time to read it. As with so many aid programs, we \noften focus on the trees and lose sight of the forest. We can point to \nlots of small success stories--new well dug here, a bridge repaired \nthere, more girls enrolled in school. But when you step back the \npicture looks very different, as Ms. Gall's article shows.\n  We and our Allies have major stakes in Afghanistan's future, and I am \nconfident that we will remain engaged. But let's do the job that needs \nto be done, not half measures. Without a more effective strategy to \nenhance security, strengthen the central government and support civil \nsociety, we will fall far short of our goals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Gall's June 11, 2003, article in the \nNew York Times entitled ``In Warlord Land, Democracy Tries Baby Steps'' \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              In Warlord Land, Democracy Tries Baby Steps\n\n       KABUL, Afghanistan, June 10.--In the hushed, rose-filled \n     gardens of the royal palace in Kabul, life seems calm and \n     good. Under the chandeliers of the meeting hall upstairs, \n     President Hamid Karzai, just back from a trip to Britain and \n     a meeting with the queen, manages to combine an expression of \n     condolence for German peacekeepers killed in a suicide bomb \n     attack in the capital Saturday with an upbeat assessment of \n     the situation in his country.\n       The heavily armed American bodyguards who stand in the \n     gardens and by the windows of the palace have become like the \n     wallpaper, so much are they part of the scene now. The \n     Taliban threat in the south and southeast, the car bomber who \n     drove this week right into the city, the persistent factional \n     fighting in the north of the country, all seem far away.\n       But in the last few months there has been a crisis of \n     confidence in Afghanistan, a sense that the security \n     situation may be spiraling downward and that the rise of \n     regional warlords may be more than a temporary phenomenon. \n     Attacks on peacekeepers and aid workers are increasing. After \n     more than a year of waiting patiently for results, people \n     here are increasingly asking: are the Americans getting it \n     right?\n       Today, as American forces in Iraq struggle to establish \n     order, as one or two American soldiers seem to fall every \n     day, it seems likely to be a question the United States will \n     soon face in Iraq as well.\n       Even the most pessimistic Afghanistan watchers acknowledge \n     that this time is different from the sliding chaos of the \n     early 1990's. The Americans are not going to turn their back \n     on Afghanistan the way they did then, and the way they did in \n     Iraq after the Persian Gulf war in 1991. The Americans are \n     here and, by all accounts and appearances, here to stay.\n       But there is only a year left for Mr. Karzai and his \n     American backers to get things right before his term is up. \n     The Bonn process, which set up the interim administration led \n     by Mr. Karzai, lays out a rapid program for a new \n     constitution to be drawn up and approved by a grand assembly \n     this October, and for national elections to be held next \n     June.\n       For Afghanistan, one key to establishing order is the \n     disarmament of the factional armies around the country. The \n     United Nations and Afghanistan's new Human Rights Commission \n     have already stressed that if the much delayed disarmament \n     and demobilization program does not go ahead, the drafting of \n     the constitution and national elections could be thrown into \n     jeopardy.\n       ``There is a real, but still avoidable, risk that the Bonn \n     process will stall if security is not extended to the \n     regions, and that Afghans will lose confidence in the central \n     government if it cannot protect them,'' the United Nations \n     special representative to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, told \n     the Security Council in New York last month.\n       Another difficulty is that the allies are tackling the \n     problems in piecemeal fashion, a strategy that will only \n     advance the country by tiny steps, critics say.\n       United States diplomats and aid officials like to draw \n     attention to a large wall map in their embassy that is \n     covered in a ``blizzard'' of yellow Post-it stickers marking \n     every single project under way in the country. They\n\n[[Page S7826]]\n\n     trumpet the provincial reconstruction teams, United States \n     military-civil affairs teams that are trying to win hearts \n     and minds in the provinces by building schools, or \n     latrines for schools. And they talk of the program to \n     train the Afghan National Army, which should produce a \n     9,000-member force by next year.\n       But the national impact of all of this is virtually nil. As \n     one director of a donor agency, which completed 160 \n     construction projects last year, said, ``The dimension of the \n     destruction is such that people don't see it.''\n       Compared with the enormous military-political Gordian knot \n     that needs to be cut, the attention to human needs can only \n     be described as paltry, even irrelevant.\n       Little has been done to disarm and dismantle the power \n     bases of the factions, and as time goes on the armed men who \n     rule the districts, regions and whole provinces are becoming \n     more and more entrenched and increasingly powerful \n     economically. They are likely to dominate politics during the \n     next year, which could fatally erode all public trust in the \n     process and the results. The country could end up being ruled \n     by a mixture of drug lords and fundamentalist mujahedeen--in \n     other words, people not much different from the Taliban.\n       Everyone has a different idea of what the United States \n     should be doing, but most Afghans and Westerners working here \n     agree that there are two basic requirements for nation-\n     building that the United States cannot afford to ignore--\n     providing security and establishing a functioning political \n     system. They are interconnected, most here agree; in fact, it \n     is impossible to have one without the other.\n       Only a legitimate, national political system will have the \n     authority to establish a police and justice system with the \n     necessary powers to establish real security. Without real \n     security, there can be no widespread development; American \n     soldiers cannot stand on every street corner, or monitor \n     every business transaction and tax collection.\n       The problem here, as in Iraq, is that the American military \n     is still running the show and views Afghanistan through the \n     prism of the campaign against terrorism and not according to \n     the country's political and economic demands. But if \n     Afghanistan is to seize the chance this year to start \n     becoming a stable and prosperous society, there is much, much \n     more to be done.\n       Many are saying that Washington needs to exert more \n     political pressure--on Mr. Karzai to act more decisively on \n     this government to work more proactively, on the police \n     nationwide to ensure law and order, on commanders to disarm, \n     on ministers to reform their ministries and even out the \n     balance of power, on warlords to give up their fiefs and join \n     the government, on Pakistan to stop supporting the Taliban \n     and other opponents of the Bonn process. The list goes on.\n       All those steps would be a help. But fundamentally, the \n     Americans need to create an atmosphere in which democratic \n     politics can take hold. That means doing more than attending \n     to human needs and offering military training. It means, in \n     the view of many Western officials here and prominent \n     Afghans, putting pressure on the warlords, disarming them and \n     cutting their power bases, leveling the political playing \n     field so that the coming elections are free and fair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7826-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Champaign, \nIL. On December 16, 2001, a Muslim Tunisian-American university student \nwas beaten by a mob of several men. Participants in the attack \nrestrained the victim's brother and his friends to prevent them from \ncoming to his aid. The student was beaten by more than six of the men, \none of whom broke his nose with a blunt object.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7826-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7826-S7827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE INDICTMENT OF CHARLES TAYLOR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see that the senior Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, is on the floor. Knowing of his longstanding \ninterest in Sierra Leone, I wonder if he wants to speak briefly about \nthe indictment last week of Charles Taylor by the Special Court for \nSierra Leone.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Vermont. He is correct about my \nlongstanding interest in Sierra Leone. With respect to the Special \nCourt, I am well aware of the events of the past week, where the \nProsecutor of the Court, David Crane, unsealed an indictment for \nCharles Taylor, while Mr. Taylor was in Ghana.\n  Unfortunately, the international community did not act in time and \nMr. Taylor was able to escape to Liberia. In doing so, the world missed \na great opportunity to bring to justice one of the world's most \nnotorious war criminals and advance the cause of international justice.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with the Senator from New Hampshire. I spoke about \nthis subject last week. Since then, it has come to my attention that \nsome officials in the State Department and other governments are upset \nat Mr. Crane for the timing of this indictment, as they saw it as \ndisruptive to the peace talks in West Africa.\n  While I can appreciate those concerns, I agree with one of Mr. \nCrane's statements on this issue, which I will read:\n\n     [T]he timing of this announcement was carefully considered in \n     light of the important peace process begun this week. To \n     ensure the legitimacy of these negotiations, it is imperative \n     that the attendees know they are dealing with an indicted war \n     criminal. These negotiations can still move forward, but they \n     must do so without the involvement of this indictee. The \n     evidence upon which this indictment was approved raises \n     serious questions about Taylor's suitability to be a \n     guarantor of any deal, let alone a peace agreement.\n\n  I was wondering if Senator Gregg had any thoughts on this issue.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree with Mr. Crane's statement about the indictment of \nCharles Taylor. As much as anyone, I want to bring peace and prosperity \nto West Africa. But, Mr. Crane has a mandate to bring to justice those \nmost responsible for the atrocities committed in Sierra Leone, and the \ntrail led to Charles Taylor. Not indicting Mr. Taylor would have been \noutrageous. Justice would not have been served.\n  I also want to read from a Washington Post editorial, dated June 5, \n2003, that summarizes the issue. It said, and I am quoting:\n\n       After years of afflicting his own country with the worst \n     kind of brutality and aiding and abetting a cruel civil war \n     in neighboring Sierra Leone, Mr. Taylor is now being pressed \n     on his own soil by rebel movements bent on driving him from \n     power. That he was out of the country this week was no \n     accident. The purpose of his trip to Ghana, organized by the \n     Economic Community of West Africa and a United Nations \n     contact group that includes the United States, was to join \n     peace talks with Liberian opposition groups. Military and \n     political weaknesses, not strength, drove him from his haven \n     in Liberia to the Ghana peace parley. Fear of international \n     justice is what has sent him scurrying back home. . . ..The \n     idea of Mr. Taylor working out an eleventh-hour agreement \n     that restores peace and stability to Liberia strikes many \n     human rights observers as ludicrous given both his record of \n     broken pledges and his overwhelming contribution to that \n     country's misery. Faced with tightening international \n     opposition, he now says he will consider stepping aside if \n     that will bring peace. He's now even making noises about \n     supporting a transitional government of national unity while \n     remaining on the sidelines. Mr. Taylor, as usual, has it all \n     wrong. He is in no position to guarantee any deal, let alone \n     a peace agreement, as Mr. Crane said yesterday. Indicted as a \n     war criminal, Charles Taylor today is nothing more than a \n     wanted man.\n\n  In short, I agree with the Post's editorial and commend Mr. Crane for \ntaking decisive action to indict Charles Taylor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I share Senator Gregg's sentiments. I would also point out \nthat Mr. Crane's office unsealed the indictment in a responsible way. \nAccording to information I received, the Special Court's chief of \nsecurity was instructed to inform all organizations with personnel in \nLiberia, including the U.S. Embassy, Freetown, that ``within 24 hours \nthe Special Court was going to take an action that could possibly \ndestabilize Monrovia.'' These actions were undertaken to ensure that \nall government and humanitarian personnel had notice to withdraw or \nstay home.\n  This effectively ``unsealed'' the indictment to governments and \nhumanitarian organizations without tipping Mr. Taylor off. In addition, \n3 hours before the press conference and public announcement, and \nminutes after the Court had confirmation that Ghanaian authorities were \nserved with the arrest\n\n[[Page S7827]]\n\nwarrant for Mr. Taylor, private letters were hand-delivered to all \nrepresentatives of a number of key governments in Freetown.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator share my view that the United States and \nother members of the international community should continue to \nstrongly support the Special Court and vigorously pursue Mr. Taylor and \nother indicted war criminals?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes. In fact, I am going to work with Senator McConnell, \nwith the goal of providing $2 million in the fiscal year 2004 foreign \noperations bill for additional support to the Court.\n  Mr. GREGG. I support the efforts of the Senator from Vermont and \nthank him for discussing this issue with me.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. In closing, I \nwould just add that there have been recent reports of a possible \n``deal'' with Mr. Taylor under which he would go into exile in exchange \nfor immunity from the Court.

Mr. President, I rise today with great sadness and \ntremendous gratitude to honor the life of yet another brave Hoosier \nkilled in action in Iraq. Sgt. Duane Rios of Griffith, IN was 25 years \nold. On Saturday, April 5, 2003, while serving as an engineer with the \n1st Marine Expeditionary Force, Duane was mortally wounded. Duane had \nreached Eastern Baghdad, where he was killed in a firefight. Sgt. Rios \nwas a brave American who left behind family, friends and the comforts \nof home to defend the principles of democracy and freedom that we all \nenjoy.\n  Duane Rios is the fourth Hoosier to be killed while bravely serving \nour Nation in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today, I mourn along with \nDuane's family, friends, fellow Marines and community. While all are \nvery proud of Duane, there is also a tremendous sense of loss. Duane's \nlife was too short, yet he will always be remembered for his heroism \nand dedication to his country. Such a life shall serve as an \ninspiration to all as we continue to fight for the liberation of Iraq.\n  Duane Rios was a charismatic and friendly person who never passed \nsomeone without smiling and saying hello. Duane attended Griffith High \nSchool, graduating in 1996. After graduation he married his high school \nsweetheart, Erica. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him. It \nwas with great pride that he left for Iraq, prepared to do his duty and \nwas willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, if fate dictated, for a \ncountry he loved dearly.\n  President Chester Arthur once said: ``Men may die, but the fabrics of \nfree institutions remain unshaken.'' These words force us to see the \nlarger picture and give some solace as we mourn the loss of Duane Rios \nand honor the sacrifice he made for America and for all humanity.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Duane Rios in the official \nrecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nDuane's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who said: \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn the loss of such \nyoung lives, and may God bless the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7827-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS.

Mr. President, on May 29, 2003, the National Trust \nfor Historic Preservation named Bathhouse Row in Hot Springs National \nPark, AR, one of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.\n  I come to the floor today to applaud the National Trust's efforts to \npreserve these bathhouses. I also want to bring the dire condition of \nthese historic sites to the Senate's attention and urge my colleagues \nto support my and Senator Lincoln's work to provide critical funding \nthis year to save the eight bathhouses in Hot Springs.\n  During the early 1900s, a variety of bathhouses were built in Hot \nSprings, AR, to accommodate the thousands of travelers who sought the \ncurative waters from 47 natural thermal springs. These bathhouses were \nelaborately constructed with remarkable architectural design, including \nstained-glass skylights and patterned mosaic floors and walls. The \nbathhouse provided restful baths and services--some peculiar and \nbizarre--that inspired the resort nickname ``The American Spa.'' In \nshort, Bathhouse Row shaped America's ``Golden Age of Bathing'' and was \ninternationally renowned, with the likes of Babe Ruth and the infamous \nAl Capone visiting the resort.\n  Arkansans have long known what the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation has announced to the Nation: that these one-of-a-kind \nhistoric treasures are on the verge of disappearing due to neglect. \nThese amazing buildings are literally falling apart. But the story for \nthe bathhouses doesn't have to end there. We have a plan that works for \nboth preservationists and budget hawks. Reasonable Federal investment \ninto reconditioning these buildings will be leveraged by private \nleasing agreements. Once restored, private ventures will breathe new \nlife and usher a new generation of use into Bathhouse Row for all \nAmericans to enjoy.\n  Lastly, I think that it is important to note that Congress has \nrecognized the national importance of Hot Springs for 171 years. On \nApril 20, 1832, the Congress had the foresight to establish Hot Springs \nReservation--making it the oldest park currently in the National Park \nSystem. On March 4, 1921, Congress changed the name to Hot Springs \nNational Park.\n  Today, Congress has the opportunity to act again in support of Hot \nSprings. I believe that our predecessors in Congress intended for the \npark to protect Bathhouse Row and the unique glimpse that it provides \ninto our Nation's social and historic past.\n  I urge my colleagues to support funding in the fiscal year 2004 \nInterior appropriations bill for Bathhouse Row in Hot Springs National \nPark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7827-4", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7827-S7828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SALUTING LOUISIANA FAITH IN ACTION GRANTEES\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am proud to serve as ranking \nmember of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, a position which \nallows me to focus on issues important to older Americans. One of the \nmost critical concerns of our Nation's seniors is the need for long-\nterm care services. And though the lack of available long-term care \nservice is a substantial problem today, the demand for long-term care \nservices will overwhelm an already-strained system as our Nation's 77 \nmillion baby boomers age.\n  Family caregivers are the cornerstone of our long-term care system, \nproviding 80 percent of all long-term care in this country. Most older \nand disabled Americans prefer to remain in their own homes or in the \ncommunity and many do so, thanks to the support and love of family \ncaregivers. But we all know that family caregivers cannot provide \naround-the-clock care--many have jobs and children to raise. Caregiving \nis stressful and it places heavy emotional, physical and financial \nburdens on caregivers. Research shows that caregivers need a variety of \nservices to support them in their caregiving roles. One innovative and \nvaluable service to family caregivers is the ``Faith in Action'' \nprogram sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\n[[Page S7828]]\n\n  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, one of our Nation's leading \nphilanthropic health care organizations, has been supporting creative \nprograms for the delivery of health care for many years. Their Faith in \nAction program is a faith-based initiative which enables elderly and \ndisabled individuals to continue to live in their homes with the \nsupport of coordinated efforts between interfaith coalitions and social \nservice agencies including senior centers, parish councils on aging, \narea agencies on aging, and hospitals.\n  The Faith in Action program provides grant money to help these groups \nprovide services, including organizing outreach to the homebound; \ntraining group leaders who oversee outreach ministries; locating \nhomebound people who have lost touch with their communities; recruiting \nvolunteers from church congregations and communities; connecting with \nlocal medical and social services; and providing emotional support \nservices to community members. All of these organizations share a \ncommon goal--to provide long-term care to their neighbors in need.\n  Next week, the 14 Faith in Action grantees in Louisiana and \ninterested faith and community leaders will join me in New Orleans for \nan event where we will honor the current grantees and volunteers and \nencourage other interested groups and individuals to become Faith in \nAction grantees. Together they can use their expertise and energy to \nmake a real difference in the lives of Louisiana seniors and disabled \npersons.\n  Mr. President, today I want to recognize these 14 existing grantees \nin Louisiana: Rapides Station Community Ministries, Inc., The Shepherd \nCenter, Inter-Faith Caregivers of the Greater Baton Rouge Federation of \nChurches & Synagogues, The Mental Health Association of Louisiana, \nFaith in Action of Acadiana, Love Inc., of Acadiana, Volunteers of \nAmerica Inc., Boys & Girls Club of Minden, Inc., Alzheimer's Disease \nand Related Disorders Association Northeast/Central Louisiana Chapter, \nG.T. Consultants Services, Inc., St. Francis Medical Center, Uptown \nArea Senior Adult Ministry, Inc., H.O.P.E. Ministry, Inc., and \nShreveport-Bossier Community Renewal Inc.\n  Thanks to their contribution to their communities, these grantees \nhave enabled over 1100 elderly and disabled persons in Louisiana to \nremain at home. Keeping families together and allowing our seniors and \ndisabled persons to live independently saves money, improves quality of \nlife and strengthens our communities. Again, I applaud the Louisiana \nFaith in Action grantees, community partners and volunteers for their \ncontribution to Louisiana families and to broadening long-term care \noptions for the people of Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7828-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ON THE RETIREMENT OF MR. ADRIAN DELL ROBERTS\n\n Mrs. Boxer. Mr. President. I rise to recognize the life work \nof Mr. Adrian Dell Roberts as he retires from Riverside Unified School \nDistrict after more than 38 years of dedicated service, leaving a \nlegacy of community-building and a belief in the potential of young \npeople.\n  Dell Roberts' ability to promote student safety, teamwork, and self-\nconfidence has been apparent at every stage of his career with \nRiverside Unified School District; starting with his initial part-time \nposition coaching track and football at Riverside Polytechnic High \nSchool in 1965, and culminating with his role as Administrative \nAssistant for Campus and Community Services. He also served as an \nadministrative aid and assistant principal in charge of discipline at \nRiverside Polytechnic High School.\n  As Administrative Assistant for Campus and Community Services, Mr. \nRoberts has worked to identify and meet the needs of Riverside's youth. \nHe has done much to help students and staff understand the diverse \ncultural values of the students in the district. Under his leadership, \nmulti-cultural councils were established at high schools and middle \nschools, facilitating peaceful group problem solving. He also played a \nleading role in the successful formation of the Black Student Union at \nRiverside Polytechnic High School and is the founder and coordinator of \nthe statewide Black Student Union.\n  In addition to his contributions on campus, Mr. Roberts has lent his \ninvolvement and leadership to organizations that work to improve the \nlives of young people and provide enriching educational and \nrecreational resources to the Riverside community. Many, many students \nhave had opportunities that would not have been available to them \nwithout Mr. Roberts' hard work to expand their horizons and perceptions \nof their own potentials.\n  Mr. Roberts' impressive accomplishments and affiliations are too \nnumerous to mention in their entirety, but we can reflect on the \nimportant underlying beliefs that have guided his work. A portion of \nMr. Roberts' biography includes his statement that he `` . . . has \nfaith in our youth because they are our present as well as our \nfuture.'' Indeed, Mr. Roberts' ability to reach out in friendship and \nsupport and to inspire respect between individuals and groups has \nenriched the lives of countless young people. I invite all of my \ncolleagues to join me in commending Dell Roberts for his years of \nloving work for the academic and personal advancement of our \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7828-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7828-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommunities.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7828-4", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON ALL FEDERAL DRUG AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT, PREVENTION, \n                EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS--PM 39\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 2202 of Public Law 107-273, I hereby transmit \na report prepared by my Administration detailing the findings of a \ncomprehensive review of all Federal drug and substance abuse treatment, \nprevention, education, and research programs.

A bill to provide for homeland security grand coordination \nand simplification, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act, to streamline and \nstrengthen the way we help our States, communities, and first \nresponders protect our homeland. I am pleased to be joined by a number \nof my colleagues including Senators Carper, Rockefeller, Voinovich, \nFeingold, Sununu, Coleman, Pryor, Allard, and Akaka.\n  Last year, the Senate spent nearly three months on the Homeland \nSecurity Act, yet the law contains virtually no guidance on how the \nDepartment is to assist State and local governments with their homeland \nsecurity needs. In fact, the 187-page Homeland Security Act mentions \nthe issue of grants to first responders in but a single paragraph. As a \nresult, the Department of Homeland Security currently allocates \nbillions of dollars of grant funds according to formulas borrowed from \nthe USA Patriot Act. The Homeland Security Act left the decisions on \nhow Federal dollars should be spent or how much money should be \nallocated for another day. Today is that day.\n  Much of the burden for homeland security has fallen on the shoulders \nof State and local officials across America, especially our first \nresponders--the firefighters, police officers and ambulance crews on \nthe front lines. Over the past months, the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs has listened to them describe the challenges associated with \nconstructing effective homeland security strategies. We have also \nlistened to State and local officials as well as Department of Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Tom Ridge. This series of three hearings looked at \nthe issues from a variety of perspectives and helped shape the \nlegislation we introduce today.\n  At our first hearing, we heard from first responders: our \nfirefighters, law enforcement officials, and emergency medical \ntechnicians, who discussed the challenges they face protecting our \ncommunities.\n  Arlington Fire Chief Ed Plaugher, the incident commander at the \nPentagon on September 11, told the Committee that he had received \nlittle homeland security funding since 9-11. Chief Paugher also \nunderscored the gaps in the homeland security planning process. Many \nlaw enforcement officials shared Chief Plaughter's concerns. Portland, \nME, Police Chief Mike Chitwood, for example, expressed his frustrations \nabout the roadblocks to accessing Federal funding and the lack of \ncoordination by Federal agencies with local jurisdictions.\n  Secretary Ridge testified at our second hearing. He discussed the \nongoing challenges involved in providing Federal resources to States, \ncommunities and first responders. He also outlined ways we can improve \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of homeland security grant programs to \nhelp first responders get the resources they need.\n  Secretary Ridge's comments underscored the need to improve the way \nthe Department of Homeland Security's first responder grant programs \nare organized within the Department, and the way the Department \ndistributes these grants.\n  The Committee's third hearing featured State and local officials who \nexpressed their support for more flexibility, coordination, and \nsimplification of Federal homeland security grant programs.\n  Maine's emergency manager, Art Cleaves, said the current maze of \nhomeland security programs has caused so much paperwork that States may \nbe forced to hire additional staff just to deal with a multiplicity of \nforms and planning documents.\n  Other witnesses, including Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, \noutlined the need for coordinating homeland security funding across the \nFederal Government. Their comments underscored how communities can \naccess funding for interoperable communications equipment through six \ndifferent Federal programs, including the FIRE Act, COPS, two \nDepartment of Health and Human Services' bio-terrorism grant programs, \nFEMA's Emergency Management Performance Account, and ODP's State \nhomeland security grant program. Despite the unified goals of these \ngrants--to purchase interoperable equipment--Federal agencies are under \nno requirement to coordinate their efforts.\n  While State and local officials agreed on the need to coordinate \nprograms and make it easier to apply for grants, Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick \nand Governor Romney commented on the differences between States and \nlocalities regarding how best to allocate funds, through States or \ndirectly to the local level.\n  I am pleased that these hearings have helped to build a consensus on \nthis issue. Yesterday, I received a letter from State and local \norganizations including the National League of Cities, the National \nAssociation of Counties, and the National Governors Association, which \nhave come together in support of our approach, to provide funds through \nStates, but to require that eighty percent be passed through to the \nlocal level.\n  Our legislation will provide a map that will better connect our \nfront-line protectors with the funding they need. It will eliminate \nduplicative homeland security planning requirements; make it easier to \napply for grants; coordinate the many grant programs that provide \nhomeland security funds; and promote a community-based approach to \nhomeland security funding. I would like to briefly describe the \napproach we have taken.\n  The first provision of our legislation would promote the same kind of \ncoordination among Federal agencies that we require of our States and \nlocalities. It would require Federal agencies to build a clear, well-\nmarked path that would lead our first responders to the funding that \nenables them to do what they do best: prepare for and respond to \nemergencies.\n  Second, the legislation would coordinate government-wide homeland \nsecurity funding by promoting one-stop-shopping for homeland security \nfunding opportunities. It would establish an information clearinghouse \nto assist first responders and State and local governments in accessing \nhomeland security grant information and other resources within the new \ndepartment. The clearinghouse would improve access to homeland security \ngrant information, coordinate technical assistance for vulnerability \nand threat assessments, provide information regarding homeland security \nbest practices, and compile information regarding homeland security \nequipment purchased with Federal funds.\n  The legislation also recognizes the importance of building on \nexisting successful programs, such as the FIRE Act, which provides \nfunding directly to fire departments for equipment and training on a \ncompetitive, peer reviewed basis. It would allow the FIRE Act to \ncontinue to be administered in its current form, but would coordinate \nits activities with other Federal programs. For example, it would make \nsure that two neighboring jurisdictions receiving funding from the FIRE \nAct are aware of industry standards regarding the interoperability of \ncommunications equipment.\n  The third provision of our legislation would strengthen the Office \nfor Domestic Preparedness's State Homeland Security Grant Program by \nsimplifying the grant process, promoting more local input in homeland \nsecurity funding, and promoting more flexibility in the use of funds.\n  The lack of guidance in the Homeland Security Act has forced State \nand local governments and first responders to engage in a 12-step \nodyssey to obtain funding from ODP's State homeland security grant \nprogram. And this program is just one of several homeland security \ngrant programs to which a State, locality, police, or fire department \ncan apply.\n  The legislation distills the homeland security grant process from \ntwelve steps to two. First, State and local governments and emergency \nresponders will develop a three-year homeland security plan that \noutlines vulnerabilities and capabilities, and a process for allocating \nresources to meet State and local needs. This plan will also require \nthe development of\n\n[[Page S7835]]\n\nmeasurable goals and objectives, such as increasing the number of local \njurisdictions participating in local and statewide exercises. Second, \nStates and communities will apply for funds based on this plan, which \nthey can revise each year pending approval from the Secretary.\n  This legislation would ensure that local government officials and \nfirst responders have a louder voice in the homeland security planning \nprocess and can access homeland security dollars and equipment in an \nefficient manner. It would also require that eighty percent of these \nresources reach the local level within sixty days of the grant \nallocation.\n  When I met with the Maine fire chiefs, they expressed concerns about \nthe lack of flexibility in homeland security funding, especially in the \narea of overtime costs for training. They told me that since homeland \nsecurity funds cannot be used for most overtime costs, some of Maine's \nfirefighters have been forced to turn down training opportunities at \nthe National Fire Academy. Because there was no funding to pay the \novertime costs for someone to fill in while the firefighter trained at \nthe Academy, they had to forego this valuable training opportunity.\n  Our legislation would address their concerns by allowing funds to be \nused not only for planning, equipment, exercises, and training, but \nalso for certain overtime costs associated with training activities.\n  Our legislation also recognizes that certain high threat areas have \ncritical vulnerabilities that must be addressed immediately. This \nlegislation will direct the Secretary to use ten percent of total \nfunding for this program to address these critical vulnerabilities. \nWhile this provision provides flexibility, it requires that any direct \nfunding be consistent with the State plan. Furthermore, this \nlegislation formally authorizes the Emergency Management Preparedness \nGrant, which provides resources to the backbone of our emergency \nmanagement structure, and ensures an adequate level of funding under \nthis program.\n  While some States and communities face a more imminent threat, our \nNation must provide for the safety of all of our citizens. This grant \nprogram maintains the current baseline level of homeland security \nassistance to each State. It then allocates the bulk of the funds not \nbased solely on population, as is the case now, but on risk assessments \nundertaken for each State.\n  Right now, States and localities must complete numerous homeland \nsecurity plans, each with its own set of questions and benchmarks. \nTerrorists will not be deterred by paperwork or by communities \nanswering the same question six different ways.\n  That's why our legislation would streamline the planning process by \nrequiring a single set of cooperatively developed performance standards \nto help States and localities evaluate homeland security plans.\n  When I met with officials of Maine's Emergency Management Agency, \nthey told me that the rigid structure of many homeland security grant \nprograms frustrates their efforts to help first responders secure \ncommunities across our State.\n  In past years, for example, the Office for Domestic Preparedness's \nhomeland security grant program allocated the same percentage of each \nState's funds for training, equipment, exercises, and planning, thus \nleaving no room to accommodate different States' priorities. In \nallocating funds this way, the Federal Government effectively said that \nMaine must spend exactly the same portion of its homeland security \ndollars on training as Hawaii. Moreover, States cannot transfer surplus \nfunds from one category to another to meet their needs.\n  As a result, Maine may be forced to return some of the Homeland \nSecurity funds allocated for exercises. This one size fits all formula \nused in past homeland security funding makes no sense. I believe all \nStates and communities should have the flexibility to spend homeland \nsecurity dollars where they are most needed. That is why this \nlegislation would allow flexibility in homeland security funds that \nhave already been appropriated but remain unspent.\n  The current homeland security grant structure is unacceptable. \nSecretary Ridge has done an admirable job distributing billions of \ndollars of homeland security funds based on borrowed authorities and \nwith no real guidance. It is time to deal the Secretary a full hand of \ncards and give our States, localities, and first responders a straight \npath to homeland security programs, not a maze. We must topple the \nmountain of paperwork. We must help, not hinder, our front-line \ndefenders.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation to \nbuild a stronger and better homeland security partnership in the months \nand years ahead.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend from Maine, \nMs. Collins, in introducing the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act \nof 2003, legislation that greatly improves the method currently used to \ndistribute much-needed first responder aid.\n  When my colleagues and I on the Governmental Affairs Committee worked \nlast year under Senator Lieberman's leadership to create the Department \nof Homeland Security, we all hoped that what we were setting up would \nhelp the Federal Government be better able to prevent and respond to \nterrorist attacks. As of March 1st of this year, we have in place the \nskeleton of an organization that aims to pull together under one roof \ninformation on threats and vulnerabilities and use that information to \nimprove security and prepare first responders.\n  As I've pointed out a number of times, however, no matter how well \nSecretary Ridge does his work on the Federal level, we will not be much \nsafer than we were on September 10, 2001 unless our first responders \nare better prepared to do their work on the local level. While homeland \nsecurity should certainly be a shared responsibility, it is vitally \nimportant that the Federal Government does its part to provide each \nState and its first responders with the assistance necessary to ensure \nthat the citizens they serve are adequately protected. The Homeland \nSecurity Grant Enhancement Act is an important step toward making this \nhappen.\n  Today, States, localities and first responders can receive Federal \nassistance from a number of different aid programs administered by \nseveral different agencies. All of the programs serve different \npurposes and require different applications. The Homeland Security \nGrant Enhancement Act sets up a process to streamline these programs to \nallow them to work well together and avoid imposing redundant or \nduplicative requirements on applicants. The aim is not to eliminate \nprograms, but to ensure that existing homeland security and homeland \nsecurity-related grant programs are well coordinated and impose as \nsmall an administrative burden on applicants as possible.\n  The Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act also creates a ``one-stop \nshop'' for grant information within the Department of Homeland Security \nby moving the Office of Domestic Preparedness, ODP, the agency within \nthe Department of Homeland Security charged with administering the \ncurrent state homeland security grant program, from the Directorate for \nBorder and Transportation Security to the Office for State and Local \nGovernment Coordination. In its new location, ODP will operate a \n``clearinghouse'' for grant information that would offer services such \nas a toll-free hotline and a list of recommended first responder \nequipment. ODP will also maintain a compilation of ``best practices'' \nmade up of successful homeland security programs from across the \ncountry and offer states technical assistance in developing the \nterrorism risk assessments that will be a part of the new State grant \nprogram.\n  Most importantly, the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act also \nmakes key improvements to the formula for distributing first responder \naid among the States. The new formula maintains the requirement that \nall money go to State governments and that 80 percent of that money be \npassed through to cities and localities. It also maintains the current \nsmall state minimum in which each State receives an equal share of 40 \npercent of funds made available for state grants. It makes a major \nimprovement, however, by dividing the remaining 60 percent of the money \namong the states according to an analysis of potential threats in each \nState.\n\n[[Page S7836]]\n\n  The current formula for distributing first responder aid ignores the \nfact that Delaware, though small in population, is located in the \nNortheast midway between New York and Washington. It ignores the fact \nthat Delaware is home to a major port, oil refineries and chemical \nplants. It ignores the fact that Delaware every day hosts scores of \nships, trains and trucks on their way to destinations up and down the \nEast Coast. It also ignores the fact that Delaware is home to the Dover \nAir Force Base, a facility that played a crucial role in the recent \nconflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I understand the need to give larger States, especially those with \ndensely populated urban areas, enough resources to protect their larger \npopulations. No State, however, should be less safe than its neighbors \nsimply because it has a smaller population. The Federal Government \nshould be working to bring every state and locality to the point where \nthey are capable of responding effectively to any potential threat. I \nam concerned that the current formula, based mostly on population does \nnot prepare all States adequately.\n  The Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act still requires that \npopulation be taken into account when distributing first responder aid. \nHowever, it adds the requirement that the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity also account for threats and risk to critical infrastructure \nidentified in State risk assessments that would be submitted to the \ndepartment as part of the grant application process. The bill also \nensures that all localities within States get their fair share of money \nby requiring that local leaders be included in the planning and \napplication process in each state and that the distribution method a \ngiven state will use once it receives its money is approved by the \ndepartment before a check is cut.\n  Finally, the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act gives states new \nflexibility in spending their first responder aid by incorporating \nprovisions from S. 838, legislation Ms. Collins and I introduced in \nApril. That bill allows States to apply for a waiver from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security so that they can move their first \nresponder aid around between the four categories--equipment, training, \nexercises and planning--in which it is sent to them. This change will \nallow States to better meet needs identified in their State terrorism \nresponse plans.\n  I applaud the Senator from Maine for her leadership on these \nimportant issues. I look forward to working with her and all of my \ncolleagues in getting this important legislation passed and signed into \nlaw as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bond, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Levin, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Domenici, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Corzine, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, \n        Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1247.

A bill to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today, I join my esteemed colleague, the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, in introducing the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2003.\n  In the past, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, \nbills received bipartisan votes at the end of a long, divisive and \narduous process. What makes today's introduction of a bipartisan IDEA \nbill so unique is that it is bipartisan in its inception.\n  The reason this is a bipartisan bill is because it strikes the \nappropriate balance between protecting the educational rights of \nchildren with disabilities while simultaneously making IDEA less \nlitigious and compliance based. Above all, the bill is designed to \nensure that IDEA resources are directed to help children with \ndisabilities obtain the same opportunity to succeed as all other \nstudents.\n  The bill streamlines State and local requirements to ensure that \npaperwork focuses on improved results for children with disabilities. \nBy eliminating the need for an 800+ procedural checklist, these \namendments favor the improvement of educational and functional results \nfor children with disabilities over burdensome bureaucratic rules.\n  The bill responds to concerns that we've heard from both parents and \nschool administrators alike on how the law has evolved into a full \nemployment government program for lawyers. Over and over again, we hear \nof fights about past procedural issues and technical errors instead of \nmaking sure that the children are being well served in the here and \nnow.\n  The bill includes many common sense provisions to alleviate the \nstress in disagreements between schools and parents and encourages them \nto seek out mediation to address their concerns before they move to \nformal hearings. The bill restores trust by; providing parents with \nbetter access to information and resources to understand their rights \nand work through conflicts; making clear that parents can request an \ninitial evaluation of a child for IDEA services and making it easier \nfor parents to make changes to their child's individual education plan; \nrequiring complaints of either the school or parents to be clear and \nspecific before going to due process; and requiring hearing officers to \nmake decisions based upon substantive grounds not technical issues that \nhave no bearing on a child's education.\n  This bill currently does not specifically address the issue of full \nfunding, because Senator Kennedy and I decided at the very outset to \npostpone that issue to the floor, since that is an issue that merits \nthe attention and active participation of the entire Senate. However, \nin addition to simplifying funding formulas so that both States and \nlocal school districts have a better indication of the funding \navailable, the bill includes 2 key provisions that will provide \nadditional fiscal relief for school districts than what is provided to \nthem under current law.\n  First, we allow school districts to treat 8 percent of their IDEA \nfunds as local funds. This will allow school districts to better align \nfunding among programs based on local priorities. Second, we require \nStates to reserve 2 percent of their overall IDEA Part B grant to \nestablish risk pool accounts to provide new resources to assist local \nschool districts and charter schools in addressing the costs of \nproviding services to high-need children and unanticipated enrollment \nof students with disabilities.\n  Finally, the bill addresses the discipline provisions in current law \nthat schools and parents have found to be confusing, hard to \nadminister, and have resulted in outcomes that were not always fair to \nevery child. The bill simplifies the framework for schools to \nadminister the law, while ensuring the rights and the safety of all \nchildren.\n  Importantly, the bill will require schools to consider whether a \nchild's behavior was the result of their disability when considering \ndisciplinary action, and ensure that individualized education plans \ncontain positive behavioral interventions and supports when a child's \nbehavior impedes his or her own learning, or that of others.\n  Senator Kennedy and I were determined to make this a bipartisan \nprocess from the beginning. We have crafted a bill that we're confident \nwill be overwhelmingly supported by both Republicans and Democrats--and \nmost importantly by parents, the disabled community and the school \ncommunity.\n\n[[Page S7837]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join with Senator \nGregg to introduce the reauthorization of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Act. Our goal is a quality education for every disabled \nchild.\n  We know that education opens the golden door of opportunity for every \nchild, and it is especially important for children with disabilities. \nSince it was first enacted, IDEA has opened that door and helped \nmillions of children with disabilities to lead independent and \nproductive lives. For them, IDEA has been the difference between \ndependence and independence, between lost potential and productive \ncareers.\n  The need for IDEA is greater now than ever. Over 6 million children \nwith disabilities rely on the Act to obtain the same learning \nopportunities as their non-disabled fellow students.\n  We know that schools need Federal help to make IDEA work. Over the \nlast two years we have listened to students, parents, teachers, and \nschool administrators. We have weighed thousands of comments on the \nmost effective ways to live up to the great promise of this law.\n  They told us they needed stronger enforcement of IDEA. This bill \nprovides it, by giving the Secretary of Education and State education \nagencies greater power and new ways to measure compliance and impose \nsanctions when schools fail to live up the standards we've set.\n  They told us they needed stronger accountability. This bill provides \nit, by requiring schools to meet strict benchmarks for student \nachievement, by providing better delivery of transition services, and \nby dealing with the over-representation of minorities in IDEA.\n  They told us they wanted a stronger and more flexible Individualized \nEducation Program. This bill provides it, by requiring that every \nstudent's plan contain positive ways to support the child and to \nincrease parental involvement.\n  They told us they wanted to protect students from being expelled from \nschool because of their disability. This bill provides it, by requiring \nschools to determine whether a child's behavior is the result of the \ndisability, or the lack of other supports that should have been \nprovided.\n  They told us they wanted better teachers in the classroom--as well-\ntrained as other teachers. This bill provides it, by requiring all \nspecial education teachers to be highly qualified by 2007, and by \ndesignating 100 percent of State improvement grants to support \nprofessional development of teachers.\n  They told us they wanted more help for their children in the \ntransition from school to college or to work. This bill provides it, by \ngiving greater access to the vocational rehabilitation system and \ntaking other steps to assist the child in meeting post-secondary goals.\n  The debate over how best to fund these reforms goes on. Schools \nurgently need the resources to make the IDEA a reality. It is not \nenough to provide only some of the promised federal aid. We must find a \nway to fully fund IDEA, because every dollar lost is another child that \nslips through the cracks.\n  We will have an opportunity to debate this issue and others in our \ncommittee and in the Senate in the weeks ahead. I look forward to these \ndebates and to working with Senator Gregg and all our colleagues to \nmake this bill even stronger.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 1249.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na minimum credit of $200 per month for stay-at-home parents, to allow \nthe dependent care credit to be taken against the minimum tax, and to \nallow a carryforward of any unused dependent care credit; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to \nintroduce legislation that will help many young families in America \nmeet the financial challenges associated with raising children. The \nlegislation I am introducing attempts to alleviate some of the \nfinancial costs incurred by the more than one out three families when \none of the parents decides to leave the work force to raise children at \nhome.\n  Current tax law recognizes that when both parents remain in the work \nforce, they incur additional child care costs because, in order to keep \ntheir jobs, they have to pay for day care services. Current tax law \nprovides a sliding scale tax credit that allows parents to claim a tax \ncredit of up to 35 percent to offset as much as $3,000 of day care \ncosts for one child, $6,000 for two or more children. The maximum \n$1,050 tax credit, $2,100 for two or more children, phase down as \nincome rises. The minimum, 20 percent credit, applies to families with \nincomes above $43,000.\n  I strongly support this dependent care tax credit because it makes it \neasier for husbands and wives to maintain their careers and provide for \ntheir families. However, there are many families that have made the \ndecision that one of the parents will give up a job in order to raise \ntheir children. In fact, this is a growing trend. In 2001, 37.7 percent \nof families had one parent at home raising the child; that's up from \n35.3 percent in 1995. And the stay-at-home parent is, overwhelmingly, \nthe mother. Barely 3.6 percent of stay-at-home parents are husbands.\n  When a working woman makes the decision to interrupt her career to \nraise her child, the family incurs an immediate financial penalty. And \nmore often than not, the career interruption may damage the woman's \nfuture earnings potential, what some have referred to as the ``Mommy \nTrack.''\n  The immediate loss of income when a parent leaves the workforce \nsignificantly changes the family's lifestyle. For example, consider a \nchildless couple where the husband earns $35,000 and\n\n[[Page S7839]]\n\nthe wife earns $27,000. After paying Federal income and payroll taxes, \nthe family retains slightly more than $50,000 in disposable income. If \nthe family has a child, and both parents continue their careers, after \ntaxes they still will keep more than $49,000 of their earnings, even if \nthey incur child care expenses of $3,000. However, in this example, if \nthe father gives up his job, the family's disposable income drops by \nnearly 40 percent to less than $32,000. Put another way, the family's \nmonthly income drops from $4,100 to $2,700. That's a difficult \nadjustment for any family, especially one that has to incur the \nadditional costs of a newborn.\n\n  I respect the parents who choose to maintain their careers while \nraising a family and the parents who make the financial sacrifice to \ngive up their careers to raise a family. But I believe the tax code \nshould treat both equally.\n  My legislation attempts to alleviate the current inequity in the code \nby giving stay-at-home moms or dads a $200 a month tax credit. This \ncredit would be indexed for inflation. The credit would apply until the \nchild reaches the age of 6. While this credit could never make up the \nfinancial loss that families face when one of the parents stops \nworking, it will provide some important financial relief to these \nfamilies. In the example I cited earlier, if the father did not work \nfor a full year, the $2,400 tax credit would completely eliminate the \nfamily's $1,500 Federal tax bill, giving the family that much more to \nspend on their living expenses.\n  In addition, under this proposal, any unused tax credits could be \ncarried forward indefinitely. Many parents who leave the work force to \nraise their children return to work when their kids enter school. By \nallowing the carry forward of unused credits, the parent who re-enters \nthe work force will be able to keep more of his or her earnings to make \nup for the financial sacrifice made when choosing to stay home with the \nfamily. I think it is only fair that society recognize the financial \nsacrifice these parents have made.\n  Congress recently acted to eliminate the marriage penalty. We should \nnow act to eliminate the penalty imposed on families when a parent \nleaves the workforce to raise a child at home. It makes sense for our \nfamilies and it is good tax policy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to direct the \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration to establish a \nvocational and technical entrepreneurship development program; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today as Ranking Member of the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to introduce the \nVocational and Technical Entrepreneurship Development Act of 2003, \nwhich is the companion bill to H.R. 1387, which bears the same name and \nwas reintroduced in the House by Congressman Robert Brady of \nPennsylvania earlier this year.\n  I want to commend Representative Brady for his hard work on behalf of \nsmall businesses not just from his home State of Pennsylvania but for \nevery trades industry entrepreneur that has ever attempted to open his \nor her own business.\n  Often Americans who work in the trade sector--construction, plumbing, \nelectrical work etc.--enter these professions with the goal of one day \nstarting a business; however many of these aspiring business owners who \npartake in career training or vocational training in certain trades, \nunfortunately, fail to obtain the necessary education in the successful \ngrowth and development of their newly formed business. This initiative \nwould develop a program that allows workers within the trades industry \nto move toward starting a new business.\n  The purpose of the Vocational and Technical Entrepreneurship \nDevelopment Act is to assist in the development of curricula that will \nencourage the successful growth of small businesses. This legislation \npassed the House last Congress on October 2, 2001 and was subsequently \ntaken up and passed by this Committee last Congress, but was not taken \nup by the full Senate.\n  The bill, in a business-education partnership, establishes a \n``vocational entrepreneurship development demonstration program,'' \nunder which the SBA would provide grants, through the Small Business \nDevelopment Centers program, to provide technical assistance to high \nschool and technical career institutes, Vo-Tech schools, to promote \nsmall business ownership in their curriculum.\n  The SBDC program is designed to deliver such up-to-date counseling, \ntraining and technical assistance in all aspects of small business \nmanagement and is the ideal candidate to provide such a program. Each \ngrant awarded under this program will be worth over $200,000--which, in \ntoday's environment where Vo-Tech programs get short-changed in \ngovernment education budgets, can do a great deal to help rebuild a \nworker-strapped trades industry.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support Vocational and Technical \nEntrepreneurship Development Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Kerry (for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Miller, Mr. Craig, and \n        Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1255. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to direct the \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration to establish a pilot \nprogram to provide regulatory compliance assistance to small business \nconcerns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished \ncolleague from Nevada, Senator John Ensign, and the cosponsors of our \nlegislation in reintroducing the National\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\nSmall Business Regulatory Assistance Act.\n  The bill we are reintroducing today is the same Cleland-Kerry \nlegislation that was introduced last Congress, and it is the companion \nto Congressman Sweeney's bill, H.R. 205, which bears the same name as \nour legislation. The Sweeney bill recently passed the House \noverwhelmingly, 417-4, with the strong support of the House Committee \non Small Business, as it did in the 107th. Our Senate version, which is \nnearly identical to the Sweeney bill, passed the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship last year but was not taken up by the \nfull Senate. Because Senator Ensign and I are fully committed to \nhelping small business owners understand and navigate complicated \ngovernment regulations, we are reintroducing this legislation, the \nNational Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act.\n  Small businesses, particularly small businesses with very few \nemployees, often face an overwhelming task when seeking advice on how \nto comply with Federal regulations, especially when implementation \nvaries for different regions of the country, or from state to state. \nMany small businesses fail to comply with important and needed labor \nand environmental regulations not because they want to break the law, \nbut because they are unaware of the actions they need to take to \ncomply. Often, small businesses are afraid to seek guidance from \nFederal agencies for fear of exposing problems at their businesses.\n  One important way to help small businesses comply with Federal \nregulations is to provide them with free, confidential advice outside \nof the normal relationship between a small business and a regulatory \nagency. The Small Business Administration's, SBA, Small Business \nDevelopment Centers, SBDCs, are in a unique position to provide this \ntype of assistance.\n  Our bill establishes a pilot program to award competitive grants to \n20 selected SBDCs, two from each SBA region, which would allow these \nSBDCs to provide regulatory compliance assistance to small businesses. \nThe SBA would be authorized to award grants between $150,000 and \n$300,000, depending on the population of the SBDC's state.\n  Under our legislation, the SBDCs would need to form partnerships with \nFederal compliance programs, conduct educational and training \nactivities and offer free-of-charge compliance counseling to small \nbusiness owners. Further, the measure would guarantee privacy to those \nwho receive compliance assistance, which is integral to the reaching \nout to as many small businesses as possible. This privacy provision has \nalso been extended to all small businesses that seek any assistance \nfrom their local SBDC.\n  The legislation we are reintroducing today uses only SBA funds and \nwill serve to complement current small business development assistance \nas well as existing compliance assistance programs. Versions of this \nlegislation introduced in previous Congresses used Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, enforcement funds to pay for these grants.\n  Small businesses can succeed when it comes to complying with Federal \nregulations, if provided with the necessary tools and information. The \nNational Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act will go a long way \ntoward assisting our Nation's small businesses that want to comply with \nFederal regulations.\n  I am pleased to say that we have the full support of the Association \nof Small Business Development Centers, which has been working closely \nwith us since January of last year to draft the Senate version of this \nlegislation, as well as support from National Small Business United, \nthe American Industrial Hygiene Association, and Congressman Sweeney.\n  I want to express my sincere thanks to Senator Ensign for his hard \nwork and continued support on this issue. I urge all of my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Lugar);\n  S. 1256. A bill to protect the critical aquifers and watersheds that \nserve as a principal water supply for Puerto Rico, to protect the \ntropical forests of the Karst Region, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce, along with \nSenator Lugar, the Puerto Rico Karst Conservation Act of 2003.\n  This very important bill will provide protection for Puerto Rico's \nkarst region by helping to maintain biodiversity within the tropical \nforest ecosystem and to protect its valuable aquifers and watersheds. \nThe area is threatened by development which, if unabated, could cause \npermanent damage to its outstanding natural and environmental assets.\n  Karst is permeable and soluble limestone that originated millions of \nyears ago. The land identified in the bill contains the last remnants \nof tropical forests that once covered the island. This area, including \nthe habitats of many endangered and threatened species and tropical \nbirds, is home to over 1,300 species of plants and animals.\n  The area also provides drinking water through subterranean aquifers \nto many of the island's citizens. Sixty-four percent of Puerto Rico's \naquifer area is contained within the northern karst belt. This aquifer \narea discharges approximately 120 million gallons of water per day, of \nwhich the citizens of Puerto Rico consume 52 million gallons per day. \nThe pharmaceutical industry is one of the mainstays of Puerto Rico's \neconomy and it is dependent on the area's fresh water supplies as well.\n  An August 2001 U.S. Forest Service report, Puerto Rican Karst: A \nVital Resource, documents the ecologically unique and scientifically \nvaluable karst region, stating ``the northern limestone contains Puerto \nRico's most extensive freshwater aquifer, largest continuous expanse of \nmature forest, and largest coastal wetlands, estuary,and underground \ncave system. The karst belt is extremely diverse, and its multiple land \nforms, concentrated in such a small area, make it unique in the \nworld.'' It should come as no surprise, then, that Forest Service Chief \ndale Bosworth has expressed his strong support for the protection of \nthe karst.\n  The Puerto Rico Karst Conservation Act of 2003 authorizes the \nSecretary of Agriculture to carry out land acquisition by using funds \nfrom a Conservation Fund created by the Act, and from the Forest Legacy \nProgram, the Land and Water Conservation Fund and other sources. The \nlegislation also authorizes the Secretary to make grants to and enter \ninto agreements with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, other federal \nagencies, organizations, and corporations for the acquisition, \nprotection, and management of land in the region. In addition, the bill \nmakes this region eligible for inclusion under the Forest Legacy \nProgram.\n  I want to thank Senator Lugar for co-sponsoring the Puerto Rico Karst \nConservation Act of 2003. His strong support for this legislation and \nhis steadfast commitment to tropical forest conservation is invaluable. \nIt is also important to note that Representative Acevedo-Vila and \nRepresentative Duncan have just introduced this measure in the House of \nRepresentatives where, I'm told, it has strong bi-partisan support.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

Res. 167\n\n       Whereas in 1903, boyhood friends, hobby designers, and \n     tinkerers William S. Harley, then 21 years old, and Arthur \n     Davidson, then 20 years old, completed the design and \n     manufacture of their first motorcycle, with help from Arthur \n     Davidson's brothers, Walter Davidson and William A. Davidson;\n       Whereas, also in 1903, Harley and the Davidson brothers \n     completed 2 additional motorcycles in a makeshift ``factory'' \n     shed in the Davidson family's backyard at the corner of 38th \n     Street and Highland Boulevard in Milwaukee, Wisconsin;\n       Whereas the design features and construction quality of the \n     early Harley-Davidson motorcycles proved significantly more \n     innovative and durable than most other motorcycles of the \n     era, giving Harley-Davidson a distinct competitive advantage;\n       Whereas in 1905, Walter Davidson won the first of many \n     motorcycle competition events, giving rise to a strong \n     tradition of victory in motorcycle racing that continues \n     today;\n       Whereas in 1906, Harley-Davidson Motor Company constructed \n     its first building, financed by the Davidsons' uncle James \n     McClay, on the site of the Company's current world \n     headquarters one block north of the Davidson home site, and \n     manufactured 50 motorcycles that year;\n       Whereas in 1907, Harley-Davidson Motor Company was \n     incorporated and its 18 employees purchased shares;\n       Whereas in 1908, the first motorcycle for police duty was \n     delivered to the Detroit Police Department, beginning Harley-\n     Davidson's long and close relationship with law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       Whereas in 1909, to enhance power and performance, Harley-\n     Davidson added a second cylinder to its motorcycle, giving \n     birth to its hallmark 45-degree V-Twin configuration and the \n     legendary Harley-Davidson sound;\n       Whereas during the years 1907 through 1913, manufacturing \n     space at least doubled every year, reaching nearly 300,000 \n     square feet by 1914;\n       Whereas Arthur Davidson, during Harley-Davidson's formative \n     years, set up a worldwide dealer network that would serve as \n     the focal point of the company's ``close to the customer'' \n     philosophy;\n       Whereas Harley-Davidson, early in its history began \n     marketing motorcycles as a sport and leisure pursuit, thus \n     laying the groundwork for long-term prosperity;\n       Whereas in 1916, Harley-Davidson launched ``The \n     Enthusiast'' magazine, which today is the longest running \n     continuously published motorcycle magazine in the world;\n       Whereas also in 1916, Harley-Davidson motorcycles saw their \n     first military duty in skirmishes in border disputes along \n     the United States border with Mexico;\n       Whereas in World War I, Harley-Davidson supplied 17,000 \n     motorcycles for dispatch and scouting use by the Allied armed \n     forces, and whereas the first Allied soldier to enter Germany \n     after the signing of the Armistice was riding a Harley-\n     Davidson motorcycle;\n       Whereas by 1920, Harley-Davidson was the world's largest \n     motorcycle manufacturer, both in terms of floor space and \n     production, with continual engineering and design innovation;\n       Whereas during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the \n     company survived when all but 1 other domestic motorcycle \n     manufacturer failed, on the strength of its product quality, \n     the loyalty of its employees, dealers, and customers, steady \n     police and commercial business, and a growing international \n     presence;\n       Whereas in 1936, Harley-Davidson demonstrated foresight, \n     resolve, and faith in the future by introducing the company's \n     first overhead valve engine, the ``Knucklehead'' as it would \n     come to be known, on its Model EL motorcycle, thus \n     establishing the widely recognized classic Harley Davidson \n     look and the company's reputation for styling;\n       Whereas Harley-Davidson workers in 1937 elected to be \n     represented by the United Auto Workers of America, thus \n     launching a proud tradition of working with Harley-Davidson \n     to further build the company through advocacy and the \n     development of effective programs and policies;\n       Whereas William H. Davidson, son of the late founder \n     William A. Davidson, became president of Harley-Davidson in \n     1942 and would lead the company until 1971;\n       Whereas Harley-Davidson built more than 90,000 motorcycles \n     for United States and Allied armed forces use during World \n     War II, earning 4 Army-Navy ``E'' Awards for excellence in \n     wartime production;\n       Whereas Harley-Davidson, during the 1950s and 1960s, \n     recharged its sales and popularity with new models, including \n     the Sportster and the Electra Glide, new engines, and other \n     technological advances;\n       Whereas the Company developed the concept of the ``factory \n     custom'' motorcycle with the 1971 introduction of the Super \n     Glide and the 1977 Low Rider, under the design leadership of \n     William ``Willie G'' Davidson,\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\n     vice president of Styling and grandson of company founder \n     William A. Davidson;\n       Whereas since 1980, as a national corporate sponsor of the \n     Muscular Dystrophy Association, Harley-Davidson has raised \n     more than $40,000,000 through company, dealer, customer, and \n     supplier contributions, to fund research and health services;\n       Whereas in 1981, a group of 13 Harley-Davidson executives, \n     led by chairman and CEO Vaughn Beals purchased Harley-\n     Davidson from its then corporate parent AMF Incorporated;\n       Whereas by 1986, Harley-Davidson, against incredible odds, \n     restored the company's reputation for quality and innovation \n     and returned the company to vitality, thus ensuring a highly \n     successful initial public stock offering;\n       Whereas throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Harley-Davidson \n     became a national role model for positive labor-management \n     relations, product innovation, manufacturing quality and \n     efficiency and phenomenal growth;\n       Whereas President Ronald Reagan, President William J. \n     Clinton, and President George W. Bush all have visited \n     Harley-Davidson manufacturing facilities and extolled the \n     example set by Harley Davidson through its practices;\n       Whereas the Harley Owners Group, with more than 800,000 \n     members and 1,200 chapters worldwide, is celebrating its 20th \n     anniversary year in 2003 as a driving force in the company's \n     heralded ``close to the customer'' operating philosophy; and\n       Whereas Harley-Davidson Motor Company is today the world's \n     leading seller of large displacement (651 cc plus) \n     motorcycles, with annual revenues in excess of \n     $4,000,000,000, annual motorcycle shipments in excess of \n     290,000 units, strong international sales, and 17 consecutive \n     years of annual revenue and earnings growth since becoming a \n     publicly held company: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the achievements of Harley-Davidson Motor \n     Company, widely regarded as a tremendous American business \n     success story and one of the top performing companies in \n     America, as its employees, retirees, suppliers, dealers, \n     customers, motorcycle enthusiasts, and friends worldwide \n     commemorate and celebrate its 100th anniversary milestone;\n       (2) recognizes the great impact that Harley-Davidson has \n     had on the business, social, and cultural landscape and lives \n     of Americans and citizens of all nations, as a quintessential \n     icon of Americana; and\n       (3) congratulates the Harley-Davidson Motor Company for \n     this achievement and trusts that Harley-Davidson will have an \n     even greater impact in the 21st century and beyond as a \n     leading force for innovative business practices and products \n     that will continue to provide enjoyment, transportation, and \n     delight for generations to come.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution to \npay tribute to the Harley-Davidson Motor Company in honor of this great \nAmerican company's 100th anniversary. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senator Kohl, Allard and Santorum.\n  As a long-time Harley-Davidson rider, I have enjoyed many years of \nsatisfaction with the company and its legendary machines.\n  I can tell you that there is no better way to enjoy Colorado's great \nscenic beauty than from the saddle of a Harley-Davidson, the freedom of \nthe open road and the often imitated, but never duplicated, throaty \nroar of an American-made machine is something that I have thoroughly \nenjoyed for countless thousands of miles.\n  Harley-Davidson not only makes great motorcycles, it also exemplifies \nthe kind of company that I am proud to support. From its humble \nbeginnings in a small 10 foot by 15 foot shed in a Milwaukee backyard \nin 1903, this company had its share of good times and bad. The Great \nDepression was a major blow to the American motorcycle industry, and \nwhen the dust finally cleared Harley-Davidson was one of only two U.S. \nmotorcycle manufacturers left standing.\n  And it is a good thing that Harley-Davidson survived because when \nWorld War II erupted, our country needed to call on Harley-Davidson to \nbuild bikes for U.S. and Allied troops. Many of the military orders and \nother intelligence messages that were vital to achieving victory would \nnot have been delivered to the front lines if it had not been for brave \nG.I. messengers riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n  Following the Allied Victory in War World II, the Harley-Davidson \nCompany refocused on developing new styles of motorcycles for the \nindividual American consumer to enjoy. The company's second generation \nof management brought fresh ideas that helped usher-in the celebrated \n``motorcycle culture'' of the 1950's and 60's.\n  When Harley-Davidson hit a rough patch of road in the 1980's it was a \ndaring combination of re-found independence, innovation and serious re-\nengineering that brought this legendary company back from the brink. \nHarley-Davidson successfully carried out a classic textbook comeback \nthat exemplifies many of our nation's best traits: independence, \ndaring, grit, tenacity, smarts, and a penchant for continuous \ninnovation and progress while remaining firmly rooted in our heritage.\n  On that note, I conclude my tribute to the people of Harley-Davidson \nwith my congratulations on 100 amazing years. I, and many others, look \nforward to many more.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting passage of this \nimportant resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7843-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7843-S7844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 168--DESIGNATING MAY 2004 AS ``NATIONAL MOTORCYCLE \n                      SAFETY AND AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Allard) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 168\n\n       Whereas the United States of America is the world leader in \n     motorcycle safety, promoting education, training, and \n     motorcycle awareness;\n       Whereas motorcycles occupy a very important position in the \n     history of this Nation and of the world;\n       Whereas over two-thirds of car-motorcycle crashes and \n     nearly one-half of all motorcycle crashes are caused by car \n     drivers, not by motorcyclists;\n       Whereas of the 1,400 fatal car-motorcycle crashes in 2001, \n     36 percent involved another vehicle violating the \n     motorcyclist's right-of-way by turning left while the \n     motorcycle was going straight, passing, or overtaking the \n     vehicle;\n       Whereas although the motorcycling community has made \n     efforts to mitigate these right-of-way crashes through \n     enhancing motorcycle awareness via billboards, posters, \n     media, and other campaigns, the message to ``watch for \n     motorcycles'' continues to go unheeded by the general \n     motoring public;\n       Whereas the motorcycling community has invested \n     considerable time and effort to improve its safety record \n     through safety initiatives such as increased rider training \n     and licensing campaigns, but many times demand for rider \n     training exceeds enrollment capacity and the programs often \n     lack support from the larger traffic safety community;\n       Whereas the larger traffic safety community, highway \n     designers, law enforcement, the medical community, designers \n     of other vehicles, government, researchers working in related \n     areas, insurers, and all road users can accomplish much more \n     toward improving motorcycle safety;\n       Whereas the motorcycle is an efficient vehicle which \n     conserves fuel, has little impact on our overworked roads and \n     highway system, is an important mode of transportation \n     involving such activities as commuting, touring, and \n     recreation, and promotes friendship by attracting riders from \n     all over the world through various clubs and organizations;\n       Whereas the month of May marks the traditional start of the \n     motorcycle riding season; and\n       Whereas, due to the increased number of motorcycles on the \n     road, it is appropriate to set aside the month of May 2004 to \n     promote motorcycle awareness and safety and to encourage all \n     citizens to safely share the roads and highways of this great \n     Nation by paying extra attention to those citizens who ride \n     motorcycles: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 2004 as ``National Motorcycle Safety and \n     Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution to designate \nMay 2004 as National Motorcycle Safety and Awareness Month. As many of \nyou know, the month of May marks the traditional start of the \nmotorcycle riding season.\n  Motorcycles have become a big part of the American landscape and \noccupy a very important position in the history of this Nation. The use \nof motorcycles has served this country well through numerous military \ncampaigns as well as playing a pivotal role in law enforcement. For \nmany Americans, motorcycles have become their sole source of \ntransportation and for others, a form of weekend recreation. According \nto the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there are well \nover four million motorcycles registered in this country. It is no \nsecret that the United States is viewed as the world's leader in \nmotorcycle safety and motorcycle awareness.\n  As a motorcycle enthusiast for more than 50 years, I am concerned \nthat\n\n[[Page S7844]]\n\nmore needs to be done to educate the general motoring public about \nmotorcycle safety and awareness. According to the American Motorcycle \nAssociation, over two-thirds of car-motorcycle crashes, and nearly half \nof all motorcycle crashes are caused by auto drivers, not by \nmotorcyclists. Think of it: Most drivers, when leaving an intersection, \nlook right and left for cars and trucks, not always for motorcycles. Of \nthe 1,400 fatal car-motorcycle crashes in 2001, 36 percent involved \nanother vehicle violating the motorcyclist's right-of-way by turning \nleft while the motorcycle was going straight, passing, or overtaking \nthe vehicle. These statistics can and must be addressed.\n  The motorcycling community has made efforts to mitigate these right-\nof-way crashes through enhancing motorcycle awareness via bill boards, \nposters, media and other campaigns, the message to ``watch for \nmotorcycles'' continues to go unheeded by the general motoring public--\nnot intentionally I am sure.\n  In addition, the motorcycling community has invested considerable \ntime and effort to improve its safety record through safety initiatives \nsuch as increased rider training and licensing campaigns, but the \nprograms are over-utilized and underfunded and often lack support from \nthe larger traffic safety community.\n  Clearly enough is not being done by motorists to take extra care in \nlooking for motorcyclists and conversely, motorcyclists need to take an \nactive roll in protecting themselves as well.\n  As we continue to move through the riding season, I will continue to \nwork with my colleagues here in the Senate and motorcycle rights groups \nsuch as the National Coalition of Motorcyclists, the American \nMotorcycle Riders Foundation to find solutions to educate the general \nmotoring public about motorcycle safety and awareness. This resolution \nis a strong, positive step in the right direction to help achieve this \ngoal.\n  For all the motorcyclists who have been injured through no fault of \ntheir own, and for the many thousands of others who will be injured \nthis year and for every year to come for quite some time, I encourage \nmy colleagues to join this effort to help raise the awareness \nNationwide of all motorized vehicle operators of motorcycles and those \nwho operate them. To do nothing invites more needless and preventable \ninjury and death to far too many innocent Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting passage of this \nimportant resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7844-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 169--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nUNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE SHOULD ISSUE A POSTAGE STAMP COMMEMORATING \n                               ANNE FRANK\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, Today is Anne Frank's birthday. If she \nhad survived the horror of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, then \nshe would have been 74 years old. But she did not survive and because \nof her moving and thoughtful diary, the world got to know her and \nunderstand what it was like living in that apartment during the Nazis' \nreign of terror. Anne Frank's diary has educated generations around the \nworld about tolerance and dignity. It has left a mark in a way that few \nbooks can, and the world is a better place because of Anne Frank's \nstory.\n  That is why I am proud to submit a resolution expressing the sense of \nthe Senate that the United States Postal Service should issue a postage \nstamp commemorating Anne Frank and the Citizens' Stamp Advisory \nCommittee should recommend to the Postmaster General that such a stamp \nbe issued.\n  Anne Frank was born on June 12, 1929, in Frankfurt, Germany to a \nGerman-Jewish family. She and her family fled the Nazi persecution of \nJews in Germany and sought safety by moving to Amsterdam, the \nNetherlands. Following the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Anne \nFrank and her family were forced into hiding in an annex located above \nher father's office. The family spent 25 months in hiding which Anne \nFrank described in her diary.\n  The family was betrayed and turned over to the Nazis. Anne Frank was \nimprisoned in the Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camp, where she died \nin March 1945. She was one of approximately 1,500,000 Jewish children \nwho died at the hands of the Nazis during World War II. In the midst of \nthis unthinkable horror, her diary survived, and was published by her \nfather after the end of the war. It has become one of the most widely \nread memoirs of the Holocaust experience. It has been translated into \nmore than 67 languages and has touched people around the world.\n  The Diary of Anne Frank holds a special place of honor in the United \nStates. It is the first educational encounter with the Holocaust for \nmany American students. It has been repeatedly dramatized in motion \npictures and in the theater. Millions of Americans have come to \nidentify with Anne Frank. She has become an inspiration to children of \nall faiths and assists young people deal with important issues such as \ndiscrimination, bigotry and hate crimes.\n  Anne Frank serves as an enduring symbol of bravery, hope, and \ntolerance in the face of harsh and brutal conditions. A commemorative \npostage stamp would be a meaningful way for Americans to honor Anne \nFrank's inextinguishable courage and dignity. I urge my colleagues to \nco-sponsor this resolution and assist our efforts to convince the \nCitizens' Stamp Advisory Committee to recommend the issuance of a \npostage stamp commemorating Anne Frank.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7844-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7844-S7845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 170--DESIGNATING THE YEARS 2004 AND 2005 AS ``YEARS \n                      OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY''\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Cochran) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 55\n\n       Whereas whales have very low reproductive rates, making \n     whale populations extremely vulnerable to pressure from \n     commercial whaling;\n       Whereas whales migrate throughout the world's oceans and \n     international cooperation is required to successfully \n     conserve and protect whale stocks;\n       Whereas in 1946 a significant number of the nations of the \n     world adopted the International Convention for the Regulation \n     of Whaling, which established the International Whaling \n     Commission to provide for the proper conservation of whale \n     stocks;\n       Whereas the Commission adopted a moratorium on commercial \n     whaling in 1982 in order to conserve and promote the recovery \n     of whale stocks, many of which had been hunted to near \n     extinction by the commercial whaling industry;\n       Whereas the Commission has designated the Indian Ocean and \n     the ocean waters around Antarctica as whale sanctuaries to \n     further enhance the recovery of whale stocks;\n       Whereas many nations of the world have designated waters \n     under their jurisdiction as whale sanctuaries where \n     commercial whaling is prohibited, and additional regional \n     whale sanctuaries have been proposed by nations that are \n     members of the Commission;\n       Whereas one nation has joined the Commission under \n     questionable authority and claims it has a reservation to the \n     moratorium that is not recognized by all other Commission \n     members;\n       Whereas two member nations currently have reservations to \n     the Commission's moratorium on commercial whaling, and one \n     member nation is currently conducting commercial whaling \n     operations in spite of the moratorium and the protests of \n     other nations;\n       Whereas the Commission has adopted several resolutions at \n     recent meetings asking member nations to halt commercial \n     whaling activities conducted under reservation to the \n     moratorium and to refrain from issuing special permits for \n     research involving the killing of whales;\n       Whereas one member nation of the Commission has taken a \n     reservation to the Commission's Southern Ocean Sanctuary and \n     also continues to conduct unnecessary lethal scientific \n     whaling in the Southern Ocean and in the North Pacific Ocean;\n       Whereas whale meat and blubber are being sold commercially \n     from whales killed pursuant to such unnecessary lethal \n     scientific whaling, further undermining the moratorium on \n     commercial whaling;\n       Whereas the Commission's Scientific Committee has \n     repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the scientific \n     need for such lethal research and recognizes the importance \n     of demonstrating and expanding the use of non-lethal \n     scientific research methods;\n       Whereas one member nation in the past unsuccessfully sought \n     an exemption allowing commercial whaling of up to 50 minke \n     whales, now uses a scientific permit for these same vessels \n     to take 50 minke whales, and continues to seek avenues to \n     allow lethal takes of whales by vessels from specific \n     communities in a manner that would undermine the moratorium \n     on commercial whaling;\n       Whereas more than 7,500 whales have been killed in lethal \n     scientific whaling programs since the adoption of the \n     commercial whaling moratorium and the lethal take of whales \n     under scientific permits has increased both in quantity and \n     species, with species now including minke, Bryde's, sei, and \n     sperm whales, and a new proposal has been offered to include \n     fin whales for the first time;\n       Whereas the first international trade of whale meat in 15 \n     years occurred last year between two member countries, and \n     other member countries have stated their intentions to engage \n     in international trade of whale products, despite a ban on \n     such trade under the Convention on International Trade in \n     Endangered Species; and\n       Whereas engaging in commercial whaling under reservation \n     and lethal scientific whaling undermines the conservation \n     program of the Commission: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) at the 55th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling \n     Commission the United States should--\n       (A) remain firmly opposed to commercial whaling;\n       (B) initiate and support efforts to ensure that all \n     activities conducted under reservations to the Commission's \n     moratorium or sanctuaries are ceased;\n       (C) not recognize the reservation to the moratorium against \n     commercial whaling claimed by one nation that has joined the \n     Commission under questionable authority;\n       (D) oppose the lethal taking of whales for scientific \n     purposes unless such lethal taking is specifically authorized \n     by the Scientific Committee of the Commission to be necessary \n     for scientific purposes, seek support for expanding the use \n     of non-lethal research methods, and seek to end the sale of \n     whale meat and blubber from whales killed for unnecessary \n     lethal scientific research;\n       (E) seek the Commission's support for specific efforts by \n     member nations to end trade in whale meat;\n       (F) support the permanent protection of whale populations \n     through the establishment of whale sanctuaries in which \n     commercial whaling is prohibited; and\n\n[[Page S7846]]\n\n       (G) support efforts to expand data collection on whale \n     populations, monitor and reduce whale bycatch and other \n     incidental impacts, create a Conservation Committee, and \n     otherwise expand whale conservation efforts;\n       (2) at the 13th Conference of the Parties to the Convention \n     on International Trade in Endangered Species, the United \n     States should oppose all efforts to reopen international \n     trade in whale meat or downlist any whale population;\n       (3) the United States should make full use of all \n     appropriate diplomatic mechanisms, relevant international \n     laws and agreements, and other appropriate mechanisms to \n     implement the goals set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2); and\n       (4) if the Secretary of Commerce certifies to the \n     President, under section 8(a)(2) of the Fishermen's \n     Protective Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978(a)(2)), that nationals \n     of a foreign country are engaging in trade or a taking which \n     diminishes the effectiveness of the Convention, then the \n     United States should take appropriate steps at its disposal \n     pursuant to Federal law to convince such foreign country to \n     cease such trade or taking.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, As Ranking Member of the Oceans, Fisheries \nand Coast Guard Subcommittee of the Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation, I am pleased to join the Chair of the Subcommittee, \nSenator Snowe, in submitting a resolution regarding the policy of the \nUnited States at the upcoming 55th Annual Meeting of the International \nWhaling Commission, IWC. I wish to also thank my colleagues Mr. \nHollings, Mr. McCain, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Reed, Ms. Collins, \nMr. Dodd, Mr. Smith, Mr. Levin, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Biden, Mr. Corzine, \nMrs. Boxer, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Lieberman for \ncosponsoring as well.\n  The IWC will meet in Berlin from June 16-19, 2003. The IWC was formed \nin 1946 under the International Convention for the Regulation of \nWhaling, in recognition of the fact that whales are highly migratory \nand that international cooperation is necessary for their preservation. \nIn 1982, due to the severe impacts of whaling on the populations of \nlarge whale species, the IWC agreed on an indefinite moratorium on all \ncommercial whaling beginning in 1985.\n  Whales are already under enormous pressure world wide from collisions \nwith ships, entanglement in fishing gear, coastal pollution, noise \nemanating from surface vessels and other sources. The need to conserve \nand protest these magnificent mammals is clear.\n  Despite the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling, significant whaling \nhas continued. First, pursuant to its reservation to the moratorium. \nNorway has continued to commercially harvest whales. Second, Japan has \nbeen using a provision in the Convention--which allows countries to \nissue themselves permits for whaling under scientific purposes--to kill \nwhales in the name of science, and later sell the meat commercially. \nMore than 7500 whales have been killed in lethal scientific whaling \nprograms since the adoption of the commercial whaling moratorium, and \nthe lethal take of whales under scientific permits has increased both \nin quantity and species, with species now including minke, Bryde's sei, \nand sperm whales.\n  The IWC Scientific Committee has not requested any of the information \nobtained by killing these whales and has stated that the scientific \nwhaling data obtained through this so-called research is not required \nfor management. Iceland, which joined the IWC last year under \nquestionable legal authority--subject to the condition that it can \nunilaterally begin commercial whaling after 2006--has recently \nindicated its intent to lethally hunt hundreds of whales, including \nendangered species such as fin whales, pursuant to this same scientific \nwhaling exception.\n  Despite a ban under the Convention on International Trade in \nEndangered Species, the first international trade of whale meat in 15 \nyears occurred last year between Norway and Iceland, both member \ncountries of the IWC. Reports indicate that Norway is seeking to \nbroaden such trade.\n  One positive development expected to be addressed at the meeting is a \nproposal from Mexico to establish a conservation committee under the \nIWC. Such a committee would strengthen the focus of the IWC on \nconservation measures that are critically important for the survival of \ncetaceans.\n  This resolution calls for the U.S. delegation to the IWC to remain \nfirmly opposed to commercial whaling. In addition, this resolution \ncalls for the U.S. oppose the lethal taking of whales for scientific \npurposes unless such lethal taking is specifically authorized by the \nScientific Committee of the Commission. It also calls on the U.S. to \nseek to end the sale of whale meat and blubber from whales killed for \nunnecessary lethal scientific research to remove this perverse \nincentive. The resolution calls for the U.S. delegation to support an \nend to the illegal trade of whale meat and to support the permanent \nprotection of whale populations through the establishment of whale \nsanctuaries in which commercial whaling is prohibited. It further calls \non the U.S. to support the establishment of a Conservation Committee, \nand to otherwise expand whale conservation efforts. Finally, the \nresolution directs the U.S. to make full use of all appropriate \nmechanisms to encourage a change in the behavior of other nations which \nare undermining the protection of these great creatures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/12/senate-section/article/S7846-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7846-S7847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 886.

ARMING CARGO PILOTS AGAINST TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Arming \n     Cargo Pilots Against Terrorism Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During the 107th Congress, both the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed measures that \n     would have armed pilots of cargo aircraft.\n       (2) Cargo aircraft do not have Federal air marshals, \n     trained cabin crew, or determined passengers to subdue \n     terrorists.\n       (3) Cockpit doors on cargo aircraft, if present at all, \n     largely do not meet the security standards required for \n     commercial passenger aircraft.\n       (4) Cargo aircraft vary in size and many are larger and \n     carry larger amounts of fuel than the aircraft hijacked on \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (5) Aircraft cargo frequently contains hazardous material \n     and can contain deadly biological and chemical agents and \n     quantities of agents that cause communicable diseases.\n       (6) Approximately 12,000 of the nation's 90,000 commercial \n     pilots serve as pilots and flight engineers on cargo \n     aircraft.\n       (7) There are approximately 2,000 cargo flights per day in \n     the United States, many of which are loaded with fuel for \n     outbound international travel or are inbound from foreign \n     airports not secured by the Transportation Security \n     Administration.\n       (8) Aircraft transporting cargo pose a serious risk as \n     potential terrorist targets that could be used as weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       (9) Pilots of cargo aircraft deserve the same ability to \n     protect themselves and the aircraft they pilot as other \n     commercial airline pilots.\n       (10) Permitting pilots of cargo aircraft to carry firearms \n     creates an important last line of defense against a terrorist \n     effort to commandeer a cargo aircraft.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     members of a flight deck crew of a cargo aircraft should be \n     armed with a firearm and taser to defend the cargo aircraft \n     against an attack by terrorists that could result in the use \n     of the aircraft as a weapon of mass destruction or for other \n     terrorist purposes.\n       (d) Arming Cargo Pilots Against Terrorism.--Section 44921 \n     of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``passenger'' each place \n     that it appears; and\n       (2) in subsection (k)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) by striking ``or,'' and all that follows; and\n       (ii) by inserting ``or any other flight deck crew \n     member.''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) All-cargo air transportation.--For the purposes of \n     this section, the term air transportation includes all-cargo \n     air transportation.''.\n       (e) Time for Implementation.--The training of pilots as \n     Federal flight deck officers required in the amendments made \n     by subsection (d) shall begin as soon as practicable and no \n     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (f) Effect on Other Laws.--The requirements of subsection \n     (e) shall have no effect on the deadlines for implementation \n     contained in section 44921 of title 49, United States Code, \n     as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 904.

ARMING CARGO PILOTS AGAINST TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Arming \n     Cargo Pilots Against Terrorism Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During the 107th Congress, both the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed measures that \n     would have armed pilots of cargo aircraft.\n       (2) Cargo aircraft do not have Federal air marshals, \n     trained cabin crew, or determined passengers to subdue \n     terrorists.\n       (3) Cockpit doors on cargo aircraft, if present at all, \n     largely do not meet the security standards required for \n     commercial passenger aircraft.\n       (4) Cargo aircraft vary in size and many are larger and \n     carry larger amounts of fuel than the aircraft hijacked on \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (5) Aircraft cargo frequently contains hazardous material \n     and can contain deadly biological and chemical agents and \n     quantities of agents that cause communicable diseases.\n       (6) Approximately 12,000 of the nation's 90,000 commercial \n     pilots serve as pilots and flight engineers on cargo \n     aircraft.\n       (7) There are approximately 2,000 cargo flights per day in \n     the United States, many of which are loaded with fuel for \n     outbound international travel or are inbound from foreign \n     airports not secured by the Transportation Security \n     Administration.\n       (8) Aircraft transporting cargo pose a serious risk as \n     potential terrorist targets that could be used as weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       (9) Pilots of cargo aircraft deserve the same ability to \n     protect themselves and the aircraft they pilot as other \n     commercial airline pilots.\n       (10) Permitting pilots of cargo aircraft to carry firearms \n     creates an important last line of defense against a terrorist \n     effort to commandeer a cargo aircraft.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     members of a flight deck crew of a cargo aircraft should be \n     armed with a firearm and taser to defend the cargo aircraft \n     against an attack by terrorists that could result in the use \n     of the aircraft as a weapon of mass destruction or for other \n     terrorist purposes.\n       (d) Arming Cargo Pilots Against Terrorism.--Section 44921 \n     of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``passenger'' each place \n     that it appears; and\n       (2) in subsection (k)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) by striking ``or,'' and all that follows; and\n       (ii) by inserting ``or any other flight deck crew \n     member.''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) All-cargo air transportation.--For the purposes of \n     this section, the term air transportation includes all-cargo \n     air transportation.''.\n       (e) Time for Implementation.--The training of pilots as \n     Federal flight deck officers required in the amendments made \n     by subsection (d) shall begin as soon as practicable and no \n     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (f) Effect on Other Laws.--The requirements of subsection \n     (e) shall have no effect on the deadlines for implementation \n     contained in section 44921 of title 49, United States Code, \n     as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 904.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1247.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1247) to increase the amount to be reserved \n     during FY2003 for sustainability grants under section 29(l) \n     of the Small Business Act.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the ``Women's Business \nCenters Preservation Act of 2003'' in recognition of the critical need \nto preserve the operations of existing Women's Business Centers \ncurrently serving women entrepreneurs in almost every state and \nterritory. I am pleased to be joined in offering this bill by Senator \nKerry, Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, and Senators Bond, Cantwell, Burns, Levin, Enzi, \nGrassley, Baucus, Domenici, and Bingaman.\n  While I am totally supportive of the Administration's efforts to add \nnew centers to serve a broader constituency, I am very concerned that \nwe may lose valuable resources established in rural and urban areas. \nThe value of the Women's Business Center Program is stated best by the \ntext taken from the Small Business Administration's (SBA) promotional \nmaterials on the Women's Business Center Program:\n\n       Each women's business center is uniquely designed to serve \n     the needs of its individual community and to place special \n     emphasis on helping those who are economically disadvantaged.\n       The Women's Business Center Program has become a strong and \n     effective part of the SBA's entrepreneurial-development \n     efforts.\n\n  And--\n\n       In tough economic times, when both employment and funding \n     resources are harder to come by, support for the WBC Program \n     is more important than ever.\n\n  As Chair of the Small Business Committee, I totally agree with the \nSBA's assessment. In fact, Congress has agreed six times since the \nprogram was introduced through the Small Business Ownership Act of \n1988, and made permanent in 1997, that this program is critical for \nwomen-business owners. The program's appropriations has grown from $2 \nmillion in 1989 to $12 million in 2003, and the results have been \nimpressive. In Fiscal Year 2002, for every dollar invested in the \nprogram, centers reported a return of $161 in gross receipts of \nclients.\n  Even more remarkable is the fact that since 1997, the Women's \nBusiness Centers have served more than 240,000 women entrepreneurs. In \nFiscal Year 2002, almost 86,000 customers were served through the \ncenters. As reported in the SBA Performance and Accountability Report \nof 2002, ``the WBC Program has more than doubled its goal of a 3 \npercent annual increase in the number of clients served in the past two \nyears. This is due in large part to the success of the sustainability \ngrants, which enable established centers to continue SBA funding. SBA \nexpects this trend to continue as more centers become firmly \nestablished and as their reputations for excellence spread.''\n  If we look at the centers that are achieving the greatest impact, it \nis the established centers. The results of their outreach and one-on-\none assistance has made it possible for the Small Business \nAdministration to achieve its goals as it measures the success of the \nproducts and programs offered by these centers.\n  It is true that this month only five Women's Business Centers face \nthe possibility of closing their doors without the dollar-to-dollar \nmatching funds that are provided through sustainability funding. The \nsustainability grant provisions reserve 30.2 percent of the $12 million \nprogram funding for sustainability grants for existing centers with the \nbalance of available funds designated for the creation and operation of \nnew centers. Based on information provided by the SBA, there are not \nsufficient sustainability reserve funds to offer continuation contracts \nto five centers in Iowa, Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and \nWashington. Therefore, SBA has proposed a reduction in grants for all \ncenters currently funded by sustainability grants. By increasing the \nreserve amount to 36 percent, only during Fiscal Year 2003, adequate \nfunds will be available for eligible existing centers operating with \nsustainability grants.\n\n  Next year, there will be more than 20 States and the U.S. Virgin \nIslands affected by the lack of funding to continue operations. Last \nmonth, I introduced the ``Women's Small Business Programs Improvement \nAct of 2003'', S. 1154, to correct deficiencies in the program and \nprovide a fair, competitive process to operate and grow the Women's \nBusiness Center Program. I expect that bill will be taken up as part of \nthe SBA reauthorization legislation my Committee will consider in July.\n  While we can fix the funding problem in the long-run, we still face a \ncrisis today. That is the reason for the bill I am introducing. By \nincreasing the formula for sustainability grants from 30.2 percent to \n36 percent, existing centers would be able to operate without \ndisruption in funding and the programs and services currently offered \nin our communities. This provision will not require an additional \nappropriation, just a reallocation of current funds.\n  I believe this approach offers the best path available to sustain the \ncenters approaching the end of their grant cycles without creating \nundue hardship for all existing centers. At the same time, it should \nnot hinder the Administration's efforts to create new centers.\n  These centers have been extraordinarily successful in providing \nassistance to women in all walks of life--from those who once received \npublic assistance but now operate businesses and create jobs, to women \ntransitioning from employee to small business employer, to established \nwomen-business owners who create and manufacture products for sale at \nhome and abroad. The Centers nurture women entrepreneurs through \nbusiness and financial planning and help with critical issues like \nsecuring funding for startup and expansion. Yet--despite these \nsuccesses--funding questions have long plagued the program.\n  I am committed to resolving the temporary funding crisis through the \nbill I introduce today and will work with my colleagues to ensure the \nlong-term viability of the Women's Business Center program for today's \nwomen entrepreneurs and those of tomorrow.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today as Ranking Member of the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship with my esteemed \ncolleague and Chair of the Committee, Senator Snowe, to offer \nlegislation to fix a funding gap that exists for meritorious Women's \nBusiness Centers that are graduating from the first stage of the \nprogram and entering the sustainability portion.\n  I would first like to thank Senator Snowe for working very closely \nwith me on this issue. Her leadership and support has been invaluable. \nI would also like to thank our House counterparts on the Small Business \nCommittee, Chairman Manzullo and Ranking Member Velazquez, who have \nalso been working diligently on the issue of sustainability grants as \nwe take on the process of reauthorizing the majority of the SBA's \nprograms. In addition, I want to thank all of the cosponsors of this \nlegislation, all of which have shown resounding support for women \nentrepreneurs and recognize the positive impact all small businesses \nhave on our national economy.\n  As I have said on more than one occasion, women business owners do \nnot get the recognition they deserve for their contribution to our \neconomy: Eighteen million Americans would be without jobs today if it \nweren't for\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\nthese entrepreneurs who had the courage and the vision to strike out on \ntheir own. For 18 years, as a member of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I have worked to increase the \nopportunities for these enterprising women in a variety of ways, \nleading to greater earning power, financial independence and asset \naccumulation. These are more than words. For these women, it means \nhaving a bank account, buying a home, sending their children to \ncollege, calling the shots.\n  And helping them at every step are the Women's Business Centers. In \n2002 alone, these centers helped 85,000 women with the business \ncounseling and assistance they likely could not find anywhere else. \nCutting funding for any centers would be harmful to the centers, to the \nwomen they serve, to the States, and to the national economy.\n  The funding gap for Women's Business Centers in the sustainability \nportion of the program exists because the Small Business Administration \nhas chosen to adopt a funding policy that short-changes existing, \nproven centers in order to open new, unproven ones. By incorrectly \ninterpreting the funding formula set up in statute for the Women's \nBusiness Center program, the SBA intends to make way for new centers at \nthe expense of those that are already established, operational and \nsuccessful. This is both bad policy and contrary to congressional \nintent.\n  As the author of the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of \n1999, I can tell that when the Women's Business Centers Sustainability \nAct of 1999 was signed into law, it was Congress's intent to protect \nthe established and successful infrastructure of worthy, performing \ncenters. The law was designed to allow all graduating Women's Business \nCenters that meet certain SBA standards to receive continued funding \nunder sustainability grants, while still allowing for new centers--but \nnot by penalizing those that have already demonstrated their \neffectiveness.\n  Currently there are 81 Women's Business Centers in 48 states. Forty-\nsix of these are in the initial program, 29 are already in \nsustainability, and six more are graduating or have graduated from the \ninitial program and are now applying for sustainability grants. Because \nthe SBA is incorrectly interpreting the funding formula for \nsustainability grants in order to open new centers, and in order to \naccommodate funding for potentially six new sustainability centers, \nthose from Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, North Carolina, Texas, and \nWashington State, the amount of funds reserved for Women's Business \nCenters in sustainability must be increased from 30.2 percent to 36 \npercent.\n  This legislation does just that. It directs the SBA to reserve 36 \npercent of the appropriated funds for the sustainability portion of \nWomen's Business Centers program--even though the SBA already has the \nauthority on its own to increase the reserve--thereby protecting the \nestablished Women's Business Centers from almost certain grant funding \ncuts and still providing enough funds to open six or more new centers \nacross the country.\n  I want to again express my sincere and steadfast support for the \ngrowing community of women entrepreneurs across the Nation and for the \ninvaluable programs through which the SBA provides women business \nowners with the tools they need to succeed. As a long-time advocate for \nwomen entrepreneurs and SBA's programs, my record in support of the \nSBA's women's programs and for women business owners speaks for itself. \nI have continually fought for increased funding for the women's \nprograms at the SBA, for sustaining and expanding the women's business \ncenters, and for giving women entrepreneurs their deserved \nrepresentation within the Federal procurement process, to name a few. \nWith respect to laws assisting women-owned businesses, I have been \nproud to either introduce the underlying legislation or strongly \nadvocate to ensure their passage and adequate funding.\n  This bill is necessary to continue the good work of SBA's Women's \nBusiness Center network, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements regarding this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1247) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1247\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
