Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 400, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Charles W. Pickering, \nSr., of Mississippi, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nCharles W. Pickering, Sr. to be a Circuit Judge on the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I am pleased that the Majority \nLeader has brought this nomination to the floor, as it has been nearly \n2\\1/2\\ years since Judge Pickering was first nominated to this \nposition. Since then, his record has been carefully considered. He \nappeared before the Judiciary Committee in not one, but two lengthy \nhearings. So there has been plenty of opportunity to consider the \nqualifications of Judge Pickering.\n  We have received hundreds of letters of support for Judge Pickering \nfrom the public, members of the bar, as well as political, academic, \nand religious\n\n[[Page S13536]]\n\nleaders. The overwhelming support for Judge Pickering's nomination from \nhis home state of Mississippi speaks volumes, especially since that \nsupport comes from across the political spectrum and from various \nracial and ethnic groups.\n  Last month, the Governor of Mississippi and the other Democratic \nelected statewide officials of Mississippi sent a letter endorsing \nJudge Pickering stating they believe he should be confirmed. In that \nletter they noted that Judge Pickering has worked for racial \nreconciliation and ``helped unify our communities.'' They go on to \nstate, ``Judge Pickering's record demonstrates his commitment to equal \nprotection, equal rights and fairness for all. His values demand he \nrespect the law and constitutional precedents and rule accordingly. He \ndoes. . . . As a judge, he is consistent in his fairness to everyone, \nand deemed well qualified by those who independently review his \nrulings, temperament, and work.''\n  Unfortunately, there has also been an unjustified campaign against \nJudge Pickering, driven largely by Washington special interest groups \nwho do not know Judge Pickering and who have an ideological axe to \ngrind. Make no mistake about it--these groups' political agenda is to \npaint President Bush's fair and qualified nominees as extremists in \norder to keep them off the federal bench. It has been reported that a \nmember of this body has accused the President of ``loading up the \njudiciary with right-wingers who want to turn the clock back to the \n1890s,'' stating that America is under attack from ``the hard right, \nthe mean people.'' That news report also quoted that same Senator as \nhaving said, ``They have this sort of little patina of philosophy but \nunderneath it all is meanness, selfishness and narrow-mindedness.''\n  Now, I am disappointed that this is the level of discourse that \nMembers of this body lower themselves to in their attempt to score \npolitical points or pander to their supporters. That is their right, if \nthey choose to do so, but it is unfortunate that the opponents of Judge \nPickering have attempted to vilify and destroy his good character and \nexemplary record with distortions and disparaging remarks. For example, \nat a recent press event in Arkansas opponents continued their smear \ncampaign, with one group describing Judge Pickering as a ``racist,'' a \n``bigot'' and a ``woman-hater.'' Such remarks reveal which side is \nbased on meanness.\n  So today I must stand and defend the character and record of Judge \nPickering and put these falsehoods, distortions and mean-spirited \nremarks in the trash bin where they belong.\n  I was pleased that, despite this intimidation campaign, President \nBush in January of this year renominated Judge Pickering for the Fifth \nCircuit. The propaganda easily gets in the way, so let me remind my \ncolleagues that after fully evaluating Judge Pickering's integrity, \ncompetence, and temperament, the American Bar Association gave him its \nhighest rating of ``Well Qualified'' not once, but twice--both when he \nwas first nominated in May 2001 and again at the outset of the current \nCongress.\n  Now I expect we will hear complaints from the other side that this \nnomination should not be before the Senate. There are those who say the \nPresident should not have renominated Judge Pickering, since the \nJudiciary Committee had already acted on the nomination. That position, \nof course, ignores the President's constitutional authority to nominate \njudges. And the extraordinary action taken by the Judiciary Committee \nin the last Congress denied the full Senate its constitutional right to \nadvise and consent. Going forward with this nomination today is fair to \nJudge Pickering, fair to the Senate, and fair to President Bush.\n  In addition to these procedural complaints, we have heard and will \nlikely continue to hear a recycling of the tired arguments and well-\nworn parade of horribles--which are horrible in large part because of \ntheir gross distortion of Judge Pickering's upstanding reputation and \nrecord. It is my fervent hope that opponents of this nomination do not \nresort to attacks on Judge Pickering based on his personal convictions \nin an effort to justify their opposition to his nomination. However, I \nam not optimistic that my hopes will be realized, if the unfortunate \nattack by the extremist abortion group, NARAL, the National Abortion \nRights Action League, is any indication. That group, which represents \nwhat this debate is truly about, states ``Charles Pickering of \nMississippi was a founding father of the anti-choice movement, and a \nclear risk to substitute far-right ideology for common-sense \ninterpretation of the law.''\n  I reject that characterization, but in any event Judge Pickering's \nprivate views on abortion, like any judicial nominee's personal views \non political issues, are irrelevant to the confirmation decision. Judge \nPickering has publicly affirmed in his confirmation hearings that he \nwill follow established law and Supreme Court precedents--even those \nwith which he disagrees. His record as a jurist demonstrates his \ncommitment to the rule of law and that he understands that all lower \ncourts, including the 5th Circuit, are bound by Roe and by the more \nrecent Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n  For the record, in 1976, then-political advocate Charles Pickering \njoined a long line of famous Democrats and liberals who believed that \nRoe v. Wade was wrongly decided. Some who shared his view include Byron \nWhite, President Kennedy's appointee to the Supreme Court, Archibald \nCox, the special prosecutor who investigated President Nixon, and \nProfessor William Van Allstyne, a former board member of the ACLU. But \nI repeat--Judge Pickering's political views are less important than his \nexpressed commitment to follow Supreme Court precedent, even precedents \nwith which he may not agree.\n  It is outrageous that Judge Pickering, who has three daughters and \nnine granddaughters, has been smeared as a ``woman-hater'' or ``anti-\nwoman.'' Indeed, numerous women who know and have worked with Judge \nPickering have endorsed his nomination, including civil rights attorney \nDeborah Gambrell, and Deputy U.S. Marshal Melanie Rube.\n  Unlike some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, I have \nsteadfastly resisted efforts to inject personal ideology into the \nconfirmation process. We have all seen the destructive effects of such \ntactics on this institution, on the judicial nominations process, and \non the nominees themselves. So as we debate the qualifications of Judge \nPickering, and as his record is fairly evaluated on the merits, there \ncan be little doubt that he deserves the support of every Member of the \nSenate.\n  Let me step back from the politics of this nomination for a minute \nand talk about the person. Too often, I fear, we Senators get engaged \nin the issues to such an extent that the personal side of individual \nnominees might be forgotten. By many opponents, Charles Pickering is \nportrayed as the stereotype of the Southern white male, locked in the \nthought, culture and traditions of his upbringing in the deep South of \nyesteryear. This is the caricature they attack, but it is not the \nreality of who Judge Pickering is. Though born and raised in the rural \nSouth, and although he has remained geographically near his childhood \nhome, Judge Pickering has traveled far in his personal and professional \nlife. And while the society of his youth has changed dramatically, in \nCharles Pickering we have a nominee with a lifetime record of civic and \ncommunity service in improving racial relations and enforcing laws \nprotecting civil and constitutional rights.\n  Judge Pickering's life story includes an outstanding academic record, \nan exceptional legal career and a life committed to serving others. He \ngraduated first in his law school class at the University of \nMississippi in 1961. While in law school, he was on the Law Journal and \nserved as Chairman of the Moot Court Board. Upon graduating, he became \na partner in a law firm in Mississippi.\n  In the 1960s, when racial tensions were prevalent throughout \nMississippi, Judge Pickering served as City Prosecuting Attorney of \nLaurel and was elected and served four years as County Prosecuting \nAttorney of Jones County. He condemned racially motivated violence and \nencouraged citizens to help the government prosecute those guilty of \nsuch violence. As County Attorney from 1964 to 1968, he assisted the \nFBI in investigating and prosecuting the Klan's attacks on African \nAmericans and civil rights workers.\n  During his time as County Attorney, the KKK infiltrated the \nWoodworkers\n\n[[Page S13537]]\n\nUnion at the Masonite pulpwood plant in Jones County. Klan members beat \npeople, shot into houses, fire bombed homes, and even committed a \nmurder at the Masonite plant. Judge Pickering signed the affidavit \nsupporting the murder indictment of reputed Klansman Dubie Lee for the \nmurder at the Masonite plant. He also testified against the Imperial \nWizard of the KKK, Sam Bowers, at a trial for the firebombing death of \na civil rights activist, indisputably putting himself and his family at \nrisk.\n  Now some may downplay Judge Pickering's actions during this era, but \nI want to emphasize the moral courage that he consistently displayed. \nLet me remind my colleagues of a statement by the chairman of the \nMississippi Legislative Black Caucus, state Rep. Philip West, who is a \nsupporter of Judge Pickering and has defended the judge's civil right's \nrecord. Representative West observed, ``For him to say one word against \nthe Klan was risking his life.'' Mr. President, to hear Judge Pickering \nnow described as a racist or bigot is simply despicable, and I will \nchallenge anybody who does that on this floor.\n  Throughout his career Judge Pickering has shown a commitment to his \ncommunity in both a professional and personal capacity. His numerous \ncivic contributions include serving as the head of the March of Dimes \ncampaign in Jones County; as the chairman of the Jones County Chapter \nof the American National Red Cross; and as the chairman of the Jones \nCounty Heart Fund. In 1963 he was recognized as one of the three \nOutstanding Young Men in Mississippi. Judge Pickering is active in his \nchurch and has served many years as a Sunday school teacher, as \nchairman of the deacons, Sunday school superintendent, and church \ntreasurer.\n  He has worked with organizations to advance issues that promote equal \nopportunity for all individuals in his community, church, political \nparty and State. His work with the race relations committee for Jones \nCounty and the Institute of Racial Reconciliation at the University of \nMississippi are just two examples of his leadership for equal rights in \nthis area. That is why we find such a broad outpouring of support for \nJudge Pickering across all groups and political parties. Allow me to \nshare some of these editorials, articles, and letters with my \ncolleagues.\n  I have already mentioned the letter of support from the current \nGovernor of Mississippi and other Democratic statewide officials. \nAnother letter came from William Winter, the former Democratic Governor \nof Mississippi, who writes, ``I have known Judge Pickering personally \nand professionally for all his adult life. I am convinced that he \npossesses the intellect, the integrity and the temperament to serve \nwith distinction on that [Fifth Circuit] court. He is wise, \ncompassionate and fair, and he is precisely the kind of judge that I \nwould want to decide matters that would personally affect me or my \nfamily. While Judge Pickering and I are members of different political \nparties and do not hold to the same view on many public issues, I have \nalways respected his fairness, objectivity, and decency.''\n  Many Senators are familiar with the name Jorge Rangel, who was \nnominated to the Fifth Circuit by President Clinton. In his letter \nsupporting Judge Pickering's nomination, Mr. Rangel explains, ``I first \nmet Judge Pickering in 1990 in my capacity as a member of the ABA's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary. As the Fifth Circuit's \nrepresentative on the Committee, I conducted the primary investigation \ninto his professional qualifications when he was nominated to a federal \ndistrict judgeship in Mississippi. The Charles W. Pickering that I have \nread about in press reports during the pendency of his current \nnomination does not comport with the Charles W. Pickering that I have \ncome to know in the last thirteen years. Competent, compassionate, \nsensitive and free from bias are terms that aptly describe him. \nAttempts to demonize him are both unfair and out of place in a judicial \nconfirmation proceeding.'' Mr. Rangel notes that Judge Pickering called \nhim during the pendency of his own nomination with words of \nencouragement, and concludes, ``The current impasse in the confirmation \nproceedings is an unfortunate one, because it continues to ensnare many \nnominees of goodwill who have answered the call to serve. For their \nsake and for the ongoing vitality of our federal judiciary, I would \nhope that you and your colleagues can find common ground. A good \nstarting point would be the confirmation of Judge Pickering.''\n  Yet another letter of support came from renowned Las Vegas criminal \ndefense lawyer David Chesnoff, a registered Democrat who serves on the \nBoard of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Mr. \nChesnoff, who tried a case before Judge Pickering, writes, ``At no time \nduring my experience before Judge Pickering . . . did I ever note even \na scintilla of evidence that Judge Pickering did not treat every \ncitizen of our great country with equal fairness and consideration. \nBased on my experience with Judge Pickering, I am offended that people \nare attacking his sterling character. I felt it important to register \nmy position on his behalf and believe he would make an outstanding \naddition to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. . \n. .''\n  I.A. Rosenbaum also wrote to voice his support for Judge Pickering. I \nwill read his letter in its entirety: ``I was the Democratic Mayor of \nMeridian [Mississippi] from 1977 to 1985 and a past President of \nCongregation Beth Israel. Injustice and character assassination galls \nme. Charles Pickering is no racist. He stood tall when our Temple was \nbombed and made very effort to prosecute Sam Bowers who planned the \nbombing. Sincerely, I.A. Rosenbaum.''\n  All of these letters, of course, were generated in response to the \ngross smear campaign waged against Judge Pickering that centered \nlargely on his actions in the Swan case. I expect that we will hear a \ngreat deal about that case during the course of this debate. But let me \nmake something perfectly clear to everyone here. Judge Pickering's \nactions in the Swan case had absolutely nothing to do with racial \ninsensitivity. His lifetime of striving to promote racial \nreconciliation and fighting prejudice provides irrefutable evidence of \nthat. Rather, Judge Pickering's actions in the Swan case had everything \nto do with his penchant for going easy on first-time criminal \ndefendants.\n\n  Judge Pickering's record is replete with examples where he has seen \nthe rehabilitative potential of first-time offenders and accordingly \nsentenced them to lighter sentences. Take, for example, the case of a \n20-year-old African-American drug defendant who faced a 5-year \nmandatory minimum. Judge Pickering reduced that to 30 months and \nrecommended the defendant be allowed to participate in an intensive \nconfinement program, further reducing his sentence.\n  Another young African-American drug defendant with no previous felony \nconvictions faced a 40-month sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. \nJudge Pickering continued his case for a year, placed him under strict \nsupervised home release for 1 year, and then used his good conduct \nduring home release to establish the basis for a downward departure. \nJudge Pickering ultimately sentenced him to 6 months of home \nconfinement, 5 years probation and no prison time.\n  A third 20-year-old African-American male faced between 70 and 87 \nmonths under the guidelines for a drug crime. Judge Pickering downward \ndeparted to 48 months and recommended that he participate in intensive \nconfinement, which further reduced his sentence. The defendant's lawyer \ncalled Judge Pickering's compassionate sentence a ``life changing \nexperience'' for this defendant.\n  In another case, an African-American woman faced a minimum sentence \nof 188 months. The government made a motion for a downward departure, \nand Judge Pickering continued the case six times over a period of 2\\1/\n2\\ years to allow the prosecution to develop a basis for a further \ndownward departure. In the end, Judge Pickering reduced her sentence by \nmore than half, sentencing her to 63 months.\n  The last case I want to discuss is the Barnett case. The Barnetts, an \ninterracial couple, were both before Judge Pickering, charged with drug \ncrimes. Both were facing sentences between 120 to 150 months but plea \nbargained with the government for a maximum 5-year sentence. Judge \nPickering sentenced Mr. Barnett to the 5 years but with\n\n[[Page S13538]]\n\nMrs. Barnett, who had Crohn's disease and was taking care of one of her \nsick children, he departed downward 22 levels and sentenced her to 12 \nmonths of home confinement. At a later time, the government made a \nmotion for a downward departure for Mr. Barnett and Judge Pickering \nreduced his sentence as well. Mrs. Barnett later wrote a letter, as she \nsaid, out of gratitude for all Judge Pickering did for her and her \nfamily. She stated she had learned a valuable lesson, that her family \nhad been brought closer together, and that her husband had changed in \nmany positive ways. She concluded, ``I want to thank you for your part \nin all of this, and I can assure you that your thoughtfulness and just \nconsideration is greatly appreciated and will never be forgotten.''\n  Thirteen years ago Judge Pickering began his service as a U.S. \nDistrict Judge. He was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate, which \nincluded a good number of members who are still serving in the Senate \ntoday, including 25 members of the Democratic caucus. That affirmative \nvote was well deserved given Judge Pickering's excellent academic \nrecord, his distinguished legal career, his outstanding character, and \nhis superb record of public and community service. That record has only \nbeen enhanced by his service on the bench.\n  Judge Pickering deserves an up or down vote on the Senate floor. So I \nurge my colleagues to use proper standards, consider the entire record, \nand use a fair process for considering Judge Pickering's nomination. \nThose who know him best, Democrats and Republicans, representing a \nbroad cross section of citizens, endorse his nomination. An unbiased \nconsideration of Judge Pickering's character and experience will lead \nevery fair-minded person that Judge Pickering's record fully justifies \nhis confirmation to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  As the President said recently, ``The United States Senate must step \nup to serious constitutional responsibilities. I've nominated many \ndistinguished and highly-qualified Americans to fill vacancies on the \nfederal, district and circuit courts. Because a small group of Senators \nis willfully obstructing the process, some of these nominees have been \ndenied up or down votes for months, even years. More than one-third of \nmy nominees for the circuit courts are still awaiting a vote. The \nneedless delays in the system are harming the administration of justice \nand they are deeply unfair to the nominees, themselves. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee should give a prompt and fair hearing to every \nsingle nominee, and send every nomination to the Senate floor for an up \nor down vote.''\n  I agree with President Bush that this obstruction is unfair and \nharmful. I have taken to the Senate floor on numerous occasions to \ncondemn the tactic of forcing judicial nominees through cloture votes. \nMy position has been the same regardless of whether the nominee was \nappointed by a Democratic president or a Republican president. I am \nproud to say that during my nearly 30 years in the Senate, I have never \nvoted against cloture for a judicial nominee, even on the rare occasion \nthat I opposed a judicial nomination and ultimately voted against it.\n\n  Yet, once again, some Senate Democrats are filibustering another \n``Well Qualified'' nominee--preventing an up-or-down vote on this judge \nwho is supported by a majority of the Senate. This is tyranny of the \nminority and it is unfair. Senator Kennedy has asked ``What's the point \nof pushing yet again for a nominee who probably cannot get enough \nsupport to be confirmed because he doesn't deserve to be confirmed?'' \nWith all due respect, I must disagree with the premise of his question. \nJudge Pickering does deserve to be confirmed, and, if an up-or-down \nvote were allowed, does have enough support to be confirmed.\n  As I have stated before, requiring a supermajority vote on this or \nany judicial nominee thwarts the Senate from exercising its \nconstitutional duty of advise and consent. The Constitution is clear on \nthis matter; it contemplates that a vote by a simple majority of the \nSenate will determine the fate of a judicial nominee. There is nothing \nin the Constitution that gives that power to a minority of 41 Senators.\n  Furthermore, a supermajority requirement for judicial nominees \nneedlessly injects even more politics into the already over-politicized \nconfirmation process. I believe that there are certain areas that \nshould be designated as off-limits from political activity. The \nSenate's role in confirming lifetime-appointed Article III judges--and \nthe underlying principle that the Senate perform that role through the \nmajority vote of its members--is one such issue. Nothing less depends \non the recognition of these principles than the continued, untarnished \nrespect in which we hold our third branch of Government--the one branch \nof Government intended to be above political influence.\n  Over the past 2 years I have been accused of changing or breaking \ncommittee rules and of pushing ideological nominees. The record will \nshow that these charges are without foundation. In fact, it is Senate \nDemocrats that have pushed the notion of injecting ideology into the \nconfirmation process and have taken unprecedented steps to oppose \njudicial nominees.\n  Opponents are using a variety of tactics to obstruct President Bush's \njudicial nominees. Supported by the extremist liberal interest groups, \nwho themselves use even more shameful tactics to defeat these nominees, \nwe have seen opponents distort the record, make unreasonable demands \nfor privileged information, and force multiple cloture votes. This is \nall part of the strategy of changing the ground rules on judicial \nnominations that Senate Democrats have implemented.\n  I am not the only one who is concerned about the dangerous precedents \nthat some Democrats have established. Before Miguel Estrada, the \nfilibuster was never used to defeat a circuit court nominee. The \nWashington Post--hardly a bastion of conservatism--warned in a February \n5, 2003, editorial that staging a filibuster against a judicial nominee \nwould be ``a dramatic escalation of the judicial nomination wars.'' The \nPost urged Democrats to ``stand down'' on any attempt to deny a vote on \nthe particular judicial nominee, Miguel Estrada. The editorial went on \nto warn that ``a world in which filibusters serve as an active \ninstrument of nomination politics is not one either party should \nwant.'' Unfortunately, this advice was rejected and the Senate was \nforced to endure an unprecedented seven cloture votes before Mr. \nEstrada requested his nomination be withdrawn. That was a sad day for \nthe Senate--one I hope is never repeated.\n  Similarly, the Wall Street Journal, on February 6, 2003 stated \n``Filibusters against judges are almost unheard of. . . . If \nRepublicans let Democrats get away with this abuse of the system now, \nit will happen again and again.'' Unfortunately, that prediction came \ntrue, as the Senate is now blocked from acting on numerous judicial \nnominees because of filibusters.\n  But it is not just editorial pages which have denounced the use of \nthe filibuster. In fact, some of my Democratic colleagues have \nexpressed similar views. For example, Senator Daschle, the Democratic \nLeader stated: ``As Chief Justice Rehnquist has recognized: 'The Senate \nis surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but \nafter the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him \ndown.' An up or down vote, that is all we ask. . . .''\n  Similarly, Senator Leahy, my friend, colleague, and ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee said ``. . . I, too, do not want to see the \nSenate go down a path where a minority of the Senate is determining a \njudge's fate on votes of 41.'' And Senator Kennedy, the senior member \non the Judiciary Committee stated, ``Nominees deserve a vote. If our \nRepublican colleagues don't like them, vote against them. But don't \njust sit on them--that's obstruction of justice.''\n  I hope that Judge Pickering's nomination is not another example of a \ndouble standard or a strategy of some of my Democratic colleagues to \nchange the ground rules on judicial nominees. I hope that my Democratic \ncolleagues will exercise the same independence that I did when I joined \nthem to invoke cloture on the nominations of Clinton judicial nominees. \nJudge Pickering deserves an up-or-down vote, and he deserves to be \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. President, there are so many other things I could say, but I want \nto leave enough time for our Mississippi Senators.\n  Let me just say this. I know Judge Pickering. I have gotten to know \nhim\n\n[[Page S13539]]\n\nbetter through this ordeal he has gone through over the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears than I ever thought I would. He is a fine man. His family is a \nfine family. He sent his kids to integrated schools--the first \nintegrated schools in Mississippi they could go to. One of them now \nsits in the Congress, Chip Pickering, who is one of the fine Congress \npeople here, and everybody who knows him knows it.\n  What they have done to him is awful. It is awful. I think it is time \nfor the Democrats to break free from these rotten outside groups that \njust play politics on everything and bring everything down to the issue \nof abortion.\n  I ask unanimous consent relevant material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Watkins Ludlam Winter\n\n\n                                              & Stennis, P.A.,\n\n                                        Jackson, MS, May 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G.

I am convinced that he possesses \n     the intellect, the integrity and the temperament to serve \n     with distinction on that court. He is wise, compassionate and \n     fair, and he is precisely the kind of judge that I would want \n     to decide matters that would personally affect me or my \n     family.\n       While Judge Pickering and I are members of different \n     political parties and do not hold to the same view of many \n     public issues, I have always respected his fairness, \n     objectivity and decency.\n       He was a member of the Mississippi State Senate when, as \n     Lieutenant Governor, I presided over that body. I found him \n     to be one of the most diligent, hardest working and most \n     respected legislators with whom I served.\n       I would single out for special commendation his sensitivity \n     and concern in the area of race relations. I had the \n     privilege of serving as a member of President Clinton's \n     National Advisory Board Race several years ago. One of the \n     impressive initiatives that resulted from the work of that \n     Board was the establishment of the Institute for Racial \n     Reconciliation at the University of Mississippi.\n       Becasue of his long-standing commitment to the cause of \n     racial equity and racial reconciliation, Judge Pickering was \n     a leader in the formation of the Institute and served as a \n     founding member of its Advisory Board.\n       As a member of the Mississippi Bar for over fifty years and \n     a former Governor of Mississippi, I am pleased to vouch for \n     Judge Pickering as being most worthy of confirmation as a \n     judge of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n           Sincerely,\n     William F. Winter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Watkins Ludlam Winter\n\n\n                                              & Stennis, P.A.,\n\n                                    Jackson, MS, October 25, 2001.\n     Hon.

He is certainly no right-wing ideologue. He will \n     bring a fair, open and perceptive mind to the consideration \n     of all issues before the court.\n       I have been particularly impressed with his commitment to \n     racial justice and equity. He and I have worked together for \n     a number of years in the advancement of racial \n     reconciliation, and we serve together on the board of the \n     Institute for Racial Reconciliation at the University of \n     Mississippi. He has been one of this state's most dedicated \n     and effective voices for breaking down racial barriers.\n       Judge Pickering has demonstrated in every position of \n     leadership which he has held a firm commitment to the \n     maintenance of a just society. I believe that he will reflect \n     those values as a member of the Fifth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, and I commend him to you as one who in my opinion \n     will be a worthy addition to that body.\n           Sincerely,\n     William F.

Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Hart \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: I write this letter to urge \n     approval of Judge Charles W. Pickering, Sr.'s nomination to \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       I first met Judge Pickering in 1990 in my capacity as a \n     member of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal \n     Judiciary. As the Fifth Circuit's representative on the \n     Committee, I conducted the primary investigation into his \n     professional qualifications when he was nominated to a \n     federal district judgeship in Mississippi. I spent many hours \n     discussing his qualifications with judges, lawyers and lay \n     people throughout the state. I also interviewed Judge \n     Pickering, during which we touched on matters relevant to his \n     qualifications to serve as a federal judge.\n       The Charles W. Pickering that I have read about in press \n     reports during the pendency of his current nomination does \n     not comport with the Charles W. Pickering that I have come to \n     know in the last thirteen years. Competent, compassionate, \n     sensitive and free from bias are terms that aptly describe \n     him. Throughout his professional career as a lawyer and as a \n     judge, Judge Pickering has tried to do what he thought was \n     right, consistent with his oaths as an officer of the court \n     and as a judge. Attempts to demonize him are both unfair and \n     out of place in a judicial confirmation proceeding.\n       On a more personal note, I still remember the words of \n     encouragement I received from Judge Pickering while my own \n     nomination to the Fifth Circuit was pending before the \n     Judiciary Committee. On one occasion, Judge Pickering called \n     me and graciously offered to contact Senator Lott's office to \n     see if anything could be done to secure a hearing for my \n     nomination. The word came back that Senator Lott was willing \n     to help, but the process could not go forward until my home \n     state senators returned their blue slips. That never \n     happened. To this day, I very much appreciate the fact that \n     Judge Pickering reached out to me and offered to help at a \n     time when my pleas for a hearing had fallen on deaf ears.\n       The current impasse in the confirmation proceedings is an \n     unfortunate one, because it continues to ensure many nominees \n     of goodwill who have answered the call to serve. For their \n     sake and for the ongoing vitality of our federal judiciary, I \n     would hope that you and your colleagues can find common \n     ground. A good starting point would be the confirmation of \n     Judge Pickering.\n       Thank you.\n           Yours truly,\n     Jorge C. Rangel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Goodman & Chesnoff,\n\n                                  Las Vegas, NV, January 16, 2003.\n     Re the Honorable Judge Charles W. Pickering, Sr.'s nomination \n         to the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th \n         Circuit.\n\n     Chairman Orrin Hatch,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: I had the pleasure of meeting with you \n     when my partner Las Vegas Mayor, Oscar B. Goodman and I \n     represented former United States District Court Judge Harry \n     Chaiborne, in his impeachment proceeding in the United States \n     Senate. I remember your open-mindedness and fairness in \n     considering our case.\n       I am presently on the Board of the National Association of \n     Criminal Defense Lawyers and a registered Democrat. I have \n     been a financial supporter for the election of President \n     William Jefferson Clinton and a contributor to the campaign \n     of Vice-President Albert Gore, when he ran for President. I \n     have been an aggressive advocate on the part of citizens \n     accused of crimes and have appeared in criminal proceedings \n     in thirty of our fifty states.\n       I had the privilege and pleasure of meeting Judge Pickering \n     several years ago when I was hired by the former mayor of \n     Biloxi, Mississippi, Peter J. Halet to represent him in a \n     very complex and high profile federal trial assigned to Judge \n     Pickering in the United States District Court in Hattiesburg, \n     Mississippi.\n       The case was quite celebrated and the allegations were of \n     the most serious nature. There were complicated legal \n     questions and difficult human dynamics. Needless to say, the \n     emotions ran high in the local community as well as among the \n     participants. Having arrived in Judge Pickering's courtroom \n     from across the country, I did not know what to expect in \n     terms of my reception.\n       Sufficed to say, from day-one Judge Pickering treated all \n     of the lawyers I brought with me to assist in the process, my \n     jury expert and myself with courtesy and patience.\n       Certain tactics and techniques that we utilized may not \n     have been used by other lawyers appearing before Judge \n     Pickering in earlier cases, but he kept an open mind, \n     listened to our position and gave me as fair a trial as I \n     have received in any United States District Court, anytime.\n       Judge Pickering had a grasp of the difficult legal issues \n     and addressed the case with objectivity and fairness. At no \n     time during my experience before Judge Pickering, including \n     the jury selection process, did I ever note even a scintilla \n     of evidence that Judge Pickering did not treat every citizen \n     of our great country with equal fairness and consideration. \n     Based on my experience with Judge Pickering, I am offended \n     that people are attacking his sterling character. I felt it \n     important to register my position on his behalf and believe \n     he would make an outstanding addition to the United States \n     Court\n\n[[Page S13540]]\n\n     of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, of which I am admitted and \n     have appeared.\n           Very truly yours,\n     David Z.

Pickering, III to the Fifth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. Charles Pickering is an able, outstanding \n     and fair minded judge. I could not conceive that he would \n     exhibit gender bias toward women inside or outside a court of \n     law.\n       As an African American I have personal knowledge and \n     experience of his efforts to heal the wounds of racial \n     prejudice, and to resolve conflicts between the races in our \n     state. As someone who experiences racial prejudice, both open \n     and subtle, I can only say that my admiration for Judge \n     Pickering is immense.\n       I sincerely appreciate all the efforts made by you and your \n     committee in order to insure fairness in our federal \n     judiciary. I urge you and your fellow committee members to \n     recognize diverse opinions of persons, such as myself, who \n     function and work at ground level in our local communities.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Johnny L.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: A few days ago I ran into Judge \n     Pickering at lunch and congratulated him on his being \n     selected for an appointment to the Fifth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. I thereafter learned of opposition to his \n     appointment and felt compelled to write this letter.\n       As an African American attorney who practices in the \n     federal courts of the Southern District of Mississippi, where \n     Judge Pickering has sat for the past eleven (11) years, I am \n     concerned that he has come under scrutiny. I have appeared \n     before Judge Pickering on numerous occasions during the past \n     eleven (11) years, most often than not, in cases involving \n     violations of civil rights and employment discrimination \n     matters. I have found Judge Pickering not only to be a fair \n     jurist, but one who is concerned with the integrity of the \n     entire judicial process and assures every participant of a \n     ``level playing field'' and a judge who will apply the law \n     without regard for the sensitive nature of cases of this \n     sort, which may have caused him personal discomfort.\n       I have personally seen him go overboard in working to bring \n     reconciliation in matters wherein parties, because of lack of \n     understanding of the law or actual ill will, may have \n     committed violations because of lack of knowledge, etc. I \n     have even been appointed by Judge Pickering to represent \n     indigents who have legitimate claims but not the expertise or \n     money to litigate the same, when he could have selected \n     attorneys who might not bring the passion and true concern to \n     bear to insure that the litigants rights are protected. Even \n     when I don't prevail, my clients know that they have had \n     their ``day in court'' before a judge who is open-minded, \n     fair and just and will follow the law without regard to \n     color, economic status or political persuasion.\n       I have known Judge Pickering prior to his taking the bench \n     and have seen him advocate the rights of the poor and those \n     disenfranchised by the system. Over the past 11 years, I have \n     seen him bring the same passion for fairness and equity to \n     the federal bench.\n       Though I personally hate to see him leave the Southern \n     District, I am proud to say that his honesty, integrity and \n     sense of fair play would make him an excellent candidate for \n     the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n           Sincerely,\n     Deborah Jones Gambrell.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Hattiesburg, MS,\n\n                                                 October 25, 2001.\n     Hon.

I have had the privilege of working in Judge \n     Pickering's courtroom for the past two years as a Deputy \n     United States Marshal.\n       Judge Pickering brings honor and compassion to the bench. \n     His courtroom is truly a center of justice and fairness for \n     men and women of every race and religion. As a Deputy U.S. \n     Marshal, I have been present for most of his courtroom \n     sessions. I am always impressed by Judge Pickering's rulings \n     and opinions. He puts his heart and soul into preparing each \n     case.\n       I am overwhelmed at the compassion that Judge Pickering \n     shows each and every defendant. He truly cares for the \n     welfare of these defendants and their families. I believe it \n     grieves him to see mothers and fathers separated from their \n     loved ones. As a man of great conviction, I know that Judge \n     Pickering would make a positive impact on the Fifth Circuit.\n       As a Deputy U.S. Marshal, I am proud to serve under a man \n     who personifies justice. As a citizen of the United States, I \n     am glad to know that in times like these, we have Judge \n     Charles Pickering in the position to maintain dignity and \n     responsibility in our courtroom. As a woman, I am pleased at \n     the thought that we will have Judge Pickering looking out for \n     the rights of women and children from the beach of the Fifth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n           Sincerely,\n     Melanie Rube.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Holcomb Dunbar,\n\n                                     Oxford, MS, October 25, 2001.\n     Re U.S. District Judge Charles Pickering.\n\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: This letter is to submit for your \n     consideration my unqualified endorsement of U.S. District \n     Judge Charles Pickering for confirmation of his appointment \n     by the President to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth \n     Circuit.\n       I have practiced law in the State of Mississippi for more \n     than 40 years.

I have never known Judge Pickering \n     to be a person or judge that was anything other than fair and \n     impartial in his conduct toward women or minorities.\n       I do not think anyone questions his judicial \n     qualifications. The American Bar Association has deemed him \n     ``well qualified.''\n       For these reasons, I strongly endorse his confirmation to \n     the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n           Respectfully,\n     Jack F.

I have \n     practiced in his Court on many occasions throughout the last \n     12 or 13 years and I can only say this is the most fair Judge \n     before whom I have ever appeared. Not only is he fair, he \n     wants to be fair to all parties. I have never known of any \n     indifference or prejudice that he has shown against blacks or \n     women and in my own humble opinion, it is regrettable that he \n     has been accused of such.\n       I presently serve as Chairman of the Forrest County \n     Democratic Executive Committee and although Charles was prior \n     to his judicial service, a Republican, I do not hesitate to \n     signify to any person that he is fair and impartial, and has \n     been so even to myself, a Democrat.\n           Very sincerely yours,\n                                                 William H. Jones.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I am \nhappy to yield whatever time the distinguished senior Senator from \nMississippi desires.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Hatch.\n  It is a pleasure to serve with my distinguished colleague from \nMississippi who will be speaking later today.\n  I say to Senator Hatch, thank you for your leadership, your \nsensitivity as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and for your \nspecific help in the confirmation process of Judge Charles Pickering to \nbe on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I also want to express appreciation to Senator Frist, the leader, for \ngiving us time in a very busy schedule to take up\n\n[[Page S13541]]\n\nthis nomination. But it is time we go forward with a vote on the \nnomination of this good and honest and very capable Federal judge, \nCharles Pickering.\n  Mr. President, as I say, I rise today in strong support of Judge \nCharles Pickering's nomination to be a judge on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit. I am pleased that this day has finally \ncome, and that after almost 2\\1/2\\ years of waiting, we are finally \nmoving forward with the consideration of Judge Pickering's nomination \nhere on the floor of the Senate. I am grateful to Senator Hatch for his \nhard work in leading the Judiciary Committee to its recent approval of \nJudge Pickering's nomination to the Fifth Circuit, and this important \nvote has led to our being able to begin debate on this outstanding \nnominee.\n  As many Senators will recall, Judge Pickering was unanimously \napproved by the Judiciary Committee in the fall of 1990 to be a United \nStates District Court Judge for the Southern District of Mississippi. \nHe was then unanimously confirmed by the full Senate. He has served \nhonorably in this position for 13 years, and I am happy that the \nPresident has re-nominated Judge Pickering for a promotion to the Fifth \nCircuit after his nomination was blocked from consideration by the full \nSenate during the 107th Congress.\n  Charles Pickering and I have known each other for over 40 years, \nwhich doesn't seem possible, and I can personally attest that there is \nno other person in the State of Mississippi who is more eminently \nqualified to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. President, Charles Pickering graduated first in his class from \nthe University of Mississippi Law School in 1961, and received his B.A. \ndegree from Ole Miss with honors in 1959. He practiced law for almost \n30 years in Jones County, Mississippi, and during this time served \nstints as the prosecuting attorney for Jones County and the City of \nLaurel during the 1960's. From 1972 to 1980, Charles served in the \nMississippi State Senate. This was a part-time position, with full-time \ndemands I might add, that allowed him to continue his law practice \nduring this period.\n  Judge Pickering has had an impeccable reputation on the bench in \nMississippi, and he is respected by all sectors of the Mississippi and \nnational legal community. Scores of attorneys, community leaders, and \nother Mississippians from all walks of life have applauded his \nnomination to the Fifth Circuit. What a compliment to Judge Pickering, \nMr. President, for him to have the support of those who know him best--\nthe people he works with in his professional life and spends time with \nin his personal endeavors. It is no surprise that the ABA's Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary found him ``Well-Qualified'' for \nappointment as a Fifth Circuit judge.\n  Furthermore, he is highly respected within the federal judiciary. He \nserved on the Board of Directors of the Federal Judges Association from \n1997 until 2001, and was a member of the Executive Committee for the \nfinal 2 years of his term. He recently completed a term of service on \nthe Judicial Branch Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates.\n  Judge Pickering has been involved in numerous community and public \nservice endeavors. He has headed the March of Dimes campaign in Jones \nCounty, Mississippi, and served as Chairman of the Jones County Chapter \nof the American National Red Cross. He was also a major participant in \nthe formation of the Jones County Economic Development Authority, \nserving as its first chairman.\n  Charles Pickering has been a leader in his community and in the state \non race relations, and in standing up for what is right. In 1967, at \nthe risk of harm to himself and his family, he testified against the \nImperial Wizard of the KKK, Sam Bowers, for the fire-bombing death of \ncivil rights activist Vernon Dahmer. He was active in his community's \nefforts to integrate their public schools, sending all four of his \nchildren to the integrated schools. In 1981, Charles Pickering \nrepresented an African American man falsely accused of robbing a white \nteen-aged girl. Although his decision to provide this legal \nrepresentation was not supported by some in his community, he \naggressively represented his client, who was found not guilty. He was a \nmotivating force behind and currently serves on the Board of Directors \nof the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation at the \nUniversity of Mississippi, our mutual alma mater.\n\n  He has also volunteered for the Jones County Heart Fund, the Jones \nCounty Drug Education Council, and the Economic Development Authority \nof Jones County. He has always been very active in his church, serving \nas a Sunday school teacher, Chairman of the Deacons, Sunday school \nsuperintendent, and church treasurer. From 1983-85, he was the \nPresident of the Mississippi Baptist Convention.\n  In addition to his many professional and civic activities, Charles \nPickering has also been a good farmer. He was the first president of \nthe National Catfish Farmers Association and was a leader in catfish \nfarming during its early days. Most importantly, though, is the fact \nthat Charles has always put his family first, even with the commitments \nI have just described. He has a wonderful wife and four grown children \nwith spouses and families of their own, including his son, Congressman \nChip Pickering, who is a former member of my staff. Representative \nPickering's integrity is a further testament to the caliber of Judge \nCharles Pickering's character.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering this \nimportant nomination today, because the Senate needs to act now to \nconfirm Judge Pickering. He is exceptionally well-qualified for \nelevation to the Fifth Circuit, and I strongly endorse his nomination. \nHe has been waiting far, far too long for a debate and vote on his \nnomination. I urge my colleagues to support moving forward with an up-\nor-down vote on this important nomination. I know that Judge \nPickering's elevation to the Fifth Circuit is supported by a majority \nof Senators, and it is time for this majority to be heard.\n  As I said, he has been waiting 2\\1/2\\ years in this process. \nUnfortunately, last year he was defeated on a party-line vote and \nprevented from being reported out of the Judiciary Committee. But this \nyear he was reported to the floor. He deserves to have his story told, \nand even a vote to occur on his nomination.\n  I have known this man and his family and his neighbors, the people in \nhis church, the school officials, the minority leaders in his community \nfor over 40 years.\n  I think there used to be a time when a Senator vouched for a person, \na nominee from his State, and it carried real weight. I am here to tell \nyou, this is one of the finest men, one of the finest family men, one \nof the smartest individuals, one of the best judges I have known in my \nlife. There is no question that he has the educational background, the \nqualifications, the experience, the judicial demeanor, and also the \nleadership to bring about unity, not division.\n  That has been the story of his life. He has always been a unifier. He \nhas always been willing to step up and take on the tough battles in his \nhome county and in our State of Mississippi.\n  Senator Hatch made reference to the fact that when he was county \nattorney, years ago, in the late 1960s he had the courage to actually \nwork with the FBI and to testify against the Imperial Wizard of the Ku \nKlux Klan, something not very healthy for your political career or even \nyour life at the time. But he took a stand and was defeated for \nreelection, to a large degree because of that.\n  He continued to work in his community and provide leadership. He \npracticed law for 30 years. If you want to look at his qualifications, \nhere they are listed. He was not just an average student. He graduated \nfirst in his class from law school. He graduated from undergraduate \nschool with honors. He has the highest rating by Martindale Hubbell. In \n1990, he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to be a district \njudge. He has been very good in his rulings. In fact, of those that \nwere appealed, the reversal rate is only 7.9 percent, which is \nextraordinarily good. He received from the American Bar Association--\nnot once but twice--their highest rating of well qualified. They looked \ninto allegations that were made against him after his first \nconsideration by the committee and came back and said: He is still well \nqualified--not a group known for dismissing allegations or charges that \nwere made against him.\n\n[[Page S13542]]\n\n  He certainly has the qualifications and the experience. In his \ncommunity, he is endorsed by Democrats and Republicans, elected \nofficials of both parties, the head of the local NAACP. The people who \nknow him best, who know his family, who see him every day, say this is \na good man, qualified to be on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  He has served on the Federal bench for 13 years. He is highly \nrespected within the Federal judiciary. In fact, he has served in a \nleadership capacity there. He has been on the board of directors of the \nFederal Judges Association from 1997 to 2001, and he was on the \nexecutive committee for the final 2 years of his term. He recently \ncompleted a term of service on the Judicial Branch Committee of the \nJudicial Conference. He is respected by his fellow judges.\n  I know some of the Senators on both sides of the aisle have had \nFederal judges in their States also vouch for this good man to be on \nthe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  He has had letters of endorsement from a wide span of community \nleaders and State leaders in our State, including all five statewide \nelected Democrats.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                             State of Mississippi,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                  Jackson, MI, September 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Bldg., \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: The nomination of Federal \n     District Judge Charles Pickering to the U.S. Fifth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals is once again coming before the U.S. Senate \n     in Washington for consideration. We are the Democratic \n     statewide officials of Mississippi.\n       We know Charles Pickering personally and have known him for \n     many years. We believe Judge Pickering should be confirmed \n     for this appointment and serve on that court.\n        Judge Pickering chose to take stands during his career \n     that were difficult and often courageous. He has worked for \n     racial reconciliation and helped unify our communities. \n     Toward that objective, he formed a biracial commission in his \n     home county to address community issues and led an effort to \n     start a program for at-risk youth. Furthermore, Judge \n     Pickering helped establish and serves on the board of the \n     Institute for Racial Reconciliation at the University of \n     Mississippi.\n        We are all active Democrats. Charles Pickering was, before \n     rising to the Federal Bench, an active Republican. It is our \n     hope that Party labels can be transcended in this fight over \n     his nomination. We should cast a blind eye to partisanship \n     when working to build a fair and impartial judiciary.\n        The U.S. Senate has a chance to demonstrate a commitment \n     to fairness. Judge Pickering's record demonstrates his \n     commitment to equal protection, equal rights and fairness for \n     all. His values demand he respect the law and constitutional \n     precedents and rule accordingly. He does.\n        He has never been reversed on any substantive issue in a \n     voting rights or employment discrimination case that has come \n     before him. His rulings reflect his support for the principle \n     of one man one vote. Judge Pickering ruled the 1991 \n     Mississippi legislative redistricting plan unconstitutional \n     for failing to conform to one man one vote standards and \n     ordered a new election as the remedy.\n        In 1963, at the age of 26, Judge Pickering was elected \n     Prosecuting Attorney of Jones County. While holding this \n     office he confronted the effects of racial hatred and saw \n     firsthand its result in the form of extensive Ku Klux Klan \n     violence. It was a horrible time in Mississippi. Judge \n     Pickering took a public stand against the Klan violence and \n     terrorism. He worked with the FBI to prosecute and stop the \n     Klan. Charles Pickering testified against the Klan leader Sam \n     Bowers in the murder of civil rights activist Vernon Dahmer.\n        In the 1960's Charles Pickering stood up for the voting \n     rights of African Americans, and for the equal protection of \n     all. In the 1970's and 1980's he led his community, his \n     children's school, his political party and his church in \n     integration and inclusion. Today, he is a voice for racial \n     reconciliation across our state. As a judge, he is consistent \n     in his fairness to everyone, and deemed well qualified by \n     those who independently review his rulings, temperament and \n     work.\n        Mississippi has made tremendous progress in race relations \n     since the 1960s and Charles Pickering has been part of that \n     progress. We ask the United States Senate to stand up to \n     those that malign the character of Charles Pickering, and \n     give him an up or down vote on the Senate Floor.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Ronnie Musgrove,\n       Governor of Mississippi.\n     Eric Clark,\n       Secretary of State.\n     Mike Moore,\n       Attorney General.\n     Lester Spell,\n       Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce.\n     George Dale,\n       Commissioner of Insurance.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have other letters of endorsement and articles supporting \nJudge Charles Pickering, and I ask unanimous consent that they be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From: Representative Phillip West, Chairman.\n     Date: April 25, 2003.\n     Re: Judge Charles Pickering.\n\n\n             position statement on judge charles pickering\n\n       After having listened to Judge Charles Pickering during his \n     meeting with the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus, \n     reviewed materials concerning Judge Pickering's record as a \n     Jones County attorney, and spoken with some of the members of \n     the Institute of Racial Reconciliation, I have decided to \n     reverse my position regarding Judge Pickering's nomination to \n     the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       When I originally signed the petition against his \n     nomination I was not aware of the information that has \n     subsequently come to my attention. I labored under the \n     impression that opponents had a clear and convincing \n     argument. Now I am not certain that the ammunition on him is \n     as powerful and as convincing as I was led to believe. I \n     certainly do not believe Judge Pickering is presently a \n     ``racist''.\n       Judge Pickering's record of working with both races and \n     working for racial reconciliation in past and present years \n     is beyond what many whites we have supported and continue to \n     support in positions of leadership have done in our state.\n       While I do not condemn and judge all white men and women to \n     be ``staunch racist'', I do believe many have racist \n     tendencies and beliefs as evidenced by the racism instilled \n     in our many institutions. At least Judge Pickering has shown \n     a willingness to work for racial reconciliation prior to his \n     consideration for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals \n     position.\n       I hope and pray understanding of the need for racial \n     reconciliation by Judge Pickering will help strengthen the \n     Fifth Circuit's fortitude in resolving racial issues and \n     concerns in a spirit that God directs.\n       I recognize different people can review the same facts and \n     reach different conclusions. I respect their right, for \n     ``Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.''\n       It would also be ``Politically Correct'' for me to remain \n     silent. However, I cannot support a position that may be \n     ``Politically Correct'' but I feel is ``Morally Wrong''. I \n     truly believe we all should embrace truth, justice, and \n     fairness whether we are black or white, rich or poor, \n     democrat or republican. Our state needs it. Our children \n     deserve it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                   Houston, TX, February 10, 2003.\n      Re Charles W.

Pickering, Sr. for \n     appointment as Judge of the United States Court of Appeals, \n     Fifth Circuit.\n       A substantial majority of our Committee is of the opinion \n     that Charles W. Pickering, Sr. is Well Qualified and a \n     minority of the Committee is of the opinion that Charles W. \n     Pickering, Sr. is Qualified for this appointment.\n       A copy of this letter has been sent to Charles W. \n     Pickering, Sr. for his information.\n           Yours very truly,\n                                                 Carol E.

As has been made clear to those \n     following the Capitol Hill controversy, the hue and cry is \n     about racism but the undercurrent of opposition isn't about \n     race at all--it's about the thorny issue of abortion rights.\n       As in the case of fellow Bush federal appellate court \n     nominee Miguel Estrada, the opposition to Pickering among \n     Senate Democrats isn't about the judge's qualifications. It's \n     about the judge's politics.\n       And while Senate Republicans played the same political game \n     with the judicial nominees of former President Bill Clinton, \n     the politics of personal destruction in the case of Pickering \n     has reached a new low.\n       By any reasonable standard, Charles Pickering Sr. has lived \n     the life and done the work of a man with his heart in the \n     right place on race in a state where such a life and work \n     wasn't always easy or appreciated.\n       Pickering isn't a Johnny-Come-Lately to the concept of \n     meaningful racial reconciliation. He's been part of the \n     solution to Mississippi's vexing racial conundrum for \n     decades. He has been an able jurist, a contributing citizen \n     and a responsible politician and jurist.\n       Those who seek to oppose Judge Pickering on the grounds of \n     his political philosophy or religious views should do so \n     openly and in aboveboard fashion--not hiding behind the \n     political skirts of dubious charges of racism.\n       Racism is a serious evil. Mississippians know better than \n     most in America the severity of racism and the vile \n     manifestations it can assume. Mississippi has borne witness \n     to unspeakable acts of cruelty and mayhem in the name of race \n     literally since statehood.\n       In Mississippi's fragile racial environment--one in which \n     people of good will and good intentions have sought to build \n     bridges--crying ``wolf'' on false charges of racism is a \n     particularly onerous political and social crime.\n       On a broader scale, the politics of judicial confirmation \n     threatens to subvert the partisan political give and take of \n     the presidency in judicial nominations to provide \n     philosophical balance to the courts.\n       Confirmation hearings should be about the qualifications \n     and character of the judicial nominee, not the next \n     presidential election.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee owes Judge Pickering a fair \n     hearing based on an examination of his record--his entire \n     record--as a judge, as a public figure and as a man.\n       Based on what we have known of that record, a fair hearing \n     by the committee will produce no impediment to confirmation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Constance Iona Slaughter Harvey,\n\n                                     Forest, MS, October 23, 2001.\n     Hon. Charles W. Pickering, Sr.,\n     U.S. District Court Judge,\n     Hattiesburg, MS.\n       Dear judge Pickering: Thank you for reminding me of the \n     upcoming Institute for Racial Reconciliation Board Retreat to \n     be held Friday, November 9 through Saturday, November 10, \n     2001. Unfortunately, my heavy schedule will prevent me from \n     attending. On those dates, I will also be required to \n     participate in the Annual State Convention of Mississippi \n     Action for Progress Head Start and facilitate a session at \n     the Metro Black Women Lawyers' retreat. Both of these events \n     require my personal involvement.\n       While I will not be in attendance, I am assured, because of \n     your integrity, that you will continue to provide the quality \n     of leadership you have provided in the past. You have served \n     Mississippi and her people well even to the extent of taking \n     positions that were unpopular. This sometimes meant great \n     personal sacrifice and loss of political gain for you.\n       Thank you for being a human being and for caring what \n     happens to other human beings. I am especially mindful of \n     your commitment to racial reconciliation over the past twenty \n     years. Because of this commitment, our future looks better.\n       I'll contact you regarding the developments at the Retreat \n     around the 15th of November. My best to you.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Constance Slaughter-Harvey.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Mar. 9, 2003]\n\n                       Trials of a Southern Judge\n\n\n  evidence doesn't support charges of racism against charles pickering\n\n                     (By Janita Poe and Tom Baxter)\n\n       When court is not in session, Deborah Gambrell and U.S. \n     District Judge Charles W. Pickering often hole up with other \n     lawyers in a courthouse anteroom--and debate the law.\n       They're there to schedule trials or sentencings. But \n     Gambrell, a liberal African-American lawyer, and Pickering, a \n     conservative white judge, invariably fall into spirited \n     exchanges on legal issues and philosophies.\n       ``We've had debates over everything from Clarence Thomas to \n     the details of some case,'' Gambrell said. ``Judge Pickering \n     is a conservative, but he wants to hear your opinion. And \n     he's amenable to having his mind changed, too.''\n       Gambrell sees no racial bias in the judge. On the contrary, \n     she said, he appoints motivated lawyers such as her to \n     represent workers--many of them black--who claim they were \n     wronged by employers. ``He loves the law and wants you to \n     represent your client well,'' Gambrell said, ``and I don't \n     think that's discriminatory.''\n       Strange as it sounds, Gambrell is talking about the same \n     Charles Pickering who made headlines last year as a reputed \n     old-line Southern bigot. The liberal lobbying group People \n     for the American Way, for example, claims Pickering is \n     ``hostile to civil rights.'' NAACP Chairman Julian Bond says \n     Pickering uses ``a racial lens to look at America.''\n       Pickering drew the criticism after President Bush nominated \n     him for a job on the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court \n     of Appeals, one step below the Supreme Court. A Senate \n     committee controlled by Democrats, heeding complaints about \n     the judge's racial views, rejected him.\n       With the Senate now in Republican hands, Bush has \n     renominated Pickering, prompting new Democratic charges that \n     Republicans, even after the Trent Lott fiasco, are catering \n     to racist Southern whites.\n       In Mississippi, however, many describe a different man than \n     the one feared and vilified by critics inside the Beltway.\n       Rather, their up-close description of Pickering is that he \n     is a relative progressive on race, a man who in the 1960s, \n     when much of Mississippi was still fighting efforts to kill \n     Jim Crow, testified against a murderous Ku Klux Klansman. He \n     is a parent who, despite a poisonous racial atmosphere around \n     Laurel, bucked white flight to send his four children to \n     newly integrated public schools.\n       Pickering has been excoriated for seeking a lighter \n     sentence for a white man convicted in a cross burning (see \n     related story). But he also sought reduced sentences for many \n     black first offenders. He has pushed to establish a racial \n     reconciliation center at the University of Mississippi, his \n     alma mater. And, both on the bench and off, he has pressed \n     white prison officials to ensure the rights of black inmates.\n       The judge's record is not spotless on race. In the infamous \n     cross-burning case, he worried aloud how a tough sentence \n     would play in the community--apparently the white community.\n       And as a law student in 1959, he published a paper laying \n     out a strategy for maintaining a ban on mixed-race marriages \n     in Mississippi.\n       Yet these are two exceptions, the second more than four \n     decades old, in an otherwise surprisingly upstanding history \n     on race.\n       Pickering will not comment publicly, pending Senate action \n     on his nomination, which is expected this month or next.\n\n\n                        roots: religion and race\n\n       Pickering, the son of a Laurel dairy farmer, has always \n     stayed close to his south-central Mississippi roots. The New \n     Orleans-based appeals court job would be his first post \n     outside Mississippi.\n       A land of bayous and pine trees, the region around Laurel \n     and Hattiesburg is a place where people take their religion \n     seriously. Methodist and Baptist churches line the main \n     streets; even today, when much of the Bible Belt has \n     succumbed to secularism, day care centers are named ``River \n     of Life'' and ``Alpha Christian.''\n       Pickering is a 42-year member at First Baptist Church of \n     Laurel, where he has been a deacon, a Sunday school teacher \n     and church treasurer. In the mid-'80s, he was president of \n     the Southern Baptists in Mississippi and was allied with the \n     ``inerrantists,'' who maintain the Bible is the word of God \n     and its accounts are factual.\n       Racism once had as strong grip on the region as religion, \n     and Pickering was reared during a period of open, \n     unquestioned apartheid. That upbringing has lent some \n     credibility to critics' charges.\n       Marilyn Huff, a white 65-year-old who lived next to the \n     Pickering farm, recalls playing hopscotch and marbles with \n     Pickering and several children of black sharecroppers who \n     lived nearby. But the black kids attended a different school.\n       ``We got on our bus and went to our school, and they got on \n     their bus and went to theirs,'' she said. ``I think the South \n     accepted those things when other areas of the country did \n     not.''\n       Pickering's 1959 paper on ``miscegenation,'' or mixed-race \n     marriage, reflects that acceptance. In the article, which was \n     based on a case of that era, Pickering suggests that \n     Mississippi lawmakers could strengthen the state's anti-\n     miscegenation law against legal challenges by reviewing \n     similar laws in 23 other states. Pickering published the \n     article in the Mississippi Law Journal, where he was a staff \n     writer.\n       The judge's son, U.S. Rep. ``Chip'' Pickering, 39, explains \n     the article as nothing more than an assigned ``exercise'' in \n     which students ``assessed laws on interracial marriage and \n     told why the Mississippi law was struck down.''\n       The congressman's account, however, does not fully convey \n     the tone of the brief. The article did not simply analyze \n     problems with the law, but suggested how it could better \n     withstand court challenges. As People for the American Way \n     points out, Pickering ``expressed no moral outrage over laws \n     prohibiting and criminalizing interracial marriage'' but \n     instead calmly offered a strategy for maintaining a ban--as \n     if the law were as ethically neutral as, say, restrictions on \n     double-parking.\n       Elsewhere, by the 1950s, people inside and outside the \n     state were beginning to question Mississippi's adherence to \n     Jim Crow strictures. In 1955, Pickering's junior college near \n     Laurel achieved a breakthrough of sorts when its all-white \n     football team, in a quest for a national championship, \n     decided to play an integrated squad from California despite\n\n[[Page S13544]]\n\n     protests from the state's racist establishment.\n       In 1962, as Pickering started his law practice, the Federal \n     government forced the University of Mississippi to admit \n     James Meredith, a black Air Force veteran. Students and \n     locals responded by staging a riot that killed two people and \n     injured hundreds.\n       And that was in relatively genteel Oxford. Laurel, a \n     rougher place to begin with, became a flash point of racial \n     and class tensions, with leftist union and reactionary Ku \n     Klux Klan organizers alike recruiting members from the 4,000 \n     workers at the town's big Masonite plant. The toxic \n     atmosphere soon presented Pickering with a chance to depart \n     Mississippi's well-worn racial path.\n       Laurel was home to a man who combined ferver for both \n     Christianity and apartheid to produce a vicious, ragtag holy \n     war in defense of the status quo. In 1966, Sam Bowers, the \n     Scripture-quoting imperial wizard of the White Knights of the \n     Ku Klux Klan, led a gang of Klansmen to firebomb the home of \n     Hattiesburg NAACP leader Vernon Dahmer, killing him.\n       Pickering, then serving as Jones County prosecutor, could \n     have avoided the trial, as the slaying took place in a \n     neighboring county. But Jim Dukes, the prosecutor, who \n     presented the case against Bowers, asked his colleague to \n     testify to Bowers' violent character, and Pickering agreed--\n     despite the risk of Klan reprisals.\n       ``He was putting himself at risk of bodily harm, social \n     ostracism and economic destruction,'' Dukes said. ``These \n     were turbulent times, and testifying against the Klan was not \n     a popular thing to do.''\n       Pickering lost a race for a state House seat later that \n     year. Bowers--whose trial ended in a hung jury and who was \n     not convicted until 1998--took credit for beating him.\n\n\n                          republican politics\n\n       Like many Mississippians of his generation, Pickering began \n     political life as a Democrat and switched to the GOP. He did \n     so, however, before the party had become a haven for Southern \n     whites disaffected with the national Democrats' liberal \n     racial policies.\n       Pickering changed parties in 1964, a time when \n     Mississippi's Democratic leadership stood for continued \n     segregation. Most notoriously, Democratic Gov. Ross Barnettt \n     had personally turned Meredith away from Ole Miss and helped \n     provoke the later rioting. The Mississippi Democratic \n     establishment, in the thrall of Jim Crow, sent an all-white \n     delegation to the 1964 national convention and was denied \n     seating.\n       The small but growing Mississippi GOP leaned to the right \n     on many issues, as it still does, reflecting a pro-business \n     bent. But compared with the Democratic leadership, many \n     Republicans were moderate or even progressive on \n     desegregation and on compliance with federal court orders.\n       The state GOP ``was characterized by some very powerful \n     business types who could afford to be more moderate in their \n     political views,'' said Marty Wiseman, director of the John \n     Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State \n     University.\n       Laurel's powerful state senator, E.K. Collins, led the all-\n     white delegation to the Democratic convention. In 1971, \n     Pickering took Collins on and beat him. ``It was considered \n     nervy for a young upstart to run against an established \n     longtime Dixiecrat like E.K.,'' recalled former Rep. Tucker \n     Buchanan, a Democrat who became friends with Pickering in the \n     Legislature.\n       In the Senate, Pickering developed a reputation for being \n     able to talk with all sides and occasionally broker a deal--\n     even though, as one of only two Republicans, he was excluded \n     from Senate leadership.\n       ``He was right down the middle. He was a moderate,'' said \n     former Gov. William Winter, a progressive Democrat who was \n     lieutenant governor when Pickering arrived at the \n     Legislature.\n       The new governor, Democrat William Waller, was the first in \n     many years who had not made race the focus of his campaign, \n     and as a prosecutor had heroically but unsuccessfully mounted \n     two cases against white supremacist Byron de la Beckwith for \n     the murder of the NAACP's Medgar Evers. ``Charles was of that \n     stripe,'' Winter said.\n       Robert G. Clark Jr., who is today the House speaker pro \n     tem, in 1968 became the first African-American elected to the \n     Legislature. He did not receive a warm welcome. ``It was \n     pretty lonely back then,'' Clark said.\n       But Pickering was cordial. ``He was one who didn't mind \n     coming up to me to shake my hand and say, `How are you doing \n     today, Rep. Clark?' ''\n       Pickering was elected state GOP chairman in 1976, serving \n     with then-Executive Director Haley Barbour, who went on to \n     become Republican national chairman, a powerful Washington \n     lobbyist and--this year--a candidate for governor.\n       Pickering won credit as a party peacemaker after a bruising \n     fight between supporters of Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan at \n     the 1976 GOP convention. But he lost his one bid for federal \n     office in 1978, when Thad Cochran defeated him in the U.S. \n     Senate primary. He lost again in a run for state attorney \n     general a year later, ending his career in elective politics.\n\n\n                       the sovereignty commission\n\n       Pickering's terms as a state senator coincided with the \n     final years of the infamous Mississippi Sovereignty \n     Commission. Created in 1956 in reaction to the U.S. Supreme \n     Court's school desegration decision, the agency was supposed \n     to protect Mississippi and her ``sister states'' from federal \n     encroachment, by ``any and all acts and things deemed \n     necessary and proper.''\n       The commission used its charge to spy on, intimidate and \n     harass those considered to be racial troublemakers or outside \n     ``agitators.'' It helped fund the reactionary white Citizens \n     Councils and kept up a system of informants who reported to \n     the commission on the activities of the FBI as well as civil \n     rights groups.\n       As a state senator Pickering voted twice, in 1972 and 1973, \n     along with the majority, to continue funding for the \n     commission--votes his critics have highlighted during the \n     confirmation hearings. By the early '70s, however, \n     Mississippi had generally dismantled legal segregation, and \n     the agency was trying to retool itself as a general \n     investigative organization.\n       Waller vetoed the funding in 1973, and the commission was \n     officially dissolved in 1977, its files sealed. In the end, \n     Pickering voted with the majority to end the commission and \n     seal the records.\n       In 1990, during hearings on his nomination as district \n     judge, Pickering said he ``never had any contact'' with the \n     commission and that he knew ``very little about what is in \n     those records.'' His opponents point out, however, that when \n     the Sovereignty Commission's files were subsequently opened, \n     an investigator's memo was found naming him.\n       The document suggested Pickering and two other legislators \n     had communicated with the commission on its investigation of \n     labor union activity in Laurel. The three lawmakers were \n     ``very interested'' and ``requested to be advised of \n     developments,'' according to the memo.\n       Pickering's son, the congressman, says the agency had \n     approached his father, not the other way around. ``His only \n     contact came in 1972, when a Sovereignty Commission employee \n     approached him and said he had information about a radical \n     group infiltrating a union in Jones County. My father's only \n     response was, `Keep me informed.' ''\n       Again, this may be too easy a dismissal. The nature of the \n     supposed union infiltration is in dispute. The commission \n     memo says the agency was focusing on a pro-civil rights \n     group, but in Pickering's confirmation hearing last year, the \n     judge said he was concerned about Klan activity.\n       Any alleged connection to the racism of the Sovereignty \n     Commission sharply contrasts with Pickering's public and \n     personal actions in support of integration in the same \n     decade.\n\n\n                           at home in laurel\n\n       Even though they lived in racially polarized Jones County, \n     Pickering and his wife, Margaret Ann, sent their four \n     children to newly integrated public schools in the '70s.\n       Allison Montgomery, the judge's second-youngest child, \n     recalls thinking her father had to set an example for other \n     families by supporting integration. She was bused to the \n     formerly all-black Oak Park High the year it debuted as an \n     integrated elementary school.\n       ``It was never discussed in our home, but my sense was that \n     because Daddy had a reputation as being one who supported \n     what was right, that it was what we were expected to do,'' \n     said Montgomery, 35, a homemaker who lives in Shreveport, La.\n       ``Even though it meant we would end up in a minority \n     situation, I think the powers that be in our community knew \n     he would still support the public school system.''\n       Montgomery has fond memories of learning new games and \n     chants with her black schoolmates, but she remembers several \n     white parents moving their children out of her hometown \n     because the teacher was black. Some families enrolled their \n     children in private schools. ``Suddenly people were sending \n     their kids to a little small academy called Heidelburg \n     Academy,'' she said. ``It was in Jasper County, and they \n     probably had a 20- or 30-minute drive, at least.\n       Black people in the Laurel area took note of Pickering's \n     stance on racial issues.\n       When Larry Thomas was a child, he watched his father, a \n     local civil rights leader, work out the logistics of \n     demonstrations with Pickering. Later, he dealt directly with \n     Pickering as a fellow economic-development board member. \n     Thomas, 49, a pharmacist, is a black Democrat.\n       Over the years, Pickering disregarded white criticism to \n     make alliances with black people, Thomas said.\n       ``When things were changing in the '60s and '70s, he always \n     tried to reach a compromise. He was always trying to \n     understand the thinking and concerns of the black \n     community,'' Thomas said. ``To me, that's the most I expect \n     of a white man. The rest is our responsibility.''\n       Melvin Mack, 53, a black county supervisor, grew up about \n     four miles from Pickering's family and, over the years, has \n     seen him at dozens of black gatherings. Pickering may have \n     been reared in an era when discrimination was the rule, he \n     said, but he has always been friendly with blacks.\n       ``You will see him at black family reunions,'' Mack said. \n     ``You will see him at funerals when a black family's loved \n     one has died.''\n       In the '90s, Pickering was an early, prominent supporter \n     for establishing what became the William Winter Institute for \n     Racial Reconciliation at Ole Miss. Among its other functions, \n     the institute promotes programs to combat racial prejudice.\n       Pickering has also responded to complaints about the abuse \n     of black State prison inmates. Sometimes he has ordered \n     changes\n\n[[Page S13545]]\n\n     from the bench and other times, when evidence did not fully \n     substantiate the abuse, worked informally. Pickering ``will \n     call me afterward and ask that we look into what is going \n     on,'' said Leonard Vincent, general counsel for the State \n     Corrections Department.\n       In one case, such informal intervention led to the firing \n     of at least two guards.\n       ``Judge Pickering was the only white leader we could get to \n     stand up against the guards and the penal system,'' said a \n     local civic activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \n     ``I mean, he called them on the carpet and cleaned them up.''\n       Pickering, the activist said, did not seek to publicize his \n     behind-the-scenes effort. ``I'm not saying Judge Pickering is \n     a saint,'' he said. ``He is a conservative man. But he's not \n     afraid to stand up for what is right.''\n\n\n                       The case against pickering\n\n       Such sentiments do not sway opponents.\n       ``Judge Pickering's record isn't erased just because he has \n     African-American friends in his community,'' said NAACP \n     Chairman Bond, a former Georgia legislator. ``This is a \n     question of what kind of Federal judiciary are we going to \n     have. Are we going to have one occupied by women and men who \n     support justice and fairness, or who oppose it?''\n       Many Pickering opponents object to his nomination on \n     grounds unrelated to his racial attitudes. The predominantly \n     black Magnolia Bar Association of Mississippi is one such \n     opponent.\n       The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over \n     Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, whose population is 45 \n     percent nonwhite. But of 14 judges' seats that are filled, \n     only two are Hispanic and only one is black. The Magnolia Bar \n     has sought more diversity and more liberal voices on the \n     court for years, President Melvin Cooper said, so Pickering--\n     a conservative white--is the wrong choice.\n       ``We're looking at . . . the decisions he would make on the \n     bench,'' Cooper said.\n       Abortion-rights groups have joined the fight against \n     Pickering, also because of his conservative personal views. \n     As a State legislator in the mid-1970s, Pickering led an \n     effort to make the national Republican platform anti-\n     abortion, specifically opposing the U.S. Supreme Court's \n     ``intrusion'' into the issue with Roe v. Wade.\n       ``We're concerned that would color the attitude he would \n     take to the appellate bench,'' said Judy Appelbaum, a vice \n     president of the National Women's Law Center.\n       When asked about abortion at his confirmation hearing last \n     year, the judge sounded less militant. ``My personal views \n     are immaterial and irrelevant,'' the judge responded. ``I \n     will tell you that I will follow the constitution, and I will \n     apply the Supreme court precedent.''\n       Pickering has yet to rule on an abortion matter. But the \n     5th U.S. Circuit may well consider the constitutionality of \n     state statutes designed to make abortions more difficult to \n     obtain. In Mississippi, for example, legislation is pending \n     that would restrict the time when an abortion is legal and \n     require abortion providers to be board-certified in \n     obstetrics and gynecology.\n       Yet allegations of bigotry have hurt the judge's chances--\n     and damaged his reputation--more than concerns about his \n     general conservatism. His son says Pickering is willing to \n     undergo another round of intense scrutiny and heated attacks \n     to restore his good name.\n       ``The stereotype of what Mississippi is can easily be used \n     against someone like my father, who is a Southern Baptist and \n     from an older generation of white Mississippians,'' he said. \n     ``But my father is not at all the man they try to say he is. \n     We hope in this second go-round the truth catches up with the \n     false accusations.''\n       The law-review article on mixed-race marriage laws casts a \n     cloud on that record. But the evidence suggests that the \n     judge has moved on since he wrote it.\n       ``That was 1959,'' said Angela Barnett. ``Back in the day, \n     everyone was taught to think that way.''\n       Barnett, who is white, went before Pickering on drug \n     charges in 1997--with her black husband, Harrell. The couple, \n     who now live in Houston, say the judge helped them get their \n     lives together with lenient sentences and advice.\n       ``If he was racist, he wouldn't even be thinking about \n     helping us,'' Barnett said. ``He would have said `Heck, no, \n     she's married to a black man, I'm not going to help them.'''\n       When the Senate debates Pickering's nomination, his \n     conservative views--on abortion, federalism, the role of the \n     judiciary and other matters--will be fair game. The judge is \n     quite conservative by most measures, and many people would \n     prefer more moderate or liberal nominees.\n       But in Mississippi, the notion that Pickering is a racial \n     throwback and a friend to cross-burners doesn't sell.\n       Pascagoula attorney Richard ``Dickie'' Scruggs, for \n     example, is a believer in Pickering.\n       Scruggs is a ``mass tort'' trial lawyer--the sort who signs \n     up thousands of plaintiffs to join in class-action lawsuits--\n     who was lead litigator in Mississippi's multibillion-dollar \n     tobacco suit.\n       ``Judge Pickering has been in the camp that was considered \n     liberal to moderate in the 1960s,'' said Scruggs, a Democrat \n     who is also Trent Lott's brother-in-law. ``He's a bright \n     jurist and has a moral compass that gives him a real sense of \n     fairness. . . .\n       ``I think he would be a great [appeals court] judge. I just \n     don't know why he would want to go through this process \n     again.''\n  Mr. LOTT. One of the criticisms was, well, the Judge was the \nintermediary in sending some of the letters of support. I am not going \nto belabor the point, but as a matter of fact, I have the list of who \nthese people were. They were people he had known for 30 years, former \ncollege friends, law school friends, people he practiced law with. It \nwas in the aftermath of the anthrax attack here on the Capitol. The \nonly way he could make sure the letters got to the Judiciary Committee \nin a timely way was to send them himself. The allegation that there was \nsomething inappropriate about that is totally baseless, and it is just \nthe type of thing that has been used against him.\n  Another allegation is that when he was a State senator he had some \nrelationship with what was then known as the Sovereignty Commission. \nWhen he went into the Senate, I think when he was first sworn in, \nrepresentatives from that organization said they had some concerns \nabout Klan activity with regard to labor unions down in his home \ncounty.\n  He said: Keep me posted.\n  Seldom do they note the fact that he subsequently voted to abolish \nthe Sovereignty Commission; again, a very frivolous charge. To have \nyour name mentioned 30 years later in a report, that they had some \nhappenstance contact with him, certainly should not be disqualifying.\n  From all walks of life in Mississippi, people are very much in \nsupport of this nomination. He hasn't just been a lawyer and a judge \nand family man. He has been involved. He helped bring his hometown \nschool through integration. His kids went to the public schools. The \nfirst time I saw his son--now a Congressman--Chip Pickering, he was \nplaying linebacker for the football team for the Laurel Tornadoes, R. \nH. Watkins Laurel High School. He was a great athlete on a team that \nwas probably 80 percent African American. They have always been willing \nto take a stand.\n  He was head of the local March of Dimes. He headed the local Red \nCross. He has been involved in economic development. He has been \ninvolved in the Heart Fund, the Drug Education Council, Sunday school \nteacher, chairman of the deacons, church treasurer, president of the \nMississippi Baptist Convention. Some people look at that almost like it \nis an indictment. It is a great honor for the people of your faith to \nhonor you to head their organization statewide.\n  He has even been a farmer and was the first president of the National \nCatfish Farmers Association. I had contact with him then.\n  President Reagan once wrote in a note where there was a picture of a \nmother and her son: The apple never falls too far from the tree. The \npoint was, if the child is really an outstanding person, he probably \ncame from a very strong and good tree. True. In this case, there is not \na finer young man I know of than Congressman Chip Pickering who has \nlabored valiantly to tell the truth about his dad. If you want to get \nemotional, watch a son work for his father. I think the kind of man \nChip Pickering is tells you a lot about the father who brought him into \nthe world, along with his mother.\n  This certainly is an outstanding individual. He had his reputation \nbesmirched a couple of years ago. He has been willing to continue to \nstand and fight to have the record corrected and to see this through to \na conclusion. I hope the Senate will not filibuster this judge. At \nleast give him a direct vote. Or if we have to have a vote on cloture, \nvote to invoke cloture, and let's move this nomination forward.\n  There is a real fester developing here in this institution, \ninstitutionally and individually. We have to lance it or it is going to \ndemean us as individuals and the institution. We have to stop it. This \nis the place to do it. This man should be confirmed for the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 11 minutes 9 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n[[Page S13546]]\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a good and \nbrave man from the State of Mississippi, Judge Charles Pickering. I \nalso rise today to talk about a judicial nominating process that is \nbadly broken and out of control. Judge Charles Pickering has been \nvictimized by inaccurate race baiting and political trash talk of the \nnews media, Members of Congress, and Washington's liberal elite. Judge \nPickering's critics continue to unfairly label him a racist and \nsegregationist. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Judge Pickering has worked courageously in difficult times--difficult \ntimes many in this body could not hope to understand--to eliminate \nracial disparities in Mississippi and the South. My good friend, former \nGovernor William Winter of Mississippi, a Democrat and one of the \nSouth's most respected progressives, came to Washington to support \nJudge Pickering's nomination. Sadly, Governor Winter's praise and \nfirsthand account of Pickering's true record fell on deaf ears by most \nCapitol Hill Democrats.\n  Charles Pickering deserves an up-or-down vote on his nomination, as \ndoes another fine nominee who has been treated in the same shameful \nmanner, Justice Janice Rogers Brown of California. On both of these \nnominees, I fear we are about to cave in once again to the left-leaning \nspecial interest groups. These special interest groups, like termites, \nhave come out of the woodwork to denounce Justice Brown simply because \nshe is an African American who also happens to be conservative. Never \nmind that Justice Brown is intelligent, articulate, chock-full of \ncommon sense, and highly qualified to serve on the Federal appeals \ncourt bench. Never mind that in 1998, 76 percent of Californians voted \nto retain Justice Brown. That is a job approval rating most of us could \nonly dream of.\n  The special interest groups don't care about any of that. They don't \nwant to hear how qualified Justice Brown and Judge Pickering are, or \nhow much the voters like the job they have done.\n  No, their only mission is to assassinate these good people's \ncharacter and to take them down one way or another because they fear \nthey won't cater to their liberal agenda. They are right; they won't. \nThese fine nominees are much too independent and much too intelligent \nto be held hostage to anyone's extreme agenda. Or as Thomas Sowell \nwrote of Justice Brown in a column headlined ``A Lynch Mob Takes Aim at \nJudicial Pick'':\n\n       What really scares the left about Brown is that she has \n     guts as well as brains. She won't weaken or waver.\n\n  So they can publish all the racist cartoons they want and they can \ndemonize Judge Pickering and brutally and callously reduce Justice \nBrown to tears at her committee meeting. They can sneeringly accuse \nthem both of being outside the mainstream. But President Bush knows and \nthe voters of California and Mississippi know, and the majority of this \nSenate knows, Charles Pickering and Janice Rogers Brown are not the \nones who are outside the mainstream. The ones who are completely out of \ntouch are the special interest groups that have taken this nominating \nprocess hostage and those in this body who have aided and abetted their \ndoing so.\n  Speaking of lynch mobs, my all-time favorite movie is ``To Kill a \nMockingbird.'' In the movie's key scene, you may remember, Atticus \nFinch, a lawyer who is raising two small children, is defending a black \nman unjustly accused of rape. That lynch mob also tries to take justice \ninto its own hands. Atticus confronts them at the jailhouse door. His \ndaughter Scout joins him and sees that the leader of the mob is someone \nshe knows. She calls to him by name: Hey, Mr. Cunningham. Remember me? \nYou are Walter's daddy. Walter is a good boy. Tell him I said hello.\n  After a dramatic pause, Mr. Cunningham turns away and says to the \nmob: Let's go home, boys.\n  This group, bent on injustice, was turned aside by a small girl who \nappealed to them as individuals.\n  My friends in this Chamber, I know you, and I appeal to each of you \nas individuals, as fathers, mothers, colleagues and friends. Most of \nyou were taught in Sunday school to do unto others as you would have \nthem do unto you. This is not treating someone as you would want to be \ntreated yourself. This extreme partisanship and deliberately planned \nobstructionism has gone on long enough in this body. I wish we could do \naway with the 60-vote rule that lets a small minority rule this Chamber \nand defeat the majority, reversing the rule of free government \neverywhere; everywhere, that is, except in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MILLER. I hope we can have an up-or-down vote--just an up-or-down \nvote, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Five minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that there be an additional 10 \nminutes equally divided with, of course, the same understanding that \nSenator Cochran will be the last to speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shan't because I have \nalready spoken about this with the distinguished senior Senator from \nUtah, but my understanding is this is 10 minutes equally divided on top \nof whatever time is remaining?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right, with the understanding that Senator Cochran \nwill be the last to speak for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the current order--I was off the \nfloor when the order was entered last night--what is the current order \non who speaks last?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The final 5 minutes is to the majority \nleader or his designee, and the previous 5 minutes is to the minority \nleader or his designee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is perfectly all right. I think the Senator from Utah \nhas proposed a very fair proposal. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The Chair understands \nthe request is to add 5 minutes to each side.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the control of--\n  Mr. LEAHY. The same way.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The same persons controlling the time.\n  Mr. HATCH. With the understanding that Senator Cochran will be given \nthe leader's 5 minutes at the very end of the debate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the distinguished Senator care to go ahead?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 35 minutes on the Democratic \nside and 10 minutes on the Republican side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Chair repeat that, please? I didn't hear what the \nChair said.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains 35 minutes to the Democratic \nside and 10 minutes to the Republican side, 5 minutes added to each \nside. The Chair reminds the Senators that the last 5 minutes on each \nside is under the control of the leaders or their designees.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's strong \nleadership on this issue. I rise in the strong support of the \nnomination of Charles Pickering to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I want to say, first, that I appreciate the honesty, the integrity, \nand the forthrightness of my colleague from Georgia on every issue, but \nparticularly on this issue. He has been very much out front, and this \nSenator greatly appreciates his attitude and his dedication to ensuring \nthat quality judges are confirmed to every circuit of the United States \nand every district of the Federal bench.\n  I rise with some special appreciation for Judge Pickering's \nnomination because he is nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  In 1969, when this Senator became a member of the Georgia bar, \nGeorgia was a member of the Fifth Circuit. So I have been a member of \nthe Fifth Circuit bar since my early days. The Eleventh Circuit was \ncreated in 1980. We split off at that time, so I no longer argue cases \non a regular basis in the Fifth Circuit.\n\n[[Page S13547]]\n\n  The Fifth Circuit has been very blessed with a number of great \njudges. Look at the judges who came from difficult times, such as my \nvery good friend Judge Griffin Bell who, after serving as a member of \nthe Fifth Circuit, came to be Attorney General; Elbert Tuttle, Judge \nFrank Johnson--any number of judges such as these judges at the \ndistrict court level--Judge W.A. Bootle. These individuals came through \nvery difficult times and distinguished themselves as judges.\n  Judge Charles Pickering came through that same very difficult time in \nthe South, a time in the South when race was a very critical and the \nmost forthright issue. Charles Pickering looked the racial issue in the \neye and provided the kind of leadership of which every American would \nbe very proud.\n  As we now consider his nomination to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, I could not be prouder of any individual than I am of the \nnomination of Charles Pickering. I am going to have a lot more to say \nabout this, but today we have the opportunity to bring this nomination \nto an up-or-down vote.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to give him a vote on the floor of \nthe Senate. Let's put this good man, this good judge on the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 3 minutes \nremaining--2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I come at this differently than the \nSenator from Mississippi. I don't know Charles Pickering. I have met \nhim briefly only twice. But I care about the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Bridget Lipscomb and I have studied his record diligently.\n  Nearly 40 years ago, I was a law clerk on the Fifth Circuit for the \ngreat Judge John Minor Wisdom. I have been trying to think of something \nto say to the Members on the other side to help them change their minds \non this nomination.\n  Judge Wisdom was a member of the Federal court that ordered the \nUniversity of Mississippi to admit James Meredith to Ole Miss. The \nFifth Circuit played a crucial role in desegregating the South. Judges \nTuttle, Rives, Brown, and Wisdom were real heroes at that time. Crosses \nwere burned in front of their homes. I will have more to say about \nthis, but Judge Pickering is a worthy successor to the court of Judges \nWisdom, Tuttle, Rives, and Brown.\n  While those judges were ordering the desegregation of Deep South \nschools, while crosses were being burned in front of their homes, Judge \nPickering was enrolling his children in those same newly desegregated \nschools, and Judge Pickering in his hometown was testifying in court \nagainst Sam Bowers, the man the Baton Rouge Advocate called the ``most \nviolent living racist,'' at a time when people were killing people \nbased on race.\n  Many of my generation have changed their minds about race in the \nSouth over the last 40 years. That is why the opposition to Judge \nPickering to me seems so blatantly unfair. He hasn't changed his mind. \nThere is nothing to forgive him for. There is nothing to condemn. There \nis nothing to excuse. He was not a product of his times. He led his \ntimes. He spoke out for racial justice. He testified against the most \ndangerous of the cross burners. He did it in his own hometown, with his \nown neighbors, at a time in our Nation's history when it was hardest to \ndo. He stuck his neck out for civil rights.\n  Mr. President, will our message to the world be: Stick out your neck \nfor civil rights for Mississippi in the 1960s and then we will cut your \nneck off in the Senate in 2003, all in the name of civil rights? I \ncertainly hope not.\n  Charles Pickering earned this nomination. He is a worthy successor to \nthe court of Judge Wisdom, Judge Tuttle, Judge Rives, and Judge Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand the time has been used. I know \nthe remarks of the distinguished Senator from Tennessee are much more \nlengthy. I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the vote, \nhe be given time to finish his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. What was the request?\n  Mr. HATCH. That immediately following the vote on Judge Pickering, \nthe distinguished Senator from Tennessee be given time to finish his \nremarks because he has prepared extensively.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator like to ask for time to finish the \nremarks now, with the same amount of time given to this side? If my \nfriend from Tennessee wants to finish his speech now, I will ask \nconsent that he be given that amount of time with an equal amount of \ntime added to this side.\n  Mr. HATCH. That will be fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, that is very generous. How much time do \nI have to finish the speech?\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. May I ask for 10 minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is with an equal amount of time to our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this will be pushing the time of the vote \nback to about 10:20, 10:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be approximately 55 minutes from now.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont and \nthe Senator from Utah for their generosity.\n  Let me remake my first point. I care about this case because I care \nabout the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Many of the Senators know or \nknew Judge John Minor Wisdom. They knew what a great judge he was.\n  They knew what the times were like in the Deep South during the 1960s \nand 1970s. I remember Judge Wisdom once telling me the Ku Klux Klan had \nburned a cross in the intersection between his home and that of \nCongressman Hale Boggs. Judge Wisdom said: They were getting both of us \nwith one cross burning.\n  So I set out some time ago, with my staff, to look through the record \nof Judge Pickering to see what he has done. All the evidence is that \nJudge Pickering, like Judge Wisdom, like Judge Tuttle, Judge Rives, and \nJudge Brown, stuck his neck out for civil rights at a time when it was \nhardest to do. Mississippians know that.\n  William Winter, with whom I served, a leading former Democrat \nGovernor, a leader for racial justice, strongly supports Judge \nPickering. Frank Hunger, who served on that court with me as a law \nclerk back in the 1960s, President Clinton's Deputy Attorney General, \nAl Gore's brother-in-law, strongly supports Judge Pickering. I have \nlived in the South for a long time, about the same amount of time as \nJudge Pickering. I have learned to tell those who are racists, those \nwho stood silently by, and those who stuck their necks out.\n  Let me invite my colleagues to go back with me to Mississippi, to the \nlate 1960s. James Meredith had become the only Black to graduate from \nthe undergraduate school at Ole Miss. Reuben Anderson, who has endorsed \nJudge Pickering, had become the first Black graduate of the Ole Miss \nLaw School.\n  In Nashville, where I went to school at Vanderbilt, the first \nintegrated class had just graduated from Vanderbilt University. Robert \nClark became the first black elected to the Mississippi Legislature \nsince the Reconstruction.\n  It was not until 1968, that the first blacks were permitted to \nparticipate in intercollegiate athletics at the University of Florida \nand Georgia and Tennessee and other Southeastern Conference schools.\n  The law had changed but there were still plenty of ``colored only'' \nsigns on restroom doors in plenty old southern cities during the late \n1960s. Martin Luther King was murdered in Memphis during 1968. Alabama \nGovernor George Wallace won the Democrat primary for president in 1976 \nin Mississippi, and in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S13548]]\n\n  Perhaps my colleagues saw the movie, ``Mississippi Burning.'' That \nwas about events during 1967 in Mississippi. Civil rights workers \nGoodman, Schwerner, and Chaney were murdered. They were picked up by \nthree carloads of Klansmen, shot and their bodies were buried in a 15-\nfoot earthen dam. In 1967, seven men were convicted of federal \nconspiracy charges, eight were acquitted and three received mistrials. \nAt the time, the state of Mississippi refused to file murder charges. \nTo this day, no one has ever been tried for those murders.\n  Wes Pruden, a young reporter at the time, told me he went to a \nMississippi courtroom and everybody in the courtroom except the judge \nhad a button on that said ``Never.'' That was the environment in which \nCharles Pickering was living in Laurel, Mississippi in Jones County in \nthe late 1960s.\n  Blacks were just beginning to serve on juries. A few Blacks voted. \nSchools were being desegregated one grade at a time starting with the \nlower grades so that older children would have less opportunity to \ninteract socially. Race was not a theoretical issue in Laurel in the \nlate sixties, or even a political issue. People were killing people \nbased on race in the late 1960s in Jones County, MS.\n  The White Citizens Council, a group of white collar, non-violent \nsegregationists was the country club version of resistance to \nintegration in Laurel. Klan members were known at that time in Laurel \nfor putting on their white robes, opening up their bibles, building a \nbonfire in a pasture, crossing a sword and a gun over a bible, and \nproceeding to burn down the home of a black person. The KKK in Laurel \nshot into homes and beat blacks over the head with baseball bats. One \ndid not speak out lightly against the Klan because its members could \nvery well be your neighbor or your co-worker.\n  The Klan infiltrated law enforcement departments and juries. The Klan \nput out fliers instructing residents not to cooperate with the FBI on \ncases.\n  Laurel was Klan territory. It was the home of Sam Bowers. Bowers had \ncreated the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan because he believed that \nthe regular KKK was not violent enough. The Klan was out to resist \nintegration, but that was not enough for Sam Bowers. The White Knights \nset out to oppose racial integration ``by any means necessary.''\n  Since 9/11 we have heard a lot of talk about terrorists. This is not \nthe first time we have seen terrorists in America. We had terrorists \nthen. Sam Bowers and the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Laurel, \nMS, were the terrorists of the 1960s. The FBI said the White Knights \nwere responsible for at least 10 killings then. The Times of London \nsaid Bowers himself was suspected of the orchestration of 300 bombings.\n  According to the Baton Rouge Advocate, Sam Bowers was ``America's \nmost violent living racist.''\n  Charles Pickering made public statements condemning Klan violence. He \nworked with the FBI to prosecute and stop Klan violence. In the late \n1960s, Bowers came up for trial for the murder of the slain civil \nrights worker, Vernon Dahmer, and Judge Pickering testified publicly \nagainst Bowers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to submit for the record two documents. The \nfirst is a Klan newsletter from 1967 criticizing Pickering for \ncooperating with the FBI. The second is Bowers' own Motion for Recusal \nfiled in Federal court, asking Pickering to remove himself from hearing \na case involving Bowers because of Pickering's previous testimony \nagainst Bowers and taking credit for defeating Judge Pickering in a \nstatewide race for attorney general.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Citizen-Patriot]\n\n     A Newsletter Dedicated to Truth and the Christian Civilization\n\n       ``Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty.--2 \n     Corinthians 3:17.\n       When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for \n     the Truth to be told concerning massive animal corruption in \n     Public Office, it is the Duty of the Public Press to inform \n     the Citizens. Unfortunately for the citizens of Jones County, \n     J.W. West, the Chief-Communist Propagandist, not only refuses \n     to tell the Truth, but actually takes a leading part in the \n     direction of the evil public corruption which is strangling \n     liberty in America. The Responsibility to Truth must there be \n     filled by the Citizens themselves. These are the Publishers \n     and Distributors of the Citizen-Patriot.\n\n\n                    Public Office is a Public Trust\n\n       Its successful administration requires from its Officials a \n     Fear of God, rather than a fear of men, and those Officials \n     who serve justly must be ambitious for the Glory of the \n     Heavenly Father rather than ambitious for their own personal \n     advancement or the advancement of some device to which they \n     have a vested attachment. Our Father has promised and amply \n     demonstrated that He will prosper a Nation whose Officers \n     serve Him. And, conversely, He will wreak vengeance and \n     punishment upon a Nation whose officers are self-serving men \n     pleasures. All citizens owe a high Duty to law and \n     government, but all men owe a higher duty to our Heavenly \n     Father, the Author of Truth and Liberty.\n\n\n             Let FACTS be submitted to a candid population\n\n       The Base of the Political Corruption which is sweeping our \n     Beloved Land of America lies in the Establishment of a \n     National Police Bureau, which brings pressure to bear upon \n     local officials. By a calculated means of Fear and Lust for \n     Reward, this Beast of Satan directs its pressure in such a \n     way that the local government is, in fact, woed against the \n     local citizens and their local interests.\n       The honest citizens of Jones County have recently been \n     defrauded by certain officials in an outstanding and clear-\n     cut example of the above, whereby the Spirit of the Law was \n     frustrated under the Color of the form and letter of legality \n     by the clever manipulations of Chet Dillard and Charles \n     Pickering. Fortunately, this pair were not completely \n     successful in their attempt to pervert justice in the Circuit \n     Court. By the cunning use of their official positions for \n     personal benefit they were able to operate their evil ____ \n     before the Honorable Grand Jury; but the Honorable Trial \n     Jurors in the Roy Strickland case saw through their scheme, \n     and struck a blow in favor of Justice by returning a verdict \n     of ``Not Guilty.''\n       Praise be the Blessed Name of the Heavenly Father, The \n     Guardian of our Liberty Whose Holy Word is the only Truth and \n     Anchor in a stormy world ruled by evil men operating under \n     color of Law\n       The honest facts regarding the Roy Strickland Case are as \n     follows:\n       In the late summer of 1965 a series of wholesale arrests \n     were made in Jones County with regard to a car theft ring. \n     These arrests were made by local officials at the urging of \n     FBI Special Agent Bob Lee of Laurel, Miss. Lee, following \n     standard FBI practice, misrepresented the amount of evidence \n     which he had regarding the car thefts, and deceived the local \n     officials in order to get them to make a larger number of \n     arrests than his evidence would warrant. Bob Lee's motive in \n     this was not so much to convict anyone with regard to the car \n     thefts, but rather to bring additional underworld characters \n     under FBI control where they could be used for criminal \n     action and as stool pigeons. Roy Strickland was Bob Lee's \n     chief target in this regard. After being arrested in the late \n     summer of 1963, Strickland was allowed and easy bond and \n     released. Strickland was eventually arrested and indicted \n     (and released without bond in two instances) on five separate \n     counts of car theft which alleged to have occurred during \n     August and September of 1965. The arrests and indictments for \n     these offenses spanned a period form September 1963 through \n     March 1966. At no time prior to April of 1967, however, did \n     Dillard or Pickering make an attempt to prosecute Roy \n     Strickland on any of these cases. They were all continued \n     from time to time and from term to term in the Circuit Court \n     of Jones County at the request of the prosectution. \n     Strickland was allowed to walk out of the courtroom without \n     even making bond on two of the indictments until early in \n     1967. Then, on short notice, the oldest of the five cases was \n     quickly called up for trial on April 22, 1967.\n       Why? the sudden change of attitude on the part of Messers. \n     Dillard and Pickering from that of a relaxed indulgence for a \n     year and a half to that of a sudden, vicious persecution of \n     Roy Strickland on charges that were nothing more than frame-\n     ups in the first place? Let's look into the Hidden Truth \n     which the Communist, J.W. West is trying to conceal from the \n     citizens of Mississippi.\n       ____ was out on bond doing work on oil rigs in Louisiana in \n     January of 1966 when he was contacted by Ford O'Neil. O'Neil \n     advanced a proposition to Strickland asking him to help the \n     State Investigators and the FBI in some work to kidnap and \n     torture a confession out to Lawrence Byrd on the Dahmer case. \n     Ford O'Neil promised Ray Strickland that in exchange for this \n     work, the FBI and State Investigators would pressure Chet \n     Dillard not to prosecute Strickland on the car thefts. \n     Strickland agreed to assist in the Lawrence Byrd kidnap and \n     torture, and brought in Jack Watkins, another ex-convict, who \n     at that time was wanted for burglary and armed robbery in the \n     Coast area. Jack Watkins was also promised immunity from his \n     crimes by the State Investigators and FBI agents. Later, Roy \n     Strickland, Jack Watkins, Ford O'Neil, MHSP, Steve Henderson, \n     NHSP, Roy K. Moore, Chief Special agent, FBI, and Bill Dukes, \n     Gulfport Special agent, FBI, got together to make final plans \n     and arrangements for the actual kidnapping and torture of \n     Lawrence Byrd. To show ``good faith'' Roy Moore gave Ford \n     O'Neil a hundred dollars, and Ford passed it over to Roy \n     Strickland to bind the deal. Several days later Strickland, \n     Watkins and several others did carryout the actual kidnap\n\n[[Page S13549]]\n\n     and torture of Lawrence Byrd. The FBI men stood in the bushes \n     out of sight and directed Byrd's statements while Watkins \n     tortured Byrd. This was the confession which resulted in the \n     arrest of a dozen or so innocent white men in the Dahmer \n     case.\n       At first, it seemed that the evil plot of the FBI would \n     succeed. J.W. West was giving them massive doses of \n     propaganda in order to convince the men before the ever \n     entered the courtroom and to the general public they were \n     looking like ``Lynden's Little Angels.'' But there was a \n     cloud on the horizon. The plot started coming to pieces \n     when Strickland was arrested on a drunk charge early in \n     1967 in Jones County. FBI Chieftan, Roy K. Moore, was \n     getting worried about Strickland, as was Ford O'Neil. They \n     wanted him to stay out of Jones County until after the \n     Dahmer case was tried. Strickland was worrying them by \n     coming back to Jones County at frequent intervals and \n     going on drinking sprees. All during 1966 rumors had been \n     circulating in Laurel that Strickland knew something about \n     the Lawrence Byrd kidnap-torture, and there was an ever-\n     present danger that Strickland might reveal the whole \n     thing to the wrong person during one of his binges. Roy K. \n     Moore could not rest easy as long as Roy Strickland was in \n     Jones County, whether in or out of jail, but it was \n     finally agreed that it was better to leave Strickland in \n     jail, and try to ease him off to Parchman, even if it \n     meant double crossing him.\n       However, Strickland began to realize that the FBI was \n     trying to use everybody against everybody, and then betray \n     everybody for the sole benefit and advancement of the FBI. \n     Strickland then decided to tell the truth and take his \n     chances in open court. He contacted the defense attorneys in \n     the Dahmer case and gave them the full facts about the FBI-\n     engineered kidnap and torture of Lawrence Byrd. This, and \n     much other supporting evidence was turned over to Chet \n     Dillard in order to obtain a just indictment for kidnapping \n     against Roy K. Moore, Bill Duke, Ford O'Neil, Steve \n     Hendrickson and Jack Watkins. When first given the evidence, \n     Dillard appeared to be interested in enforcing the law \n     without fear or favor, but when the proper FBI pressure was \n     applied to him he caved in like a ripe watermelon, and \n     defended the FBI men before the Grand Jury, and worked \n     against the indictment, using trickery, lies and deceit to \n     hobble the work of the Honest Jurors.

Roy K. \n     Moore is a criminal who was smart enough to acquire an \n     education and an official position BEFORE he began to prey \n     upon the honest and productive members of the community. Now, \n     he will, like any other criminal, threaten, beat, rob, \n     torture, persecute and kill anyone who interferes with the \n     advancement of his personal career, which, to him, is the \n     ``whole of the law.'' Truly, it may be said that these highly \n     trained criminals of the National Police Bureaucracy are the \n     most dangerous animals upon the face of the earth.\n       Understandably, weaklings such as Dillard and Pickering are \n     afraid of the FBI, but they should realize that Public \n     Service in America requires a Personal Sacrifice on the part \n     of the officeholder, and that the purpose of Law in America, \n     is Equal Justice, rather than the protection of official \n     Bureaucratic Criminals.\n       Whatever his past, Roy Strickland was working on an honest \n     job when the FBI enticed him to kidnap Lawrence Byrd. Whether \n     or no he stole the car? He is charged with, there is little \n     or no real evidence against him in any of them to establish \n     his guilt.

The \n     facts show the following:\n       1. Lawrence Byrd was kidnapped under the direction of the \n     F.B.I., with collaboration by Mississippi State Highway \n     Patrol investigators and assistance of ex-convicts and wanted \n     felons. The convict felons were hired and paid by the F.B.I. \n     and promised immunity by the state investigators in order to \n     get them to kidnap and torture Byrd.\n       2. The motive for the kidnap was to beat and torture \n     Lawrence Byrd into confessing to the Dahmer incident and \n     force him into implicating a large number of other men who \n     are politically opposed to dictatorship. This was to enhance \n     the prestige of the F.B.I. as an investigative organization, \n     and to frighten the citizens of Jones County and Mississippi \n     into submitting to dictatorship.\n       3. The men who arranged and conducted the Byrd kidnap were: \n     Roy Moore, F.B.I.; Bill Dukes, F.B.I.; Steven Henderson, \n     M.H.P.; Ford O'Neil, M.H.P.; Jack Watkins, convict felon, Roy \n     Strickland, convict felon, and others. Dillard and Pickering \n     have sworn affidavits in their possession, but they refuse to \n     do their duty and present the whole body of evidence to the \n     Jones County Grand Jury. They offer as their lame excuse that \n     ``too many important persons are involved.''\n       Since when has the LAW been a respecter of persons?\n       It is high time that we found out the real truth about the \n     American Gestapo, the F.B.I.

Are you going to do your duty and arrest Jack \n     Watkins or are you going to continue to try and confuse, \n     mislead and manipulate the Grand Jury?\n       Why were Dillard and Pickering so anxious to persecute old \n     Buck, who only stole a few hundred dollars, yet so reluctant \n     to indict the F.B.I. criminals who are stealing the life and \n     liberty of the whole country.

Accusing Pickering of \n     ``glaring racial insensitivity,'' they charge that he abused \n     his powers as a U.S. District Court judge in Mississippi to \n     give a light sentence to a man convicted of the crime. ``Why \n     anyone would go the whole nine yards and then some to get a \n     lighter sentence for a convicted cross burner is beyond me,'' \n     New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer said Wednesday. \n     ``Why anyone would do that--in 1994 and in a state with \n     Mississippi's history--is simply mind-boggling.''\n       But a close look at the facts of the case suggests that \n     Pickering's actions were not only not mind-boggling but were \n     in fact a reasonable way of handling a difficult case. Here \n     is what happened:\n       The crime took place on January 9, 1994. Three men--20-\n     year-old Daniel Swan, 25-year-old Mickey Herbert Thomas, and \n     a 17-year-old whose name was not released because he was a \n     juvenile--were drinking together when one of them came up \n     with the idea that they should construct a cross and burn it \n     in front of a house in which a white man and his black wife \n     lived in rural Walthall County in southern Mississippi. While \n     it is not clear who originally suggested the plan, it is \n     known that the 17-year-old appeared to harbor some sort of \n     hostility toward the couple; on an earlier occasion, he had \n     fired a gun into the house (no one was hit). Neither Swan nor \n     Thomas was involved in the shooting incident.\n       The men got into Swan's pickup truck, went to his barn, and \n     gathered wood to build an eight-foot cross. They then drove \n     to the couple's house, put up the cross, doused it with \n     gasoline, and set it on fire.\n       Because the case involved a cross burning covered under the \n     federal hate-crimes statute, local authorities immediately \n     brought in investigators from the Clinton Justice \n     Department's Office of Civil Rights. After the three suspects \n     were arrested in late February, 1994, lawyers for the civil-\n     rights office made the major decision in prosecuting the \n     case.\n       In a move that baffled and later angered Judge Pickering, \n     Civil Rights Division prosecutors early on decided to make a \n     plea bargain with two of the three suspects. The first, \n     Mickey Thomas, had an unusually low IQ, and prosecutors \n     decided to reduce charges against him based on that fact. The \n     second bargain was with the 17-year-old. Civil Rights \n     Division lawyers allowed both men to plead guilty to \n     misdemeanors in the cross-burning case (the juvenile also \n     pleaded guilty to felony charges in the shooting incident). \n     The Civil Rights Division recommended no jail time for both \n     men.\n       The situation was different for the third defendant, Daniel \n     Swan, who, like the others, faced charges under the hate-\n     crime statute. Unlike the others, however, Swan pleaded not \n     guilty. The law requires that the government prove the \n     accused acted out of racial animus, and Swan, whose defense \n     consisted mainly of the contention that he was drunk on the \n     night of the cross burning, maintained that he simply did not \n     have the racial animus necessary to be guilty of a hate crime \n     under federal law.\n       The case went to trial in Pickering's courtroom. During the \n     course of testimony, Pickering came to suspected the Civil \n     Rights Division had made a plea bargain with the wrong \n     defendant. No one questioned the Justice Department's \n     decision to go easy on the low-IQ Thomas, but the 17-year-\n     old was a different case. ``It was established to the \n     satisfaction of this court that although the juvenile was \n     younger than the defendant Daniel Swan, that nevertheless \n     the juvenile was the ring leader in the burning of the \n     cross involved in this crime,'' Pickering wrote in a \n     memorandum after the verdict. ``It was clearly established \n     that the juvenile had racial animus. . . . The court \n     expressed both to the government and to counsel for the \n     juvenile serious reservations about not imposing time in \n     the Bureau of Prisons for the juvenile defendant.''\n       In addition to the 17-year-old's role as leader, there was \n     significant evidence, including the fact that he had once \n     fired a shot into the mixed-race couple's home, suggesting \n     that he had a history of violent hostility to blacks that far \n     outweighed any racial animosity felt by Daniel Swan. Swan had \n     no criminal record, and seven witnesses testified that they \n     were not aware of any racial animus he might have held \n     against black people. On the other hand, one witness \n     testified that he believed Swan did not like blacks, and Swan \n     admitted under questioning that he had used the ``N'' word in \n     the past. In the end, Swan was found guilty--there was no \n     doubt that he had taken an active role in the cross burning--\n     and the Justice Department recommended that he be sentenced \n     to seven and a half years in jail.\n       At that point, the Justice Department had already made a \n     no-jail deal with the 17-year-old. When it came time to \n     sentence Swan, Pickering questioned whether it made sense \n     that the most-guilty defendant got off with a misdemeanor and \n     no jail time, while a less-guilty defendant would be \n     sentenced to seven and a half years in prison. ``The \n     recommendation of the government in this instance is clearly \n     the most egregious instance of disproportionate sentencing \n     recommended by the government in any case pending before this \n     court,'' Pickering wrote. ``The defendant [Swan] clearly had \n     less racial animosity than the juvenile.''\n       Compounding Pickering's concern was a conflict between two \n     federal appeals-court rulings over the applicability of a \n     statutory mandatory minimum sentence to the case. The Justice \n     Department insisted that Swan be sentenced to a minimum of \n     five years under one statute and two and a half years under a \n     separate law. Pickering doubted whether both were applicable \n     to the case and asked Civil Rights Division lawyers whether \n     the same sentencing standards were used in cases in other \n     federal circuits. The prosecutors said they would check with \n     Washington for an answer.\n       Pickering set a sentencing date of January 3, 1995. As the \n     date approached, he waited for an answer from the Justice \n     Department. He asked in November, 1994 and received no \n     response. He asked again in December and received no \n     response. He asked again on January 2, the day before the \n     sentencing, and still received no response. He delayed \n     sentencing, and on January 4 wrote a strongly-worded order to \n     prosecutors demanding not only that they respond to his \n     questions but that they take the issue up personally with \n     Attorney General Janet Reno and report back within ten days.\n       Shortly after issuing the order, Pickering called assistant \n     attorney general Frank Hunger, a Mississippian and friend of \n     Pickering's who headed the Justice Department's Civil \n     Division at the time (Hunger was also well known as the \n     brother-in-law of vice president Al Gore). Pickering says he \n     called Hunger to express ``my frustration with the gross \n     disparity in sentence recommended by the government, and my \n     inability to get a response from the Justice Department in \n     Washington.'' Hunger told Pickering that the case wasn't \n     within his area of responsibility. It appears that Hunger \n     took no action as a result of the call. (Hunger later \n     supported Pickering's nomination to the federal appeals \n     courts.)\n       Finally, Pickering got word from Civil Rights Division \n     prosecutors, who said they had decided to drop the demand \n     that Swan be given the five-year minimum portion of the \n     recommended sentence. Pickering then sentenced Swan to 27 \n     months in jail. At the sentencing hearing, Pickering told \n     Swan, ``You're going to the penitentiary because of what you \n     did. And it's an area that we've got to stamp out; that we've \n     got to learn to live, races among each other. And the type of \n     conduct that you exhibited cannot and will not be tolerated . \n     . . . You did that which does hinder good race relations and \n     was a despicable act . . . . I would suggest to you that \n     during the time you're in the prison that you do some reading \n     on race relations and maintaining good race relations and how \n     that can be done.''\n       So Swan went to jail, for a bit more than two years rather \n     than seven. Every lawyer in the case--the defense attorneys, \n     the prosecutors, and the judge--faced the difficulty of \n     dealing with an ugly situation and determining the \n     appropriate punishment for a bad guy and a somewhat less-bad \n     guy. Pickering, who believed the Civil Rights Division went \n     too easy on the 17-year-old bad guy, worked out what he \n     believed was the best sentence for Daniel Swan. It was a \n     real-world solution to the kind of real-world problem that \n     the justice system deals with every day. And it was the end \n     of the cross-burning case until Pickering was nominated by \n     President Bush to a place on the Fifth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     [From Byron York, NR White House Correspondent, Jan. 13, 2003]\n\n         The Cross-Burning Case: What Really Happened, Part II\n\n       After the publication last Thursday of ``The Cross Burning \n     Case: What Really Happened,'' readers have asked follow-up \n     questions about the 1994 trial that Democrats cite to accuse \n     federal-appeals-court-nominee Charles Pickering of ``racial \n     insensitivity.'' New York Sen. Charles Schumer and others \n     charge that Pickering, a U.S. District Court judge in \n     Mississippi who has been nominated for a place on the Fifth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, abused his powers to win a light \n     sentence for a man convicted of burning a cross in the front \n     yard of a mixed-race couple. Here are some of the questions \n     that have been asked about the case, along with answers based \n     on the best available information:\n       Why did the Clinton Justice Department give a no-jail \n     misdemeanor plea bargain to the 17-year-old defendant--who \n     was the ringleader in the crime, who appeared to be motivated \n     by racial hatred, and who had on an earlier occasion fired a \n     shot into the home of the mixed-race couple--while demanding \n     that the other defendant, Daniel Swan--who was not the \n     ringleader, who apparently did not share the 17-year-old's \n     racial animus, and who had no role in the shooting incident--\n     be sent to jail for seven and a half years?\n       The answer is not entirely clear; the Justice Department's \n     prosecution memos and other internal deliberation documents \n     are\n\n[[Page S13551]]\n\n     confidential, and no one who was involved in the prosecution \n     has publicly explained the department's motives. but there is \n     enough publicly available evidence to suggest a few \n     conclusions. First, and most obviously, the 17-year-old \n     agreed to plead guilty, which often helps a defendant receive \n     a reduced sentence. (It's not clear why the Justice \n     Department dealt with the 17-year-old as a juvenile; given \n     the seriousness of the crime, he could have been treated as \n     an adult.) Swan did not agree to plead guilty. While he never \n     denied that he took part in the cross burning, he did deny \n     that he acted out of racial animus, which is required for a \n     heavy sentence under the federal hate crimes statute. He \n     chose to take his chances at trial, and was convicted. At \n     that point, there was no question he would go to prison. \n     Pickering felt strongly that Swan should serve time, but he \n     believed that seven-and-a-half years was too long, in light \n     of the leniency given to the 17-year-old and the other \n     circumstances of the case (discussed below).\n       Another possible explanation for the easy treatment given \n     to the 17-year-old is that the no-jail plea offer was made by \n     the United States Attorney's Office in Mississippi (and \n     accepted by the defendant) before all the facts of the case \n     were known. The government's insistence on a mandatory \n     minimum seven-and-a-half year sentence for Swan came later, \n     after lawyers from the Justice Department's Civil Rights \n     Division became involved. While they wanted a stiff sentence \n     for Swan, it appears that the Civil Rights Division lawyers \n     also realized that letting the 17-year-old off with no jail \n     had been a mistake. In a February 12, 2002 letter to \n     Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, Pickering cited the transcript \n     of an open court session in which he told Civil Rights \n     Division lawyer Brad Berry that he felt the Swan case was an \n     example of disparate sentencing. Berry answered, according to \n     the transcript cited by Pickering, that, ``Perhaps the \n     lesson--the lesson that I take from that, your Honor, is that \n     perhaps the government should have been more tough--should \n     have asked for a more stringent or stronger or longer \n     sentence for the other defendants in this case.''\n       There are also some indications that at least one Justice \n     Department lawyer involved in the case agreed with Pickering \n     that the department's sentencing demand for Swan was too \n     severe. In a January 5, 1995 memo to Linda Davis, who was \n     head of the criminal section of the Civil Rights Division, \n     federal prosecutor Jack Lacy recounted several sessions with \n     Pickering on the Swan issue (memo was made public as part of \n     Pickering's confirmation hearings.) ``The impulse to the \n     conversation is always the same,'' Lacy wrote. ``He thinks \n     the sentence facing Swan is draconian, and he wants a way \n     out. He has been careful to phrase his concern in such terms \n     as, `I wish you could suggest some way that this harsh \n     sentence could be avoided.''' Later in the letter, Lacy wrote \n     that he ``personally agreed with the judge that the sentence \n     is draconian,'' but said he also reminded Pickering that Swan \n     could have pleaded guilty but instead, ``the defendant \n     repeatedly chucked our offers in our teeth.''\n       Finally, as the last few words of that passage suggest, it \n     is possible that Swam--and the whole vexing case--simply made \n     prosecutors mad. They could not undo the damage they had done \n     by letting the 17-year-old off with no jail time, but they \n     could compensate by meting out heavy punishment to Swan.\n       How did Pickering know that the 17-year-old harbored the \n     racial animus required for a severe sentence under the hate \n     crime statute, while Swan did not?\n       The first and clearest reason is the earlier incident in \n     which the 17-year-old had fired a shot into the home of the \n     mixed-race couple in whose yard he and Swan would later burn \n     the cross. (The Justice Department allowed the 17-year-old to \n     plead guilty to a felony in that incident, all as part of the \n     no-jail plea bargain.) Swan had nothing to do with that \n     shooting, and had no criminal record. The other evidence of \n     racial animus came out during the sentencing phase of the \n     trial--well after the government had agreed to the juvenile's \n     guilty plea. This is how Pickering explained it in his \n     February 12, 2002 letter to Hatch:\n       ``At sentencing. . . . courts must also take into account \n     evidence of the defendant's history. This is where the \n     breadth of disparity in racial animus between the 17 year-old \n     and Swan became clear. While the 17 year-old and Swan had \n     both used the ``N-word'' previously, the 17 year-old's own \n     grandmother stated that he did not like ``blacks'' and his \n     own mother stated that he ``hated N - - - - s.'' (Emphasis \n     added.) In contrast, seven witnesses and Swan's mother stated \n     that he had no racial animus; only one witness stated that \n     Swan did not like African Americans, and this was disputed. \n     Further, the 17 year-old had acted on his ``hate'' by \n     fighting with African Americans at school, resulting in his \n     suspension. Swan had neither fought with African Americans \n     nor been suspended for any racial incident. Moreover, the 17 \n     year-old had shot a firearm into the home of the mixed-race \n     couple in whose yard the cross was later burned and bragged \n     about ``shooting at some N - - - - s.'' Swan had never shot \n     at or into the home of African Americans, or anyone else. In \n     short, even though both participated in the heinous crime, \n     the 17 year-old defendant also had a history of escalating \n     violence motivated by the racial hatred that culminated in \n     his participation in the cross burning, while Swan did not.''\n       Was Pickering's communication with the Justice Department \n     improper?\n       At Pickering's second confirmation hearing, North Carolina \n     Democratic Sen. John Edwards accused him of violating the \n     Code of Judicial Conduct by calling top Justice Department \n     official (and fellow Mississippian) Frank Hunger to discuss \n     the Swan case. In that call, Pickering expressed his \n     frustration with the Justice Department's position; Hunger \n     told Pickering the case wasn't within his area of \n     responsibility, and the two men ended the conversation.\n       The section of the Code to which Edwards referred is a rule \n     intended to prevent judges from making secret deals with one \n     side or another in a case. It says: ``A judge should . . . \n     neither initiate nor consider exparte communications on the \n     merits, or procedures affecting the merits, of a pending or \n     impending proceeding.'' Pickering explained to the Judiciary \n     Committee that he had previously discussed his concerns at \n     length with both sides in the Swan case and that the call to \n     Hunger was a ``follow-up'' to see if the Justice Department \n     was going to respond to his questions about the sentencing. \n     None of that, he explained, touched on the merits of the \n     case, and thus the call was not improper.\n       In addition, last February, Hunger, a lifelong Democrat who \n     also happens to be Al Gore's brother-in-law, wrote a letter \n     to the Judiciary Committee saying, ``I think it appropriate \n     that it be known that I have little or no recollection of the \n     call. The significance of this to me is that had I felt at \n     the time that there was anything inappropriate or improper \n     about Judge Pickering's call I would most assuredly remember \n     it today.'' Continuing, Hunger told the committee, ``I have \n     known Judge Pickering for nearly thirty years and have the \n     utmost respect for him as a fair-minded judge who would never \n     knowingly do anything improper or unethical.;;\n       Had Pickering ever shown similar concerns about heavy \n     sentencing of other defendants, particularly African \n     Americans, in cases that had nothing to do with race?\n       On March 14, 2002, at the Judiciary Committee meeting in \n     which Democrats killed the Pickering nomination, Sen. Edward \n     Kennedy suggested that Pickering practiced a selective form \n     of leniency--that he went easy on a racist cross burner and \n     tough on everybody else, including blacks convicted of crimes \n     in his court. One week later, on March 21, Pickering sent \n     Hatch a letter in which he said,``I have consistently sought \n     to keep from imposing unduly harsh penalties on young people \n     whom I did not feel were hardened criminals.'' (Swan was a \n     first-time offender.) Pickering went on to describe several \n     cases in which ``departed downward,' that is, reduced the \n     sentences of first-time offenders from the mandatory minimums \n     required by law.\n       ``One case involved a 20-year-old African American male who \n     faced a mandatory minimum five year sentence,'' Pickering \n     wrote. ``I departed downward to 30 months. I also recommended \n     that he be allowed to participate in the intensive \n     confinement program which further reduced his sentence.'' \n     Pickering also described the case of a 58-year-old black man \n     who faced a five-year mandatory sentence, plus a minimum of \n     46 months for a separate drug charge. Pickering again \n     sentenced the man to 30 months. In two other cases, he threw \n     out any jail time for men who faced prison terms of 18 and 40 \n     months, respectively. Both defendants were black. ``I have \n     departed downward in far more cases involving African \n     Americans than I have in cases involving white defendants,'' \n     Pickering wrote.\n       Pickering sent Hatch the names of the cases, the case \n     numbers, letters from the defense lawyers involved, and the \n     phone numbers of people to call to check his account of his \n     sentencing practices. Of course, by that time, Democrats on \n     the committee had already killed his nomination on a straight \n     party-line vote.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Mar. 9, 2003]\n\nThe Cross-Burning Trial, Judge's Handling of One Case Gave His Critics \n                               Ammunition\n\n                            (By Bill Rankin)\n\n       Charles Pickering has heard hundreds of legal arguments and \n     handed down thousands of rulings, but his judicial reputation \n     hangs almost entirely on one explosive case.\n       In 1994, the federal judge put extraordinary pressure on \n     federal prosecutors to slash the sentence of Daniel Swan, a \n     man who had burned a cross outside an interracial couple's \n     home in rural Mississippi. Democrats and liberal interest \n     groups have hammered Pickering with the case, branding him as \n     racially insensitive and unfit to serve on a federal appeals \n     court.\n       ``Why anyone would go the whole 9 yards, and then some, to \n     get a lighter sentence for a convicted cross-burner is beyond \n     me,'' Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said during a hearing on \n     Pickering's first appeals court nomination last year. ``Why \n     anyone would do that in 1994, and in a state with \n     Mississippi's sad history of race relations, is simply mind-\n     boggling.''\n       But a review of the case by The Atlanta Journal-\n     Constitution, part of the newspaper's broad look at \n     Pickering's record on the bench, finds that the judge \n     apparently acted out of a concern for fairness. Two cross-\n     burning co-defendants, including the purported ringleader, \n     had received far lighter sentences than Swan, and Pickering \n     saw that as unjust.\n\n[[Page S13552]]\n\n       Prosecutors would have no reason to sympathize with the \n     judge, as it was the stiff sentence they sought that the \n     judge was attacking. Yet an internal Justice Department \n     account of a closed-door meeting held by Pickering shows the \n     judge deeply troubled by the sentencing disparity.\n       At the same time, the Justice Department memo, written by a \n     lawyer in the case, lends at least some support to the \n     charges of Pickering's opponents. It depicts the judge \n     worrying about how a harsh sentence on Swan would play in the \n     community--presumably the white community--a factor that \n     should be irrelevant to the pursuit of justice.\n       In the case, two men and a 17-year-old boy were out \n     drinking on the night of Jan. 9, 1994. They set fire to an 8-\n     foot-tall cross outside the Improve, Miss., home of a white \n     man and his African-American wife.\n       Two defendants--Mickey Herbert Thomas and the juvenile--\n     pleaded guilty to federal civil rights charges. Following \n     recommendations from prosecutors, Pickering sentenced both to \n     probation with home confinement. As it turned out, the 17-\n     year-old was likely the instigator, who would later admit to \n     firing a shot through the interracial couple's window.\n       The final defendant, Swan, 20, went to trial. He admitted \n     being at the scene but said he was not there out of racial \n     animosity. The jury found otherwise, convicting him on three \n     counts. Federal prosecutors then asked Pickering to sentence \n     Swan to 7\\1/2\\ years in prison.\n       Pickering strongly criticized the sentencing disparity. He \n     persuaded prosecutors to drop one count in order to void one \n     conviction that required a five-year mandatory sentence. \n     Pickering eventually sentenced Swan to two years and three \n     months in prison.\n\n\n                     faith in justice ``destroyed''\n\n       That move troubled Brenda Polkey, one of the victims of the \n     cross-burning incident. Last year, she wrote to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee in opposition to Pickering's appeals \n     court nomination, fueling the Democrats' attack.\n       Polkey, who had lost a family member to a racial killing, \n     said she had ``experienced incredible feelings of relief and \n     faith in the justice system'' when a predominantly white jury \n     convicted Swan.\n       ``My faith in the justice system was destroyed, however, \n     when I learned about Judge Pickering's efforts to reduce the \n     sentence of Mr. Swan,'' she wrote. ``I am astonished that the \n     judge would have gone to such lengths to thwart the judgment \n     of the jury and to reduce the sentence of a person who caused \n     so much harm to me and my family.''\n       The AJC review of the judge's rulings, however, shows that \n     Pickering--like many other federal judges who face rigid U.S. \n     sentencing rules--has gone out of his way many times to \n     reduce prison sentences in cases where he thought the result \n     would be unreasonable. And many of the defendants who \n     benefited are black.\n       William Moody, an African-American drug defendant, was \n     arrested in 2000, seven years after his indictment. \n     Authorities could not find him because he was living in New \n     York, holding a steady job and supporting his family. Upon \n     learning about Moody's apparent turnaround, Pickering delayed \n     his sentencing a year, allowing his continued good behavior \n     to be used as a basis for punishment with no prison time.\n       Five years earlier, in a large-scale cocaine case, \n     Pickering learned months after sentencing black defendant \n     Richard Evans to 12\\1/2\\ years in prison that prosecutors \n     were recommending he sentence a more culpable co-defendant \n     also an African-American, to no more than nine years. \n     Pickering quickly vacated Evans' sentence and later sent him \n     to prison for 10 years--five months less than what the co-\n     defendant received.\n       ``He has tried to treat people fairly,'' said Lloyd Miller, \n     a U.S. probation officer who prepared sentencing reports in \n     Pickering's courtroom for more than a decade. ``It didn't \n     matter whether you were black or white, whether you were a \n     pauper or if you had money.''\n       Pickering, who would not comment for this article pending a \n     vote on his renomination, has said that in almost all the \n     criminal cases that came before him involving nonviolent \n     first offenders, he has tried to lessen their sentences.\n       ``I have consistently sought to keep from imposing unduly \n     harsh penalties on young people whom I did not feel were \n     hardened criminals,'' Pickering wrote in a letter to Senate \n     Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) following his \n     combative confirmation hearings last year.\n       Pickering has not addressed his reported worry about a \n     white backlash in the cross-burning case because the Justice \n     Department memo has not been publicized until now. But there \n     is substantial evidence, both from his civic life and \n     judicial record, to believe that he does not cater to white \n     people's particular interests.\n       In a 1999 essay on race relations in the Jackson Clarion-\n     Ledger, Pickering addressed racial bias in the courts, \n     empathizing with black, not white, concerns. He counseled \n     whites who were angry about the recent acquittal of a black \n     murder suspect to look at the justice system from a black \n     perspective.\n       White Mississippians may not realize that African-Americans \n     are treated differently by the system, he wrote, but ``it is \n     the truth and a most disturbing one if you are black.''\n       As a judge, Pickering has thrown out only two jury \n     verdicts, both times because he felt the verdicts were biased \n     against minority plaintiffs.\n       In one of the cases, in 1993, an African-American woman was \n     injured at a restaurant. The jury awarded the woman only what \n     the restaurant argued she should receive. Pickering ordered a \n     new trial, and the second jury awarded the woman a larger \n     judgment.\n\n\n                              other issues\n\n       Interest groups opposing the judge maintain the cross-\n     burning case is just part of a pattern of the judge's \n     racially questionable rulings.\n       Opponents point to the Pickering's ruling involving the \n     Voting Rights Act, an important civil rights law that \n     mandates federal oversight of Southern elections to keep \n     white authorities from suppressing the black vote. The law \n     has allowed black-majority voting districts to be created in \n     some cases, boosting the number of minorities elected to \n     political office.\n       Laughlin McDonald, director of the American Civil Liberties \n     Union's Southern regional office in Atlanta, acknowledged \n     that Pickering had enforced the Voting Rights Act to the \n     satisfaction of minority plaintiffs in some cases.\n       ``But what is disturbing is the philosophy that seems to \n     pervade his decisions,'' he said. ``He has an obvious \n     hostility to the federal courts getting involved in this \n     issue.''\n       In several cases reviewed by the AJC, Pickering did \n     question how far the federal courts should go to resolve \n     certain voting-rights issues. The judge wrote from the \n     perspective of a former legislator who once had to draw lines \n     for voting districts himself--and who still respects \n     lawmakers' prerogatives.\n       In a 1993 decision, Pickering wrote at length about the \n     history of the one-person, one-vote principle, suggesting \n     courts may have applied it too rigidly sometimes.\n       The courts ``should be cautions in their obtrusion into \n     what otherwise would be a legislative manner,'' he wrote in \n     denying a challenge to election districts in Forrest County, \n     Miss.\n       Legislative bodies, when drawing voting districts, must \n     consider the convenience of new districts to voters and their \n     costs, Pickering wrote. Court rulings that ordered some \n     districts be redrawn have shown, Pickering added, ``that very \n     few of those responsible for handing down these decisions \n     ever had the responsibility themselves of carrying out these \n     decisions or trying to comply with them.'' Pickering's \n     application of judicial restraint is in line with that of \n     many federal judges. Like many other jurists put on the bench \n     by Republican presidents, Pickering appears disinclined to \n     tinker at the margins of social dilemmas as would a more \n     activist judge.\n       As such, Pickering would find himself at home at the 5th \n     U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, widely considered one of the \n     more conservative appellate courts in the country.\n\n\n                         A will to get his way\n\n       Liberal critics have complained about the judge's general \n     conservatism. But it is questionable how much those \n     complaints would resonate without the cross-burning case \n     against Swan and his two co-defendants.\n       The case shows Pickering exerting his will and the power of \n     the federal bench to get his way from the Justice \n     Department's civil rights lawyers in Washington.\n       At trial, Swan was convicted of three counts: violating the \n     interracial couple's civil rights, interfering with their \n     federally protected housing rights and using fire when he \n     committed a crime, which prosecutors said carried a \n     mandatory, consecutive five-year sentence.\n       Pickering not only thought the 7\\1/2\\-year sentence sought \n     by prosecutors for Swan was unfair, but he also questioned \n     whether a five-year mandatory sentence for one of the counts \n     applied to the cross-burning case, as prosecutors contended. \n     Pickering noted there was a split in the federal appeals \n     courts on that very issue.\n       Pickering repeatedly asked Civil Rights Division lawyers to \n     explain to him whether the same sentencing standards were \n     being used in other cases across the country. After receiving \n     no answers, Pickering demanded the issue be addressed to \n     then-U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. Pickering even called \n     Vice President Al Gore's brother-in-law, Frank Hunger, a \n     longtime friend who headed the Justice department's Civil \n     Division, to express his frustration.\n       Pickering summed up his thoughts about the sentencing \n     disparities in the cross-burning case clearly when Swan was \n     to be sentenced on Nov. 15, 1994.\n       ``He committed a reprehensible crime, and a jury's found \n     that,'' Pickering said from the bench. ``And he's going to \n     pay a price for it. But I have never, since I've been on this \n     bench, seen a more contradictory, inconsistent position by \n     the government than they're taking in this case.''\n       Bradford Berry, a civil rights prosecutor from Washington, \n     responded by saying perhaps the Justice Department should \n     have asked for harsher punishment against Swan's two co-\n     defendants.\n       ``You're the one working for the Justice Department, not \n     me,'' Pickering shot back. ``I didn't take that position. The \n     Justice Department took that position.''\n       Pickering postponed the sentencing another two months. He \n     also called all the lawyers involved back to his chambers, \n     without a court reporter to transcribe the discussion.\n\n[[Page S13553]]\n\n       In a memo written after the meeting, Berry gave an \n     extraordinary account of what transpired.\n       Pickering told the lawyers about his civil rights \n     background, saying that while not at the forefront of the \n     movement, he was a supporter, according to Berry's memo. \n     Pickering said he'd testified against a Ku Klux Klan leader, \n     had twice thrown out jury verdicts in trials when he thought \n     the results were tainted with racism and had encouraged his \n     son to make certain his fraternity at the University of \n     Mississippi was not discriminating against a black student \n     who wanted to join.\n       ``Pickering said he has carefully examined his conscience \n     in this case an is confident that his discomfort with the \n     sentence is not the product of racism,'' berry wrote.\n       But Pickering also gave another reason the case disturbed \n     him, Berry noted. The judge said that ``in the current racial \n     climate in that part of the state, such a harsh sentence \n     would serve only to divide the community.''\n       Pickering then asked prosecutors to consider agreeing to \n     dismiss the count against Swan that mandated a five-year \n     sentence. By the time prosecutors returned for Swan's \n     sentencing two months later, they had capitulated, agreeing \n     to drop it.\n       Don Samuel, former president of the Georgia Association of \n     Criminal Defense Lawyers, who studied Berry's memo, said \n     Pickering's aggressive posture in the cross-burning case is \n     not uncommon among the federal judiciary.\n       ``There are judges who want a just result and try to \n     convince the parties to find a way that enables them to do so \n     under the federal sentencing guidelines, which can be very \n     harsh and rigid,'' Samuel said. ``These things happen. Often \n     it's very well-intentioned to get around a harsh result.''\n       But Samuel said he found troubling Berry's account of \n     Pickering's concern about a harsh sentence dividing the \n     community. ``That doesn't seem like a very good basis and it \n     shouldn't be,'' the defense lawyer said.\n       University of Georgia criminal law professor Ron Carlson \n     said the only part of the community that would be divided by \n     such a sentence would ``probably be rural white people.''\n       But Carlson said it is unfortunate that Pickering has been \n     condemned for his action in the cross-burnings case. ``That's \n     because this is certainly not a racist judge overseeing the \n     cross-burning case,'' he said. ``Quite the opposite. He's \n     very fulsome in his condemnation.''\n       When the sentence was finally imposed on Jan. 23, 1995, \n     Pickering told Swan he had committed ``a despicable act.''\n       ``The type of conduct you exhibited cannot and will not be \n     tolerated,'' the judge said. He suggested to Swan that \n     ``during the time that you're in prison . . . do some reading \n     on race relations and maintaining good race relations and how \n     that can be done.''\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I will not dwell on the lifelong record \nof Mr. Pickering. But his testimony against Sam Bowers was not an \nisolated instance. I will not dwell on the charge some have made about \na 1994 case. Senator Hatch dealt with that, although I ask unanimous \nconsent to include two articles, one from the National Review Online \nand the Atlanta Journal-Constitution explaining what really happened. \nIn short, the Justice Department botched the case and the ringleader in \nthe cross burning was turned loose. Pickering then properly reduced a \njuvenile accomplice's sentence from seven and one half years to 27 \nmonths, severely criticizing him.\n  In terms of the struggle for equality and freedom, I have seen the \nSouth and our Nation change for the better during my lifetime. I have \ntried to help bring about that change. When I look back now, it seems \nembarrassingly slow and amazing that it was so hard. I remember as a \nstudent at Vanderbilt in 1962, when we raised the issue of integrating \nthe student body, the student body voted no. I remember in 1980 I \nappointed the first Black Tennessee supreme court justice, and he was \ndefeated in the next election. I remember it was 1985 before we had the \nMartin Luther King Holiday, and the legislature nearly voted it down. I \nappointed the first two African American vice presidents of the \nUniversity of Tennessee, but that did not happen until 1989.\n  Our country, from its beginning, has truly been a work in progress. \nAnd on this issue, racial justice, we have had an especially hard time \nmaking progress. We have had a hard time changing our minds. The truth \nis, most members of my own generation have had one view about race in \nthe 1960's and another view today. Many of the men and women who are \njudges, who are mayors, who are legislators, who are Senators today, \nopposed integration in the 1950s, opposed the Voting Rights Act in the \n1960s. They were against the Martin Luther King holiday in the 1980s, \nand we welcome them to society today. We have confirmed some of them to \nthe Federal bench, some of them Democrats, some of them Republicans.\n  What is especially ironic about this incident is that Judge Pickering \nwas not one of those people whose ideas we have to excuse. He led his \ntimes. He spoke out. He would have, I am certain, joined Judge Wisdom, \nJudge Tuttle, Judge Rives, and Judge Brown in ordering Ole Miss to \nadmit James Meredith to the University of Mississippi 40 years ago.\n  Why would we not now recognize this man, who lived in the Deep South, \nwho did what we all hope we would have had the courage to do, but might \nnot have done in the late 1960s? Why would we not now honor and \nrecognize that service by confirming his nomination to this appellate \ncourt?\n  I care about the court. I care about these issues. I have studied the \nrecord as carefully as I could. All of the evidence supports the fact \nthat Charles Pickering is a worthy successor on the Fifth Circuit to \nthe court of Judge John Minor Wisdom, Judge Elbert Tuttle, Judge \nRichard Rives, and Judge John R. Brown.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words concerning the \nnomination of Judge Charles Pickering.\n  Throughout the entire history of the Senate, no judicial nominee has \never been defeated by a filibuster. Yet in this session alone, four \nnominations have been blocked by this unconstitutional obstruction. \nSoon, there will be five, six, and likely even more nominees facing \npartisan filibusters. this obstruction flies in the face of more than \n200 years of Senate tradition, the constitutional role of the Congress, \nand the consent of the governed.\n  While all of these filibusters are wrong, it seems to me that the \ntactics employed against certain nominees is particularly disgraceful.\n  First, we witnessed the hostile attitude towards Leon Holmes, a \nnominee for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Despite having earned the \nsupport of each of his home state Senators--both members of the \nminority--Mr. Holmes was sharply criticized--not for his legal work, \nbut for his personal writings about his religious views.\n  Then we witnessed the strident animus directed toward Alabama \nAttorney General, Bill Pryor--who was repeatedly challenged over \nwhether his ``philosophy'' and ``deeply held views,'' particularly \nthose arising from his religious beliefs, precluded him from becoming a \njudge.\n  And now, today, we are witnessing the terrible treatment of Judge \nCharles Pickering. This is an issue that is of particular importance to \nmy state, because Judge Pickering has been nominated to a long-standing \nvacancy on the Fifth Circuit--which covers Texas and Louisiana in \naddition to Mississippi.\n  Like the other nominees, Judge Pickering is a deeply religious man. \nHe is also a man from the South. And I believe he is clearly qualified \nto serve on the federal bench, as he has been serving for over a \ndecade. Yet Judge Pickering has, like others, become the target of a \nvenomous special interest group campaign, one directed against \nSoutherners and against those who take their faith seriously. A \nrepresentative of one of these groups recently called Judge Pickering a \n``racist,'' a ``bigot,'' and ``a woman-hater.''\n  It is sad to see this shameful caricature of a well-qualified, \nrespected man. And it is sadder still to see these special interests \ndominate the other side of the aisle. I hoped such tactics would never \ngain apologists among any members of this body, but hearing this debate \ntoday, I fear that my hope was all for naught.\n  This Nation, both North and South, has for too long suffered from the \nscourge of racism. We have made a great deal of progress so far, and \nthere is more to go. but even as we condemn racism with all our might, \nwe must also condemn false charges of racism. Every false charge of \nracism weakens a true charge of racism, and ultimately, that hurts us \nall.\n  Judge Pickering has been praised and supported by those who know him \nbest--by those who have worked by his side, and seen him fight racism \nin his home state of Mississippi.\n  My fellow Southerners who have reviewed the record carefully agree. \nAll six Mississippi statewide officeholders, including five Democrats, \nhave stated that Judge Pickering's ``record demonstrates his commitment \nto equal\n\n[[Page S13554]]\n\nprotection, equal rights and fairness for all.'' The senior Senator \nfrom Louisiana has applauded Pickering's lifelong campaign against \nracism, characterizing them as ``acts of courage.'' And the Senators \nfrom Georgia have written that, ``Pickering's critics have and will \ncontinue to unfairly label him a racist and segregationist,'' and that \n``nothing could be further from the truth.''\n  But perhaps the most compelling views on this subject have been \nexpressed by Mr. Charles Evers. He is the brother of the slain civil \nrights leader Medgar Evers, and he has personally known Judge Pickering \nfor over 30 years. He is intimately familiar with Judge Pickering's \nnumerous actions throughout his career to fight racism, often with deep \nsacrifice and personal cost.\n  Mr. Evers wrote in the Wall Street Journal in support of Judge \nPickering, saying,\n\n       As someone who has spent all my adult life fighting for \n     equal treatment of African-Americans, I can tell you with \n     certainty that Charles Pickering has an admirable record on \n     civil rights issues. He has taken tough stands at tough times \n     in the past, and the treatment he and his record are \n     receiving at the hands of certain interest groups is shameful \n     . . . Those in Washington and New York who criticize Judge \n     Pickering are the same people who have always looked down on \n     Mississippi and its people, and have done very little for our \n     state's residents.\n\n  I hope that today the Senate will take a stand against the despicable \ntactics of radical special interest groups. We must not allow the \nspecial interests' exploitation of religious views, stereotypes, or \nfalse caricatures--concerning Southerners or any other people--to \ndecide a vote on any nominee. Such reprehensible practices have no \nplace in this debate. And it is a dark day for the Senate and for \nAmerica's independent judiciary when we allow special interests to \ndictate the basis for disqualification.\n  I ask my fellow Senators to vote to confirm Judge Pickering, to \nreject the inhuman caricature that has been drawn by special interest \ngroups intent on vilifying, demonizing, and marginalizing an admirable \nnominee. I hope that my colleagues will give all these qualified \nnominees what they deserve, and allow them to have an up or down vote.\n  For the sake of the Senate, the Nation, and our independent \njudiciary, I hope that these days of obstruction finally end.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I speak today in support of Judge Charles \nPickering and his nomination to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Judge Pickering was unanimously confirmed to be a Federal district \njudge in 1990, where he has served honorably ever since. He graduated \nfirst in his law school class at the University of Mississippi while \nserving on the Law Journal and Moot Court. In addition to practicing in \na law firm, Judge Pickering was both a city and county prosecutor and a \nmunicipal court judge. Judge Pickering continued his public service in \nthe Mississippi State Senate. He also has served his fellow man by \nhelping others through organizations like the Red Cross and the March \nof Dimes. Judge Pickering has also devoted his life to Christ, serving \nat the First Baptist Church in Laurel, MS, as a Sunday school teacher \nand a deacon.\n  Those things tell us much about the man that Charles Pickering is. \nBut there is much more. You see, Judge Pickering has spent his career \nas a leader in race relations in Mississippi. What is truly telling, \nhowever, is he spent his whole career tearing down barriers for \nminorities in the South, including during the 1960s and 1970s. Those \nactions did not make him a popular man among many in Mississippi at the \ntime.\n  I remember the 1960s and 1970s. I regularly traveled around the \ncountry during those years and I remember what race relations were like \nin the South and throughout America. I remember what it was like as \nprofessional baseball gradually accepted then embraced minorities. It \nwas a tumultuous time in our country and many brave men and women \nwillingly staked their careers, their reputations, and even their lives \non doing what was just and right. Charles Pickering was one of those \nmen.\n  The stories of how Judge Pickering stepped above the fray and reached \nout to bring racial equality to Mississippi have been told many times. \nIn recent years Judge Pickering has served on race relations committees \nin Mississippi including the Institute for Racial Reconciliation at the \nUniversity of Mississippi. He has spent time working with at-risk \nminority children.\n  Those actions are laudable in and of themselves, but the actions that \ntell the true story of who Charles Pickering really is come from the \n1960s and 1970s, those years when racial tensions were at their highest \nand the South was so volatile. In 1967 Judge Pickering was Prosecuting \nAttorney Pickering in Jones County, MS. Knowing it was to his own \npersonal detriment, Charles Pickering took the witness stand to testify \nagainst the ``Imperial Wizard'' of the Ku Klux Klan in a trial for \nkilling a black civil rights activist in a fire-bombing attack. By \nstanding up for equality and justice, Prosecuting Attorney Pickering \nput himself and his family in danger and lost his reelection.\n  You can never really judge the strength of a man's convictions until \nstanding up for those beliefs costs him something. Judge Pickering's \nwillingness to stand up against racial violence cost him his job as a \nprosecutor. But that did not dissuade him from continuing to fight for \nracial justice. Possibly the most contentious race issue in the 1960s \nand 1970s was the integration of the public schools. Integration came \nto Laurel, MS, in 1973. Integration has been fought for years and \ncreating a plan was not an easy task. The black and white communities \nin Laurel were split and Charles Pickering worked to bring them \ntogether and create a plan to integrate the schools. In the end many \nwhite families still moved their children to private schools to avoid \nintegration and Judge Pickering easily could have done the same with \nhis kids. Instead, he believed in integration and kept his children in \nthe public schools.\n  Unfortunately, the reason Charles Pickering has been singled out by \nthe radical left has nothing to do with the man or his qualifications. \nIt has everything to do with ideology and the remaining adherents of a \nfailed liberal orthodoxy holding on to their last vestiges of power in \nthis Nation--the courts.\n  A radical liberal minority in this country is scared of Judge \nPickering. They do not think he will do a bad job because he is \nunqualified. After all, the American Bar Association rated Judge \nPickering ``well qualified.'' Last I had heard, the liberal minority \nobstructing Judge Pickering's nomination called that rating their gold \nstandard for judicial nominees.\n  The reason the liberal special interests are scared of Judge \nPickering is that he is a judge who knows his role, who follows the \nlaw, and has a stellar civil rights record. These special interests \nhave lost out in the public opinion and mainstream politics. They \ncannot successfully achieve their goals in the normal course of \ngovernance so they turn to the court system, which they have \nsuccessfully used to roll back traditional values, traditional roles of \nGovernment, and individual rights. A judge with a proven record of \nfollowing the law and understanding the difference between the \nlegislature and the judiciary is a roadblock in their path of \nlegislating through the judiciary.\n  I really believe Judge Pickering was singled out because of his \nstellar record on civil rights. It seems to me the liberal special \ninterest groups that seem to be dictating the moves of the minority \nparty in the Senate needed a test case to see if they could stop \nPresident Bush's nominees at will. They researched all his nominees and \npicked one who would be impossible to defeat on the merits and decided \nto distort his record and assassinate his character. They needed to see \nif they could get away with it. So last year they gave it a shot. And \nit worked. These special interests found willing accomplices in the \nSenate and in the media. Facts became irrelevant as lies flew and \nCharles Pickering was demagogued. But that was only a preview of what \nwas to come.\n  While the filibustering by a minority of the Senate of Judge \nPickering is an abdication of constitutional responsibility of the \nSenate, the wholesale assault on President Bush's nominees is truly \negregious. Judge Pickering is not alone. The minority has taken aim at \nMiguel Estrada, Carolyn Kuhl, Janice\n\n[[Page S13555]]\n\nRogers Brown, Bill Pryor, Priscilla Owen, and Henry Saad. Each nominee \nhas a fantastic story and a stellar record. Each has been singled out \nfor his or her adherence to the law and the traditional roles of \ngovernment.\n  Radical liberals have long fancied themselves as the champions of \nwomen and minorities in this country, and I have no doubt that many on \nthe left do strive for equality for all Americans. But the radical left \nhas achieved its power through the politics of division. A conservative \nHispanic or conservative woman or conservative Arab or conservative \nblack woman or conservative religious man is anathema to their \ndominance of these issues. Rather than celebrating the achievements of \nthese gifted human beings ascending to the job for which he or she was \nselected by the President of the United States, these ultra liberals \nwould rather defame their characters and demagogue their beliefs.\n  There seems to be no end in sight to these tactics and political \nshowdowns. But I hope and pray that day will soon come.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today we will vote on whether the \nSenate shall be allowed simply to consider the nomination of Charles \nPickering to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. From my review of \nJudge Pickering's record, I have been struck by one resounding virtue--\nmoral courage.\n  As the tide of racial equality swept America in the 1950s and 1960s, \nit unfortunately met with fierce resistance in certain areas. Laurel, \nMS was one. Unlike New England, integration was not popular in Jones \nCounty. Unlike New York, the press was not friendly to integration in \nJones County. Unlike large Southern cities such as Atlanta and \nBirmingham, there was no substantial segment of the community that had \nan enlightened view on race relations. Indeed, the town of Laurel, in \nJones County, MS, with a small population was the home territory of the \nImperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, Sam Bowers.\n  In the 1960s, Klan-incited violence escalated in Jones County, MS. \nThe Klan would drive by homes in the middle of the night and shoot into \nthem. The Klan would firebomb the homes of African Americans and those \nwho helped them. The Klan would murder its enemies who stood for civil \nrights.\n  Because these shootings, bombings, and murders violated the law, the \nvictims looked for justice. They found it in Jones County Attorney \nCharles Pickering.\n  On the one hand, Charles Pickering had his duty to enforce the law. \nOn the other hand, he had public opinion, the press, and most state law \nenforcement personnel against vigorously prosecuting Klan violence. A \n27-year-old Charles Pickering stared in the face his political future, \nmany in his community, and the press and chose to do his duty of \nenforcing the law against the men who committed such violence. In the \n1960s in Mississippi, this took courage.\n  Soon County Attorney Charles Pickering found that he had to choose \nagainst between those in law enforcement who would only go through the \nmotions of investigating the Klan and those who sought to vigorously \nprosecute and imprison Klansmen. He chose to work with the FBI to \ninvestigate, prosecute, and imprison Klansmen. In the mid-1960s in \nMississippi, this took courage.\n  Then came the threats. The Klan threatened to have County Attorney \nPickering whipped. With the Klan already firebombing and murdering \nother whites whom it viewed as helping black citizens, the Pickering \nfamily could have easily been next.\n\n  At night, County Attorney Charles Pickering would come back to his \nsmall home and look into the eyes of his young wife Margaret. He would \nlook into the eyes of his four small children who believed daddy could \ndo anything and who did not understand hate and murder. One can only \nimagine how his wife Margaret would lie awake in fear, hoping that she \nwould hear her husband's footsteps coming home.\n  Charles Pickering had no money to protect his family. He had no press \nto stand up for him and his family. He had no covering of popular \nopinion to hide behind. And in this time of hate, bombings and murder, \nCharles Pickering reached down deep in his soul, embraced the only \nthing he did have, his religious faith.\n  He then testified against Sam Bowers, the Imperial Wizard of the Ku \nKlux Klan in the firebombing trial of civil rights activist Vernon \nDahmer in 1967. And Charles Pickering signed the affidavit supporting \nthe murder indictment of Klansman Dubie Lee for a murder committed at \nthe Masonite Corporation's pulpwood plant in Jones County. The took \ncourage.\n  While it is easy in Washington, DC, in 2003, to make a speech or sign \na bill in favor of civil rights after decades have changed racial \nattitudes in schools, in society, and in the press, who among us would \nhave had the courage of Charles Pickering in Laurel, MS in 1967? Who \namong us would have had the courage of his wife Margaret to stand with \nhim?\n  There are those who would say ``We are pleased that Pickering was one \nof the few prosecutors who actually prosecuted crimes committed by the \nKKK in the 1960s, but he should have also gone further by calling for \nimmediate integration of schools and the workplace.''\n  That argument is tantamount to saying, ``We are pleased that Harry \nTruman integrated the federal armed forces in 1948, but he should have \ngone further and called for the integration of the state national \nguards as well.'' Or to say, ``We are pleased that Lyndon Johnson \nsigned the Civil Rights Act in 1964, after opposing civil rights, but \nhe should have gone further and demanded that all businesses adopt an \naffirmative action hiring plan.''\n  To judge the words and actions of these Civil Rights Champions in the \n1940s, 50s, and 60s, by a 2003 standard, would leave them wanting. We \nmust remember that in Mississippi and other Southern States in the \n1960s, most elected prosecutors sat on their hands when the \nKlan committed acts of violence. Young Charles Pickering had to deal \nwith white citizens and politicans who resisted integration and civil \nrights. He had to deal with these people in language that would not \nincite further violence and with requests for action that he had a \nchance of getting people to take. He did so with moral courage.\n\n  And because he acted with courage at such a young age, Charles \nPickering was able to continue with more progressive actions decade \nafter decade. In 1976, he hired the first African American field \nrepresentative for the Mississippi Republican Party. In 1981, he \ndefended a young black man who had been falsely accused of the armed \nrobbery of a teenage white girl. In 1999, he joined the University of \nMississippi's Racial Reconciliation Commission. And in 2000 he helped \nestablish a program for at-risk kids, most of whom were African \nAmericans, in Laurel, MS--where 35 years earlier he had backed his \nprinciples with his and his family's lives. This is a record of \ncourage. It is a record to be commended.\n  In the years since the 1960s, attitudes in Mississippi and elsewhere \nhave dramatically improved. Schools are integrated. The Klan is no \nlonger a powerful force capable of intimidating whole communities. And \nthe support from Mississippians--black and white, men and women--who \nhave known Charles Pickering for decades has been overwhelming. This \nsupport no doubt results from the moral courage of Charles Pickering.\n  In 1990, the Judiciary Committee unanimously reported the nomination \nof Charles Pickering, and the Senate unanimously confirmed him to the \ndistrict court bench. In his 12 years on the bench, he had handled \n4,500 cases. In approximately 99.5 percent of these cases, his rulings \nhave stood. The American Bar Association rated Judge Pickering ``well \nqualified'' for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals--once upon a time, \nthe vaunted ``gold standard'' of my Democrat colleagues.\n  I was present at Judge Pickering's confirmation hearing. I listened \nto the testimony and reviewed the record. I have measured the \nallegations and those who made them, against the entire record and the \ncourage of Judge Pickering. I have found the allegations to be \nunfounded and the special interest group accusers lacking in the moral \ncourage that Judge Pickering possesses.\n  The Senate now has a chance to show the courage that Charles \nPickering has consistently demonstrated. Unfortunately, I fear it will \nshrink from this\n\n[[Page S13556]]\n\nmoment. And for that I apologize, in advance, to Judge Pickering and \nhis family. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was going to speak first, but I \nunderstand the senior Senator from New York, as happens with so many of \nus, is supposed to be in two places at once. While he is capable of \nmany good things, that is one thing he has not figured out how to do \nyet.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York. Once he has finished, \nI will then speak and answer some of the things that have been said on \nthe other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. President, this is a difficult decision in a very certain sense. \nI listened to the sincere words of my colleague from Tennessee. I think \nthey were heartfelt and well spoken. I have tremendous respect for my \ntwo colleagues from Mississippi, and I know particularly to my friend \nSenator Lott how much this means. He has worked very hard and \ndiligently on behalf of Judge Pickering's nomination.\n  I must rise to oppose it, and let me explain both to my colleagues \nand to everybody, I guess, why. I am a patriot. I love America. My \nfamily came to this country 5, 3, and 2 generations ago, poor as church \nmice, discriminated against in Europe. My dad could not graduate from \ncollege, and I am a United States Senator. God bless America. What a \ngreat country.\n  I study the history of America. One of the things I try to study is \nwhat are our faults, what are our strengths, how do we make sure what \nhappened to the Roman Empire and the British Empire does not happen to \nthis country. One of the most profound scholars who studied America was \nAlexis de Tocqueville. He came to America in 1832 or so, traveled \nacross the country, including upstate New York, and he wrote a couple \nof things. First, he wrote then when we were a small nation, not mighty \nlike the great European nations of Britain, France, or Russia. He wrote \nthat we would become the greatest country in the world. That was pretty \nomniscient. But he also wrote that there was one thing that could do \nAmerica in, and that was the poison of race.\n  We have made great progress. We all know it and everybody knows it. \nMuch of the progress was made--all of it just about--in the last 40 \nyears. We did not make much progress from 1865 to, say, 1960 or 1955.\n  I guess Brown v. Board started the whole wellspring. Frankly, for the \nfirst time in my life I am optimistic about racial relations in \nAmerica. I think, over time, things will heal. I didn't used to think \nthat, even 5 years ago.\n  But we still have a lot of healing to do, despite the progress. I \nhave to say I don't think the nomination of Judge Pickering--I know he \nis people's friend; I know lots of fine people think he is a fine man--\nhelps that healing. I think it hurts it. I base my decision not only on \nhis record, which--I would have to disagree, in all due respect, with \nmy friend from Tennessee--on race issues is, at best, mixed. The cross-\nburning case bothers me greatly because if you are sensitive to race, \neven if you think a case was wrongly decided, you don't go through the \nextra legal means, on a cross-burning case, to do what you have to do.\n  Does that mean a person should be put in jail or excoriated? No. Does \nit mean if he runs for public office that he is going to lose? No.\n  But on the Fifth Circuit, the circuit that has had the great names at \nhealing race and racial divisions that my colleague from Tennessee \nmentioned, should not we be extra careful about trying to bring a \nunifying figure to that bench, particularly when it represents more \nminorities than any other?\n  The bottom line is, while we can find individual names, to me it is \noverwhelmingly clear that the Black community in Mississippi--which \nought to have pretty good judgment about who did what, when, and how \nfar we have come--is quite overwhelmingly against Judge Pickering.\n  You can say it is politics. But when we hear the head of the NAACP \nsay, as he told us yesterday, that every single chapter--I don't \nremember how many there were, like 140--were against Judge Pickering, \nthat means something. When you hear that all but a handful of the Black \nelected officials in Mississippi are against Judge Pickering, that \nmeans something.\n  Frankly, in this body we don't have an African American to give voice \nto their view, the African American view, diverse as it is, about \nwhether Judge Pickering is a healing figure and deserves to be on this \nexalted circuit. We are not demoting him. We are not excoriating him. \nWe are debating whether he should be promoted to this important bench, \nparticularly when it comes to race and civil rights. And the \noverwhelming voice is no.\n  I ask unanimous consent from my colleague to be given an additional 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield another 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So the overwhelming voice is no. The elected Black \nofficials of Mississippi--I don't know the percentage, but I think it \nis against him. The only Black Member of Congress speaks strongly \nagainst him. He doesn't just say, well, I wouldn't vote for him, but it \nis an either/or situation, and that has to influence us. It is not \ndispositive. People can say ``these groups.'' Well, the NAACP is not \njust a group. It has been the leading organization. It is a mainstream \nAfrican-American organization.\n  There are groups on the other side lobbying for Judge Pickering. \nThere are groups on this side against. I don't know why my colleagues, \nsome on the other side, say the groups that lobby against what they \nwant are evil, and the groups that lobby for are doing American \njustice. That is what groups do, and we listen to them sometimes.\n\n  I, from New York, don't know that much about this. I try to study \nhistory, but I haven't lived there. I haven't gone through the history \nthat my colleagues from Mississippi or Tennessee have. But I have to \nrely on other voices as well.\n  So the fork in the road we come to here is this: On this nomination \nin this important circuit which has, indeed, done so much to move us \nforward--and I do believe we will continue to move forward as a \ncountry; even as Alexis de Toqueville said, on the poison of race--do \nwe appoint a man who, on racial issues, has a record that at best is \nmixed, and who recently, at a very minimum, has shown insensitivity on \nthe cross-burning case? Sure, there was a disparity of sentence. One \nthing I know quite well, in criminal law there are always disparities \nof sentence when there is a plea bargain, and prosecutors always go to \nsomeone in the case and say: If you plea bargain, you will get fewer \nyears than if you don't. So that is not a great injustice. It happens \nevery day in every court in this land. On this particular case, that is \nwhere Judge Pickering's heart was, to take it to a higher level. It is \nbothersome, particularly when it comes to nominating someone, not just \nto be a district court judge--which he is now--but nominated to the \nexalted Fifth Circuit, the racial healer in America for so long.\n  So in my view--no aspersions to my colleagues from Mississippi who \nfeel so strongly about this; no aspersions to my colleague from \nTennessee who was eloquent, in my opinion; and no aspersions to Judge \nPickering as well--but we can do better, particularly on the Fifth \nCircuit, when it comes to the issue of race, which has plagued the \nregions of the Fifth Circuit and plagued my region as well. We can do \nbetter.\n  I urge this nomination be defeated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13556-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13556-S13572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the \nnomination of Charles Pickering to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit.\n  I oppose this nomination because Judge Pickering has repeatedly \ndemonstrated a disregard for the principles that protect the rights of \nso many of our citizens. Judge Pickering's record as a judge is full of \ninstances in which he has elevated his personal views above the law. \nFor example, Judge Pickering has shown a lack of respect for the \nSupreme Court's landmark\n\n[[Page S13557]]\n\nlegal precedents, especially those that protect rights. He has harshly \ncriticized the Supreme Court's ``one person, one vote'' rulings and has \nbeen reversed numerous times by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for \nhis failure to follow ``well-settled principles of law.''\n  In one case, Judge Pickering took extraordinary steps to reduce the \nsentence required by law for a man convicted of cross burning. In \naddition, he exerted extraordinary efforts to reduce the 5-year \nsentence mandated by Federal sentencing guidelines in the cross-burning \ncase and went so far as to make an ex parte phone call to Justice \nDepartment officials in an attempt to assist the defendant.\n  And, since his hearing, Judge Pickering has actively solicited the \nsupport of this nomination from attorneys who appear in his courtroom. \nThis behavior not only calls into question Judge Pickering's commitment \nto protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans, but legal \nexperts agree that his actions violated the canons of judicial ethics.\n  Unfortunately, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nin their drive to push through every Bush judge at all costs, have \nturned this process into a personal attack on the integrity and \nmotivations of those of us who oppose this nomination. We have been \naccused of anti-Southern bias. Of course, anyone listening to me talk \nwould have to figure that I am the last person to hold an anti-Southern \nbias.\n  We have even been accused of calling Judge Pickering a racist, \nsomething we have not done. I do not presume to know what is in Judge \nPickering's heart. But I do know what is in his record. That record \nproves him unfit to serve as a Court of Appeals judge.\n  We have tried our best to facilitate consensus and cooperation in \njudicial nominations. Unfortunately, most of our efforts are being \nrejected, which doesn't make a bit of sense, since we accomplish so \nmuch when we all work together.\n  We have seen what happens when the President meets us halfway. He has \ndone it before--rarely, but he has done it. He reached out to us on \nAllyson Duncan, an outstanding North Carolinian who just yesterday was \nformally installed as a judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nbreaking a logjam that had held our State back for a decade.\n  In that case, President Bush did more than just pay lip service to \nour constitutional obligation to advise and consent. He reached out to \nus before he made his decision. He consulted with us. He sought our \nadvice. And in making his decision, the President selected a nominee \nwho represents the mainstream of our State.\n  Throughout Judge Duncan's confirmation process, I commended the \nPresident for consulting with us and making an excellent nomination. \nAnd I told him that if he takes this approach to future judicial \nnominations we have a real opportunity to find common ground in the \nsearch for excellence on the federal bench. When we work together, we \nfind outstanding nominees like Allyson Duncan, who represents the best \nof North Carolina and America.\n  But rather than accept my call for consensus, the President just said \nno.\n  There is a saying that if you see a dog and a cat eating from the \nsame dish, it might look like a compromise, but you can bet they are \neating the cat's food. That is how things seem to be working in \nWashington these days. My colleagues and I have tried and tried to find \ncommon ground. We have said yes to Bush judges, time after time after \ntime. We have said yes to more than 160 Bush judges. But but my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have instead dug in their \nheels and demanded that unless we agree to every judicial nominee the \nPresident sends up here, no matter how unacceptable they are, we are \nbeing obstructionist.\n  We can do better than this. And we should do better. It is time for \nthis President to stop saying no to judges who respect our civil \nrights. Let's say yes to judges who will fairly apply the law. Let's \nsay yes to judges who will not allow their extreme personal views to \ncolor their decision-making. Let's say yes to judges who will protect \nour civil rights. I am proud to stand with my colleagues today as we \nsay a resounding yes to fairness, equality and justice.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, Federal judges serve lifetime terms, and \nare responsible for interpreting our Constitution, and our laws, in \nways that have real implications for the rights of regular Americans. \nLast year I joined my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee in voting \nnot to report the nomination elevating Federal District Court Judge \nCharles Pickering to the Circuit Court of Appeals to the Senate floor. \nI stand by that vote. I continue to have very real concerns about Judge \nPickering's ability to be a fair and neutral Court of Appeals judge.\n  In evaluating judicial nominations, among the factors I consider are \nwhether the nominee demonstrates the highest level of professional \nethics and integrity, and has the ability to distinguish between \npersonal beliefs and interpreting the law. Unfortunately, I believe \nJudge Pickering falls short in meeting these criteria. Judge Pickering \nis an honorable person, but he is simply the wrong person to fill this \nvery important position.\n  Like my colleagues, I am troubled by Judge Pickering's handling of \nthe case of United States v. Swan, where a white defendant was tried \nfor burning a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple. Judge \nPickering had multiple ex parte conversations with prosecutors and \nJustice Department officials in an effort to reduce the sentence of Mr. \nSwan. In doing so, Judge Pickering seems to have lost sight of the \nethical limitations on his actions, and the extent to which he was \nfailing to maintain judicial independence. As Brenda Polkey, the victim \nof the cross burning, said, her ``faith in the justice system was \ndestroyed'' by Pickering's efforts to reduce Mr. Swan's sentence. In \nevery aspect of government we need to work hard and keep faith with the \npublic.\n  This case indicates how deeply held Judge Pickering's views are, and \nhow far he will go to arrive at an outcome he believes to be correct. \nThe difficulty that he has in keeping his personal views out of his \njudicial decisionmaking are obvious, not only in this case, but in \nseveral opinions in which he goes beyond the facts of the case to state \nhis belief of what the law ought to be. Judge Pickering's efforts to \nsolicit letters of support from lawyers appearing before him in direct \nviolation of the canons of judicial ethics is another example of his \nlack of understanding and adherence to the ethical guidelines that are \ncritical to maintaining the independence and integrity of the Federal \njudiciary.\n  Because of this troubling record of not following precedent, and of \noverstepping ethical bounds to achieve a particular outcome, I asked \nJudge Pickering questions at his hearing that focused on the right to \nprivacy. I asked Judge Pickering about privacy as it pertains to \nconsumers' rights, specifically medical and financial records, as it \npertains to an individual's right to privacy in the context of \ngovernment surveillance, and with regard to a woman's right to make \npersonal decisions about her body. In response, he declined to state \nwhether he believed that any right to privacy was conferred by our \nConstitution.\n  While my concern about how Judge Pickering would rule on cases of \nfundamental privacy rights is not the only factor in my decision to \noppose his elevation to the Circuit Court, it is one I believe is \nimportant.\n  The Fifth Circuit covers three States--Louisiana, Texas and \nMississippi--that have passed more anti-choice legislation restricting \na woman's right to make personal choices about her own body than any \nother States. In fact, all three States continue to have \nunconstitutional and unenforceable laws on their books prohibiting a \nwoman from having an abortion, because the legislature in each of these \nStates will not repeal the laws. This is the context against which we \nmust consider the President's nomination of Judge Pickering.\n  While Judge Pickering has repeatedly pledged to restrain his personal \nideological views and follow the precedent of the Supreme Court, given \nthe unique role that the Fifth Circuit plays in protecting not only the \nconstitutional right to privacy enunciated in Roe and affirmed in \nCasey, but also in protecting women's access to abortion providers in \nthe States with the Fifth\n\n[[Page S13558]]\n\nCircuit, I am concerned about Judge Pickering's willingness to say \nwhere in the Constitution privacy is protected and his willingness to \nfollow the law.\n  Judge Pickering's actions on the bench reveal a lack of understanding \nof the requirements of judicial ethics and a failure to meet the very \nhighest standards of the legal profession. Judge Pickering has \nexhibited a lack of ability to distinguish his personal believes from \njudging the issues before the court, and I therefore cannot support his \nelevation to the Fifth Circuit.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote no on cloture on the \nnomination of Charles Pickering to be a judge on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  We had a fair process in the last Congress on this nominee--two \nhearings, a lengthy period of deliberation and debate, and a fair vote. \nThe nomination was defeated. The Judiciary Committee's consideration of \nthis nomination was thorough and fair. Obviously, some did not like the \nresult, but I do not think they can in good faith find fault with the \nprocess.\n  It is my view that a process that gives a nominee a hearing, and then \na vote in the Judiciary Committee is not an unfair process, or an \n``institutional breakdown,'' as some critics of our work in the \ncommittee last year called it. It is the way the Judiciary Committee is \nsupposed to work. During the 6 years prior to last Congress, the \nJudiciary Committee did not work this way. Literally dozens of nominees \nnever got a hearing, as Charles Pickering did, and never got a vote, as \nCharles Pickering did. Those nominees were mistreated by the committee; \nCharles Pickering was not. What happened in the Judiciary Committee \nlast year provides no justification whatsoever for the President's \nunprecedented action of renominating someone who has been considered by \nthe committee and rejected.\n  Judges on our Federal courts of appeals have an enormous influence on \nthe law. Whereas decisions of the district courts are always subject to \nappellate review, the decisions of the courts of appeals are subject \nonly to discretionary review by the Supreme Court. Because the Supreme \nCourt agrees to hear only a very small percentage of the cases on which \nits views are sought, the decisions of the courts of appeals are in \nalmost all cases final. That means that the scrutiny that we in the \nSenate and on the committee give to circuit court nominees must be \ngreater than that we give to district court nominees.\n  I would think that this would be self-evident, and certainly the \ndebates over circuit court nominees over the years have been much more \nheated than those relating to district court nominees. But I begin with \nthis point because there are some who have argued that because the \nSenate confirmed Judge Pickering to the district court by a unanimous \nvote in 1990, he must be elevated to the circuit court.\n  Judge Pickering now has a substantial record as a district court \njudge that he did not have in 1990, and Senators are entitled--indeed \nit is our duty--to review and evaluate that record. Even leaving that \naside, a court of appeals judgeship is different from a district court \njudgeship.\n  There is another factor that I think requires us as a committee to \ngive this nomination very careful consideration. During the last 6 \nyears of the Clinton administration, this committee did not report out \na single judge to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. That is right. \nNot a single one.\n  And as we all know, that was not for lack of nominees to consider. \nPresident Clinton nominated three well-qualified lawyers to the Court \nof Appeals--Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Alston Johnson. None of \nthese nominees even received a hearing before this committee. When the \nchairman held a hearing in July 2001 on the nomination of Judge Clement \nfor a seat on this circuit court, only a few months after she was \nnominated, it was the first hearing for a Fifth Circuit nominee since \nSeptember 1994. We have since confirmed another Fifth Circuit nominee, \nEdward Prado.\n  So there is a history here and a special burden on the administration \nto consult with our side on nominees for this Circuit. Otherwise, we \nwould simply be rewarding the obstructionism that the President's party \nengaged in over the last 6 years by allowing him to fill with his \nchoices seats that his party held open for years, even when qualified \nnominees were advanced by President Clinton. And I say once again, my \ncolleagues on the Republican side bear some responsibility for this \nsituation, and they can help resolve it by urging the administration to \naddress the injustices suffered by so many Clinton nominees.\n  With that background, let me outline the concerns that have caused me \nto reach the conclusion that Judge Pickering should not be confirmed. \nExcept for the DC Circuit, the Fifth Circuit has the largest percentage \nof residents who are minorities of any circuit--over 40 percent. It is \na court that during the civil rights era issued some of the most \nsignificant decisions supporting the rights of African American \ncitizens to participate as full members of our society. It is a circuit \nwhere cases addressing the continuing problems of racism and \ndiscrimination in our country will continue to arise.\n  Judge Pickering's record as a Federal district court judge leads me \nto conclude that he does not have the dedication to upholding the civil \nrights laws that I believe a judge on this circuit must have. Judge \nPickering has a disturbing habit of injecting his own personal opinions \nabout civil rights laws into his opinions and of criticizing plaintiffs \nwho seek through legal action to correct what they perceive to be \ndiscriminatory conduct. In two separate opinions in unrelated \nemployment discrimination cases, Judge Pickering not only found against \nthe plaintiffs but saw fit to disparage their claims in identical \nlanguage. This is what he said:\n\n     The fact that a black employee is terminated does not \n     automatically indicate discrimination. The Civil Rights Act \n     was not passed to guarantee job security to employees who do \n     not do their job adequately. . . . The Courts are not super \n     personnel managers charged with second guessing every \n     employment decision made regarding minorities. The Court \n     should protect against discrimination but it can do no more. \n     This case has all the hallmarks of a case that is filed \n     simply because an adverse employment decision was made in \n     regard to a protected minority.\n\n  The use of this kind of language as a boilerplate does not indicate \nto me a judge who has an open mind about employment discrimination \nlawsuits. I think that people who have legitimate claims under the \ncivil rights laws of this country have reason to be concerned about \nwhether a judge who would go out of his way to say these kinds of \nthings in legal opinions will hear their cases fairly.\n  Indeed, during his confirmation hearing, Judge Pickering seemed to \nconfirm that he has a predisposition to believe that employment \ndiscrimination claims that come before him are not meritorious. He \ntestified that as he understands the law, the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission ``engages in mediation and it is my impression \nthat most of the good cases are handled through mediation and are \nresolved.'' He went on to say, ``The cases that come to court are \ngenerally the ones that the EEOC has found are not good cases, so then \nthey are filed in court.'' That is emphatically not the law, and it was \nextremely disturbing that a sitting federal judge who has ruled in \nnumerous employment discrimination cases would so profoundly \nmisunderstand the role of the EEOC in these cases.\n  Judge Pickering has also expressed troubling views in voting rights \ncases, including criticizing the concept of ``one person, one vote.'' \nThat concept is one of the bedrock constitutional foundations of our \npolitical system. Judge Pickering opined in one case: ``It is wondered \nif we are not giving the people more government than they want, more \nthan is required in defining one man, one vote, too precisely.'' I do \nnot believe that we can give the people too much democracy, and I am \nnot inclined to elevate to a higher court a judge who seems not to take \nthis constitutional principle seriously.\n  Another area of the law where Judge Pickering has demonstrated what \nseems like a hostility to certain kinds of claims is that of prisoner \nlitigation. We all know that there is a significant problem of \nfrivolous lawsuits being filed by prisoners. Congress addressed this \nproblem in 1996 with the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act, where it \nprovided certain sanctions for prisoners who file repeated frivolous \nclaims. Judge Pickering, however, has taken\n\n[[Page S13559]]\n\nthe law into his own hands on numerous occasions by threatening to \norder prison officials to restrict prisoners' privileges if they filed \nanother frivolous lawsuit. And he did this even after Congress \nspecified certain sanctions for repeated frivolous lawsuits in the 1996 \nAct.\n  I believe that this kind of threat is inappropriate behavior for a \nFederal judge. Judge Pickering's opinions could not help but chill even \nlegitimate complaints from prisoners. While it is true that much \nfrivolous litigation is filed by prisoners, it is also true that some \ncelebrated cases upholding and explaining the constitutional rights of \nthe accused have had their genesis in a prisoner complaint where the \nprisoner did not have a lawyer. Gideon v. Wainwright, which established \nthe right to an attorney, was such a case. Just the day before Judge \nPickering's second hearing, the Washington Post ran a story about a \nprisoner who received a favorable Supreme Court decision in a case that \nbegan with such a complaint. And the petition for certiorari was filed \nby the prisoner without a lawyer, as well. I believe that judges at all \nlevels must have an open mind toward all types of cases. Engaging in \ntactics that will frighten people into not asserting their rights is a \nhighly questionable thing to do.\n  Judge Pickering did respond to my written questions about his \ndecisions in prisoner litigation. I was gratified to learn that he \nnever actually imposed the sanctions he threatened, and I appreciate \nhis and the Justice Department's efforts to find legal authority for \nhis orders. I find those efforts unconvincing, particularly with \nrespect to the orders that he entered after Congress passed the \nPrisoner Litigation Reform Act. Judge Pickering states in answer to my \nquestions that ``[m]y objective was to stop prisoners who were filing \nfrivolous litigation from doing so,'' and that ``I do not believe that \nlegitimate complaints by prisoners were chilled by this approach.'' I \nsimply do not know how Judge Pickering could be so certain now, or when \nhe was making these orders, that threatening to order prison officials \nto take away unspecified privileges if a prisoner filed another \nfrivolous complaint was a tactic that would discourage only frivolous \nsuits by prisoners, but not legitimate ones.\n  I also have concerns about two different ethical issues that arose \nduring the consideration of his confirmation. I questioned him about \none such issue at his second hearing before Judiciary Committee last \nyear. After his first hearing, Judge Pickering asked a number of \nlawyers who practice before him to submit letters of recommendation. He \nasked them to send those letters to his chambers so that he could fax \nthem to Washington. And he testified that he read the letters before \nforwarding them to the Justice Department, which sent them on to the \ncommittee. Now when I asked Judge Pickering about this, he seemed \nconfused by the questions, as if he thought I was objecting to the fact \nthat the letters had been faxed rather than mailed. Let me be clear, I \nhave no problem with faxes. I get them all the time. What I do have a \nproblem with is a sitting Federal judge asking lawyers who practice \nbefore him to send letters supporting his nomination to a higher court \nand having those letters sent to him rather than directly to the \nJustice Department or the Senate. That seems to raise an obvious \nethical issue, and I was surprised that Judge Pickering didn't \nrecognize it, even when I questioned him about what he did.\n\n  I asked Professor Stephen Gillers of NYU Law School, one of the \nleading experts on legal and judicial ethics in the country, for his \nviews on this issue. Professor Gillers responded in a letter to me. He \nconfirmed my concern about Judge Pickering's actions. Let me read a \nportion of that letter. Professor Gillers wrote:\n\n       It was improper for Judge Pickering to solicit letters in \n     support of his nomination from lawyers who regularly appear \n     before him. It is important to my answer that the Judge asked \n     the lawyers to fax him the letters so that he could send them \n     to the Justice Department for transmittal to the Senate. He \n     did not ask the lawyers to send any letters directly to \n     Washington. Consequently, the Judge would know who submitted \n     letters and what the letters said, as would be obvious to the \n     lawyers.\n\n  Last year, Senator Hatch obtained a letter on this issue from a \nprofessor Richard Painter. Professor Painter answers only the question \nof whether soliciting letters of support violates existing rules of \njudicial conduct and never mentions the additional fact that Judge \nPickering asked for the letters to be sent to him rather than to the \nSenate. That makes Professor Painter's views much less relevant to the \nquestions I asked.\n  Furthermore, Professor Painter's analysis seems to be limited to an \neffort to show that the authorities relied upon by Professor Gillers \nare not exactly on point and that the standards governing the \nsolicitation of letters of support for nominations are vague. He argues \nthat the rules should be clarified and made more specific. And perhaps \nhe is right about that. But it seems to me to be an insufficiently low \nstandard to set that judges need only make sure they don't clearly \nviolate the ethical rules. We should not want judges who simply avoid \nclear violations of rules of ethical conduct. We should not want judges \nwho either don't spot ethical issues or treat them as obstacles to be \nparsed and tiptoed around. We should want judges who are beyond \nreproach, who know that ethical conduct is at the core of their \nresponsibilities, because such conduct helps ensure that the public \nwill respect their decisions. I believe that Judge Pickering's conduct \nfell far short in this instance.\n  Before this year's committee vote on Judge Pickering, some additional \ninformation came to light on this matter that suggests that Judge \nPickering's conduct presents even more serious ethical questions. In \nhis response to my inquiry about Judge Pickering's solicitation of \nletters of support, Prof. Gillers also noted the following:\n\n       The impropriety becomes particularly acute if lawyers or \n     litigants with matters currently pending before the Judge \n     were solicited. Then the desire to please the Judge would be \n     immediately obvious and the coercive nature of the request \n     even more apparent. In addition, soliciting favorable letters \n     from lawyers or litigants in current matters could lead to \n     recusal on the ground that the Judge's ``impartiality might \n     reasonably be questioned.'' 28 U.S.C. Sec.  455(a).\n\n  We identified 18 separate letters, all written in late October 2001, \nthat came to the committee from Judge Pickering's chambers. We now know \nthat at least seven of the lawyers who wrote letters on behalf of Judge \nPickering at his request actually had cases pending before him at the \ntime. A number of those lawyers had more than once case pending. One \nlawyer received Judge Pickering's request for a letter when a \npreviously scheduled settlement conference was a little over a month \naway. Another lawyer whom Judge Pickering solicited represented the \nplaintiffs in a class action against a major drug company. The \ndefendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction \nin May 2001, and the motion was still pending before Judge Pickering \nwhen he requested the letter.\n  Now I have to ask my colleagues: Suppose you were a lawyer in a case \nand your opponents filed a motion trying to get your case dismissed. \nThe judge has not yet ruled on the motion and you get a call from him \nasking you to write a letter of recommendation because he has been \nnominated to serve on a higher court. What would you do? Wouldn't you \nbe troubled? Wouldn't you feel at least a bit of pressure to comply? \nAnd would you write a fully candid letter, especially if the judge \nasked you to send the letter to him directly so he could see it before \nforwarding it to the Judiciary Committee?\n  I will submit for the Record a chart indicating the lawyers with \ncases pending before Judge Pickering who wrote letters for him upon his \nrequest. I consider this a very serious ethical breach, and Prof. \nGillers agrees. This violation of judicial ethics casts serious doubt \non Judge Pickering's fitness to serve on the Court of Appeals.\n  It is within this framework that I evaluate the other ethical issue \nthat has arisen, Judge Pickering's conduct in the Swan cross-burning \ncase. This case and Judge Pickering's handling of it have been the \nsubject of a great deal of controversy and public discussion, and I \nwill not repeat the details. I will only say that I am very troubled by \nthe Swan case, for a number of reasons. Judge Pickering, it seems to \nme, improperly stepped out of his judicial role, to try to get a result \nthat he favored in the case. He had an ex parte\n\n[[Page S13560]]\n\ncontact with the Justice Department about the case. He threatened to \nrule on a legal issue in a way that he apparently did not believe was \ncorrect if the Justice Department did not change its sentencing \nposition. He twice told the Justice Department that he might order a \nnew trial even though it was clearly outside of his authority to do so. \nAnd he took unusual and apparently unjustified steps to keep his order \nsecret, which prevented public scrutiny of his actions.\n  Judicial nominations should not be like legislation that can be \nreintroduced and reconsidered by a succeeding Congress. The Senate, \nacting through this committee, and exercising its constitutional \nresponsibility, refused to give its consent to this nomination last \nyear. I believe it was wrong for the President to re-nominate Judge \nPickering.\n  I do not believe Judge Pickering is a racist, nor do I believe that \nhe is a bad person. I did not come to this decision to vote against his \nconfirmation lightly or because of pressure from interest groups or \nother Senators. I sincerely believe that Judge Pickering is not the \nright choice for this position. I wish him well in his continued work \non the district court.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nletter to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              New York University,\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                  New York, NY, February 20, 2002.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I am replying to your inquiry of \n     February 12, 2002. I assume familiarity with Judge \n     Pickering's testimony and will address the two questions you \n     ask. I address only these questions. I take no position on \n     whether Judge Pickering should be confirmed for the Fifth \n     Circuit or the weight, if any, that should be given to my \n     analysis. Obviously, many facts are relevant to a \n     confirmation vote.\n       It was improper for Judge Pickering to solicit letters in \n     support of his nomination from lawyers who regularly appear \n     before him. It is important to my answer that the Judge asked \n     the lawyers to fax him the letters so that he could send them \n     to the Justice Department for transmittal to the Senate. He \n     did not ask the lawyers to send any letters directly to \n     Washington. Consequently, the Judge would know who submitted \n     letters and what the letters said, as would be obvious to the \n     lawyers.\n       I will assume initially that none of the lawyers whose \n     letters the judge solicited had current cases pending before \n     the judge. If a solicited lawyer (or litigant) did have a \n     pending matter, the situation is more serious, as discussed \n     further below.\n       Judge Pickering's solicitation creates the appearance of \n     impropriety in violation of Canon 2 of the Code of Conduct \n     for U.S. Judges. This document, based on the A.B.A. Code of \n     Judicial Conduct, contains the ethical rules that apply to \n     all federal judicial officers below the Supreme Court.\n       Judge Pickering's conduct creates the appearance of \n     impropriety, in part, because of the power federal judges, \n     and particularly federal trial judges, have over matters that \n     come before them. Federal judges enjoy a wide degree of \n     discretion, which means that many of their decisions will be \n     upheld absent an abuse of discretion. This is a highly \n     deferential standard. It means that for many decisions, the \n     district judge is the court of last resort and lawyers know \n     that.\n       Given this power over their cases, and therefore over the \n     lawyers whose cases come before them, ethics rules for judges \n     forbid them to make certain requests of lawyers and others \n     that ``might reasonably be perceived as coercive.'' Canons \n     4(C); 5(B)(2). These particular Canons deal with soliciting \n     charitable contributions. They absolutely forbid the judge \n     ``personally'' to participate in charitable or other non-\n     profit fundraising activities. They also forbid participation \n     in ``membership solicitation'' that ``might reasonably be \n     perceived as coercive.'' A narrow exception is made for \n     fundraising from other judges ``over whom the judge does not \n     exercise supervisory or appellate authority.'' Canon 4(C).\n       In these situations, of course, the judge would be \n     soliciting a benefit for an organization, and not, as here, \n     for the judge himself. That difference makes the present case \n     more troubling because a judge would ordinarily have a \n     greater, and certainly a personal, interest in a significant \n     promotion than he or she would have in a contribution to an \n     organization with which the judge is affiliated.\n       Judge Pickering's solicitations was ``coercive'' because a \n     lawyer who regularly practices before him was not free to \n     fail to provide a letter endorsing Judge Pickering's \n     promotion. Given the risk to lawyers' (and their firms') \n     clients--a risk they would readily perceive--lawyers would \n     feel coerced to comply with the Judge's solicitation of \n     letters and in fact to exaggerate their support for the \n     Judge.\n       I do not suggest that Judge Pickering would actually \n     retaliate against a non-complying lawyer or his or her \n     clients. Nor should the word ``coercive'' be understood to \n     describe the Judge's subjective intent. Canon 2 tells judges \n     to ``avoid . . . the appearance of impropriety in all \n     activities.'' In evaluating Canon 2, we use an objective \n     standard. We do not ask whether Judge Pickering would in fact \n     ``punish'' a recalcitrant lawyer or what was really on his \n     mind. We should not have to make that inquiry. We focus on \n     the situation itself and how it will appear to the public.\n       Directly on point is Advisory Opinion 97 (1999), which I \n     attach. It was written by the Committee on Codes of Conduct \n     of the Judicial Conference of the United States (the body of \n     federal judges that interprets the Code of Conduct in \n     response to questions from judges). The Committee was asked \n     whether and when a person being considered for the position \n     of U.S. Magistrate, or for reappointment to that position, \n     must recuse himself or herself under the following \n     circumstances.\n       Initial appointments as a magistrate judge are made by \n     district judges from a list compiled by a panel of lawyers \n     and others. Identity of the members of the panel is public. \n     Reappointments as a magistrate judge are made following a \n     report of the same kind of panel.\n       The Committee wrote in Opinion 97 that a person appointed \n     or reappointed as a federal magistrate judge did not have to \n     recuse himself or herself from sitting in a case where a \n     lawyer before the magistrate judge had been on the panel \n     recommending the appointment or reappointment. But the \n     opinion emphasized that the panel ``operates under a \n     requirement of strict confidentiality,'' so that the \n     candidate was ``privy to the individual opinions of the panel \n     members concerning any candidate.'' If this were not so for a \n     particular panel member, recusal might be required. (The \n     Opinion states: ``Of course, in the unlikely event that \n     during the selection process something were to occur between \n     a panel member and the magistrate judge that bears directly \n     on the magistrate judge's ability to be, or to be perceived \n     as being, fair and impartial in any case involving that panel \n     member, then the facts on that particular situation would \n     have to be evaluated by the magistrate judge to determine if \n     recusal is an issue and if notification should be provided to \n     the parties.'') In the situation you present, Judge Pickering \n     removed the opportunity for confidentiality by having the \n     lawyers' letters sent directly to him for transmittal to \n     Washington.\n       The testimony does not clarify whether any of the lawyers \n     or litigants whom Judge Pickering solicited had current \n     matters pending before him. The only reference to this issue \n     is at line 23 on page 81, where you ask whether ``present or \n     former litigants, parties in cases that you handled'' were \n     asked to write letters. Judge Pickering answered ``some.'' \n     This is ambiguous.\n       The impropriety becomes particularly acute if lawyers or \n     litigants with matters currently pending before the Judge \n     were solicited. Then the desire to please the Judge would be \n     immediately obvious and the coercive nature of the request \n     even more apparent. In addition, soliciting favorable letters \n     from lawyers or litigants in current matters could lead to \n     recusal on the ground that the Judge's ``impartiality might \n     reasonably be questioned.'' 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455(a). As stated \n     below, judges are instructed to avoid unnecessary recusals.\n       In Opinion 97, the Committee addressed the situation where \n     a lawyer currently appearing before a magistrate judge was \n     simultaneously sitting on a panel considering whether to \n     recommend the same judge's reappointment. The Committee \n     concluded that while the issue of the magistrate judge's \n     reappointment was under consideration by a panel, the judge \n     should not sit in any matter in which a lawyer on the panel \n     represented a party. This was true even though the lawyer's \n     own position on the panel was confidential and unknown to the \n     judge. (The Opinion states: ``Therefore, in the opinion of \n     the Committee, during the period of time that the panel is \n     evaluating the incumbent and considering what recommendation \n     to make concerning reappointment, a perception would be \n     created in reasonable minds that the magistrate judge's \n     ability to carry out judicial responsibilities with \n     impartiality is impaired in any case involving an attorney or \n     a party who is a member of the panel.'') Here, of course, the \n     situation is more serious because Judge Pickering would know \n     what, if anything, a lawyer wrote.\n       Opinion 97 is consistent with court rulings that have \n     disqualified judges, or reversed judgments, when the judge, \n     personally or through another, was exploring the possibility \n     of a job with a law firm or government law office then \n     appearing before him. See, e.g., Scott v. U.S., 559 A.2d 745 \n     (D.C. 1989) (conviction reversed where judge was negotiating \n     at the time for a job with the Justice Department). Pepsico, \n     Inc. v.

Mr. President, today we are considering the nomination of \nCharles Pickering to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Despite the \nfact that the Judiciary Committee rejected his confirmation little more \nthan 18 months ago, the President has seen fit to renominate Judge \nPickering for this appellate court judgeship. But nothing that has \noccurred in the last year should alter our conclusion that we should \nnot confirm Judge Pickering.\n  The President's decision to again advance Judge Pickering's \nnomination at this time is hard to understand. Had new facts come to \nlight regarding Judge Pickering's qualifications or record which \nassuaged our doubts concerning his fitness for this judgeship, or new \nexplanations emerged for his rulings and actions while a district \njudge, we could understand the President's decision to renominate him. \nBut absolutely nothing of the kind has happened. His record was \nscrutinized at length and in detail by this Committee last year, and a \nmajority found it deficient. Rather than examining the qualifications \nand record of a new nominee, we are once again rehashing the already \nwell-documented and well-established problems with this nominee. And \nour conclusion today is the same as it was last year--Judge Pickering \ndoes not warrant a promotion to the Fifth Circuit.\n  As Judge Pickering's record became known last year, we grew more and \nmore concerned about his ability to apply and make the law without \ninterjecting his strongly held opinions. Many of Judge Pickering's \ndecisions are far outside of the mainstream and appeared to be \nmotivated by a rigid ideological agenda. For example, he has shown an \nunrelenting hostility to persons bringing cases of employment \ndiscrimination on the grounds of race, ethnicity or gender. In voting \nrights cases, he has demonstrated a callous attitude toward the core \ndemocratic principle that every vote must count.\n  And we are all aware of Judge Pickering's disgraceful actions to \nreduce the sentence of a man convicted burning a cross in the front \nlawn of an interracial couple. Judge Pickering's extraordinary behavior \non behalf of a defendant in a cross-burning case seriously calls into \nquestion his impartiality, his judgment, and his fitness to serve as an \nappeals court judge. This incident looks no better today than it did 18 \nmonths ago.\n  We are further troubled by Judge Pickering's continued active \nsolicitation of support of letters of recommendation from lawyers \npracticing before him. Judge Pickering admitted at his confirmation \nhearing last year that he asked several lawyers who practiced before \nhim to write letters of support and to send those letters to his \nchambers so that he could send them on to the Justice Department. This \nconduct obviously constitutes an abuse of a judge's position. Even \nafter hearing the ethical concerns of many last year, he has continued \nthis inappropriate practice. Such plain disregard for judicial \nproprieties and ethics speaks loudly against promoting Judge Pickering \nto the Fifth Circuit.\n  The deficiencies in Judge Pickering's record are particularly \nintolerable in a candidate for an appellate judgeship. Once confirmed \nto their positions for life, federal judges are unanswerable to the \nCongress, the President, or the people. But this fact has special force \nwhen we are considering an appellate court nominee. On the circuit \ncourt, a judge enjoys the freedom to make policy if he chooses with \nlittle concern of being overruled. Subject only to the infrequent \nreview by the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals judges are the last word \nwith respect to our liberties, our Constitution, and our civil rights.\n  I also should stress that I do not oppose Judge Pickering because his \npolitical views might be different than mine. The President has a right \nto appoint judges of his own political leanings. But in the case of \nJudge Pickering, it appears his ideology is so strong, and his \nconvictions so settled, as to interfere with his ability to fairly \ndispense justice and protect the rights of the most vulnerable in our \nsociety. Judge Pickering's record as a judge over the past decade has \ncalled into question whether he can enter the courtroom and apply the \nlaw fairly, objectively, and without prejudice. This reason alone \ncompels us to oppose his nomination.\n  I must also dissent from the charge that filibustering this \nnomination is an abuse of our Constitutional duty to advise and \nconsent. While such a step is not--and should not--be done routinely, \nfilibusters of judicial nominations have been undertaken under the \nleadership of both parties several times in recent years. This does not \neven take into account the silent filibuster known as a ``hold''--often \nanonymous--which permits one objector to block consideration of a \njudicial nominee. President Clinton's nominees were routinely defeated \nby anonymous holds. And those holds only defeated the nominees who were \nlucky enough to even get a hearing and a committee vote. In the case of \nJudge Pickering, his candidacy has been reviewed and debated twice by \nthe Judiciary Committee. Plainly he has received fair consideration of \nhis nomination.\n  Judge Pickering is simply unfit for promotion to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit. No new facts have come forward which \njustifies reconsideration of the Judiciary Committee's decision to \nreject his nomination last year. For these reasons, I must vote against \ncloture on his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the years, I have spoken many times in \nthe Chamber. In 29 years I have spoken on everything from arms control \ntreaties to relatively routine matters. In this particular case, I come \nhere with mixed feelings. The Senator from New York spoke about his two \nfriends from Mississippi, and that does bother me because the Senate--\nand I believe I am very much a creature of the Senate--on many issues, \ngets along with comity. The Senators from Mississippi are both good \nfriends.\n  I consider the senior Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, one of \nmy closest friends in this body. We traveled together in Mississippi, \nin Vermont, abroad, and we have always worked closely together on \neverything from appropriations to agricultural matters.\n  Senator Lott has always been very courteous to me and is a good \nfriend. We even compare photographs of our grandchildren. I think we \nhave both come to the conclusion that is the best part of life.\n  We are at a challenging time in our Nation's history. Over the last \nseveral days more than 200 people have been killed or wounded in \nBaghdad. The number of unemployed Americans has been at or near levels \nnot seen in years, poverty is on the rise in our country, and the \ncurrent administration seems intent on saddling our children and \ngrandchildren with trillions in deficits and debt. For the first time \nin a dozen years, charitable giving in this country is down. That is \nnot the type of compassion we heard about just 3 short years ago.\n  While negative indicators are spiking, the Republican leadership of \nthe Congress now is choosing to abandon work on very real problems in \neducation, health care and national security to turn the Senate's \nattention to wheel-spinning exercises involving the most controversial \njudicial nominees.\n  Ironically, in spite of the heated rhetoric on the other side of the \naisle, we have made progress on judicial vacancies when and where the \nadministration has been willing to work with the Senate. Indeed, just \nthe other day the Senate confirmed the 167th of this President's \njudicial nominees--100 of them, confirmed by the previous Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate.\n  In less than 3 years' time, the number of President George W. Bush's \njudicial nominees confirmed by the Senate\n\n[[Page S13562]]\n\nhas exceeded the number of judicial nominees confirmed for President \nReagan in all 4 years of his first term in office. Republicans \nacknowledge Ronald Reagan as the ``all time champ'' at appointing \nFederal judges, and already the record compiled by the Senate in \nconfirming President George W. Bush's nominees compares very favorably \nto his. Since July 2001, despite the fact that the Senate majority has \nshifted twice, a total of 167 judicial nominations have been confirmed, \nincluding 29 circuit court appointments. One hundred judges were \nconfirmed in the 17 months of the Democratic Senate majority, and now \n67 more have been confirmed during the comparative time of the \nRepublican majority.\n  One would think that the White House and the Republicans in the \nSenate would be heralding this landmark. One would think they would be \ncongratulating the Senate for putting more lifetime appointed judges on \nthe Federal bench than President Reagan did in his entire first term \nand doing it in three-quarters of the time. But Republicans have a \ndifferent partisan message. The truth is not consistent with their \nefforts to mislead the American people into thinking that Democrats \nhave obstructed judicial nominations. Only a handful of the most \nextreme and controversial nominations have been denied consent by the \nSenate. Until today only three have failed. One-hundred sixty-seven to \nthree. That record is in stark contrast to the more than 60 judicial \nnominees from President Clinton who were blocked by a Republican-led \nSenate.\n\n  Not only has President Bush been accorded more confirmations than \nPresident Reagan was during his entire first term, but the Senate also \nhas voted more confirmations this year than in any of the 6 years that \nRepublicans controlled the Senate when President Clinton was in office. \nNot once was President Clinton allowed 67 confirmations in a year when \nRepublicans controlled the pace of confirmations. Despite the high \nnumbers of vacancies and availability of highly qualified nominees, \nRepublicans never cooperated with President Clinton to the extent \nSenate Democrats have. President Bush has appointed more lifetime \ncircuit and district court judges in 10 months this year than President \nClinton was allowed in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, or 2000.\n  Last year, the Democratic majority in the Senate proceeded to confirm \n72 of President Bush's judicial nominees and was savagely attacked \nnonetheless. Likewise, in 1992, the last previous full year in which a \nDemocratic Senate majority considered the nominees of a Republican \nPresident, 66 circuit and district court judges were confirmed. \nHistorically, in the last year of an administration, consideration of \nnominations slows, the ``Thurmond rule'' is invoked, and vacancies are \nleft to the winner of the Presidential election. In 1992, however, \nDemocrats proceeded to confirm 66 of President Bush's judicial nominees \neven though it was a Presidential election year. By contrast, in 1996, \nwhen Republicans controlled the pace for consideration of President \nClinton's judicial nominees, only 17 judges were confirmed, and not a \nsingle one of them was to a circuit court.\n  In fact, President Bush has now already appointed more judges in his \nthird year in office than in the third year of the last five \nPresidential terms, including the most recent term when Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate and President Clinton was leading the country to \nhistoric economic achievements. That year, in 1999, Republicans allowed \nonly 34 judicial nominees of President Clinton to be confirmed all \nyear, including only 7 circuit court nominees. Those are close to the \naverage totals for the 6 years from 1995 to 2000 when a Republican \nSenate majority was determining how quickly to consider the judicial \nnominees of a Democratic President. By contrast, the Senate to this \npoint has confirmed 67 judicial nominees, including 12 circuit court \nnominees, almost double the totals for 1999.\n  These facts stand in stark contrast to the false partisan rhetoric by \nwhich Republican partisans have sought to demonize the Senate for \nhaving blocked seemingly all of this President's judicial nominations. \nThe reality is that the Senate is proceeding at a record pace and \nachieving record numbers. We have worked hard to balance the need to \nfill judicial vacancies with the imperative that Federal judges need to \nbe fair.\n\n  In so doing, we have reduced the number of judicial vacancies to 39, \naccording to the Republican Web site for the Judiciary Committee. Had \nwe not added more judgeships last year, the vacancies might well stand \nbelow 25. More than 95 percent of the Federal judgeships are filled. \nAfter inheriting 110 vacancies when the Senate Judiciary Committee \nreorganized under Democratic control in 2001, I helped move through and \nconfirm 100 of the President's judicial nominees in just 17 months. \nWith the additional 67 confirmations this year, we have reached the \nlowest number of vacancies in 13 years. There are more Federal judges \non the bench today than at any time in American history.\n  But, despite this record of progress, made possible only through good \nfaith effort by Democrats on behalf of a Republican President's \nnominees, and in the wake of the years of unfairness shown the nominees \nof a Democratic President, the Republican leadership has decided to use \npartisan plays out of its playbook as this year winds down.\n  Today we discuss the nomination of a candidate for a judgeship whose \nrecord already has been thoroughly examined and rejected by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Instead of debating and voting on the \nappropriations bills remaining to us for this year, including the bill \nthat funds the Justice Department, the State Department, the Commerce \nDepartment and the Federal judiciary. The Senate is being asked to \ndevote its time to the nomination of a candidate for a judgeship who \nhas demonstrated that his record as a lower court judge is not \ndeserving of a promotion. Instead of putting partisanship aside and \nbridging our differences for the sake of accomplishing what we can for \nthe American people, we are asked to participate in a transparently \npolitical exercise initiated by a President who claimed to want to be a \nuniter, not a divider. With respect to his extreme judicial \nnominations, President George W. Bush is the most divisive President in \nmodern times. Through his extreme judicial nominations, he is dividing \nthe American people and he is dividing the Senate.\n  The nominee we are being asked by the majority to consider today is \nCharles W. Pickering, Sr., currently a lifetime appointee on the \nFederal trial court in Mississippi. Originally nominated in 2001 by \nPresident Bush, this nominee's record underwent a thorough examination \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee and was found lacking. Rejected for \nthis promotion by the committee last year because of his poor record as \na judge and the ethical problems raised by his handling of his duties \nin specific instances, Judge Pickering's nomination was nonetheless \nsent back to the Senate this year by a President who is the first in \nour history to reject the judgment of the Judiciary Committee on a \njudicial nominee. This is the only President who has renominated \nsomeone rejected on a vote by the Judiciary Committee for a judicial \nappointment.\n\n  For a while this year this renomination lay dormant while Republicans \nplanned a followup hearing in their effort to reinterpret the facts and \nthe record. Every once in a while we would read a news account \nreporting that some Republican official or other would insist that the \nnomination was to resurface. Judge Pickering himself told an audience \nat a recently delivered speech that several hearings on his nomination \nwere scheduled and cancelled over the last year by the Republicans.\n  Recently, however, Republicans decided to forego any pretense at \nproceeding in regular order. They simply placed the name of Judge \nPickering on the committee's markup agenda and voted him out by means \nof their one-vote majority. There was no reason given for suddenly \nbringing this nomination to the fore again. There are plenty of \nnominees for the committee to consider whom it has not previously \nrejected. The committee had been told since January that a new hearing \nwould first be held, but none was.\n  So the timing has begged the question: Why Judge Pickering, and why \nnow? Why not move ahead to confirm well-qualified candidates, such as\n\n[[Page S13563]]\n\nRoger Titus or Gary Sharpe? Why expend the Senate's valuable time \nrehashing arguments about a controversial nomination that has already \nbeen rejected once before?\n  Some have charged that the timing of this vote has been arranged to \ncoincide with the gubernatorial election next Tuesday in Mississippi. \nThat is because for month, after month, after month--10 months, in \nfact--this renomination lay dormant, and Republicans seemed reluctant \nto bring it back to the committee, let alone to the Senate floor, for \nvotes.\n  Next Tuesday, the people of Mississippi will be voting for their \nGovernor in what newspapers report may be a pretty tight race. So now \nthat this nomination is back, coinciding so neatly with an election in \nwhich Haley Barbour, a savvy Republican political operative, is \nchallenging an incumbent Democratic Governor, Ronnie Musgrove, it does \nmake you wonder--especially when Governor Musgrove supports the \nPickering nomination. Let us hope that the Senate is not being used for \nthat partisan purpose.\n\n  Here we have a nominee defeated by the Judiciary Committee entirely \non the merits--a nominee who, as Democratic Senators have shown, has a \nrecord that does not merit this promotion, who injects his personal \nviews into judicial opinions, and who has made highly questionable \nethical judgments. We also have a record of misleading and unfair \narguments made by the nominee's supporters in the Senate in the wake of \nhis first defeat, examples of Republican Senators implying that \nDemocrats opposed the nominee because of his religion or region.\n  Some believe that the political calculation has been made to ignore \nthe facts, to pin some unflattering characterization on Democratic \ncandidates in Mississippi, and to count on cynicism and misinformation \nto rule the day. Introduce the red herring that opposition to Judge \nPickering's confirmation is tantamount to some kind of insult to the \nSouth, and hope nobody sees through that deception.\n  The poorly named ``Committee for Justice,'' an organization created \nto make the ugliest and most partisan political arguments in favor of \nPresident Bush's nominees, and an organization run by the first \nPresident Bush's White House Counsel, Boyden Gray, has already produced \ntelevision advertisements in support of Judge Pickering, designed to \nput pressure on Democratic Senators. How long before we see those ads \nrunning on Mississippi television stations? And out of whose offices \ndoes the ``Committee for Justice'' do its business? None other than the \nWashington lobbying firm still controlled by and named after the \nRepublican nominee himself, Mr. Haley Barbour. And now, as part of an \norchestrated campaign, Republican partisans in the House have also been \npressed into service for this misinformation campaign.\n  Another shameful thing we will hear today is a distortion of the \nhistory of the filibuster. Some Republicans would now have the public \nbelieve that a filibuster of a nominee is, in their words, \n``unprecedented.'' This is another deception. As some of these same \nRepublicans well know, they filibustered the nominations of Judge Paez \nand Judge Berzon on the floor of the Senate in 1999 and 2000, as they \nconceded at that time. By way of example, I note that several \nRepublicans currently serving voted against cloture, the motion to \nclose debate, after the Paez nomination had been pending before the \nSenate for more than four years. I have already noted that even after \nlosing the cloture vote, Republicans led by Senator Sessions moved to \nindefinitely postpone a vote on Judge Paez's nomination, and a number \nof Republican Senators currently serving voted to continue to block \naction on the Paez nomination in 2000. Yet some Republican Senators now \nclaim that it is unprecedented to filibuster or deny a circuit court \nnominee an up or down confirmation vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  Their filibuster of Judge Paez's nomination is just one example of \nRepublican filibusters of Democratic nominees. Others include Dr. David \nSatcher to be Surgeon General in 1998; Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon \nGeneral in 1995; Judge H. Lee Sarokin to the Third Circuit in 1994; \nRicki Tigert to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1994; \nDerek Shearer to be an Ambassador in 1994; Sam Brown to an ambassador-\nlevel position in 1994; Rosemary Barkett, a Mexican-American attorney, \nnominated to the 11th Circuit, 1994; Larry Lawrence, to be ambassador \nin 1994; Janet Napolitano at the Justice Department in 1993; and Walter \nDellinger to be Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \nCounsel at the Justice Department in 1993.\n  The nominations of Dr. Foster and Mr. Brown were successfully \nfilibustered on the Senate floor by Republicans. Similarly, the \nnomination of Abe Fortas by President Lyndon B. Johnson to the Supreme \nCourt of the United States was successfully filibustered by Republicans \nwith help from some Southern Democrats.\n  In addition, to the nominees of Democratic Presidents whose \nnominations were subject to sometimes fatal delay on the floor, \nRepublicans made an art form of killing nominations in committee so \nthat they would never even have a vote on the floor. According to the \npublic record, more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees \nwere defeated by willful refusal to allow them a vote, and more than \n200 executive branch nominees, including several Latinos, of President \nClinton met the same fate, with their nominations nixed in the dark of \nnight without any accountability. They were filibustered and never \nallowed votes on the Senate floor. I discussed this history in more \ndetail on February 26, 2003, in the Congressional Record.\n  In addition, in the Congressional Record on March 5, 2003, March 11, \n2003, and March 13, 2003, I summarized the history of filibusters of \nnominees. I also spoke on May 19, 2003, about the history of Senate \ndebate and the constitutionality of Rule XXII of the Senate rules. The \nfact of the matter is that many nominees have been blocked from \nreceiving votes throughout the Senate's history. For example, 25 \nSupreme Court nominees were not confirmed in the Senate's history. \nEleven of those nominations were defeated by delay, not by confirmation \nvotes on the Senate floor, including the nomination of Justice Fortas. \nSince the early 19th century, nominees for the highest court and to the \nlowest short-term posts have been defeated by delay, while others were \nvoted down. Not even all of President Washington's nominees were \nconfirmed, nor were many other Presidents', often for political or \nideological reasons. Filibusters and other parliamentary practices to \ndelay matters were known to the Framers. There was even a filibuster in \nthe first Congress over locating the capital.\n  It is too bad that it has come to a filibuster on Judge Pickering's \nnomination, but the White House's refusal to accept the Senate's advice \nhas made it inevitable.\n  Let me clearly outline, once again, the reasons why I cannot support \nthis nomination.\n  Judge Pickering was nominated to a vacancy on the Fifth Circuit on \nMay 25, 2001. Unfortunately, due to the White House's change in the \nprocess that had been used by Republican and Democratic Presidents for \nmore than 50 years, his peer review conducted by the ABA's Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary was not received until late July of \nthat year, just before the August recess. At that point the committee \nwas concentrating on expediting the confirmation hearing of the new \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who was confirmed in \nrecord time before the August recess, and other nominations.\n  As a result of a Republican objection to a Democratic leadership \nrequest to retain all judicial nominations pending before the Senate \nthrough the August recess, the initial nomination of Judge Pickering \nwas required by Senate Rules to be returned to the President without \naction. Judge Pickering was renominated in September, 2001.\n  Although Judge Pickering's nominations was not among the first batch \nof nominations announced by the White House and received by the Senate, \nin an effort to accommodate the Republican Leader, I included this \nnomination at one of our three October hearings for judicial \nnominations. The day before his hearing, held on October 18, the three \nSenate office buildings were evacuated because of the threat of anthrax \ncontamination. Rather than cancel the hearing in the wake of the \nSeptember 11 attacks and the dislocations due to the anthrax letters, \nwe sought to go forward.\n  Senator Schumer chaired the session in a room in the Capitol, but \nonly a few\n\n[[Page S13564]]\n\nSenators were available to participate. Security and space constraints \nprevented all but a handful of people from attending. In preparation \nfor the October 18 hearing, we determined that Judge Pickering had \npublished a comparatively small number of his district court opinions \nover the years. In order to give the committee time to consider the \nlarge number of unpublished opinions that Judge Pickering estimated he \nhad written in his 12 years on the bench, and because of the \nconstraints on public access to the first hearing, the committee \nafforded the nominee an opportunity for a second hearing.\n\n  I continued to work with Senator Lott and, as I told him in response \nto his inquiries that December, I proceeded to schedule that follow-up \nhearing for the first full week of the 2002 session. There was, of \ncourse, ample recent precedent for scheduling a follow-up session for a \njudicial nominee. Among those nominees who participated in two hearings \nover the last few years were Marsha Berzon, Richard Paez, Margaret \nMorrow, Arthur Gajarsa, Eric Clay, William Fletcher, Ann Aiken and \nSusan Mollway, among others. Unlike those hearings, some of which were \nheld years after the initial hearings, Judge Pickering's second hearing \nwas held less than 4 months after the first one and, as promised, \nduring the first full week of the following session.\n  I should note that the committee worked with Senators Lott and \nCochran from the time of the change in the majority to ensure swift \nconfirmation of other consensus candidates to the Federal bench, and as \nUnited States Attorneys and United States Marshals. On October 11, \n2001, the Senate confirmed United States District Court Judge Michael \nMills for the Northern District of Mississippi; on October 23, James \nGreenlee was confirmed as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District \nof Mississippi; and on November 6, Dunn Lampton received Senate \napproval to be the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of \nMississippi; Nehemiah Flowers was confirmed as the U.S. Marshal for the \nSouthern District of Mississippi on February 8 although he was not \nnominated until the week before adjournment last session; and Larry \nWagster was confirmed as the U.S. Marshal for the Northern District of \nMississippi on February 8 although he was not nominated until the day \nbefore adjournment the session before. We moved forward quickly that \nyear to fill all these crucial law enforcement vacancies in \nMississippi.\n  After determining that the number of Judge Pickering's published \nopinions was unusually low, and within a week of the first hearing, the \ncommittee made a formal request to Judge Pickering for his unpublished \nopinions. Judge Pickering produced copies of those opinions to us. They \ncame to the committee in sets of 100 or more at a time, including a \ndelivery of more than 200 the day before Judge Pickering's second \nhearing, and another 200 or more nearly a week after. It took three \nwritten requests from the committee and more than 3 months, but \neventually we were assured that all available computer databases and \npaper archives for all existing unpublished opinions had been searched.\n  We appreciated Judge Pickering and his clerks providing the requested \nmaterials. Other nominees had been asked by this committee to fulfill \nfar more burdensome requests than producing copies of their own \njudicial opinions. For example, 4 years after he was nominated to the \nNinth Circuit, Judge Richard Paez was asked to produce a list of every \none of his downward departures from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nduring his time on the Federal district court. That request required \nthree people to travel to California and join the judge's staff to \nhand-search his archives. Margaret Morrow, who was nominated to a \ndistrict court judgeship, was asked to disclose her votes on California \nreferenda over a number of years and required to collect old bar \nmagazine columns from years before. Marsha Berzon, who was nominated to \nthe Ninth Circuit, was asked to produce her attendance record from the \nACLU of Northern California. She was also asked to produce records of \nthe board meetings and minutes of those meeting so that Senators could \ndetermine how she had voted on particular issues. Timothy Dyk, \nnominated to the Federal circuit, was asked for detailed billing \nrecords from a pro bono case that was handled by an associate he \nsupervised at his law firm.\n  The Judiciary Committee only asked Judge Pickering to produce a \nrecord of his judicial rulings. They are public documents but were not \nreadily available to the public or the committee. Given the \ncontroversial nature of this nomination and the disproportionately high \nnumber of unpublished opinions, this request was appropriate as part of \nour efforts to provide a full and fair record on which to evaluate this \nnomination, as some Republican Senators have conceded.\n  I set forth this background, for the record, to ensure that no one \nmisunderstands how the committee went about evaluating Judge \nPickering's record. We did not engage in a game of tit-for-tat for past \nRepublican practices, nor did we delay proceeding on this nomination, \nas so many nominations were delayed in recent years. Rather, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee seriously considered the nomination, gave the \nnominee two opportunities to be heard, and promptly scheduled a \nCommittee vote. I also postponed a business meeting of the committee 1 \nweek at the request of the Republican leader, out of deference and \ncourtesy to him.\n  The responsibility to advise and consent on the President's nominees \nis one that I take seriously. I firmly believe that Judge Pickering's \nnomination to the Court of Appeals was given a fair hearing and a fair \nprocess before the Judiciary Committee. Those members who had concerns \nabout the nomination raised them and gave the nominee the opportunity \nto respond, both at his hearing and in written follow-up questions. In \nparticular, I thank Senator Schumer for chairing the October 18 hearing \nand for his fairness then and, again, at the February follow-up \nhearing. I commend Senator Feinstein for her fairness in chairing that \nfollow-up hearing. I said at the time that I could not remember anyone \nbeing more fair than she was that day, and I reiterate that today.\n\n  My regret is that she and so many Democrats on the Judiciary \nCommittee were subjected to unfair criticism and attacks on their \ncharacter and judgment after last year's committee vote defeating the \nnomination. I was distressed to hear that Senator Feinstein received \ncalls and criticism, as have I, that were based on our religious \naffiliations. That was wrong. I was disappointed to see Senator Edwards \nsubjected to criticism and insults and name-calling for asking \nquestions. That was regrettable. While Democrats and most Republicans \nhave kept to the merits of this nomination, it is most unfortunate that \nothers chose to vilify, castigate, unfairly characterize and condemn \nwithout basis some Senators who were working conscientiously to fulfill \ntheir constitutional responsibilities.\n  I would like to explain exactly what it is about Judge Pickering's \nrecord as a judge that so clearly argues against his confirmation. My \nfirst area of concern, which I raised at his hearing, is that Judge \nPickering's record on the United States District Court bench, as \nreflected by several troubling reversals, does not commend him for \nelevation. Instead, it indicates a pattern of not knowing or choosing \nnot to follow the law, of relying to his detriment on magistrates and \nof misstating and missing the law.\n  At his hearing, I asked Judge Pickering about many of these \nreversals. Looking at his record, I saw that he had been reversed by \nthe Fifth Circuit at least 25 times. And in 15 of those cases, the \nFifth Circuit reversed him without publishing their decisions, which \naccording to their rules and practice indicates that the appellate \ncourt regards its decision as based on well-settled principles of law. \nThose Fifth Circuit reversals on well-settled issues indicated that \nJudge Pickering had committed mistakes as a judge in either not knowing \nthe law or in not applying the law in the cases before him. That is \nfundamental to judging.\n  I asked Judge Pickering about a toxic tort case, Abram v. Reichhold \nChemicals. There he dismissed with prejudice the claims of eight \nplaintiffs because he held that they had not complied with a case \nmanagement order. That means he dismissed them and denied them all \nrights to bring the case. Again, the Fifth Circuit reversed Judge \nPickering's dismissal, holding he had\n\n[[Page S13565]]\n\nabused his discretion because he had not tried to use lesser sanctions \nbefore throwing the plaintiffs out of court permanently, without \nhearing the case on the merits. Again, the Fifth Circuit did not \npublish its reversal, indicating that it was settled law that a \ndismissal with prejudice was appropriate only where the failure to \ncomply was the result of purposeful delay or contumaciousness, and the \nrecord reflects that the district court employed lesser sanctions \nbefore dismissing that action. The Fifth Circuit found none of those \nconditions existed.\n  Approximately 3 years before reversing Judge Pickering in the Abram \ncase, it had reversed him on the same legal principle in a case called \nHeptinstall v. Blount. There the Fifth Circuit held that he had abused \nhis discretion in dismissing a case with prejudice for a discovery \nviolation without any indication that he had used this extreme measure \nas a remedy of last resort. And in its ruling in Heptinstall, the Court \ncited another of its previous rulings which stated the same principle \nof law. Thus, this was not a principle with which Judge Pickering was \nunfamiliar, he had been reversed on that basis once and committed the \nsame error again. This was binding Fifth Circuit authority of which he \nwas aware but chose not to follow.\n  At his hearing, I asked Judge Pickering to explain his ruling in \nAbram, especially in light of the prior reversal by the Fifth Circuit \non the same principle of law in another of his earlier cases. And while \nhe offered his recollection of the facts of the case, he offered no \nsatisfactory explanation of why he ruled in a way contrary to settled \nand binding precedent.\n  I asked Judge Pickering about a first amendment case, Rayfield \nJohnson v. Forrest County Sheriff's Department. This was a case in \nwhich a prison inmate filed a civil rights lawsuit claiming that a \njail's rules preventing inmates from receiving magazines by mail \nviolated his first amendment rights. In an unpublished one-paragraph \njudgment, Judge Pickering adopted the recommendation of a magistrate \nand granted the jail officials' motion to grant them summary judgment. \nIn other words, he said that the petitioner's claim of a first \namendment right to religious materials which he wanted to get through \nthe mail would be denied without further proceedings.\n  In its unpublished opinion, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, not \nconsidered by many a liberal circuit or one that coddles prisoners, \nreversed Judge Pickering and said that the inmate's first amendment \nrights had been violated. In explaining why he was wrong, the Fifth \nCircuit relied on and cited a published decision of its own from \nseveral years before, Mann v. Smith. In that case, they struck down a \njail rule prohibiting detainees from receiving newspapers and \nmagazines, holding that it violated the first amendment.\n\n  What was of concern here was that in the Mann case, the prison \nofficials had made much the same argument about fire hazards and \nclogged plumbing that were made by prison officials and accepted by \nJudge Pickering in the Johnson case. This was a case with almost \nidentical facts in his own circuit, what we call in the law a case ``on \nall fours'' with the Johnson case, and he did not cite it. Indeed, he \nturned his back on it and ruled the other way. We do not know whether \nhe did not know the law or did not follow it. At the hearing, Judge \nPickering admitted that the magistrate who had worked on the matter and \nhe had ``goofed'' and that he was unaware of the law and the recent, \nbinding precedent in his own circuit.\n  There are many other reversals, which continue to concern me for the \nsame reasons that I remain concerned about the Johnson case and about \nthe Abram case.\n  One of them is a case called Arthur Loper v. United States. This is \nanother case in which Judge Pickering was reversed in an unpublished \nFifth Circuit opinion, which again means that he violated ``well-\nsettled principles of law.'' This case dealt with an enhanced sentence \nthat the Fifth Circuit found he had imposed improperly on a criminal \ndefendant. When the defendant made a motion for the sentence to be \ncorrected or set aside, Judge Pickering denied the inmate's motion \nwithout giving him a hearing but without even waiting for the \ngovernment to respond. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit reversed Judge \nPickering's denial of the motion, noting that the government conceded \nthat the defendant was correct, and that an error had been made that \nprohibited the judge from imposing the sentence that he did. The Fifth \nCircuit also cited the statute under which the inmate filed his motion, \nwhich requires that under ordinary circumstances, the trial judge \n``shall . . . grant a prompt hearing'' and ``make findings of fact and \nconclusions of law'' on the petitioner's claims. The Fifth Circuit \ncriticized Judge Pickering for denying the motion in a ``one-page order \nthat did not contain his reasoning.'' And then the court went on to \nremind him that ``[a] statement of the court's findings of fact and \nconclusions of law is normally `indispensable to appellate review.' '' \nReading this case, I can only wonder why Judge Pickering did not abide \nby the statute and follow the law. Was he unaware of the requirements \nof the law or had he decided to follow his own view of what the law \nshould be on the matter?\n  There is another case in which Judge Pickering denied a petitioner's \nmotion for a hearing and missed controlling Fifth Circuit precedent. \nThe case was U.S. v. Marlon Johnson, in which a prisoner claimed that \nhis rights had been violated because of ineffective assistance of \ncounsel and asked that his guilty plea be set aside. The inmate claimed \nthat he had asked his counsel to file a direct appeal of his \nconviction.\n  Once again, in another unpublished opinion, the Fifth Circuit \nreversed Judge Pickering's denial of the inmate's motion, explaining \nthat the inmate's ``allegation that he asked his counsel to file a \ndirect appeal triggered an obligation to hold an evidentiary hearing.'' \nThis time the court of appeals relied on two of its own published \ndecisions for its conclusion, neither of which Judge Pickering \nmentioned in his ruling. Again, there was settled law in the circuit of \nwhich Judge Pickering was unaware of that he chose not to follow.\n  I know that something will likely be made of statistics purporting to \nshow that Judge Pickering does not have an unusually high ``reversal \nrate,'' and that other judges, some appointed by Democrats, have higher \nnumbers of unpublished reversals. Whatever these numbers purport to \nrepresent about the quantity of Judge Pickering's reversals--and I \ncannot vouch for them one way or another, not knowing their source or \nmeaning--they do not in any way excuse the poor quality of his \nunderlying opinions.\n  In addition to the many times that Judge Pickering has been reversed \nby the Court of Appeals for not knowing or following the law, there are \nnumerous instances of Judge Pickering misstating the law in cases that \nwere not appealed to a higher court and other cases in which he stated \na conclusion without any legal support.\n  An example is a statement by Judge Pickering in a case called Barnes \nv. Mississippi Department of Corrections. In an earlier go-round in \nthis case, the Fifth Circuit had reversed Judge Pickering on one point, \nand in this later opinion, he tried to explain that they did so, in \npart, on the basis of a 1993 Supreme Court case called Withrow v. \nWilliams. In particular, Judge Pickering wrote that the Supreme Court, \n``acknowledg[ed] in Withrow that the Miranda warning is not a \nconstitutional mandate.'' This was clearly a misreading of Withrow. I \ntrust that Judge Pickering would now acknowledge that the Supreme Court \nrecently made clear in Dickerson v. United States that the Miranda \nwarning is indeed derived from a constitutional mandate.\n  An example of an entirely unsupported conclusion comes in a case \ncalled Holtzclaw v. United States, where Judge Pickering presided over \na habeas corpus petition by a Federal petitioner whom he had convicted. \nAlthough this was the first habeas petition the prisoner had filed, \nPickering termed the petition frivolous. He regarded the petition as \nrestating claims that had already been made at trial. He dismissed it, \nand stated that he would order prison officials to punish the \npetitioner if he filed another frivolous petition. Judge Pickering also \nconducted a ``survey'' of cases within his district to determine how \nmany frivolous habeas petitions had been filed. However, in the section \nof his opinion dealing with the sanctions, he did not cite a single \nstatute, rule of procedure, local\n\n[[Page S13566]]\n\nrule or case as support for his decision. He stated:\n\n       In the future, this Court will give serious consideration \n     to requiring prison authorities to restrict rights and \n     privileges of prison inmates who file frivolous petitions \n     before this Court. Specifically, this Court gives notice to \n     Roger Franklin Holtzclaw that should he file another \n     frivolous petition for habeas corpus in the future, that the \n     Court will seriously consider and very likely order the \n     appropriate prison officials to restrict and limit the \n     privileges and rights of Petitioner for a period of from \n     three to six months and/or that the Court will also consider \n     other appropriate sanctions. Petitioner Roger Franklin \n     Holtzclaw is instructed not to file further frivolous \n     petitions.\n\n  Judge Pickering relied on no authority when he threatened to impose \nsanctions. This sort of action by a federal judge is disturbing. \nThrough consideration and passage of habeas corpus reforms in 1996, \nCongress has made very deliberate decisions about what sanctions ought \nto be imposed for frivolous and repetitious petitions. In Holtzclaw, \nJudge Pickering went beyond Congress' intent, and in what could be \ndescribed as judicial activism, threatens sanctions not contemplated by \nthe statute.\n  Another example of Judge Pickering's misunderstanding the basics of \nFederal practice and due process occurred in a case called Rudd v. \nJones, where he presided over a prisoner's civil rights claim before \nthe enactment of the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act. He properly noted \nthat the Supreme Court required that a pro se plaintiff is ``entitled \nto have his complaint liberally construed'' and admitted that, under \nthis rule, the complaint ``could be construed to state a cause of \naction.'' Nevertheless, he claimed that the complaint was stated in \nonly conclusory terms and decided that, ``based upon previous \nexperience with complaints that are couched in such a highly conclusory \nfashion, this Court is aware that plaintiffs in such cases are very \nrarely successful and very seldom come forward with any facts that \nwould even justify a trial.'' Therefore, on his own motion, the Judge \nordered the plaintiff to refile the complaint with more specific \nallegations or have the case dismissed before defendant had to respond. \nHe also did another ``survey'' to prove that Federal courts were \nwasting their resources on frivolous prisoner civil rights claims.\n  In forcing the plaintiff to refile, Judge Pickering entirely \ndisregarded Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, which requires only \nnotice pleading. This is a basic tenet of the American system of \njurisprudence, laid out by the Supreme Court in 1957 in Conley v. \nGibson.\n  In yet another case, Judge Pickering disregards the applicable law. \nIn United States v. Maccachran, he denied a habeas corpus petitioner's \nmotion for recusal without referring the matter to another judge. The \npetitioner filed affidavits stating that the judge had a personal bias \nagainst him. The relevant statute, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 144, states:\n\n       Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court \n     makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the \n     judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias \n     or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse \n     party, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but \n     another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding.\n\n  According to the statute, the Judge had to allow another judge decide \nwhether he should be recused or not. However, Judge Pickering did not \nfollow the law, and he decided the case himself, stating that the \naffidavit was false. In support of his decision, he cited the dissent \nin a Fifth Circuit case.\n  I am also concerned about Judge Pickering's rulings and the attitude \nthey signal on one of the most precious rights we have as Americans: \nvoting rights. In Fairly v. Forrest County, a 1993 case, Judge \nPickering rejected a ``one-person, one-vote'' challenge to voting \ndistricts that deviated in population by more than the amount deemed \npresumptively unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. He called the \ndoctrine of one-person, one-vote ``obtrusive,'' expressing skepticism \nabout the role of the Federal courts in vindicating rights under the \nVoting Rights Act in order to ensure meaningful participation by all \ncitizens in elections. In that case he also denigrates the value of \neach citizen's vote, arguing that the impact of any malapportionment \n``is almost infinitesimal'' because an individual voter holds so little \npower. While we have always known about the power and value of \nindividual votes, the last Presidential election has certainly taught \nall of us a new respect for the impact of each citizen. Judge \nPickering's disregard for such a vital American right and for the worth \nof each American's vote is extremely troubling.\n\n  Additional questions arise from another disturbing trend that emerges \nfrom a review of Judge Pickering's opinions, published and unpublished: \nhis habit of inserting his personal views into written decisions in \nsuch a way as to create a terrible impression of bias to categories of \nplaintiffs and hostility to entire types of claims before the Federal \ncourts.\n  One entire category of claims in which Judge Pickering demonstrates \nhostility and bias is employment discrimination actions. This is also a \ncategory of cases where an examination of the judge's unpublished \nopinions was crucial, because over the last 12 years on the Federal \nbench, he chose to publish only one of his employment discrimination \ndecisions. The remaining 12 were all among the unpublished decisions he \nproduced to the committee upon request after his first hearing last \nOctober.\n  What is significant in these cases are the times in the unpublished \nopinions that Judge Pickering went beyond merely ruling against the \nplaintiff to make unnecessary, off-the-cuff statements about all the \nreasons he believes plaintiffs claiming employment discrimination \nshould not be in court, and about the general lack of substance of \nclaims brought under the federal anti-discrimination statutes.\n  For example, in a 1996 case, Johnson v. Southern Mississippi Home \nHealth, Judge Pickering did not limit his opinion to a legal conclusion \nbased on the facts presented. Instead he made sure to note that:\n\n       The fact that a black employee is terminated does not \n     automatically indicate discrimination. The Civil Rights Act \n     was not passed to guarantee job security to employees who do \n     not do their job adequately.\n\n  In a case called Seeley v. Hattiesburg, No. 2:96-CV-327PG, (S.D. \nMiss. Feb. 17, 1998), where he should have limited himself to the facts \nand the law, Judge Pickering went on to comment about other matters \nrelating to race discrimination lawsuits apparently on his mind at the \ntime, writing that:\n\n       [T]he Courts are not super personnel managers charged with \n     second guessing every employment decision made regarding \n     minorities. . . The federal courts must never become safe \n     havens for employees who are in a class protected from \n     discrimination, but who in fact are employees who are \n     derelict in their duties.\n\n  In a credit discrimination case, Judge Pickering ruled on the case \nbefore him, and then included a lengthy lecture giving his very \npersonal views on anti-discrimination laws. He wrote:\n\n       This case demonstrates one of the side effects resulting \n     from anti-discrimination laws and racial polarization. When \n     an adverse action is taken affecting one covered by such \n     laws, there is a tendency on the part of the person affected \n     to spontaneously react that discrimination caused the action. \n     Sometimes this is true and sometimes it is not true. All of \n     us have difficulty accepting the fact that we sometimes \n     create our own problems. When expectations are created that \n     are incapable of fulfillment. . . Plaintiffs fail to \n     recognize that whatever your race--black, white, or other--\n     natural consequences flow from one's actions. The fact that \n     one happens to be protected from discrimination does not give \n     one insulation from one's own actions.\n\n  All of this unnecessary editorializing is ironic given Judge \nPickering's testimony at his first hearing in October of last year, \nwhen he explained to the committee why he has chosen to publish so few \nof his opinions over the years. He explained that, ``Americans were \ndrowning in information,'' and that there is, ``absolutely too much,'' \nlaw written down. He testified that his view is, ``[i]f you are not \nestablishing precedent, why make lawyers have to read,'' and that, \n``there is too much being written out there.'' ``If you don't have \nanything to add . . . that is going to be helpful to somebody,'' he \nsaid, ``you are just cluttering up the information.''\n  After reading statements like those I have just read, it seems to me \nthat a plaintiff with a discrimination claim, reading or knowing about \nJudge Pickering's hostile position toward anti-discrimination laws and \nclaimants, would be justified in fearing that\n\n[[Page S13567]]\n\nthe judge had already made up his mind.\n  Such blatant editorial comments, reflecting such a narrow view of the \nimportant goals of our Nation's civil rights law, and coming from the \npen of the one person who is supposed to guarantee a fair hearing and a \njust result, are troubling. Judges are not appointed to inject their \nown personal beliefs into a case.\n  Judge Pickering voiced another disturbing aspect of his views on \nemployment discrimination cases almost as an afterthought at his second \nhearing. In an attempt to explain his statements on the weakness of \nmany of these cases in response to Senator Kennedy, Judge Pickering \ndemonstrated a troubling misunderstanding of the role of Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission in reviewing employment cases. He \nstated that he believed that, ``the EEOC engages in mediation and it is \nmy impression that most of the good cases are handled through mediation \nand they are resolved. The cases that come to court are generally the \nones that the EEOC has investigated and found that there is no basis, \nso then they are filed in court.'' But this is completely wrong. The \nEEOC has a backlog of almost 35,000 cases. Both parties must agree to \nmediation. The commission lack resources. Yet Judge Pickering had \nalready prejudged employment discrimination cases filed in court as \nwithout merit. That kind of erroneous and unfair a generalization about \nthe strength of discrimination cases by a Federal judge responsible for \npresiding over them, was extremely disconcerting. That a Federal judge, \non the bench for a dozen years, could so misunderstand the legal and \npractical mechanisms behind employment discrimination cases was \ndisturbing.\n\n  While fair treatment in employment on the basis of race, sex, \nnational origin, age and disability is fundamental to the American \ndream, and crucial to a free and thriving economy, due process in \ncriminal proceedings can be a matter of life and death. Here, too, \nJudge Pickering has misunderstood the law and injected his personal \nviews.\n  In a 1995 case, Barnes v. Mississippi Department of Corrections, \nJudge Pickering presided over a habeas corpus case in which a prisoner \nclaimed that his confession was involuntary because he had been held in \ncustody for more than three days before being given an initial hearing \nby a magistrate. The judge denied the petition and the Fifth Circuit \nreversed his decision. After remand, he again denied the petition, \nstating that granting such a habeas petition ``is far more cruel than \ndenying to a known murderer a procedural right regardless of how \nimportant that right is.'' He cited the Bible and Coke's treatise to \nmake the point that habeas corpus should be limited to petitioners who \ncan prove actual innocence. That was a misstatement of the law in \ncontradiction to Supreme Court precedent. He further stated that, \n``[i]t is the fundamental responsibility of government to protect the \nweak from the strong, but it is also a fundamental responsibility of \ngovernment to protect the meek from the mean--the law-abiding from the \nlaw violating.'' He cited no legal precedent for this apparently \npersonal view that society's natural law rights to be free from crime \noverride the specific protections contained in the Bill of Rights.\n  In Drennan v. Hargett, a 1994 case over which Judge Pickering \npresided, a habeas corpus petitioner claimed that he had been denied \naccess to the courts and received ineffective assistance of counsel. He \nhad pleaded guilty to a charge of capital murder at age 15 and received \na life sentence. He claimed that his attorney had threatened him with \nthe gas chamber if he did not plead guilty and that his lawyer did not \nmake important motions, such as a motion to suppress his confession \nunder Miranda. He also claimed that he did not know how to obtain \nrelief from the courts for several years because of his youth and \nbecause his representatives misled him. Judge Pickering denied the \nclaim, and devoted a third of his opinion, three pages of a nine-page \nopinion, to arguing that habeas corpus should not be allowed unless a \npetitioner can prove actual innocence. In this unusual opinion, he \ncited the ninth and tenth amendments, the Preamble to the Constitution \nand the Declaration of Independence in support of his views, adding \nthat he believes the Bill of Rights is in tension with the preamble on \nthis point. Again, he cited no legal precedent for these odd and \nextremely personal views, almost entirely unrelated to the controlling \nlaw.\n  And in Washington v. Hargett, a 1995 habeas corpus case, Judge \nPickering rejected the plaintiff's request for DNA testing required to \nprove his actual innocence, but stated that an attempt to prove actual \ninnocence was, ``the only reason why this Court or any other federal \ncourt should be considering a petition for habeas corpus,'' so long \nafter the trial. While that may be Judge Pickering's personal opinion, \nit is undeniably contrary to Supreme Court and statutory law. They \nstate that a prisoner petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus is \ncontesting the legality of his detention. The Supreme Court explained \nas much two years before Judge Pickering decided this case.\n  Interestingly, whatever the answer to that question, in the same case \nwhere Judge Pickering declared the importance of actual innocence, he \ndenied a petitioner the only thing that could have possibly proved \nhis--a DNA test. It was in that case of Washington v. Hargett that \nJudge Pickering summarily rejected the plaintiff's motion for a DNA \ntest in order to prove his claim of innocence. The case involved a rape \nthat occurred in August 1982, before DNA was generally available and \naccepted in the courts. Yet the judge suggested in his opinion that DNA \ntesting was inappropriate simply because the request came in 1995--13 \nyears after the trial. As he put it:\n\n       Plaintiff had a fair criminal trial. He was, and is, \n     entitled to nothing more. He was not entitled to a perfect \n     trial. No such trial can be held. Plaintiff states that he \n     wants DNA testing now thirteen years later. He wants a new \n     trial. A new trial, now, 13 years later, would be much less \n     reliable than the one that occurred 13 years ago.\n\n  As Judge Pickering may well know, over the last decade, post-\nconviction DNA testing has exonerated well more than 100 people, \nincluding 11 who were awaiting execution.\n  I have introduced legislation that would, among other things, afford \ngreater access to DNA testing by convicted offenders. Senator Hatch and \nSenator Feinstein have also introduced bills to promote the use of DNA \ntesting in the post-conviction context. In recent weeks I joined with \nChairman Hatch and others in introducing a bill drawn from these \nearlier efforts. Attorney General Ashcroft has stated that ``DNA can \noperate as a kind of truth machine, ensuring justice by identifying the \nguilty and clearing the innocent.'' Judge Pickering appears in this \ncase to have created an exception to his own oft-expressed view that \nhabeas corpus should be considered would be to establish actual \ninnocence.\n  I have asked in a number of different cases and areas of the law \nwhether Judge Pickering was unaware of the law in different areas or \nwhether he was trying to impose his own views in spite of the law. \nAnother area of great concern to me--Judge Pickering's intervention on \nbehalf of a convicted criminal--raises this same fundamental question.\n  In this 1994 case, United States v. Swan, Judge Pickering presided \nover a case brought against three people accused of burning a cross on \nthe lawn of an interracial couple. Two of the defendants, one a \njuvenile and the other with significant mental disabilities, accepted \nplea bargains offered by the prosecution. The third, Daniel Swan, the \nonly competent adult of the three, was also offered a plea up to the \nlast minute, but chose to go to trial, and was convicted of all three \ncounts brought by the Government. The story of what happened next is \nwhat troubles me about Judge Pickering.\n  But before I get to that, I think it is important for us to \nunderstand exactly what the facts were in the case. From the trial \ntranscript we know that on a night in early January of 1994, three \nyoung men hanging out and drinking in front of a convenience store got \nthe idea to go and burn a cross on the lawn of a local family where the \nhusband, Earnest Polkey, was a white man, and his wife, Brenda, was \nAfrican American. Testimony at trial shows that two of the defendants, \nJason Branch, who was at the time a juvenile, and Daniel Swan, a \ncompetent adult, were the moving forces behind this idea. The third \nman, Mickey Thomas, had a very low IQ and mental difficulties. It \nreally\n\n[[Page S13568]]\n\nwas Branch and Swan who referred to the Polkey family using awful \nracial slurs, and together they cooked up this idea.\n  After deciding what they would do, they moved into action, and using \nDaniel Swan's pickup truck, his wood, his nails, his gasoline and his \nlighter, the three men constructed a cross, took it to the Polkey's \nfront lawn, leaned it up against a tree, and lit it on fire.\n  Not long afterward, the three were caught by the FBI and all three \nwere charged with the identical counts: 18 U.S.C. 241, conspiracy to \ndeprive victims of their civil rights, 18 U.S.C. 3631(a), intimidation \non account of race, and 18 U.S.C. 844(h)(1), the use of fire in the \ncommission of a felony. All three were also offered a plea bargain \nwhich would result in little or no jail time, and two of them took the \noffer. Two of them, Jason Branch, the minor, and Mickey Thomas, who has \na mental disability, took the deal. They decided not to roll the dice \nwith a jury, and to admit their responsibility for the crime. These \nkinds of deals happen every day. They permit the justice system to \nfunction, and they offer defendants opportunities to admit their guilt.\n  One of the defendants, Daniel Swan, didn't take the offer. Instead, \nMr. Swan, who had boasted to friends before he was caught that he would \nnever do any time even if he was caught, decided to take his chances in \nfront of a jury. Well, it was not a wise decision for Mr. Swan, because \nonce the jury heard the evidence that I recounted earlier, they \nconvicted him on all counts. And that is where Judge Pickering's \nunethical behavior comes in.\n  Instead of doing what the law required of him and sentencing Daniel \nSwan to at least the congressionally required mandatory minimum \nsentence of 5 years for his conviction of the use of arson in a felony, \nhe started to act like one of Daniel Swan's defense attorneys and to \nadvocate for him, insisting that the Justice Department drop the arson \ncharge so Swan could get a more lenient sentence.\n  Why would the Government drop a charge after having secured a \nconviction in such a terrible hate crime? Why would the prosecution \nagree to imposition of such a reduced sentence for someone already \nfound guilty by a jury of his peers? According to documents that the \nDepartment of Justice produced to the committee only minutes before \nJudge Pickering's second hearing was to begin, and documents that they \nagreed to make public in a heavily redacted form a week after that, \nJudge Pickering made them an offer that they could not refuse. He \nthreatened them. He threatened them with bad law--with a decision that \nwould have called into question the applicability of the arson charge \nto cross burnings. And he threatened to make--and presumably grant his \nown motion for a new trial for Mr. Swan--a motion for which there would \nhave been no basis in law.\n  He badgered them, ordering them in extraordinary terms to consult \npersonally with the Attorney General, to report on all prior Justice \nDepartment prosecutions for cross burnings, and to agree to dismiss an \nalready secured conviction, in the face of the fact that the law did \nnot permit the result he sought. And when the prosecutors, career \nassistants in the United States Attorneys Office and career prosecutors \nin Washington, refused to cave in to his bullying, Judge Pickering took \nthings a step further, and he called an old friend, then in a high-\nranking position at the Department of Justice. As he admitted in a \nletter to me and in testimony at his second hearing, Judge Pickering, \nunhappy with the answer he was receiving from those prosecuting the \ncase, called the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division, a \nfriend of long standing from Mississippi, to, as he explained it, \nexpress his frustration with the prosecutors. Judge Pickering insisted \nin his testimony to the committee that he did not ask his old friend to \ndo anything or take any action but he did not deny the contact.\n  This sort of contact with the Department of Justice during a pending \ncase is extremely troubling. These sorts of ex parte contacts are \nexpressly prohibited by every code of conduct and canon of ethics ever \nwritten, and for good reason. The credibility of our entire system of \njustice rests on the presumption that the conduct of every trial, \ncriminal or civil, is fair and above board, and that no one side has \nany real or perceived advantage. Judge Pickering's phone call and \nactions undermine that assumption in very disturbing ways.\n  Judge Pickering and his defenders in this matter will tell you that \nhe intervened in this case not because he took pity on Daniel Swan, a \nconvicted hate criminal, but because he was concerned about the \ndisparity among the sentences handed down to the three offenders. He \nblamed the Government for agreeing to lower sentences for the two \nparties who pleaded guilty and then ``recommending,'' as he \ninaccurately puts it, a higher sentence for the party who took his \nchances with a trial. He tried to give the impression that upon the \nsentencing for Mr. Swan he was surprised to learn about certain aspects \nof the crime and the defendants' behavior in them. But it is clear, \nupon examining the record, that none of the defendants was sentenced \nuntil after Mr. Swan's trial, until after all the testimony about their \nactions and relative culpability had been revealed in sworn public \ntestimony. Judge Pickering is the one who sentenced all these \ndefendants after having presided over the case.\n  Moreover, I know of no other criminal cases in which Judge Pickering \nintervened based on a concern about disparate sentencing or another \ncase in which he took action to avoid imposing a sentence based on a \nstatutory mandated minimum. His defenders will point to a few cases \nwhere he properly showed leniency within the law, but they are \ndifferent from this one. In those cases it is clear he had the legal \ndiscretion to reduce sentences, but those advocating this nomination \ncan point to no specific legal justification here.\n  The law has very real consequences, as this letter from Mrs. Brenda \nPolkey makes clear. It was sent to me last year when I was Chairman of \nthe Committee. Mrs. Polkey says:\n\n       My now-deceased husband, Ernest Polkey, and I were the \n     victims of a cross-burning at our home in Improve, \n     Mississippi in 1994. We had purchased the home in Southern \n     Mississippi while I was still active military and my husband \n     had retired from the military. The cross-burning case was \n     prosecuted by the Justice Department in Judge Charles \n     Pickering's court.\n       I write to express my profound disappointment in learning \n     of Judge Pickering's actions toward the defendant, Daniel \n     Swan. As you can imagine, my family suffered horribly as a \n     result of the conduct committed by Mr. Swan and the two other \n     defendants. My daughter actually saw the cross in our yard \n     the morning of the incident. I still have a photograph of the \n     cross that I took that morning to make sure that the crime \n     was documented properly.\n       The trial of Daniel Swan was extremely emotional for me and \n     my family. As a native Southerner, I had grown up in the \n     1960's with violent acts based on race, and I lost a member \n     of my family due to a racial killing. I never imagined that \n     violence based on racism would come my way again in the \n     1990's. We helped in the prosecution of the case, and I \n     testified at the trail. The local NAACP gave me a certificate \n     for my role in pursuing the case.\n       I experienced incredible feelings of relief and faith in \n     the justice system when the predominantly white Mississippi \n     jury convicted Daniel Swan for all three civil rights crimes. \n     I had hoped against hope that the jury would do the right \n     thing and convict Mr. Swan of this horrible deed. The jury \n     came to a guilty verdict on all three counts after only two \n     hours.\n       My faith in the justice system was destroyed, however, when \n     I learned about Judge Pickering's efforts to reduce the \n     sentence of Mr. Swan. I cannot begin to explain what his \n     actions have done to my longstanding opinion that we were \n     correct in helping to prosecute the case, in trying to \n     bring about justice and in trying to prevent hate crimes \n     from being committed against other persons. I am \n     astonished that the judge would have gone to such lengths \n     to thwart the judgment of the jury and to reduce the \n     sentence of a person who caused so much harm to me and my \n     family.\n       I am very much opposed to any effort to promote Judge \n     Pickering to a higher court. Respectfully yours, Mrs. Brenda \n     Polkey.\n\n  When I raise questions about this case and Judge Pickering's \ninvolvement in the case and suggest it violates every Canon of Judicial \nEthics, it is not just my opinion. It is the opinion of some of the \nNation's foremost legal scholars on judicial ethics. Let me read to you \nwhat some of them have said. Professor Stephen Gillers of the New York \nUniversity School of Law, one of the foremost, if not the foremost, \nlegal ethics experts in the country, told Senator Edwards after Judge \nPickering's hearings: ``Judge Pickering exceeded\n\n[[Page S13569]]\n\nhis powers as the trial judge in the Swan case in a way that undermined \ndecisions of the political branches of government. He then sealed the \nOrder that would have fully revealed his actions.''\n  The professor concludes that this is a violation of Canon 2A and \n3A(1) of the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges because of his failure to \nrespect and comply with the law or to be faithful to the law. He \nsubstituted his judgment not only for the judgment of the prosecutors, \nbut also for the judgment of the legislators, this Senate and the \nHouse, instead of sticking to his role as a judge. And by sealing the \norder that revealed his position, he made certain that no judicial \nreview of his actions could occur.\n  Professor John Leubsdorf, legal ethics professor and Judge Lacey \nDistinguished Scholar at Rutgers Law School, agreed with Professor \nGillers. Professor Leubsdorf, who has been studying and teaching Legal \nEthics for 25 years, has taught at Columbia, Cornell, and the \nUniversity of California-Berkeley's law schools, and has published \narticles in the Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Texas, NYU, Pennsylvania, \nMinnesota, and Cornell law reviews, could not have been clearer. After \nreviewing the judge's actions, he concludes that, ``[w]hatever Judge \nPickering's motives may have been, this was no way for a judge to \nbehave,'' and that he ``cannot escape the conclusion that Judge \nPickering departed from his proper judicial role of impartiality in the \nSwan case to become an advocate for the sentence he considered \nproper.''\n  Steven Lubet, a Professor of Law at Northwestern University Law \nSchool, director of the law school's Program on Advocacy and \nProfessionalism, and the author of numerous articles on legal ethics, \nreached much the same conclusion. He tells us that, ``Judge Pickering's \nactions raise serious questions under the Code of Conduct for United \nStates Judges. In particular, it appears that Judge Pickering initiated \na prohibited ex parte communication in violation of Canon 3A(4),'' and \nthat his, ``extended efforts to reduce Swan's sentence for cross \nburning appear to have compromised his impartiality, taking him nearly \ninto the realm of advocacy, thus implicating Canons 2A and 3A as \nwell.''\n  The ethics concerns raised by the judge's behavior in the cross \nburning case are not the only ethical problems Judge Pickering's \nnomination presents. There is also the very serious matter of his \nhaving solicited letters of support and having asked to review them \nbefore forwarding them to the Justice Department and to the Senate. As \nProfessor Gillers for NYU explains, this is a matter of grave concern. \nThe letter, which has been made a part of the record, recounts the \nvarious Canons of the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges implicated by \nthis behavior, and is just another reason why I cannot approve of Judge \nPickering's elevation.\n  I should note that Judge Pickering's behavior in this matter is \nsimilar to that of a nominee from more than 20 years ago, Charles \nWinberry. Nominated to the U.S. District Court in North Carolina by \nDemocratic President Jimmy Carter, Mr. Winberry's nomination was \ndefeated in the Judiciary Committee in 1980. Among the grounds on which \nI opposed this nomination, sent to the Senate by a President of my \nparty, were my objections to Mr. Winberry's having solicited letters \nfrom lawyers who would be appearing before him, if he were confirmed, \nand for asking for blind copies of those letters.\n  The increasing frequency of nominees campaigning for confirmation to \nthe federal bench is a troubling development and one that threatens the \nvery independence of our judiciary. I was concerned about it in 1980 \nand I remain concerned about it in 2002.\n  During the course of these proceedings, some have falsely contended \nthat Democratic Senators have called Judge Pickering a racist. That did \nnot happen and that criticism is a smokescreen to obscure the real \nproblems with this nomination. I attended the committee hearings on \nthis nomination and witnessed Democratic Senators asking questions and \nthe nominee being given opportunity after opportunity to make his best \ncase for elevation to the Fifth Circuit. Some have even insinuated that \nSenators who oppose this nomination are anti-Southern or anti-\nChristian, a smear that is as wrong as it is ugly. The talking points \ndistributed by the other side are partisan, political and intentionally \nmisleading. They have been accepted and repeated by some who have \nfailed to review the record. That is unfortunate.\n\n  I think the nominee's past views and actions during a difficult time \nin Mississippi's history were not irrelevant, but I based my decision \non his years on the bench and the record amassed and reviewed at our \nhearings.\n  So let me sum up for my colleagues what Judge Pickering's own record \nmakes clear. Judge Pickering's record is replete with examples of bad \njudging and is littered with cases that demonstrate a misunderstanding \nof the law in many crucial and sensitive areas. Judge Pickering's \nrecord shows a judge inserting his personal views into his judicial \nopinions and putting his personal preferences above the law. It is a \nrecord that does not merit this promotion to one of the highest courts \nin the land. Based on Judge Pickering's record, I will vote against \ninvoking cloture, and should cloture be invoked, I will vote against \nthis nomination.\n  If Judge Pickering's nomination is not ultimately successful, he will \nnonetheless remain a Federal judge of the Southern District of \nMississippi with life tenure. He will be responsible for presiding over \ncases and determining matters central to the lives and well-being of \nmany people in Mississippi and from elsewhere. He has served as a \nprosecutor, a State legislator, a local leader, and now as a Federal \njudge.\n  The oath taken by Federal judges is a solemn pledge to administer \njustice fairly to those who come before the court seeking justice. It \nextends to those who are rich or poor, white or black, Republican or \nDemocrat, without regard to gender or sexual orientation, national \norigin or disability.\n  Judge Pickering remains a very important and powerful person in \nMississippi. I understand that he may be the only Federal judge who \nsits in Hattiesburg. The judge's ability faithfully to discharge the \nduties of the office are important every day, on every case, with \nrespect to every claim and regarding every litigant. I bear him no \nmalice and wish him and his family well.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: How much time remains for the distinguished \nSenator from Utah and myself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts in just a moment.\n  I would hope, after this debate, we might start debating judicial \nnominees based on the facts and not on some of the innuendoes we have \nheard.\n  Mr. President, before I yield, I understand that again we are \nreserving the last 5 minutes for the distinguished senior Senator from \nMississippi; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. You asked for 5 minutes, but \nyou will not have 5 minutes after allotting the 3.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, \nwho is, after all, a model of propriety and fairness.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Judge Charles \nPickering on his record. I want to be absolutely clear about that. \nCharles Pickering has a disturbing record as a U.S. district court \njudge that simply does not qualify him for appointment to the Fifth \nCircuit. He has often been hostile to plaintiffs bringing civil rights \nclaims, he has questioned the value of important constitutional \nprotections such as ``one-person, one-vote,'' and he has tried to \nrestrict habeas corpus. His cases are filled with dicta and with \nexpressions of his own personal opinion. This all calls into question \nhis ability to enforce statutory and constitutional protections and his \njudicial temperament.\n  The States of the Fifth Circuit are among the poorest in the Nation. \nThey have a population that is 42 percent minority--the highest of any \ncircuit. For many years, the Fifth Circuit had a critical role in the \nNation's history in applying and interpreting the civil rights laws. \nNot long ago, the circuit was hailed for its courage in protecting\n\n[[Page S13570]]\n\nthe civil rights of African Americans. When Congress passed the 1964 \nCivil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, many State and local \ngovernments in the South resisted these measures. Federal judges such \nas Elbert Tuttle, Frank Johnson, and John Minor Wisdom helped to make \nthe promise of equality a reality by enforcing these landmark laws of \nour time. It is particularly important that a judge appointed to this \ncourt have a commitment to civil rights, to the constitutional \nsafeguards that protect all Americans, and to the rule of law.\n  I am disturbed by the rhetoric I have heard today that those of us \nwho oppose this nomination are a ``lynch mob.'' This rhetoric is a \nprofoundly cynical misuse of race and disregards the lessons that we \nshould all have learned from history. Those who cannot tell the \ndifference between a mob bent on murder and torture of an innocent \nindividual solely because of the color of his skin, on the one hand, \nand those of us in the Senate who seek to focus on genuine issues in \nJudge Pickering's record, on the other hand, needs a serious history \nlesson. Frankly, such a comparison is not only unfair, but it does an \ninjustice to those African Americans who suffered and died at the hands \nof real lynch mobs in the South, including in the State of Mississippi. \nThis is not a lynch mob, this is reasoned debate, and it is part of our \nconstitutional role of advice and consent to engage in such debate.\n  Judge Pickering's troubling record on civil rights and his injection \nof his personal opinion can be seen in his extraordinary intervention \non behalf of a cross-burning defendant. Pickering repeatedly pressured \nthe Federal Government to drop a charge against a convicted cross-\nburner to avoid having the defendant serve a congressionally mandated \n5-year minimum sentence. Pickering went so far as to threaten to order \na new trial, and to initiate an ex parte communication with a high-\nranking official of the Justice Department while the case was pending \nbefore him. Three ethics experts have written Senator Edwards stating \nthat this conduct violated the Code of Judicial Conduct.\n  I have spent a great deal of time thinking about this case, and I \nhave come to the conclusion that Judge Pickering's efforts to reduce \nthe defendant's sentence of a convicted cross-burner in United States \nv. Swan cannot be justified by the fact that other participants in the \ncross-burning received lesser sentences.\n  The other two participants in the cross-burning pled guilty and \ntherefore were not subject to mandatory minimum sentences. Mr. Swan was \ntried and found guilty of a crime that has a mandatory minimum \nsentence. This eliminated any sentencing discretion Judge Pickering \nmight have had under the law. Thus, this case raises the question of \nwhether Judge Pickering will follow the law even if he does not agree \nwith it.\n  Mr. Swan was an adult of average intelligence at the time of the \ncrime. By contrast, one of the other participants was severely limited \nin intelligence, with an IQ of 80, and the other was a juvenile. Thus, \nMr. Swan arguably bore greater responsibility for the hate crime. \nFinally, the materials used to build the cross, the gasoline used to \ndouse it, the truck used to transport it, and the lighter used to \nignite it all belonged to Mr. Swan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the 2 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Judge Pickering has a duty to follow the law and the \ncanons of judicial ethics whether or not he agrees with them. His \nfailure to do so in this recent case cast doubt on whether he would do \nso if confirmed to the Fifth Circuit.\n  In a letter to Senator Hatch, Judge Pickering admitted that he has \ndeparted downward from other mandatory minimum sentences only when the \nSentencing Guidelines allowed an exception.\n  I have heard some say that the fact that some black Mississippians \nmay support Judge Pickering should be enough to have him confirmed. \nMany black Mississippians, including those from organizations \nrepresenting thousands of African Americans in Mississippi have come \nout against Judge Pickering. The State's major African American Bar \nAssociation--the Magnolia Bar Association--has written a letter to the \nCommittee opposing Judge Pickering. He is also opposed by Eugene \nBryant, President of the Mississippi State Conference of the NAACP, \nwhich represents one hundred chapters of the NAACP.\n  Democrats have not smeared Judge Pickering's reputation by examining \nhis record. Judge Pickering has a complex legacy. On the one hand, he \ntestified against the KKK and has spoken in favor of racial \nreconciliation. On the other, he has opposed civil rights laws, and the \nconcept of ``one-person, one-vote'' under the Voting Rights Act. \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee have never said that he is a \nracist. But the committee has to determine what sort of judge he will \nbe, not what kind of neighbor he is or the nature of his historical \nlegacy. His 12 years as a district court judge provide us with a clear \nrecord that he is unwilling to apply or respect the law when he \ndisagrees with it, and I will vote against his nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 7 minutes 29 \nseconds, with 5 minutes being reserved for the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is that all the time left on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard my distinguished friends on \nthe other side say we have approved 167 judges but have rejected only 3 \nwith a filibuster. Actually, that is a little bit of an untruth because \nMiguel Estrada was filibustered and, of course, withdrawn. Priscilla \nOwen is presently being filibustered. Carolyn Kuhl, there is a \nthreatened filibuster on her. These are all circuit court of appeals \nnominees. William Pryor has already been filibustered. Charles \nPickering is being filibustered. This is a cloture vote to determine \nwhether we can even have the dignity of an up-or-down vote.\n  Leon Holmes has been threatened with a filibuster. Janice Rogers \nBrown has been threatened with a filibuster. Claude Allen has been \nthreatened with a filibuster.\n  The fact is, we have never had a filibuster before in the history of \nthe Senate, in the history of this country, with regard to judicial \nnominees.\n  I have heard a lot of comments about what a nice man Judge Pickering \nis and all of this; it is the record they disagree with. This is a man \nwho has been on the bench for a long time, and he would be a rare \nperson if you didn't find one or two cases with which you disagree. I \nhave to say that in all honesty, most of these arguments they have made \nare smokescreen issues and arguments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I can't right now because I have a limited time.\n  Every one of them can be answered. Let me tell the principal reason \nbehind this. After we voted Judge Pickering out of the committee a few \nweeks ago, we held a press conference. One of the people who appeared \nwith us at the press conference was one of the leading civil rights \nministers of the South, former head of the ACLU in Mississippi, really \none of the most respected people in the civil rights cause. His life \nhad been threatened. He came and spoke fervently for Judge Pickering. \nBefore he did, I got up and I said: This is all about abortion.\n  After he spoke, he came up to me and he said: Senator, as you know, I \nam pro-choice, but you are absolutely right. This is all about \nabortion. Let me make that case by putting up this chart, the National \nAbortion Rights Action League.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds for each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. The National Abortion Rights Action League, Pro-choice \nAmerica sent this out to everybody they could: ``Urge your Senators to \nstop anti-choice nominee Pickering'' because they know he is pro-life, \neven though he has agreed he will abide by the law. He will abide by \nRoe v. Wade.\n\n[[Page S13571]]\n\nHe will abide by the other abortion cases. That is what this is all \nabout. Frankly, I have it on impeccable information that that is what \nthis is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am sorry the Senator from Utah was unwilling to yield \nfor a question. He mentioned a threatened filibuster on Mr. Holmes. I \nassure him, we have cleared Holmes on our side. The Republicans could \nbring him up any time they want. There is no filibuster being \nthreatened over here. I don't know why they don't bring him up. Gary \nSharpe of New York, I don't know why they don't bring him up. These are \njudges they could bring up any time they wanted. They have been cleared \nfor a vote on this side. We may vote for or against them. But Mr. \nHolmes is not being filibustered. That is a mistake on the part of the \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Charles Pickering has been subjected to \nthe most intense and thorough scrutiny that I can remember any judicial \nnominee enduring since I have been in the U.S. Senate. After all of his \nopinions as a United States district judge have been read and reread \nand dissected, this is what the record shows.\n  In 13 years on the Federal bench, he has demonstrated a sense of \nfairness and good judgment that has reflected credit on the Federal \njudiciary. He has become known throughout our State as someone who is \nabove reproach, who is totally honest and honorable, and who applies \nthe law without regard to race, creed, or ethnicity in an intelligent, \nthoughtful, and sensible manner.\n  He is widely respected as a United States district judge. I have no \ndoubt that if confirmed by the Senate, he will serve with distinction \nand dedication on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  Before he became a Federal judge, Charles Pickering served ably in \nthe Mississippi State Senate and was the chairman of the Mississippi \nRepublican Party. He was elected county prosecuting attorney after he \nhad been engaged in the practice of law for only 2 years. When Charles \nPickering was nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of Mississippi in 1990, he was approved unanimously \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee. And he was confirmed unanimously by \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  As U.S. district court judge, he has become one of the highest rated \njudges in the Nation. Judge Pickering has received the highest rating \nfrom the American Bar Association. He has a lower reversal rate than \nboth the national and Fifth Circuit average. Mr. President, 99.5 \npercent of his cases have been affirmed or not appealed. Of those cases \nthat have been appealed, Judge Pickering has only a 7.9-percent \nreversal rate, which is 20-percent lower than the national average of \nthe Department of Justice, and two times lower than the average \ndistrict court judge in the Fifth Circuit.\n  He has been endorsed by the current president and the past 17 \npresidents of the Mississippi State Bar. He is endorsed by all of the \nmajor newspapers in Mississippi. He has also been endorsed by all of \nour State government officials who were elected statewide, including \nthe Democrats who serve as Governor, attorney general, and secretary of \nstate.\n  The people who know Charles Pickering the best are the residents of \nmy State, and they overwhelmingly support his confirmation as a court \nof appeals judge.\n  It is time to end this effort to discredit and demean this good man. \nIt is time for the Senate to do what is right and confirm this well-\nqualified and honorable nominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has all time been yielded back?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on leader time, I wish to make a few \nclosing statements with regard to this vote and this nomination.\n  In a few minutes, we will have the opportunity to vote on whether \nJudge Pickering, whom the Senate has once before confirmed to the \nFederal district court without blemish, can be given the simple \nfairness, the simple honesty of an up-or-down vote or whether he will \nbe denied that fairness.\n  The vote matters to many people because none of the President's \njudicial nominees has suffered more indignities and distortions than \nthis superbly qualified man, Judge Pickering.\n  Others in the past and over the course of the morning have spoken \nmuch more ably about the qualifications with regard to this superbly \nqualified individual, Judge Charles Pickering.\n  I know the passion of the two Mississippi Senators from whom we just \nheard. We heard Senator Lott speak about this man, and we heard the \nstrong support from Mississippi Senator Thad Cochran for this nominee, \nand we know of the hard work of the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Chairman Hatch--all of whom have worked so hard to bring \nthis nomination to the floor over the last 2\\1/2\\ years since he was \nfirst nominated by President Bush--again, 2\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  It had always been my hope over the last 10 months since I became \nmajority leader that we would be able to put much of the unfortunate \nhistory of the 106th Congress behind us when it came to judicial \nnominations. By that, I refer to the inaction on nominees in committee \nto their outright defeat in committee which denied the opportunity for \nall Senators to exercise the constitutional responsibility of advise \nand consent, and the ability and opportunity to vote up or down on \njudicial nominations. I think we have made huge progress over the \ncourse of this year in that regard, thanks to Chairman Hatch.\n  While in many ways we closed that chapter of Senate history, a new \nchapter has opened and, once again, I believe we will see it today, and \nthat is this unprecedented use of the partisan filibuster in the Senate \nto deny Senators the opportunity and the ability to have an up-or-down \nvote to speak clearly, and the way we have the power to do that is \nthrough our votes, either for a judicial nomination or against a \njudicial nomination.\n  What bothers me as majority leader is what that says about our \ninstitution and about the future of this institution. Many of us have \nspoken to this and have warned over the past several months about the \ndangers of departing from this 200-year history of the Senate, that \ntradition of precedent from which all of a sudden we are seeing this \ndeparture over the course of this year.\n  Today, in just a few minutes, once again we have a choice, an \nopportunity to move ahead and make progress and to discharge that \nconstitutional responsibility of an up-or-down vote. This is not only a \nvote to decide whether the Senate will say yes or no to a man who, as \nwe all know, is perfectly qualified, a good man, a man of high \nintegrity and character, an able jurist who we all know will bring \ncredit to the Federal appeals court.\n  To vote yes on cloture, in my view, is the latest referendum on \nwhether or not we want to reaffirm our history in this body, the \nSenate, whether or not we want to shut this new chapter of \nunprecedented delay and destruction, whether or not we want to return \nthe Senate to the well-worn path that it has tried over the last 200 \nyears but from which over the course of this year we seem to be \ndeviating, a path of men and women coming to this body and by their \nvote being able to take direct responsibility of either confirming or \nrejecting a nomination.\n\n  I represent the State of Tennessee. Right now I represent my party as \nRepublican leader. In addition, I, as majority leader, believe I have a \nresponsibility to this entire body. Together we look to the past and we \nbuild for the future. I appeal once again to my colleagues to remember \nthe history we have as stewards, as servants to this institution; that \nwe remember the responsibilities charged to us by the Constitution, \nresponsibilities of advise and consent, and vote aye on cloture, and \nthen vote up or down but vote one way or another on the nomination of \nCharles Pickering. To do any less than that does fail the history we \nhave had the privilege to recognize and be part of. Indeed, it adds one \nmore obstacle to the progress we could make as we go forward.\n  Finally, it does ensure that with this new course foisted on the \nSenate, we will have to meet that radical departure from 200 years of \nhistory with responses that will reestablish a more regular order of \naction in the future.\n\n[[Page S13572]]\n\n  Mr. President, I close by simply saying I urge our colleagues to \nsupport an opportunity for an up-or-down vote--that is all we ask--on \nJudge Charles Pickering.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Will the majority leader yield for a question not related \nto the Pickering nomination?\n  Mr. FRIST. Through the Chair, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we were originally going to have a vote on \nthe global warming issue. It would have been about 12:45 p.m. This will \nnecessitate that vote occurring around 1:15 p.m., but under the regular \nprocess here, on Thursdays we do not vote during the hour of 1 p.m. to \n2:15 p.m. I wonder if the leader will be able to at this time indicate \nthat the managers of the Healthy Forests issue should be here about \n1:15 p.m., or thereabouts, so they can start on that issue prior to \nvoting on the global warming issue, which I hope can occur at 2 o'clock \nbecause there are a number of people on our side who need to vote on \nthat. I hope the leader understands what I am saying.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do. Let me talk to the managers before \nactually agreeing to anything. I have not talked with them about the \nscheduling. Before committing to a schedule, let me make an \nannouncement right after this vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote be vitiated and that the Senate immediately proceed to a vote to \nconfirm the nomination of Judge Charles Pickering to the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the \nnomination of Charles Pickering to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit.\n  I oppose this nomination because Judge Pickering has repeatedly \ndemonstrated a disregard for the principles that protect the rights of \nso many of our citizens. Judge Pickering's record as a judge is full of \ninstances in which he has elevated his personal views above the law. \nFor example, Judge Pickering has shown a lack of respect for the \nSupreme Court's landmark\n\n[[Page S13557]]\n\nlegal precedents, especially those that protect rights. He has harshly \ncriticized the Supreme Court's ``one person, one vote'' rulings and has \nbeen reversed numerous times by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for \nhis failure to follow ``well-settled principles of law.''\n  In one case, Judge Pickering took extraordinary steps to reduce the \nsentence required by law for a man convicted of cross burning. In \naddition, he exerted extraordinary efforts to reduce the 5-year \nsentence mandated by Federal sentencing guidelines in the cross-burning \ncase and went so far as to make an ex parte phone call to Justice \nDepartment officials in an attempt to assist the defendant.\n  And, since his hearing, Judge Pickering has actively solicited the \nsupport of this nomination from attorneys who appear in his courtroom. \nThis behavior not only calls into question Judge Pickering's commitment \nto protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans, but legal \nexperts agree that his actions violated the canons of judicial ethics.\n  Unfortunately, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nin their drive to push through every Bush judge at all costs, have \nturned this process into a personal attack on the integrity and \nmotivations of those of us who oppose this nomination. We have been \naccused of anti-Southern bias. Of course, anyone listening to me talk \nwould have to figure that I am the last person to hold an anti-Southern \nbias.\n  We have even been accused of calling Judge Pickering a racist, \nsomething we have not done. I do not presume to know what is in Judge \nPickering's heart. But I do know what is in his record. That record \nproves him unfit to serve as a Court of Appeals judge.\n  We have tried our best to facilitate consensus and cooperation in \njudicial nominations. Unfortunately, most of our efforts are being \nrejected, which doesn't make a bit of sense, since we accomplish so \nmuch when we all work together.\n  We have seen what happens when the President meets us halfway. He has \ndone it before--rarely, but he has done it. He reached out to us on \nAllyson Duncan, an outstanding North Carolinian who just yesterday was \nformally installed as a judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nbreaking a logjam that had held our State back for a decade.\n  In that case, President Bush did more than just pay lip service to \nour constitutional obligation to advise and consent. He reached out to \nus before he made his decision. He consulted with us. He sought our \nadvice. And in making his decision, the President selected a nominee \nwho represents the mainstream of our State.\n  Throughout Judge Duncan's confirmation process, I commended the \nPresident for consulting with us and making an excellent nomination. \nAnd I told him that if he takes this approach to future judicial \nnominations we have a real opportunity to find common ground in the \nsearch for excellence on the federal bench. When we work together, we \nfind outstanding nominees like Allyson Duncan, who represents the best \nof North Carolina and America.\n  But rather than accept my call for consensus, the President just said \nno.\n  There is a saying that if you see a dog and a cat eating from the \nsame dish, it might look like a compromise, but you can bet they are \neating the cat's food. That is how things seem to be working in \nWashington these days. My colleagues and I have tried and tried to find \ncommon ground. We have said yes to Bush judges, time after time after \ntime. We have said yes to more than 160 Bush judges. But but my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have instead dug in their \nheels and demanded that unless we agree to every judicial nominee the \nPresident sends up here, no matter how unacceptable they are, we are \nbeing obstructionist.\n  We can do better than this. And we should do better. It is time for \nthis President to stop saying no to judges who respect our civil \nrights. Let's say yes to judges who will fairly apply the law. Let's \nsay yes to judges who will not allow their extreme personal views to \ncolor their decision-making. Let's say yes to judges who will protect \nour civil rights. I am proud to stand with my colleagues today as we \nsay a resounding yes to fairness, equality and justice.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, Federal judges serve lifetime terms, and \nare responsible for interpreting our Constitution, and our laws, in \nways that have real implications for the rights of regular Americans. \nLast year I joined my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee in voting \nnot to report the nomination elevating Federal District Court Judge \nCharles Pickering to the Circuit Court of Appeals to the Senate floor. \nI stand by that vote. I continue to have very real concerns about Judge \nPickering's ability to be a fair and neutral Court of Appeals judge.\n  In evaluating judicial nominations, among the factors I consider are \nwhether the nominee demonstrates the highest level of professional \nethics and integrity, and has the ability to distinguish between \npersonal beliefs and interpreting the law. Unfortunately, I believe \nJudge Pickering falls short in meeting these criteria. Judge Pickering \nis an honorable person, but he is simply the wrong person to fill this \nvery important position.\n  Like my colleagues, I am troubled by Judge Pickering's handling of \nthe case of United States v. Swan, where a white defendant was tried \nfor burning a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple. Judge \nPickering had multiple ex parte conversations with prosecutors and \nJustice Department officials in an effort to reduce the sentence of Mr. \nSwan. In doing so, Judge Pickering seems to have lost sight of the \nethical limitations on his actions, and the extent to which he was \nfailing to maintain judicial independence. As Brenda Polkey, the victim \nof the cross burning, said, her ``faith in the justice system was \ndestroyed'' by Pickering's efforts to reduce Mr. Swan's sentence. In \nevery aspect of government we need to work hard and keep faith with the \npublic.\n  This case indicates how deeply held Judge Pickering's views are, and \nhow far he will go to arrive at an outcome he believes to be correct. \nThe difficulty that he has in keeping his personal views out of his \njudicial decisionmaking are obvious, not only in this case, but in \nseveral opinions in which he goes beyond the facts of the case to state \nhis belief of what the law ought to be. Judge Pickering's efforts to \nsolicit letters of support from lawyers appearing before him in direct \nviolation of the canons of judicial ethics is another example of his \nlack of understanding and adherence to the ethical guidelines that are \ncritical to maintaining the independence and integrity of the Federal \njudiciary.\n  Because of this troubling record of not following precedent, and of \noverstepping ethical bounds to achieve a particular outcome, I asked \nJudge Pickering questions at his hearing that focused on the right to \nprivacy. I asked Judge Pickering about privacy as it pertains to \nconsumers' rights, specifically medical and financial records, as it \npertains to an individual's right to privacy in the context of \ngovernment surveillance, and with regard to a woman's right to make \npersonal decisions about her body. In response, he declined to state \nwhether he believed that any right to privacy was conferred by our \nConstitution.\n  While my concern about how Judge Pickering would rule on cases of \nfundamental privacy rights is not the only factor in my decision to \noppose his elevation to the Circuit Court, it is one I believe is \nimportant.\n  The Fifth Circuit covers three States--Louisiana, Texas and \nMississippi--that have passed more anti-choice legislation restricting \na woman's right to make personal choices about her own body than any \nother States. In fact, all three States continue to have \nunconstitutional and unenforceable laws on their books prohibiting a \nwoman from having an abortion, because the legislature in each of these \nStates will not repeal the laws. This is the context against which we \nmust consider the President's nomination of Judge Pickering.\n  While Judge Pickering has repeatedly pledged to restrain his personal \nideological views and follow the precedent of the Supreme Court, given \nthe unique role that the Fifth Circuit plays in protecting not only the \nconstitutional right to privacy enunciated in Roe and affirmed in \nCasey, but also in protecting women's access to abortion providers in \nthe States with the Fifth\n\n[[Page S13558]]\n\nCircuit, I am concerned about Judge Pickering's willingness to say \nwhere in the Constitution privacy is protected and his willingness to \nfollow the law.\n  Judge Pickering's actions on the bench reveal a lack of understanding \nof the requirements of judicial ethics and a failure to meet the very \nhighest standards of the legal profession. Judge Pickering has \nexhibited a lack of ability to distinguish his personal believes from \njudging the issues before the court, and I therefore cannot support his \nelevation to the Fifth Circuit.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote no on cloture on the \nnomination of Charles Pickering to be a judge on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  We had a fair process in the last Congress on this nominee--two \nhearings, a lengthy period of deliberation and debate, and a fair vote. \nThe nomination was defeated. The Judiciary Committee's consideration of \nthis nomination was thorough and fair. Obviously, some did not like the \nresult, but I do not think they can in good faith find fault with the \nprocess.\n  It is my view that a process that gives a nominee a hearing, and then \na vote in the Judiciary Committee is not an unfair process, or an \n``institutional breakdown,'' as some critics of our work in the \ncommittee last year called it. It is the way the Judiciary Committee is \nsupposed to work. During the 6 years prior to last Congress, the \nJudiciary Committee did not work this way. Literally dozens of nominees \nnever got a hearing, as Charles Pickering did, and never got a vote, as \nCharles Pickering did. Those nominees were mistreated by the committee; \nCharles Pickering was not. What happened in the Judiciary Committee \nlast year provides no justification whatsoever for the President's \nunprecedented action of renominating someone who has been considered by \nthe committee and rejected.\n  Judges on our Federal courts of appeals have an enormous influence on \nthe law. Whereas decisions of the district courts are always subject to \nappellate review, the decisions of the courts of appeals are subject \nonly to discretionary review by the Supreme Court. Because the Supreme \nCourt agrees to hear only a very small percentage of the cases on which \nits views are sought, the decisions of the courts of appeals are in \nalmost all cases final. That means that the scrutiny that we in the \nSenate and on the committee give to circuit court nominees must be \ngreater than that we give to district court nominees.\n  I would think that this would be self-evident, and certainly the \ndebates over circuit court nominees over the years have been much more \nheated than those relating to district court nominees. But I begin with \nthis point because there are some who have argued that because the \nSenate confirmed Judge Pickering to the district court by a unanimous \nvote in 1990, he must be elevated to the circuit court.\n  Judge Pickering now has a substantial record as a district court \njudge that he did not have in 1990, and Senators are entitled--indeed \nit is our duty--to review and evaluate that record. Even leaving that \naside, a court of appeals judgeship is different from a district court \njudgeship.\n  There is another factor that I think requires us as a committee to \ngive this nomination very careful consideration. During the last 6 \nyears of the Clinton administration, this committee did not report out \na single judge to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. That is right. \nNot a single one.\n  And as we all know, that was not for lack of nominees to consider. \nPresident Clinton nominated three well-qualified lawyers to the Court \nof Appeals--Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Alston Johnson. None of \nthese nominees even received a hearing before this committee. When the \nchairman held a hearing in July 2001 on the nomination of Judge Clement \nfor a seat on this circuit court, only a few months after she was \nnominated, it was the first hearing for a Fifth Circuit nominee since \nSeptember 1994. We have since confirmed another Fifth Circuit nominee, \nEdward Prado.\n  So there is a history here and a special burden on the administration \nto consult with our side on nominees for this Circuit. Otherwise, we \nwould simply be rewarding the obstructionism that the President's party \nengaged in over the last 6 years by allowing him to fill with his \nchoices seats that his party held open for years, even when qualified \nnominees were advanced by President Clinton. And I say once again, my \ncolleagues on the Republican side bear some responsibility for this \nsituation, and they can help resolve it by urging the administration to \naddress the injustices suffered by so many Clinton nominees.\n  With that background, let me outline the concerns that have caused me \nto reach the conclusion that Judge Pickering should not be confirmed. \nExcept for the DC Circuit, the Fifth Circuit has the largest percentage \nof residents who are minorities of any circuit--over 40 percent. It is \na court that during the civil rights era issued some of the most \nsignificant decisions supporting the rights of African American \ncitizens to participate as full members of our society. It is a circuit \nwhere cases addressing the continuing problems of racism and \ndiscrimination in our country will continue to arise.\n  Judge Pickering's record as a Federal district court judge leads me \nto conclude that he does not have the dedication to upholding the civil \nrights laws that I believe a judge on this circuit must have. Judge \nPickering has a disturbing habit of injecting his own personal opinions \nabout civil rights laws into his opinions and of criticizing plaintiffs \nwho seek through legal action to correct what they perceive to be \ndiscriminatory conduct. In two separate opinions in unrelated \nemployment discrimination cases, Judge Pickering not only found against \nthe plaintiffs but saw fit to disparage their claims in identical \nlanguage. This is what he said:\n\n     The fact that a black employee is terminated does not \n     automatically indicate discrimination. The Civil Rights Act \n     was not passed to guarantee job security to employees who do \n     not do their job adequately. . . . The Courts are not super \n     personnel managers charged with second guessing every \n     employment decision made regarding minorities. The Court \n     should protect against discrimination but it can do no more. \n     This case has all the hallmarks of a case that is filed \n     simply because an adverse employment decision was made in \n     regard to a protected minority.\n\n  The use of this kind of language as a boilerplate does not indicate \nto me a judge who has an open mind about employment discrimination \nlawsuits. I think that people who have legitimate claims under the \ncivil rights laws of this country have reason to be concerned about \nwhether a judge who would go out of his way to say these kinds of \nthings in legal opinions will hear their cases fairly.\n  Indeed, during his confirmation hearing, Judge Pickering seemed to \nconfirm that he has a predisposition to believe that employment \ndiscrimination claims that come before him are not meritorious. He \ntestified that as he understands the law, the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission ``engages in mediation and it is my impression \nthat most of the good cases are handled through mediation and are \nresolved.'' He went on to say, ``The cases that come to court are \ngenerally the ones that the EEOC has found are not good cases, so then \nthey are filed in court.'' That is emphatically not the law, and it was \nextremely disturbing that a sitting federal judge who has ruled in \nnumerous employment discrimination cases would so profoundly \nmisunderstand the role of the EEOC in these cases.\n  Judge Pickering has also expressed troubling views in voting rights \ncases, including criticizing the concept of ``one person, one vote.'' \nThat concept is one of the bedrock constitutional foundations of our \npolitical system. Judge Pickering opined in one case: ``It is wondered \nif we are not giving the people more government than they want, more \nthan is required in defining one man, one vote, too precisely.'' I do \nnot believe that we can give the people too much democracy, and I am \nnot inclined to elevate to a higher court a judge who seems not to take \nthis constitutional principle seriously.\n  Another area of the law where Judge Pickering has demonstrated what \nseems like a hostility to certain kinds of claims is that of prisoner \nlitigation. We all know that there is a significant problem of \nfrivolous lawsuits being filed by prisoners. Congress addressed this \nproblem in 1996 with the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act, where it \nprovided certain sanctions for prisoners who file repeated frivolous \nclaims. Judge Pickering, however, has taken\n\n[[Page S13559]]\n\nthe law into his own hands on numerous occasions by threatening to \norder prison officials to restrict prisoners' privileges if they filed \nanother frivolous lawsuit. And he did this even after Congress \nspecified certain sanctions for repeated frivolous lawsuits in the 1996 \nAct.\n  I believe that this kind of threat is inappropriate behavior for a \nFederal judge. Judge Pickering's opinions could not help but chill even \nlegitimate complaints from prisoners. While it is true that much \nfrivolous litigation is filed by prisoners, it is also true that some \ncelebrated cases upholding and explaining the constitutional rights of \nthe accused have had their genesis in a prisoner complaint where the \nprisoner did not have a lawyer. Gideon v. Wainwright, which established \nthe right to an attorney, was such a case. Just the day before Judge \nPickering's second hearing, the Washington Post ran a story about a \nprisoner who received a favorable Supreme Court decision in a case that \nbegan with such a complaint. And the petition for certiorari was filed \nby the prisoner without a lawyer, as well. I believe that judges at all \nlevels must have an open mind toward all types of cases. Engaging in \ntactics that will frighten people into not asserting their rights is a \nhighly questionable thing to do.\n  Judge Pickering did respond to my written questions about his \ndecisions in prisoner litigation. I was gratified to learn that he \nnever actually imposed the sanctions he threatened, and I appreciate \nhis and the Justice Department's efforts to find legal authority for \nhis orders. I find those efforts unconvincing, particularly with \nrespect to the orders that he entered after Congress passed the \nPrisoner Litigation Reform Act. Judge Pickering states in answer to my \nquestions that ``[m]y objective was to stop prisoners who were filing \nfrivolous litigation from doing so,'' and that ``I do not believe that \nlegitimate complaints by prisoners were chilled by this approach.'' I \nsimply do not know how Judge Pickering could be so certain now, or when \nhe was making these orders, that threatening to order prison officials \nto take away unspecified privileges if a prisoner filed another \nfrivolous complaint was a tactic that would discourage only frivolous \nsuits by prisoners, but not legitimate ones.\n  I also have concerns about two different ethical issues that arose \nduring the consideration of his confirmation. I questioned him about \none such issue at his second hearing before Judiciary Committee last \nyear. After his first hearing, Judge Pickering asked a number of \nlawyers who practice before him to submit letters of recommendation. He \nasked them to send those letters to his chambers so that he could fax \nthem to Washington. And he testified that he read the letters before \nforwarding them to the Justice Department, which sent them on to the \ncommittee. Now when I asked Judge Pickering about this, he seemed \nconfused by the questions, as if he thought I was objecting to the fact \nthat the letters had been faxed rather than mailed. Let me be clear, I \nhave no problem with faxes. I get them all the time. What I do have a \nproblem with is a sitting Federal judge asking lawyers who practice \nbefore him to send letters supporting his nomination to a higher court \nand having those letters sent to him rather than directly to the \nJustice Department or the Senate. That seems to raise an obvious \nethical issue, and I was surprised that Judge Pickering didn't \nrecognize it, even when I questioned him about what he did.\n\n  I asked Professor Stephen Gillers of NYU Law School, one of the \nleading experts on legal and judicial ethics in the country, for his \nviews on this issue. Professor Gillers responded in a letter to me. He \nconfirmed my concern about Judge Pickering's actions. Let me read a \nportion of that letter. Professor Gillers wrote:\n\n       It was improper for Judge Pickering to solicit letters in \n     support of his nomination from lawyers who regularly appear \n     before him. It is important to my answer that the Judge asked \n     the lawyers to fax him the letters so that he could send them \n     to the Justice Department for transmittal to the Senate. He \n     did not ask the lawyers to send any letters directly to \n     Washington. Consequently, the Judge would know who submitted \n     letters and what the letters said, as would be obvious to the \n     lawyers.\n\n  Last year, Senator Hatch obtained a letter on this issue from a \nprofessor Richard Painter. Professor Painter answers only the question \nof whether soliciting letters of support violates existing rules of \njudicial conduct and never mentions the additional fact that Judge \nPickering asked for the letters to be sent to him rather than to the \nSenate. That makes Professor Painter's views much less relevant to the \nquestions I asked.\n  Furthermore, Professor Painter's analysis seems to be limited to an \neffort to show that the authorities relied upon by Professor Gillers \nare not exactly on point and that the standards governing the \nsolicitation of letters of support for nominations are vague. He argues \nthat the rules should be clarified and made more specific. And perhaps \nhe is right about that. But it seems to me to be an insufficiently low \nstandard to set that judges need only make sure they don't clearly \nviolate the ethical rules. We should not want judges who simply avoid \nclear violations of rules of ethical conduct. We should not want judges \nwho either don't spot ethical issues or treat them as obstacles to be \nparsed and tiptoed around. We should want judges who are beyond \nreproach, who know that ethical conduct is at the core of their \nresponsibilities, because such conduct helps ensure that the public \nwill respect their decisions. I believe that Judge Pickering's conduct \nfell far short in this instance.\n  Before this year's committee vote on Judge Pickering, some additional \ninformation came to light on this matter that suggests that Judge \nPickering's conduct presents even more serious ethical questions. In \nhis response to my inquiry about Judge Pickering's solicitation of \nletters of support, Prof. Gillers also noted the following:\n\n       The impropriety becomes particularly acute if lawyers or \n     litigants with matters currently pending before the Judge \n     were solicited. Then the desire to please the Judge would be \n     immediately obvious and the coercive nature of the request \n     even more apparent. In addition, soliciting favorable letters \n     from lawyers or litigants in current matters could lead to \n     recusal on the ground that the Judge's ``impartiality might \n     reasonably be questioned.'' 28 U.S.C. Sec.  455(a).\n\n  We identified 18 separate letters, all written in late October 2001, \nthat came to the committee from Judge Pickering's chambers. We now know \nthat at least seven of the lawyers who wrote letters on behalf of Judge \nPickering at his request actually had cases pending before him at the \ntime. A number of those lawyers had more than once case pending. One \nlawyer received Judge Pickering's request for a letter when a \npreviously scheduled settlement conference was a little over a month \naway. Another lawyer whom Judge Pickering solicited represented the \nplaintiffs in a class action against a major drug company. The \ndefendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction \nin May 2001, and the motion was still pending before Judge Pickering \nwhen he requested the letter.\n  Now I have to ask my colleagues: Suppose you were a lawyer in a case \nand your opponents filed a motion trying to get your case dismissed. \nThe judge has not yet ruled on the motion and you get a call from him \nasking you to write a letter of recommendation because he has been \nnominated to serve on a higher court. What would you do? Wouldn't you \nbe troubled? Wouldn't you feel at least a bit of pressure to comply? \nAnd would you write a fully candid letter, especially if the judge \nasked you to send the letter to him directly so he could see it before \nforwarding it to the Judiciary Committee?\n  I will submit for the Record a chart indicating the lawyers with \ncases pending before Judge Pickering who wrote letters for him upon his \nrequest. I consider this a very serious ethical breach, and Prof. \nGillers agrees. This violation of judicial ethics casts serious doubt \non Judge Pickering's fitness to serve on the Court of Appeals.\n  It is within this framework that I evaluate the other ethical issue \nthat has arisen, Judge Pickering's conduct in the Swan cross-burning \ncase. This case and Judge Pickering's handling of it have been the \nsubject of a great deal of controversy and public discussion, and I \nwill not repeat the details. I will only say that I am very troubled by \nthe Swan case, for a number of reasons. Judge Pickering, it seems to \nme, improperly stepped out of his judicial role, to try to get a result \nthat he favored in the case. He had an ex parte\n\n[[Page S13560]]\n\ncontact with the Justice Department about the case. He threatened to \nrule on a legal issue in a way that he apparently did not believe was \ncorrect if the Justice Department did not change its sentencing \nposition. He twice told the Justice Department that he might order a \nnew trial even though it was clearly outside of his authority to do so. \nAnd he took unusual and apparently unjustified steps to keep his order \nsecret, which prevented public scrutiny of his actions.\n  Judicial nominations should not be like legislation that can be \nreintroduced and reconsidered by a succeeding Congress. The Senate, \nacting through this committee, and exercising its constitutional \nresponsibility, refused to give its consent to this nomination last \nyear. I believe it was wrong for the President to re-nominate Judge \nPickering.\n  I do not believe Judge Pickering is a racist, nor do I believe that \nhe is a bad person. I did not come to this decision to vote against his \nconfirmation lightly or because of pressure from interest groups or \nother Senators. I sincerely believe that Judge Pickering is not the \nright choice for this position. I wish him well in his continued work \non the district court.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nletter to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              New York University,\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                  New York, NY, February 20, 2002.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I am replying to your inquiry of \n     February 12, 2002. I assume familiarity with Judge \n     Pickering's testimony and will address the two questions you \n     ask. I address only these questions. I take no position on \n     whether Judge Pickering should be confirmed for the Fifth \n     Circuit or the weight, if any, that should be given to my \n     analysis. Obviously, many facts are relevant to a \n     confirmation vote.\n       It was improper for Judge Pickering to solicit letters in \n     support of his nomination from lawyers who regularly appear \n     before him. It is important to my answer that the Judge asked \n     the lawyers to fax him the letters so that he could send them \n     to the Justice Department for transmittal to the Senate. He \n     did not ask the lawyers to send any letters directly to \n     Washington. Consequently, the Judge would know who submitted \n     letters and what the letters said, as would be obvious to the \n     lawyers.\n       I will assume initially that none of the lawyers whose \n     letters the judge solicited had current cases pending before \n     the judge. If a solicited lawyer (or litigant) did have a \n     pending matter, the situation is more serious, as discussed \n     further below.\n       Judge Pickering's solicitation creates the appearance of \n     impropriety in violation of Canon 2 of the Code of Conduct \n     for U.S. Judges. This document, based on the A.B.A. Code of \n     Judicial Conduct, contains the ethical rules that apply to \n     all federal judicial officers below the Supreme Court.\n       Judge Pickering's conduct creates the appearance of \n     impropriety, in part, because of the power federal judges, \n     and particularly federal trial judges, have over matters that \n     come before them. Federal judges enjoy a wide degree of \n     discretion, which means that many of their decisions will be \n     upheld absent an abuse of discretion. This is a highly \n     deferential standard. It means that for many decisions, the \n     district judge is the court of last resort and lawyers know \n     that.\n       Given this power over their cases, and therefore over the \n     lawyers whose cases come before them, ethics rules for judges \n     forbid them to make certain requests of lawyers and others \n     that ``might reasonably be perceived as coercive.'' Canons \n     4(C); 5(B)(2). These particular Canons deal with soliciting \n     charitable contributions. They absolutely forbid the judge \n     ``personally'' to participate in charitable or other non-\n     profit fundraising activities. They also forbid participation \n     in ``membership solicitation'' that ``might reasonably be \n     perceived as coercive.'' A narrow exception is made for \n     fundraising from other judges ``over whom the judge does not \n     exercise supervisory or appellate authority.'' Canon 4(C).\n       In these situations, of course, the judge would be \n     soliciting a benefit for an organization, and not, as here, \n     for the judge himself. That difference makes the present case \n     more troubling because a judge would ordinarily have a \n     greater, and certainly a personal, interest in a significant \n     promotion than he or she would have in a contribution to an \n     organization with which the judge is affiliated.\n       Judge Pickering's solicitations was ``coercive'' because a \n     lawyer who regularly practices before him was not free to \n     fail to provide a letter endorsing Judge Pickering's \n     promotion. Given the risk to lawyers' (and their firms') \n     clients--a risk they would readily perceive--lawyers would \n     feel coerced to comply with the Judge's solicitation of \n     letters and in fact to exaggerate their support for the \n     Judge.\n       I do not suggest that Judge Pickering would actually \n     retaliate against a non-complying lawyer or his or her \n     clients. Nor should the word ``coercive'' be understood to \n     describe the Judge's subjective intent. Canon 2 tells judges \n     to ``avoid . . . the appearance of impropriety in all \n     activities.'' In evaluating Canon 2, we use an objective \n     standard. We do not ask whether Judge Pickering would in fact \n     ``punish'' a recalcitrant lawyer or what was really on his \n     mind. We should not have to make that inquiry. We focus on \n     the situation itself and how it will appear to the public.\n       Directly on point is Advisory Opinion 97 (1999), which I \n     attach. It was written by the Committee on Codes of Conduct \n     of the Judicial Conference of the United States (the body of \n     federal judges that interprets the Code of Conduct in \n     response to questions from judges). The Committee was asked \n     whether and when a person being considered for the position \n     of U.S. Magistrate, or for reappointment to that position, \n     must recuse himself or herself under the following \n     circumstances.\n       Initial appointments as a magistrate judge are made by \n     district judges from a list compiled by a panel of lawyers \n     and others. Identity of the members of the panel is public. \n     Reappointments as a magistrate judge are made following a \n     report of the same kind of panel.\n       The Committee wrote in Opinion 97 that a person appointed \n     or reappointed as a federal magistrate judge did not have to \n     recuse himself or herself from sitting in a case where a \n     lawyer before the magistrate judge had been on the panel \n     recommending the appointment or reappointment. But the \n     opinion emphasized that the panel ``operates under a \n     requirement of strict confidentiality,'' so that the \n     candidate was ``privy to the individual opinions of the panel \n     members concerning any candidate.'' If this were not so for a \n     particular panel member, recusal might be required. (The \n     Opinion states: ``Of course, in the unlikely event that \n     during the selection process something were to occur between \n     a panel member and the magistrate judge that bears directly \n     on the magistrate judge's ability to be, or to be perceived \n     as being, fair and impartial in any case involving that panel \n     member, then the facts on that particular situation would \n     have to be evaluated by the magistrate judge to determine if \n     recusal is an issue and if notification should be provided to \n     the parties.'') In the situation you present, Judge Pickering \n     removed the opportunity for confidentiality by having the \n     lawyers' letters sent directly to him for transmittal to \n     Washington.\n       The testimony does not clarify whether any of the lawyers \n     or litigants whom Judge Pickering solicited had current \n     matters pending before him. The only reference to this issue \n     is at line 23 on page 81, where you ask whether ``present or \n     former litigants, parties in cases that you handled'' were \n     asked to write letters. Judge Pickering answered ``some.'' \n     This is ambiguous.\n       The impropriety becomes particularly acute if lawyers or \n     litigants with matters currently pending before the Judge \n     were solicited. Then the desire to please the Judge would be \n     immediately obvious and the coercive nature of the request \n     even more apparent. In addition, soliciting favorable letters \n     from lawyers or litigants in current matters could lead to \n     recusal on the ground that the Judge's ``impartiality might \n     reasonably be questioned.'' 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455(a). As stated \n     below, judges are instructed to avoid unnecessary recusals.\n       In Opinion 97, the Committee addressed the situation where \n     a lawyer currently appearing before a magistrate judge was \n     simultaneously sitting on a panel considering whether to \n     recommend the same judge's reappointment. The Committee \n     concluded that while the issue of the magistrate judge's \n     reappointment was under consideration by a panel, the judge \n     should not sit in any matter in which a lawyer on the panel \n     represented a party. This was true even though the lawyer's \n     own position on the panel was confidential and unknown to the \n     judge. (The Opinion states: ``Therefore, in the opinion of \n     the Committee, during the period of time that the panel is \n     evaluating the incumbent and considering what recommendation \n     to make concerning reappointment, a perception would be \n     created in reasonable minds that the magistrate judge's \n     ability to carry out judicial responsibilities with \n     impartiality is impaired in any case involving an attorney or \n     a party who is a member of the panel.'') Here, of course, the \n     situation is more serious because Judge Pickering would know \n     what, if anything, a lawyer wrote.\n       Opinion 97 is consistent with court rulings that have \n     disqualified judges, or reversed judgments, when the judge, \n     personally or through another, was exploring the possibility \n     of a job with a law firm or government law office then \n     appearing before him. See, e.g., Scott v. U.S., 559 A.2d 745 \n     (D.C. 1989) (conviction reversed where judge was negotiating \n     at the time for a job with the Justice Department). Pepsico, \n     Inc. v. McMillen, 764 F.2d 458 (7th Cir. 1985) (judge \n     disqualified after headhunter for judge contacted law firms \n     appearing before judge). Recusal has also been required where \n     the judge's contact with a litigant or lawyer in a pending \n     case was not employment-related but was otherwise viewed as \n     favorable to the judge. Home Placement Service, Inc. v. \n     Providence Journal Co., 739 F.2d 671 (1st Cir. 1984) (recusal \n     required where judge cooperated with a newspaper reporter in \n     a complimentary article about the judge and his wife while \n     newspaper's case was pending before judge).\n\n[[Page S13561]]\n\n       The Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges requires judges to \n     refrain from activity that could lead to unnecessary recusal. \n     Canon 3 states that the ``judicial duties of a judge takes \n     precedent over all other activities.'' Canon 5 instructs \n     judges to `'regulate extra-judicial activities to minimize \n     the risk of conflict with judicial duties.'' Opinion 97 and \n     the cases cited would have given a current litigant who did \n     not write (or whose lawyer did not write) a letter \n     recommending the Judge a strong legal basis to seek to recuse \n     the Judge in the litigant's case. A litigant whose case came \n     before the Judge reasonably soon thereafter, but whose lawyer \n     had not written a letter in response to the Judge's earlier \n     request (as the Judge would be aware), would also have a \n     basis for a recusal motion.\n       I hope this letter assists your important work.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Stephen Gillers.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today we are considering the nomination of \nCharles Pickering to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Despite the \nfact that the Judiciary Committee rejected his confirmation little more \nthan 18 months ago, the President has seen fit to renominate Judge \nPickering for this appellate court judgeship. But nothing that has \noccurred in the last year should alter our conclusion that we should \nnot confirm Judge Pickering.\n  The President's decision to again advance Judge Pickering's \nnomination at this time is hard to understand. Had new facts come to \nlight regarding Judge Pickering's qualifications or record which \nassuaged our doubts concerning his fitness for this judgeship, or new \nexplanations emerged for his rulings and actions while a district \njudge, we could understand the President's decision to renominate him. \nBut absolutely nothing of the kind has happened. His record was \nscrutinized at length and in detail by this Committee last year, and a \nmajority found it deficient. Rather than examining the qualifications \nand record of a new nominee, we are once again rehashing the already \nwell-documented and well-established problems with this nominee. And \nour conclusion today is the same as it was last year--Judge Pickering \ndoes not warrant a promotion to the Fifth Circuit.\n  As Judge Pickering's record became known last year, we grew more and \nmore concerned about his ability to apply and make the law without \ninterjecting his strongly held opinions. Many of Judge Pickering's \ndecisions are far outside of the mainstream and appeared to be \nmotivated by a rigid ideological agenda. For example, he has shown an \nunrelenting hostility to persons bringing cases of employment \ndiscrimination on the grounds of race, ethnicity or gender. In voting \nrights cases, he has demonstrated a callous attitude toward the core \ndemocratic principle that every vote must count.\n  And we are all aware of Judge Pickering's disgraceful actions to \nreduce the sentence of a man convicted burning a cross in the front \nlawn of an interracial couple. Judge Pickering's extraordinary behavior \non behalf of a defendant in a cross-burning case seriously calls into \nquestion his impartiality, his judgment, and his fitness to serve as an \nappeals court judge. This incident looks no better today than it did 18 \nmonths ago.\n  We are further troubled by Judge Pickering's continued active \nsolicitation of support of letters of recommendation from lawyers \npracticing before him. Judge Pickering admitted at his confirmation \nhearing last year that he asked several lawyers who practiced before \nhim to write letters of support and to send those letters to his \nchambers so that he could send them on to the Justice Department. This \nconduct obviously constitutes an abuse of a judge's position. Even \nafter hearing the ethical concerns of many last year, he has continued \nthis inappropriate practice. Such plain disregard for judicial \nproprieties and ethics speaks loudly against promoting Judge Pickering \nto the Fifth Circuit.\n  The deficiencies in Judge Pickering's record are particularly \nintolerable in a candidate for an appellate judgeship. Once confirmed \nto their positions for life, federal judges are unanswerable to the \nCongress, the President, or the people. But this fact has special force \nwhen we are considering an appellate court nominee. On the circuit \ncourt, a judge enjoys the freedom to make policy if he chooses with \nlittle concern of being overruled. Subject only to the infrequent \nreview by the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals judges are the last word \nwith respect to our liberties, our Constitution, and our civil rights.\n  I also should stress that I do not oppose Judge Pickering because his \npolitical views might be different than mine. The President has a right \nto appoint judges of his own political leanings. But in the case of \nJudge Pickering, it appears his ideology is so strong, and his \nconvictions so settled, as to interfere with his ability to fairly \ndispense justice and protect the rights of the most vulnerable in our \nsociety. Judge Pickering's record as a judge over the past decade has \ncalled into question whether he can enter the courtroom and apply the \nlaw fairly, objectively, and without prejudice. This reason alone \ncompels us to oppose his nomination.\n  I must also dissent from the charge that filibustering this \nnomination is an abuse of our Constitutional duty to advise and \nconsent. While such a step is not--and should not--be done routinely, \nfilibusters of judicial nominations have been undertaken under the \nleadership of both parties several times in recent years. This does not \neven take into account the silent filibuster known as a ``hold''--often \nanonymous--which permits one objector to block consideration of a \njudicial nominee. President Clinton's nominees were routinely defeated \nby anonymous holds. And those holds only defeated the nominees who were \nlucky enough to even get a hearing and a committee vote. In the case of \nJudge Pickering, his candidacy has been reviewed and debated twice by \nthe Judiciary Committee. Plainly he has received fair consideration of \nhis nomination.\n  Judge Pickering is simply unfit for promotion to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit. No new facts have come forward which \njustifies reconsideration of the Judiciary Committee's decision to \nreject his nomination last year. For these reasons, I must vote against \ncloture on his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the years, I have spoken many times in \nthe Chamber. In 29 years I have spoken on everything from arms control \ntreaties to relatively routine matters. In this particular case, I come \nhere with mixed feelings. The Senator from New York spoke about his two \nfriends from Mississippi, and that does bother me because the Senate--\nand I believe I am very much a creature of the Senate--on many issues, \ngets along with comity. The Senators from Mississippi are both good \nfriends.\n  I consider the senior Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, one of \nmy closest friends in this body. We traveled together in Mississippi, \nin Vermont, abroad, and we have always worked closely together on \neverything from appropriations to agricultural matters.\n  Senator Lott has always been very courteous to me and is a good \nfriend. We even compare photographs of our grandchildren. I think we \nhave both come to the conclusion that is the best part of life.\n  We are at a challenging time in our Nation's history. Over the last \nseveral days more than 200 people have been killed or wounded in \nBaghdad. The number of unemployed Americans has been at or near levels \nnot seen in years, poverty is on the rise in our country, and the \ncurrent administration seems intent on saddling our children and \ngrandchildren with trillions in deficits and debt. For the first time \nin a dozen years, charitable giving in this country is down. That is \nnot the type of compassion we heard about just 3 short years ago.\n  While negative indicators are spiking, the Republican leadership of \nthe Congress now is choosing to abandon work on very real problems in \neducation, health care and national security to turn the Senate's \nattention to wheel-spinning exercises involving the most controversial \njudicial nominees.\n  Ironically, in spite of the heated rhetoric on the other side of the \naisle, we have made progress on judicial vacancies when and where the \nadministration has been willing to work with the Senate. Indeed, just \nthe other day the Senate confirmed the 167th of this President's \njudicial nominees--100 of them, confirmed by the previous Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate.\n  In less than 3 years' time, the number of President George W. Bush's \njudicial nominees confirmed by the Senate\n\n[[Page S13562]]\n\nhas exceeded the number of judicial nominees confirmed for President \nReagan in all 4 years of his first term in office. Republicans \nacknowledge Ronald Reagan as the ``all time champ'' at appointing \nFederal judges, and already the record compiled by the Senate in \nconfirming President George W. Bush's nominees compares very favorably \nto his. Since July 2001, despite the fact that the Senate majority has \nshifted twice, a total of 167 judicial nominations have been confirmed, \nincluding 29 circuit court appointments. One hundred judges were \nconfirmed in the 17 months of the Democratic Senate majority, and now \n67 more have been confirmed during the comparative time of the \nRepublican majority.\n  One would think that the White House and the Republicans in the \nSenate would be heralding this landmark. One would think they would be \ncongratulating the Senate for putting more lifetime appointed judges on \nthe Federal bench than President Reagan did in his entire first term \nand doing it in three-quarters of the time. But Republicans have a \ndifferent partisan message. The truth is not consistent with their \nefforts to mislead the American people into thinking that Democrats \nhave obstructed judicial nominations. Only a handful of the most \nextreme and controversial nominations have been denied consent by the \nSenate. Until today only three have failed. One-hundred sixty-seven to \nthree. That record is in stark contrast to the more than 60 judicial \nnominees from President Clinton who were blocked by a Republican-led \nSenate.\n\n  Not only has President Bush been accorded more confirmations than \nPresident Reagan was during his entire first term, but the Senate also \nhas voted more confirmations this year than in any of the 6 years that \nRepublicans controlled the Senate when President Clinton was in office. \nNot once was President Clinton allowed 67 confirmations in a year when \nRepublicans controlled the pace of confirmations. Despite the high \nnumbers of vacancies and availability of highly qualified nominees, \nRepublicans never cooperated with President Clinton to the extent \nSenate Democrats have. President Bush has appointed more lifetime \ncircuit and district court judges in 10 months this year than President \nClinton was allowed in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, or 2000.\n  Last year, the Democratic majority in the Senate proceeded to confirm \n72 of President Bush's judicial nominees and was savagely attacked \nnonetheless. Likewise, in 1992, the last previous full year in which a \nDemocratic Senate majority considered the nominees of a Republican \nPresident, 66 circuit and district court judges were confirmed. \nHistorically, in the last year of an administration, consideration of \nnominations slows, the ``Thurmond rule'' is invoked, and vacancies are \nleft to the winner of the Presidential election. In 1992, however, \nDemocrats proceeded to confirm 66 of President Bush's judicial nominees \neven though it was a Presidential election year. By contrast, in 1996, \nwhen Republicans controlled the pace for consideration of President \nClinton's judicial nominees, only 17 judges were confirmed, and not a \nsingle one of them was to a circuit court.\n  In fact, President Bush has now already appointed more judges in his \nthird year in office than in the third year of the last five \nPresidential terms, including the most recent term when Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate and President Clinton was leading the country to \nhistoric economic achievements. That year, in 1999, Republicans allowed \nonly 34 judicial nominees of President Clinton to be confirmed all \nyear, including only 7 circuit court nominees. Those are close to the \naverage totals for the 6 years from 1995 to 2000 when a Republican \nSenate majority was determining how quickly to consider the judicial \nnominees of a Democratic President. By contrast, the Senate to this \npoint has confirmed 67 judicial nominees, including 12 circuit court \nnominees, almost double the totals for 1999.\n  These facts stand in stark contrast to the false partisan rhetoric by \nwhich Republican partisans have sought to demonize the Senate for \nhaving blocked seemingly all of this President's judicial nominations. \nThe reality is that the Senate is proceeding at a record pace and \nachieving record numbers. We have worked hard to balance the need to \nfill judicial vacancies with the imperative that Federal judges need to \nbe fair.\n\n  In so doing, we have reduced the number of judicial vacancies to 39, \naccording to the Republican Web site for the Judiciary Committee. Had \nwe not added more judgeships last year, the vacancies might well stand \nbelow 25. More than 95 percent of the Federal judgeships are filled. \nAfter inheriting 110 vacancies when the Senate Judiciary Committee \nreorganized under Democratic control in 2001, I helped move through and \nconfirm 100 of the President's judicial nominees in just 17 months. \nWith the additional 67 confirmations this year, we have reached the \nlowest number of vacancies in 13 years. There are more Federal judges \non the bench today than at any time in American history.\n  But, despite this record of progress, made possible only through good \nfaith effort by Democrats on behalf of a Republican President's \nnominees, and in the wake of the years of unfairness shown the nominees \nof a Democratic President, the Republican leadership has decided to use \npartisan plays out of its playbook as this year winds down.\n  Today we discuss the nomination of a candidate for a judgeship whose \nrecord already has been thoroughly examined and rejected by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Instead of debating and voting on the \nappropriations bills remaining to us for this year, including the bill \nthat funds the Justice Department, the State Department, the Commerce \nDepartment and the Federal judiciary. The Senate is being asked to \ndevote its time to the nomination of a candidate for a judgeship who \nhas demonstrated that his record as a lower court judge is not \ndeserving of a promotion. Instead of putting partisanship aside and \nbridging our differences for the sake of accomplishing what we can for \nthe American people, we are asked to participate in a transparently \npolitical exercise initiated by a President who claimed to want to be a \nuniter, not a divider. With respect to his extreme judicial \nnominations, President George W. Bush is the most divisive President in \nmodern times. Through his extreme judicial nominations, he is dividing \nthe American people and he is dividing the Senate.\n  The nominee we are being asked by the majority to consider today is \nCharles W. Pickering, Sr., currently a lifetime appointee on the \nFederal trial court in Mississippi. Originally nominated in 2001 by \nPresident Bush, this nominee's record underwent a thorough examination \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee and was found lacking. Rejected for \nthis promotion by the committee last year because of his poor record as \na judge and the ethical problems raised by his handling of his duties \nin specific instances, Judge Pickering's nomination was nonetheless \nsent back to the Senate this year by a President who is the first in \nour history to reject the judgment of the Judiciary Committee on a \njudicial nominee. This is the only President who has renominated \nsomeone rejected on a vote by the Judiciary Committee for a judicial \nappointment.\n\n  For a while this year this renomination lay dormant while Republicans \nplanned a followup hearing in their effort to reinterpret the facts and \nthe record. Every once in a while we would read a news account \nreporting that some Republican official or other would insist that the \nnomination was to resurface. Judge Pickering himself told an audience \nat a recently delivered speech that several hearings on his nomination \nwere scheduled and cancelled over the last year by the Republicans.\n  Recently, however, Republicans decided to forego any pretense at \nproceeding in regular order. They simply placed the name of Judge \nPickering on the committee's markup agenda and voted him out by means \nof their one-vote majority. There was no reason given for suddenly \nbringing this nomination to the fore again. There are plenty of \nnominees for the committee to consider whom it has not previously \nrejected. The committee had been told since January that a new hearing \nwould first be held, but none was.\n  So the timing has begged the question: Why Judge Pickering, and why \nnow? Why not move ahead to confirm well-qualified candidates, such as\n\n[[Page S13563]]\n\nRoger Titus or Gary Sharpe? Why expend the Senate's valuable time \nrehashing arguments about a controversial nomination that has already \nbeen rejected once before?\n  Some have charged that the timing of this vote has been arranged to \ncoincide with the gubernatorial election next Tuesday in Mississippi. \nThat is because for month, after month, after month--10 months, in \nfact--this renomination lay dormant, and Republicans seemed reluctant \nto bring it back to the committee, let alone to the Senate floor, for \nvotes.\n  Next Tuesday, the people of Mississippi will be voting for their \nGovernor in what newspapers report may be a pretty tight race. So now \nthat this nomination is back, coinciding so neatly with an election in \nwhich Haley Barbour, a savvy Republican political operative, is \nchallenging an incumbent Democratic Governor, Ronnie Musgrove, it does \nmake you wonder--especially when Governor Musgrove supports the \nPickering nomination. Let us hope that the Senate is not being used for \nthat partisan purpose.\n\n  Here we have a nominee defeated by the Judiciary Committee entirely \non the merits--a nominee who, as Democratic Senators have shown, has a \nrecord that does not merit this promotion, who injects his personal \nviews into judicial opinions, and who has made highly questionable \nethical judgments. We also have a record of misleading and unfair \narguments made by the nominee's supporters in the Senate in the wake of \nhis first defeat, examples of Republican Senators implying that \nDemocrats opposed the nominee because of his religion or region.\n  Some believe that the political calculation has been made to ignore \nthe facts, to pin some unflattering characterization on Democratic \ncandidates in Mississippi, and to count on cynicism and misinformation \nto rule the day. Introduce the red herring that opposition to Judge \nPickering's confirmation is tantamount to some kind of insult to the \nSouth, and hope nobody sees through that deception.\n  The poorly named ``Committee for Justice,'' an organization created \nto make the ugliest and most partisan political arguments in favor of \nPresident Bush's nominees, and an organization run by the first \nPresident Bush's White House Counsel, Boyden Gray, has already produced \ntelevision advertisements in support of Judge Pickering, designed to \nput pressure on Democratic Senators. How long before we see those ads \nrunning on Mississippi television stations? And out of whose offices \ndoes the ``Committee for Justice'' do its business? None other than the \nWashington lobbying firm still controlled by and named after the \nRepublican nominee himself, Mr. Haley Barbour. And now, as part of an \norchestrated campaign, Republican partisans in the House have also been \npressed into service for this misinformation campaign.\n  Another shameful thing we will hear today is a distortion of the \nhistory of the filibuster. Some Republicans would now have the public \nbelieve that a filibuster of a nominee is, in their words, \n``unprecedented.'' This is another deception. As some of these same \nRepublicans well know, they filibustered the nominations of Judge Paez \nand Judge Berzon on the floor of the Senate in 1999 and 2000, as they \nconceded at that time. By way of example, I note that several \nRepublicans currently serving voted against cloture, the motion to \nclose debate, after the Paez nomination had been pending before the \nSenate for more than four years. I have already noted that even after \nlosing the cloture vote, Republicans led by Senator Sessions moved to \nindefinitely postpone a vote on Judge Paez's nomination, and a number \nof Republican Senators currently serving voted to continue to block \naction on the Paez nomination in 2000. Yet some Republican Senators now \nclaim that it is unprecedented to filibuster or deny a circuit court \nnominee an up or down confirmation vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  Their filibuster of Judge Paez's nomination is just one example of \nRepublican filibusters of Democratic nominees. Others include Dr. David \nSatcher to be Surgeon General in 1998; Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon \nGeneral in 1995; Judge H. Lee Sarokin to the Third Circuit in 1994; \nRicki Tigert to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1994; \nDerek Shearer to be an Ambassador in 1994; Sam Brown to an ambassador-\nlevel position in 1994; Rosemary Barkett, a Mexican-American attorney, \nnominated to the 11th Circuit, 1994; Larry Lawrence, to be ambassador \nin 1994; Janet Napolitano at the Justice Department in 1993; and Walter \nDellinger to be Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \nCounsel at the Justice Department in 1993.\n  The nominations of Dr. Foster and Mr. Brown were successfully \nfilibustered on the Senate floor by Republicans. Similarly, the \nnomination of Abe Fortas by President Lyndon B. Johnson to the Supreme \nCourt of the United States was successfully filibustered by Republicans \nwith help from some Southern Democrats.\n  In addition, to the nominees of Democratic Presidents whose \nnominations were subject to sometimes fatal delay on the floor, \nRepublicans made an art form of killing nominations in committee so \nthat they would never even have a vote on the floor. According to the \npublic record, more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees \nwere defeated by willful refusal to allow them a vote, and more than \n200 executive branch nominees, including several Latinos, of President \nClinton met the same fate, with their nominations nixed in the dark of \nnight without any accountability. They were filibustered and never \nallowed votes on the Senate floor. I discussed this history in more \ndetail on February 26, 2003, in the Congressional Record.\n  In addition, in the Congressional Record on March 5, 2003, March 11, \n2003, and March 13, 2003, I summarized the history of filibusters of \nnominees. I also spoke on May 19, 2003, about the history of Senate \ndebate and the constitutionality of Rule XXII of the Senate rules. The \nfact of the matter is that many nominees have been blocked from \nreceiving votes throughout the Senate's history. For example, 25 \nSupreme Court nominees were not confirmed in the Senate's history. \nEleven of those nominations were defeated by delay, not by confirmation \nvotes on the Senate floor, including the nomination of Justice Fortas. \nSince the early 19th century, nominees for the highest court and to the \nlowest short-term posts have been defeated by delay, while others were \nvoted down. Not even all of President Washington's nominees were \nconfirmed, nor were many other Presidents', often for political or \nideological reasons. Filibusters and other parliamentary practices to \ndelay matters were known to the Framers. There was even a filibuster in \nthe first Congress over locating the capital.\n  It is too bad that it has come to a filibuster on Judge Pickering's \nnomination, but the White House's refusal to accept the Senate's advice \nhas made it inevitable.\n  Let me clearly outline, once again, the reasons why I cannot support \nthis nomination.\n  Judge Pickering was nominated to a vacancy on the Fifth Circuit on \nMay 25, 2001. Unfortunately, due to the White House's change in the \nprocess that had been used by Republican and Democratic Presidents for \nmore than 50 years, his peer review conducted by the ABA's Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary was not received until late July of \nthat year, just before the August recess. At that point the committee \nwas concentrating on expediting the confirmation hearing of the new \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who was confirmed in \nrecord time before the August recess, and other nominations.\n  As a result of a Republican objection to a Democratic leadership \nrequest to retain all judicial nominations pending before the Senate \nthrough the August recess, the initial nomination of Judge Pickering \nwas required by Senate Rules to be returned to the President without \naction. Judge Pickering was renominated in September, 2001.\n  Although Judge Pickering's nominations was not among the first batch \nof nominations announced by the White House and received by the Senate, \nin an effort to accommodate the Republican Leader, I included this \nnomination at one of our three October hearings for judicial \nnominations. The day before his hearing, held on October 18, the three \nSenate office buildings were evacuated because of the threat of anthrax \ncontamination. Rather than cancel the hearing in the wake of the \nSeptember 11 attacks and the dislocations due to the anthrax letters, \nwe sought to go forward.\n  Senator Schumer chaired the session in a room in the Capitol, but \nonly a few\n\n[[Page S13564]]\n\nSenators were available to participate. Security and space constraints \nprevented all but a handful of people from attending. In preparation \nfor the October 18 hearing, we determined that Judge Pickering had \npublished a comparatively small number of his district court opinions \nover the years. In order to give the committee time to consider the \nlarge number of unpublished opinions that Judge Pickering estimated he \nhad written in his 12 years on the bench, and because of the \nconstraints on public access to the first hearing, the committee \nafforded the nominee an opportunity for a second hearing.\n\n  I continued to work with Senator Lott and, as I told him in response \nto his inquiries that December, I proceeded to schedule that follow-up \nhearing for the first full week of the 2002 session. There was, of \ncourse, ample recent precedent for scheduling a follow-up session for a \njudicial nominee. Among those nominees who participated in two hearings \nover the last few years were Marsha Berzon, Richard Paez, Margaret \nMorrow, Arthur Gajarsa, Eric Clay, William Fletcher, Ann Aiken and \nSusan Mollway, among others. Unlike those hearings, some of which were \nheld years after the initial hearings, Judge Pickering's second hearing \nwas held less than 4 months after the first one and, as promised, \nduring the first full week of the following session.\n  I should note that the committee worked with Senators Lott and \nCochran from the time of the change in the majority to ensure swift \nconfirmation of other consensus candidates to the Federal bench, and as \nUnited States Attorneys and United States Marshals. On October 11, \n2001, the Senate confirmed United States District Court Judge Michael \nMills for the Northern District of Mississippi; on October 23, James \nGreenlee was confirmed as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District \nof Mississippi; and on November 6, Dunn Lampton received Senate \napproval to be the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of \nMississippi; Nehemiah Flowers was confirmed as the U.S. Marshal for the \nSouthern District of Mississippi on February 8 although he was not \nnominated until the week before adjournment last session; and Larry \nWagster was confirmed as the U.S. Marshal for the Northern District of \nMississippi on February 8 although he was not nominated until the day \nbefore adjournment the session before. We moved forward quickly that \nyear to fill all these crucial law enforcement vacancies in \nMississippi.\n  After determining that the number of Judge Pickering's published \nopinions was unusually low, and within a week of the first hearing, the \ncommittee made a formal request to Judge Pickering for his unpublished \nopinions. Judge Pickering produced copies of those opinions to us. They \ncame to the committee in sets of 100 or more at a time, including a \ndelivery of more than 200 the day before Judge Pickering's second \nhearing, and another 200 or more nearly a week after. It took three \nwritten requests from the committee and more than 3 months, but \neventually we were assured that all available computer databases and \npaper archives for all existing unpublished opinions had been searched.\n  We appreciated Judge Pickering and his clerks providing the requested \nmaterials. Other nominees had been asked by this committee to fulfill \nfar more burdensome requests than producing copies of their own \njudicial opinions. For example, 4 years after he was nominated to the \nNinth Circuit, Judge Richard Paez was asked to produce a list of every \none of his downward departures from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nduring his time on the Federal district court. That request required \nthree people to travel to California and join the judge's staff to \nhand-search his archives. Margaret Morrow, who was nominated to a \ndistrict court judgeship, was asked to disclose her votes on California \nreferenda over a number of years and required to collect old bar \nmagazine columns from years before. Marsha Berzon, who was nominated to \nthe Ninth Circuit, was asked to produce her attendance record from the \nACLU of Northern California. She was also asked to produce records of \nthe board meetings and minutes of those meeting so that Senators could \ndetermine how she had voted on particular issues. Timothy Dyk, \nnominated to the Federal circuit, was asked for detailed billing \nrecords from a pro bono case that was handled by an associate he \nsupervised at his law firm.\n  The Judiciary Committee only asked Judge Pickering to produce a \nrecord of his judicial rulings. They are public documents but were not \nreadily available to the public or the committee. Given the \ncontroversial nature of this nomination and the disproportionately high \nnumber of unpublished opinions, this request was appropriate as part of \nour efforts to provide a full and fair record on which to evaluate this \nnomination, as some Republican Senators have conceded.\n  I set forth this background, for the record, to ensure that no one \nmisunderstands how the committee went about evaluating Judge \nPickering's record. We did not engage in a game of tit-for-tat for past \nRepublican practices, nor did we delay proceeding on this nomination, \nas so many nominations were delayed in recent years. Rather, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee seriously considered the nomination, gave the \nnominee two opportunities to be heard, and promptly scheduled a \nCommittee vote. I also postponed a business meeting of the committee 1 \nweek at the request of the Republican leader, out of deference and \ncourtesy to him.\n  The responsibility to advise and consent on the President's nominees \nis one that I take seriously. I firmly believe that Judge Pickering's \nnomination to the Court of Appeals was given a fair hearing and a fair \nprocess before the Judiciary Committee. Those members who had concerns \nabout the nomination raised them and gave the nominee the opportunity \nto respond, both at his hearing and in written follow-up questions. In \nparticular, I thank Senator Schumer for chairing the October 18 hearing \nand for his fairness then and, again, at the February follow-up \nhearing. I commend Senator Feinstein for her fairness in chairing that \nfollow-up hearing. I said at the time that I could not remember anyone \nbeing more fair than she was that day, and I reiterate that today.\n\n  My regret is that she and so many Democrats on the Judiciary \nCommittee were subjected to unfair criticism and attacks on their \ncharacter and judgment after last year's committee vote defeating the \nnomination. I was distressed to hear that Senator Feinstein received \ncalls and criticism, as have I, that were based on our religious \naffiliations. That was wrong. I was disappointed to see Senator Edwards \nsubjected to criticism and insults and name-calling for asking \nquestions. That was regrettable. While Democrats and most Republicans \nhave kept to the merits of this nomination, it is most unfortunate that \nothers chose to vilify, castigate, unfairly characterize and condemn \nwithout basis some Senators who were working conscientiously to fulfill \ntheir constitutional responsibilities.\n  I would like to explain exactly what it is about Judge Pickering's \nrecord as a judge that so clearly argues against his confirmation. My \nfirst area of concern, which I raised at his hearing, is that Judge \nPickering's record on the United States District Court bench, as \nreflected by several troubling reversals, does not commend him for \nelevation. Instead, it indicates a pattern of not knowing or choosing \nnot to follow the law, of relying to his detriment on magistrates and \nof misstating and missing the law.\n  At his hearing, I asked Judge Pickering about many of these \nreversals. Looking at his record, I saw that he had been reversed by \nthe Fifth Circuit at least 25 times. And in 15 of those cases, the \nFifth Circuit reversed him without publishing their decisions, which \naccording to their rules and practice indicates that the appellate \ncourt regards its decision as based on well-settled principles of law. \nThose Fifth Circuit reversals on well-settled issues indicated that \nJudge Pickering had committed mistakes as a judge in either not knowing \nthe law or in not applying the law in the cases before him. That is \nfundamental to judging.\n  I asked Judge Pickering about a toxic tort case, Abram v. Reichhold \nChemicals. There he dismissed with prejudice the claims of eight \nplaintiffs because he held that they had not complied with a case \nmanagement order. That means he dismissed them and denied them all \nrights to bring the case. Again, the Fifth Circuit reversed Judge \nPickering's dismissal, holding he had\n\n[[Page S13565]]\n\nabused his discretion because he had not tried to use lesser sanctions \nbefore throwing the plaintiffs out of court permanently, without \nhearing the case on the merits. Again, the Fifth Circuit did not \npublish its reversal, indicating that it was settled law that a \ndismissal with prejudice was appropriate only where the failure to \ncomply was the result of purposeful delay or contumaciousness, and the \nrecord reflects that the district court employed lesser sanctions \nbefore dismissing that action. The Fifth Circuit found none of those \nconditions existed.\n  Approximately 3 years before reversing Judge Pickering in the Abram \ncase, it had reversed him on the same legal principle in a case called \nHeptinstall v. Blount. There the Fifth Circuit held that he had abused \nhis discretion in dismissing a case with prejudice for a discovery \nviolation without any indication that he had used this extreme measure \nas a remedy of last resort. And in its ruling in Heptinstall, the Court \ncited another of its previous rulings which stated the same principle \nof law. Thus, this was not a principle with which Judge Pickering was \nunfamiliar, he had been reversed on that basis once and committed the \nsame error again. This was binding Fifth Circuit authority of which he \nwas aware but chose not to follow.\n  At his hearing, I asked Judge Pickering to explain his ruling in \nAbram, especially in light of the prior reversal by the Fifth Circuit \non the same principle of law in another of his earlier cases. And while \nhe offered his recollection of the facts of the case, he offered no \nsatisfactory explanation of why he ruled in a way contrary to settled \nand binding precedent.\n  I asked Judge Pickering about a first amendment case, Rayfield \nJohnson v. Forrest County Sheriff's Department. This was a case in \nwhich a prison inmate filed a civil rights lawsuit claiming that a \njail's rules preventing inmates from receiving magazines by mail \nviolated his first amendment rights. In an unpublished one-paragraph \njudgment, Judge Pickering adopted the recommendation of a magistrate \nand granted the jail officials' motion to grant them summary judgment. \nIn other words, he said that the petitioner's claim of a first \namendment right to religious materials which he wanted to get through \nthe mail would be denied without further proceedings.\n  In its unpublished opinion, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, not \nconsidered by many a liberal circuit or one that coddles prisoners, \nreversed Judge Pickering and said that the inmate's first amendment \nrights had been violated. In explaining why he was wrong, the Fifth \nCircuit relied on and cited a published decision of its own from \nseveral years before, Mann v. Smith. In that case, they struck down a \njail rule prohibiting detainees from receiving newspapers and \nmagazines, holding that it violated the first amendment.\n\n  What was of concern here was that in the Mann case, the prison \nofficials had made much the same argument about fire hazards and \nclogged plumbing that were made by prison officials and accepted by \nJudge Pickering in the Johnson case. This was a case with almost \nidentical facts in his own circuit, what we call in the law a case ``on \nall fours'' with the Johnson case, and he did not cite it. Indeed, he \nturned his back on it and ruled the other way. We do not know whether \nhe did not know the law or did not follow it. At the hearing, Judge \nPickering admitted that the magistrate who had worked on the matter and \nhe had ``goofed'' and that he was unaware of the law and the recent, \nbinding precedent in his own circuit.\n  There are many other reversals, which continue to concern me for the \nsame reasons that I remain concerned about the Johnson case and about \nthe Abram case.\n  One of them is a case called Arthur Loper v. United States. This is \nanother case in which Judge Pickering was reversed in an unpublished \nFifth Circuit opinion, which again means that he violated ``well-\nsettled principles of law.'' This case dealt with an enhanced sentence \nthat the Fifth Circuit found he had imposed improperly on a criminal \ndefendant. When the defendant made a motion for the sentence to be \ncorrected or set aside, Judge Pickering denied the inmate's motion \nwithout giving him a hearing but without even waiting for the \ngovernment to respond. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit reversed Judge \nPickering's denial of the motion, noting that the government conceded \nthat the defendant was correct, and that an error had been made that \nprohibited the judge from imposing the sentence that he did. The Fifth \nCircuit also cited the statute under which the inmate filed his motion, \nwhich requires that under ordinary circumstances, the trial judge \n``shall . . . grant a prompt hearing'' and ``make findings of fact and \nconclusions of law'' on the petitioner's claims. The Fifth Circuit \ncriticized Judge Pickering for denying the motion in a ``one-page order \nthat did not contain his reasoning.'' And then the court went on to \nremind him that ``[a] statement of the court's findings of fact and \nconclusions of law is normally `indispensable to appellate review.' '' \nReading this case, I can only wonder why Judge Pickering did not abide \nby the statute and follow the law. Was he unaware of the requirements \nof the law or had he decided to follow his own view of what the law \nshould be on the matter?\n  There is another case in which Judge Pickering denied a petitioner's \nmotion for a hearing and missed controlling Fifth Circuit precedent. \nThe case was U.S. v. Marlon Johnson, in which a prisoner claimed that \nhis rights had been violated because of ineffective assistance of \ncounsel and asked that his guilty plea be set aside. The inmate claimed \nthat he had asked his counsel to file a direct appeal of his \nconviction.\n  Once again, in another unpublished opinion, the Fifth Circuit \nreversed Judge Pickering's denial of the inmate's motion, explaining \nthat the inmate's ``allegation that he asked his counsel to file a \ndirect appeal triggered an obligation to hold an evidentiary hearing.'' \nThis time the court of appeals relied on two of its own published \ndecisions for its conclusion, neither of which Judge Pickering \nmentioned in his ruling. Again, there was settled law in the circuit of \nwhich Judge Pickering was unaware of that he chose not to follow.\n  I know that something will likely be made of statistics purporting to \nshow that Judge Pickering does not have an unusually high ``reversal \nrate,'' and that other judges, some appointed by Democrats, have higher \nnumbers of unpublished reversals. Whatever these numbers purport to \nrepresent about the quantity of Judge Pickering's reversals--and I \ncannot vouch for them one way or another, not knowing their source or \nmeaning--they do not in any way excuse the poor quality of his \nunderlying opinions.\n  In addition to the many times that Judge Pickering has been reversed \nby the Court of Appeals for not knowing or following the law, there are \nnumerous instances of Judge Pickering misstating the law in cases that \nwere not appealed to a higher court and other cases in which he stated \na conclusion without any legal support.\n  An example is a statement by Judge Pickering in a case called Barnes \nv. Mississippi Department of Corrections. In an earlier go-round in \nthis case, the Fifth Circuit had reversed Judge Pickering on one point, \nand in this later opinion, he tried to explain that they did so, in \npart, on the basis of a 1993 Supreme Court case called Withrow v. \nWilliams. In particular, Judge Pickering wrote that the Supreme Court, \n``acknowledg[ed] in Withrow that the Miranda warning is not a \nconstitutional mandate.'' This was clearly a misreading of Withrow. I \ntrust that Judge Pickering would now acknowledge that the Supreme Court \nrecently made clear in Dickerson v. United States that the Miranda \nwarning is indeed derived from a constitutional mandate.\n  An example of an entirely unsupported conclusion comes in a case \ncalled Holtzclaw v. United States, where Judge Pickering presided over \na habeas corpus petition by a Federal petitioner whom he had convicted. \nAlthough this was the first habeas petition the prisoner had filed, \nPickering termed the petition frivolous. He regarded the petition as \nrestating claims that had already been made at trial. He dismissed it, \nand stated that he would order prison officials to punish the \npetitioner if he filed another frivolous petition. Judge Pickering also \nconducted a ``survey'' of cases within his district to determine how \nmany frivolous habeas petitions had been filed. However, in the section \nof his opinion dealing with the sanctions, he did not cite a single \nstatute, rule of procedure, local\n\n[[Page S13566]]\n\nrule or case as support for his decision. He stated:\n\n       In the future, this Court will give serious consideration \n     to requiring prison authorities to restrict rights and \n     privileges of prison inmates who file frivolous petitions \n     before this Court. Specifically, this Court gives notice to \n     Roger Franklin Holtzclaw that should he file another \n     frivolous petition for habeas corpus in the future, that the \n     Court will seriously consider and very likely order the \n     appropriate prison officials to restrict and limit the \n     privileges and rights of Petitioner for a period of from \n     three to six months and/or that the Court will also consider \n     other appropriate sanctions. Petitioner Roger Franklin \n     Holtzclaw is instructed not to file further frivolous \n     petitions.\n\n  Judge Pickering relied on no authority when he threatened to impose \nsanctions. This sort of action by a federal judge is disturbing. \nThrough consideration and passage of habeas corpus reforms in 1996, \nCongress has made very deliberate decisions about what sanctions ought \nto be imposed for frivolous and repetitious petitions. In Holtzclaw, \nJudge Pickering went beyond Congress' intent, and in what could be \ndescribed as judicial activism, threatens sanctions not contemplated by \nthe statute.\n  Another example of Judge Pickering's misunderstanding the basics of \nFederal practice and due process occurred in a case called Rudd v. \nJones, where he presided over a prisoner's civil rights claim before \nthe enactment of the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act. He properly noted \nthat the Supreme Court required that a pro se plaintiff is ``entitled \nto have his complaint liberally construed'' and admitted that, under \nthis rule, the complaint ``could be construed to state a cause of \naction.'' Nevertheless, he claimed that the complaint was stated in \nonly conclusory terms and decided that, ``based upon previous \nexperience with complaints that are couched in such a highly conclusory \nfashion, this Court is aware that plaintiffs in such cases are very \nrarely successful and very seldom come forward with any facts that \nwould even justify a trial.'' Therefore, on his own motion, the Judge \nordered the plaintiff to refile the complaint with more specific \nallegations or have the case dismissed before defendant had to respond. \nHe also did another ``survey'' to prove that Federal courts were \nwasting their resources on frivolous prisoner civil rights claims.\n  In forcing the plaintiff to refile, Judge Pickering entirely \ndisregarded Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, which requires only \nnotice pleading. This is a basic tenet of the American system of \njurisprudence, laid out by the Supreme Court in 1957 in Conley v. \nGibson.\n  In yet another case, Judge Pickering disregards the applicable law. \nIn United States v. Maccachran, he denied a habeas corpus petitioner's \nmotion for recusal without referring the matter to another judge. The \npetitioner filed affidavits stating that the judge had a personal bias \nagainst him. The relevant statute, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 144, states:\n\n       Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court \n     makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the \n     judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias \n     or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse \n     party, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but \n     another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding.\n\n  According to the statute, the Judge had to allow another judge decide \nwhether he should be recused or not. However, Judge Pickering did not \nfollow the law, and he decided the case himself, stating that the \naffidavit was false. In support of his decision, he cited the dissent \nin a Fifth Circuit case.\n  I am also concerned about Judge Pickering's rulings and the attitude \nthey signal on one of the most precious rights we have as Americans: \nvoting rights. In Fairly v. Forrest County, a 1993 case, Judge \nPickering rejected a ``one-person, one-vote'' challenge to voting \ndistricts that deviated in population by more than the amount deemed \npresumptively unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. He called the \ndoctrine of one-person, one-vote ``obtrusive,'' expressing skepticism \nabout the role of the Federal courts in vindicating rights under the \nVoting Rights Act in order to ensure meaningful participation by all \ncitizens in elections. In that case he also denigrates the value of \neach citizen's vote, arguing that the impact of any malapportionment \n``is almost infinitesimal'' because an individual voter holds so little \npower. While we have always known about the power and value of \nindividual votes, the last Presidential election has certainly taught \nall of us a new respect for the impact of each citizen. Judge \nPickering's disregard for such a vital American right and for the worth \nof each American's vote is extremely troubling.\n\n  Additional questions arise from another disturbing trend that emerges \nfrom a review of Judge Pickering's opinions, published and unpublished: \nhis habit of inserting his personal views into written decisions in \nsuch a way as to create a terrible impression of bias to categories of \nplaintiffs and hostility to entire types of claims before the Federal \ncourts.\n  One entire category of claims in which Judge Pickering demonstrates \nhostility and bias is employment discrimination actions. This is also a \ncategory of cases where an examination of the judge's unpublished \nopinions was crucial, because over the last 12 years on the Federal \nbench, he chose to publish only one of his employment discrimination \ndecisions. The remaining 12 were all among the unpublished decisions he \nproduced to the committee upon request after his first hearing last \nOctober.\n  What is significant in these cases are the times in the unpublished \nopinions that Judge Pickering went beyond merely ruling against the \nplaintiff to make unnecessary, off-the-cuff statements about all the \nreasons he believes plaintiffs claiming employment discrimination \nshould not be in court, and about the general lack of substance of \nclaims brought under the federal anti-discrimination statutes.\n  For example, in a 1996 case, Johnson v. Southern Mississippi Home \nHealth, Judge Pickering did not limit his opinion to a legal conclusion \nbased on the facts presented. Instead he made sure to note that:\n\n       The fact that a black employee is terminated does not \n     automatically indicate discrimination. The Civil Rights Act \n     was not passed to guarantee job security to employees who do \n     not do their job adequately.\n\n  In a case called Seeley v. Hattiesburg, No. 2:96-CV-327PG, (S.D. \nMiss. Feb. 17, 1998), where he should have limited himself to the facts \nand the law, Judge Pickering went on to comment about other matters \nrelating to race discrimination lawsuits apparently on his mind at the \ntime, writing that:\n\n       [T]he Courts are not super personnel managers charged with \n     second guessing every employment decision made regarding \n     minorities. . . The federal courts must never become safe \n     havens for employees who are in a class protected from \n     discrimination, but who in fact are employees who are \n     derelict in their duties.\n\n  In a credit discrimination case, Judge Pickering ruled on the case \nbefore him, and then included a lengthy lecture giving his very \npersonal views on anti-discrimination laws. He wrote:\n\n       This case demonstrates one of the side effects resulting \n     from anti-discrimination laws and racial polarization. When \n     an adverse action is taken affecting one covered by such \n     laws, there is a tendency on the part of the person affected \n     to spontaneously react that discrimination caused the action. \n     Sometimes this is true and sometimes it is not true. All of \n     us have difficulty accepting the fact that we sometimes \n     create our own problems. When expectations are created that \n     are incapable of fulfillment. . . Plaintiffs fail to \n     recognize that whatever your race--black, white, or other--\n     natural consequences flow from one's actions. The fact that \n     one happens to be protected from discrimination does not give \n     one insulation from one's own actions.\n\n  All of this unnecessary editorializing is ironic given Judge \nPickering's testimony at his first hearing in October of last year, \nwhen he explained to the committee why he has chosen to publish so few \nof his opinions over the years. He explained that, ``Americans were \ndrowning in information,'' and that there is, ``absolutely too much,'' \nlaw written down. He testified that his view is, ``[i]f you are not \nestablishing precedent, why make lawyers have to read,'' and that, \n``there is too much being written out there.'' ``If you don't have \nanything to add . . . that is going to be helpful to somebody,'' he \nsaid, ``you are just cluttering up the information.''\n  After reading statements like those I have just read, it seems to me \nthat a plaintiff with a discrimination claim, reading or knowing about \nJudge Pickering's hostile position toward anti-discrimination laws and \nclaimants, would be justified in fearing that\n\n[[Page S13567]]\n\nthe judge had already made up his mind.\n  Such blatant editorial comments, reflecting such a narrow view of the \nimportant goals of our Nation's civil rights law, and coming from the \npen of the one person who is supposed to guarantee a fair hearing and a \njust result, are troubling. Judges are not appointed to inject their \nown personal beliefs into a case.\n  Judge Pickering voiced another disturbing aspect of his views on \nemployment discrimination cases almost as an afterthought at his second \nhearing. In an attempt to explain his statements on the weakness of \nmany of these cases in response to Senator Kennedy, Judge Pickering \ndemonstrated a troubling misunderstanding of the role of Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission in reviewing employment cases. He \nstated that he believed that, ``the EEOC engages in mediation and it is \nmy impression that most of the good cases are handled through mediation \nand they are resolved. The cases that come to court are generally the \nones that the EEOC has investigated and found that there is no basis, \nso then they are filed in court.'' But this is completely wrong. The \nEEOC has a backlog of almost 35,000 cases. Both parties must agree to \nmediation. The commission lack resources. Yet Judge Pickering had \nalready prejudged employment discrimination cases filed in court as \nwithout merit. That kind of erroneous and unfair a generalization about \nthe strength of discrimination cases by a Federal judge responsible for \npresiding over them, was extremely disconcerting. That a Federal judge, \non the bench for a dozen years, could so misunderstand the legal and \npractical mechanisms behind employment discrimination cases was \ndisturbing.\n\n  While fair treatment in employment on the basis of race, sex, \nnational origin, age and disability is fundamental to the American \ndream, and crucial to a free and thriving economy, due process in \ncriminal proceedings can be a matter of life and death. Here, too, \nJudge Pickering has misunderstood the law and injected his personal \nviews.\n  In a 1995 case, Barnes v. Mississippi Department of Corrections, \nJudge Pickering presided over a habeas corpus case in which a prisoner \nclaimed that his confession was involuntary because he had been held in \ncustody for more than three days before being given an initial hearing \nby a magistrate. The judge denied the petition and the Fifth Circuit \nreversed his decision. After remand, he again denied the petition, \nstating that granting such a habeas petition ``is far more cruel than \ndenying to a known murderer a procedural right regardless of how \nimportant that right is.'' He cited the Bible and Coke's treatise to \nmake the point that habeas corpus should be limited to petitioners who \ncan prove actual innocence. That was a misstatement of the law in \ncontradiction to Supreme Court precedent. He further stated that, \n``[i]t is the fundamental responsibility of government to protect the \nweak from the strong, but it is also a fundamental responsibility of \ngovernment to protect the meek from the mean--the law-abiding from the \nlaw violating.'' He cited no legal precedent for this apparently \npersonal view that society's natural law rights to be free from crime \noverride the specific protections contained in the Bill of Rights.\n  In Drennan v. Hargett, a 1994 case over which Judge Pickering \npresided, a habeas corpus petitioner claimed that he had been denied \naccess to the courts and received ineffective assistance of counsel. He \nhad pleaded guilty to a charge of capital murder at age 15 and received \na life sentence. He claimed that his attorney had threatened him with \nthe gas chamber if he did not plead guilty and that his lawyer did not \nmake important motions, such as a motion to suppress his confession \nunder Miranda. He also claimed that he did not know how to obtain \nrelief from the courts for several years because of his youth and \nbecause his representatives misled him. Judge Pickering denied the \nclaim, and devoted a third of his opinion, three pages of a nine-page \nopinion, to arguing that habeas corpus should not be allowed unless a \npetitioner can prove actual innocence. In this unusual opinion, he \ncited the ninth and tenth amendments, the Preamble to the Constitution \nand the Declaration of Independence in support of his views, adding \nthat he believes the Bill of Rights is in tension with the preamble on \nthis point. Again, he cited no legal precedent for these odd and \nextremely personal views, almost entirely unrelated to the controlling \nlaw.\n  And in Washington v. Hargett, a 1995 habeas corpus case, Judge \nPickering rejected the plaintiff's request for DNA testing required to \nprove his actual innocence, but stated that an attempt to prove actual \ninnocence was, ``the only reason why this Court or any other federal \ncourt should be considering a petition for habeas corpus,'' so long \nafter the trial. While that may be Judge Pickering's personal opinion, \nit is undeniably contrary to Supreme Court and statutory law. They \nstate that a prisoner petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus is \ncontesting the legality of his detention. The Supreme Court explained \nas much two years before Judge Pickering decided this case.\n  Interestingly, whatever the answer to that question, in the same case \nwhere Judge Pickering declared the importance of actual innocence, he \ndenied a petitioner the only thing that could have possibly proved \nhis--a DNA test. It was in that case of Washington v. Hargett that \nJudge Pickering summarily rejected the plaintiff's motion for a DNA \ntest in order to prove his claim of innocence. The case involved a rape \nthat occurred in August 1982, before DNA was generally available and \naccepted in the courts. Yet the judge suggested in his opinion that DNA \ntesting was inappropriate simply because the request came in 1995--13 \nyears after the trial. As he put it:\n\n       Plaintiff had a fair criminal trial. He was, and is, \n     entitled to nothing more. He was not entitled to a perfect \n     trial. No such trial can be held. Plaintiff states that he \n     wants DNA testing now thirteen years later. He wants a new \n     trial. A new trial, now, 13 years later, would be much less \n     reliable than the one that occurred 13 years ago.\n\n  As Judge Pickering may well know, over the last decade, post-\nconviction DNA testing has exonerated well more than 100 people, \nincluding 11 who were awaiting execution.\n  I have introduced legislation that would, among other things, afford \ngreater access to DNA testing by convicted offenders. Senator Hatch and \nSenator Feinstein have also introduced bills to promote the use of DNA \ntesting in the post-conviction context. In recent weeks I joined with \nChairman Hatch and others in introducing a bill drawn from these \nearlier efforts. Attorney General Ashcroft has stated that ``DNA can \noperate as a kind of truth machine, ensuring justice by identifying the \nguilty and clearing the innocent.'' Judge Pickering appears in this \ncase to have created an exception to his own oft-expressed view that \nhabeas corpus should be considered would be to establish actual \ninnocence.\n  I have asked in a number of different cases and areas of the law \nwhether Judge Pickering was unaware of the law in different areas or \nwhether he was trying to impose his own views in spite of the law. \nAnother area of great concern to me--Judge Pickering's intervention on \nbehalf of a convicted criminal--raises this same fundamental question.\n  In this 1994 case, United States v. Swan, Judge Pickering presided \nover a case brought against three people accused of burning a cross on \nthe lawn of an interracial couple. Two of the defendants, one a \njuvenile and the other with significant mental disabilities, accepted \nplea bargains offered by the prosecution. The third, Daniel Swan, the \nonly competent adult of the three, was also offered a plea up to the \nlast minute, but chose to go to trial, and was convicted of all three \ncounts brought by the Government. The story of what happened next is \nwhat troubles me about Judge Pickering.\n  But before I get to that, I think it is important for us to \nunderstand exactly what the facts were in the case. From the trial \ntranscript we know that on a night in early January of 1994, three \nyoung men hanging out and drinking in front of a convenience store got \nthe idea to go and burn a cross on the lawn of a local family where the \nhusband, Earnest Polkey, was a white man, and his wife, Brenda, was \nAfrican American. Testimony at trial shows that two of the defendants, \nJason Branch, who was at the time a juvenile, and Daniel Swan, a \ncompetent adult, were the moving forces behind this idea. The third \nman, Mickey Thomas, had a very low IQ and mental difficulties. It \nreally\n\n[[Page S13568]]\n\nwas Branch and Swan who referred to the Polkey family using awful \nracial slurs, and together they cooked up this idea.\n  After deciding what they would do, they moved into action, and using \nDaniel Swan's pickup truck, his wood, his nails, his gasoline and his \nlighter, the three men constructed a cross, took it to the Polkey's \nfront lawn, leaned it up against a tree, and lit it on fire.\n  Not long afterward, the three were caught by the FBI and all three \nwere charged with the identical counts: 18 U.S.C. 241, conspiracy to \ndeprive victims of their civil rights, 18 U.S.C. 3631(a), intimidation \non account of race, and 18 U.S.C. 844(h)(1), the use of fire in the \ncommission of a felony. All three were also offered a plea bargain \nwhich would result in little or no jail time, and two of them took the \noffer. Two of them, Jason Branch, the minor, and Mickey Thomas, who has \na mental disability, took the deal. They decided not to roll the dice \nwith a jury, and to admit their responsibility for the crime. These \nkinds of deals happen every day. They permit the justice system to \nfunction, and they offer defendants opportunities to admit their guilt.\n  One of the defendants, Daniel Swan, didn't take the offer. Instead, \nMr. Swan, who had boasted to friends before he was caught that he would \nnever do any time even if he was caught, decided to take his chances in \nfront of a jury. Well, it was not a wise decision for Mr. Swan, because \nonce the jury heard the evidence that I recounted earlier, they \nconvicted him on all counts. And that is where Judge Pickering's \nunethical behavior comes in.\n  Instead of doing what the law required of him and sentencing Daniel \nSwan to at least the congressionally required mandatory minimum \nsentence of 5 years for his conviction of the use of arson in a felony, \nhe started to act like one of Daniel Swan's defense attorneys and to \nadvocate for him, insisting that the Justice Department drop the arson \ncharge so Swan could get a more lenient sentence.\n  Why would the Government drop a charge after having secured a \nconviction in such a terrible hate crime? Why would the prosecution \nagree to imposition of such a reduced sentence for someone already \nfound guilty by a jury of his peers? According to documents that the \nDepartment of Justice produced to the committee only minutes before \nJudge Pickering's second hearing was to begin, and documents that they \nagreed to make public in a heavily redacted form a week after that, \nJudge Pickering made them an offer that they could not refuse. He \nthreatened them. He threatened them with bad law--with a decision that \nwould have called into question the applicability of the arson charge \nto cross burnings. And he threatened to make--and presumably grant his \nown motion for a new trial for Mr. Swan--a motion for which there would \nhave been no basis in law.\n  He badgered them, ordering them in extraordinary terms to consult \npersonally with the Attorney General, to report on all prior Justice \nDepartment prosecutions for cross burnings, and to agree to dismiss an \nalready secured conviction, in the face of the fact that the law did \nnot permit the result he sought. And when the prosecutors, career \nassistants in the United States Attorneys Office and career prosecutors \nin Washington, refused to cave in to his bullying, Judge Pickering took \nthings a step further, and he called an old friend, then in a high-\nranking position at the Department of Justice. As he admitted in a \nletter to me and in testimony at his second hearing, Judge Pickering, \nunhappy with the answer he was receiving from those prosecuting the \ncase, called the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division, a \nfriend of long standing from Mississippi, to, as he explained it, \nexpress his frustration with the prosecutors. Judge Pickering insisted \nin his testimony to the committee that he did not ask his old friend to \ndo anything or take any action but he did not deny the contact.\n  This sort of contact with the Department of Justice during a pending \ncase is extremely troubling. These sorts of ex parte contacts are \nexpressly prohibited by every code of conduct and canon of ethics ever \nwritten, and for good reason. The credibility of our entire system of \njustice rests on the presumption that the conduct of every trial, \ncriminal or civil, is fair and above board, and that no one side has \nany real or perceived advantage. Judge Pickering's phone call and \nactions undermine that assumption in very disturbing ways.\n  Judge Pickering and his defenders in this matter will tell you that \nhe intervened in this case not because he took pity on Daniel Swan, a \nconvicted hate criminal, but because he was concerned about the \ndisparity among the sentences handed down to the three offenders. He \nblamed the Government for agreeing to lower sentences for the two \nparties who pleaded guilty and then ``recommending,'' as he \ninaccurately puts it, a higher sentence for the party who took his \nchances with a trial. He tried to give the impression that upon the \nsentencing for Mr. Swan he was surprised to learn about certain aspects \nof the crime and the defendants' behavior in them. But it is clear, \nupon examining the record, that none of the defendants was sentenced \nuntil after Mr. Swan's trial, until after all the testimony about their \nactions and relative culpability had been revealed in sworn public \ntestimony. Judge Pickering is the one who sentenced all these \ndefendants after having presided over the case.\n  Moreover, I know of no other criminal cases in which Judge Pickering \nintervened based on a concern about disparate sentencing or another \ncase in which he took action to avoid imposing a sentence based on a \nstatutory mandated minimum. His defenders will point to a few cases \nwhere he properly showed leniency within the law, but they are \ndifferent from this one. In those cases it is clear he had the legal \ndiscretion to reduce sentences, but those advocating this nomination \ncan point to no specific legal justification here.\n  The law has very real consequences, as this letter from Mrs. Brenda \nPolkey makes clear. It was sent to me last year when I was Chairman of \nthe Committee. Mrs. Polkey says:\n\n       My now-deceased husband, Ernest Polkey, and I were the \n     victims of a cross-burning at our home in Improve, \n     Mississippi in 1994. We had purchased the home in Southern \n     Mississippi while I was still active military and my husband \n     had retired from the military. The cross-burning case was \n     prosecuted by the Justice Department in Judge Charles \n     Pickering's court.\n       I write to express my profound disappointment in learning \n     of Judge Pickering's actions toward the defendant, Daniel \n     Swan. As you can imagine, my family suffered horribly as a \n     result of the conduct committed by Mr. Swan and the two other \n     defendants. My daughter actually saw the cross in our yard \n     the morning of the incident. I still have a photograph of the \n     cross that I took that morning to make sure that the crime \n     was documented properly.\n       The trial of Daniel Swan was extremely emotional for me and \n     my family. As a native Southerner, I had grown up in the \n     1960's with violent acts based on race, and I lost a member \n     of my family due to a racial killing. I never imagined that \n     violence based on racism would come my way again in the \n     1990's. We helped in the prosecution of the case, and I \n     testified at the trail. The local NAACP gave me a certificate \n     for my role in pursuing the case.\n       I experienced incredible feelings of relief and faith in \n     the justice system when the predominantly white Mississippi \n     jury convicted Daniel Swan for all three civil rights crimes. \n     I had hoped against hope that the jury would do the right \n     thing and convict Mr. Swan of this horrible deed. The jury \n     came to a guilty verdict on all three counts after only two \n     hours.\n       My faith in the justice system was destroyed, however, when \n     I learned about Judge Pickering's efforts to reduce the \n     sentence of Mr. Swan. I cannot begin to explain what his \n     actions have done to my longstanding opinion that we were \n     correct in helping to prosecute the case, in trying to \n     bring about justice and in trying to prevent hate crimes \n     from being committed against other persons. I am \n     astonished that the judge would have gone to such lengths \n     to thwart the judgment of the jury and to reduce the \n     sentence of a person who caused so much harm to me and my \n     family.\n       I am very much opposed to any effort to promote Judge \n     Pickering to a higher court. Respectfully yours, Mrs. Brenda \n     Polkey.\n\n  When I raise questions about this case and Judge Pickering's \ninvolvement in the case and suggest it violates every Canon of Judicial \nEthics, it is not just my opinion. It is the opinion of some of the \nNation's foremost legal scholars on judicial ethics. Let me read to you \nwhat some of them have said. Professor Stephen Gillers of the New York \nUniversity School of Law, one of the foremost, if not the foremost, \nlegal ethics experts in the country, told Senator Edwards after Judge \nPickering's hearings: ``Judge Pickering exceeded\n\n[[Page S13569]]\n\nhis powers as the trial judge in the Swan case in a way that undermined \ndecisions of the political branches of government. He then sealed the \nOrder that would have fully revealed his actions.''\n  The professor concludes that this is a violation of Canon 2A and \n3A(1) of the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges because of his failure to \nrespect and comply with the law or to be faithful to the law. He \nsubstituted his judgment not only for the judgment of the prosecutors, \nbut also for the judgment of the legislators, this Senate and the \nHouse, instead of sticking to his role as a judge. And by sealing the \norder that revealed his position, he made certain that no judicial \nreview of his actions could occur.\n  Professor John Leubsdorf, legal ethics professor and Judge Lacey \nDistinguished Scholar at Rutgers Law School, agreed with Professor \nGillers. Professor Leubsdorf, who has been studying and teaching Legal \nEthics for 25 years, has taught at Columbia, Cornell, and the \nUniversity of California-Berkeley's law schools, and has published \narticles in the Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Texas, NYU, Pennsylvania, \nMinnesota, and Cornell law reviews, could not have been clearer. After \nreviewing the judge's actions, he concludes that, ``[w]hatever Judge \nPickering's motives may have been, this was no way for a judge to \nbehave,'' and that he ``cannot escape the conclusion that Judge \nPickering departed from his proper judicial role of impartiality in the \nSwan case to become an advocate for the sentence he considered \nproper.''\n  Steven Lubet, a Professor of Law at Northwestern University Law \nSchool, director of the law school's Program on Advocacy and \nProfessionalism, and the author of numerous articles on legal ethics, \nreached much the same conclusion. He tells us that, ``Judge Pickering's \nactions raise serious questions under the Code of Conduct for United \nStates Judges. In particular, it appears that Judge Pickering initiated \na prohibited ex parte communication in violation of Canon 3A(4),'' and \nthat his, ``extended efforts to reduce Swan's sentence for cross \nburning appear to have compromised his impartiality, taking him nearly \ninto the realm of advocacy, thus implicating Canons 2A and 3A as \nwell.''\n  The ethics concerns raised by the judge's behavior in the cross \nburning case are not the only ethical problems Judge Pickering's \nnomination presents. There is also the very serious matter of his \nhaving solicited letters of support and having asked to review them \nbefore forwarding them to the Justice Department and to the Senate. As \nProfessor Gillers for NYU explains, this is a matter of grave concern. \nThe letter, which has been made a part of the record, recounts the \nvarious Canons of the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges implicated by \nthis behavior, and is just another reason why I cannot approve of Judge \nPickering's elevation.\n  I should note that Judge Pickering's behavior in this matter is \nsimilar to that of a nominee from more than 20 years ago, Charles \nWinberry. Nominated to the U.S. District Court in North Carolina by \nDemocratic President Jimmy Carter, Mr. Winberry's nomination was \ndefeated in the Judiciary Committee in 1980. Among the grounds on which \nI opposed this nomination, sent to the Senate by a President of my \nparty, were my objections to Mr. Winberry's having solicited letters \nfrom lawyers who would be appearing before him, if he were confirmed, \nand for asking for blind copies of those letters.\n  The increasing frequency of nominees campaigning for confirmation to \nthe federal bench is a troubling development and one that threatens the \nvery independence of our judiciary. I was concerned about it in 1980 \nand I remain concerned about it in 2002.\n  During the course of these proceedings, some have falsely contended \nthat Democratic Senators have called Judge Pickering a racist. That did \nnot happen and that criticism is a smokescreen to obscure the real \nproblems with this nomination. I attended the committee hearings on \nthis nomination and witnessed Democratic Senators asking questions and \nthe nominee being given opportunity after opportunity to make his best \ncase for elevation to the Fifth Circuit. Some have even insinuated that \nSenators who oppose this nomination are anti-Southern or anti-\nChristian, a smear that is as wrong as it is ugly. The talking points \ndistributed by the other side are partisan, political and intentionally \nmisleading. They have been accepted and repeated by some who have \nfailed to review the record. That is unfortunate.\n\n  I think the nominee's past views and actions during a difficult time \nin Mississippi's history were not irrelevant, but I based my decision \non his years on the bench and the record amassed and reviewed at our \nhearings.\n  So let me sum up for my colleagues what Judge Pickering's own record \nmakes clear. Judge Pickering's record is replete with examples of bad \njudging and is littered with cases that demonstrate a misunderstanding \nof the law in many crucial and sensitive areas. Judge Pickering's \nrecord shows a judge inserting his personal views into his judicial \nopinions and putting his personal preferences above the law. It is a \nrecord that does not merit this promotion to one of the highest courts \nin the land. Based on Judge Pickering's record, I will vote against \ninvoking cloture, and should cloture be invoked, I will vote against \nthis nomination.\n  If Judge Pickering's nomination is not ultimately successful, he will \nnonetheless remain a Federal judge of the Southern District of \nMississippi with life tenure. He will be responsible for presiding over \ncases and determining matters central to the lives and well-being of \nmany people in Mississippi and from elsewhere. He has served as a \nprosecutor, a State legislator, a local leader, and now as a Federal \njudge.\n  The oath taken by Federal judges is a solemn pledge to administer \njustice fairly to those who come before the court seeking justice. It \nextends to those who are rich or poor, white or black, Republican or \nDemocrat, without regard to gender or sexual orientation, national \norigin or disability.\n  Judge Pickering remains a very important and powerful person in \nMississippi. I understand that he may be the only Federal judge who \nsits in Hattiesburg. The judge's ability faithfully to discharge the \nduties of the office are important every day, on every case, with \nrespect to every claim and regarding every litigant. I bear him no \nmalice and wish him and his family well.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: How much time remains for the distinguished \nSenator from Utah and myself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts in just a moment.\n  I would hope, after this debate, we might start debating judicial \nnominees based on the facts and not on some of the innuendoes we have \nheard.\n  Mr. President, before I yield, I understand that again we are \nreserving the last 5 minutes for the distinguished senior Senator from \nMississippi; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. You asked for 5 minutes, but \nyou will not have 5 minutes after allotting the 3.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, \nwho is, after all, a model of propriety and fairness.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Judge Charles \nPickering on his record. I want to be absolutely clear about that. \nCharles Pickering has a disturbing record as a U.S. district court \njudge that simply does not qualify him for appointment to the Fifth \nCircuit. He has often been hostile to plaintiffs bringing civil rights \nclaims, he has questioned the value of important constitutional \nprotections such as ``one-person, one-vote,'' and he has tried to \nrestrict habeas corpus. His cases are filled with dicta and with \nexpressions of his own personal opinion. This all calls into question \nhis ability to enforce statutory and constitutional protections and his \njudicial temperament.\n  The States of the Fifth Circuit are among the poorest in the Nation. \nThey have a population that is 42 percent minority--the highest of any \ncircuit. For many years, the Fifth Circuit had a critical role in the \nNation's history in applying and interpreting the civil rights laws. \nNot long ago, the circuit was hailed for its courage in protecting\n\n[[Page S13570]]\n\nthe civil rights of African Americans. When Congress passed the 1964 \nCivil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, many State and local \ngovernments in the South resisted these measures. Federal judges such \nas Elbert Tuttle, Frank Johnson, and John Minor Wisdom helped to make \nthe promise of equality a reality by enforcing these landmark laws of \nour time. It is particularly important that a judge appointed to this \ncourt have a commitment to civil rights, to the constitutional \nsafeguards that protect all Americans, and to the rule of law.\n  I am disturbed by the rhetoric I have heard today that those of us \nwho oppose this nomination are a ``lynch mob.'' This rhetoric is a \nprofoundly cynical misuse of race and disregards the lessons that we \nshould all have learned from history. Those who cannot tell the \ndifference between a mob bent on murder and torture of an innocent \nindividual solely because of the color of his skin, on the one hand, \nand those of us in the Senate who seek to focus on genuine issues in \nJudge Pickering's record, on the other hand, needs a serious history \nlesson. Frankly, such a comparison is not only unfair, but it does an \ninjustice to those African Americans who suffered and died at the hands \nof real lynch mobs in the South, including in the State of Mississippi. \nThis is not a lynch mob, this is reasoned debate, and it is part of our \nconstitutional role of advice and consent to engage in such debate.\n  Judge Pickering's troubling record on civil rights and his injection \nof his personal opinion can be seen in his extraordinary intervention \non behalf of a cross-burning defendant. Pickering repeatedly pressured \nthe Federal Government to drop a charge against a convicted cross-\nburner to avoid having the defendant serve a congressionally mandated \n5-year minimum sentence. Pickering went so far as to threaten to order \na new trial, and to initiate an ex parte communication with a high-\nranking official of the Justice Department while the case was pending \nbefore him. Three ethics experts have written Senator Edwards stating \nthat this conduct violated the Code of Judicial Conduct.\n  I have spent a great deal of time thinking about this case, and I \nhave come to the conclusion that Judge Pickering's efforts to reduce \nthe defendant's sentence of a convicted cross-burner in United States \nv. Swan cannot be justified by the fact that other participants in the \ncross-burning received lesser sentences.\n  The other two participants in the cross-burning pled guilty and \ntherefore were not subject to mandatory minimum sentences. Mr. Swan was \ntried and found guilty of a crime that has a mandatory minimum \nsentence. This eliminated any sentencing discretion Judge Pickering \nmight have had under the law. Thus, this case raises the question of \nwhether Judge Pickering will follow the law even if he does not agree \nwith it.\n  Mr. Swan was an adult of average intelligence at the time of the \ncrime. By contrast, one of the other participants was severely limited \nin intelligence, with an IQ of 80, and the other was a juvenile. Thus, \nMr. Swan arguably bore greater responsibility for the hate crime. \nFinally, the materials used to build the cross, the gasoline used to \ndouse it, the truck used to transport it, and the lighter used to \nignite it all belonged to Mr. Swan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the 2 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Judge Pickering has a duty to follow the law and the \ncanons of judicial ethics whether or not he agrees with them. His \nfailure to do so in this recent case cast doubt on whether he would do \nso if confirmed to the Fifth Circuit.\n  In a letter to Senator Hatch, Judge Pickering admitted that he has \ndeparted downward from other mandatory minimum sentences only when the \nSentencing Guidelines allowed an exception.\n  I have heard some say that the fact that some black Mississippians \nmay support Judge Pickering should be enough to have him confirmed. \nMany black Mississippians, including those from organizations \nrepresenting thousands of African Americans in Mississippi have come \nout against Judge Pickering. The State's major African American Bar \nAssociation--the Magnolia Bar Association--has written a letter to the \nCommittee opposing Judge Pickering. He is also opposed by Eugene \nBryant, President of the Mississippi State Conference of the NAACP, \nwhich represents one hundred chapters of the NAACP.\n  Democrats have not smeared Judge Pickering's reputation by examining \nhis record. Judge Pickering has a complex legacy. On the one hand, he \ntestified against the KKK and has spoken in favor of racial \nreconciliation. On the other, he has opposed civil rights laws, and the \nconcept of ``one-person, one-vote'' under the Voting Rights Act. \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee have never said that he is a \nracist. But the committee has to determine what sort of judge he will \nbe, not what kind of neighbor he is or the nature of his historical \nlegacy. His 12 years as a district court judge provide us with a clear \nrecord that he is unwilling to apply or respect the law when he \ndisagrees with it, and I will vote against his nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 7 minutes 29 \nseconds, with 5 minutes being reserved for the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is that all the time left on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard my distinguished friends on \nthe other side say we have approved 167 judges but have rejected only 3 \nwith a filibuster. Actually, that is a little bit of an untruth because \nMiguel Estrada was filibustered and, of course, withdrawn. Priscilla \nOwen is presently being filibustered. Carolyn Kuhl, there is a \nthreatened filibuster on her. These are all circuit court of appeals \nnominees. William Pryor has already been filibustered. Charles \nPickering is being filibustered. This is a cloture vote to determine \nwhether we can even have the dignity of an up-or-down vote.\n  Leon Holmes has been threatened with a filibuster. Janice Rogers \nBrown has been threatened with a filibuster. Claude Allen has been \nthreatened with a filibuster.\n  The fact is, we have never had a filibuster before in the history of \nthe Senate, in the history of this country, with regard to judicial \nnominees.\n  I have heard a lot of comments about what a nice man Judge Pickering \nis and all of this; it is the record they disagree with. This is a man \nwho has been on the bench for a long time, and he would be a rare \nperson if you didn't find one or two cases with which you disagree. I \nhave to say that in all honesty, most of these arguments they have made \nare smokescreen issues and arguments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I can't right now because I have a limited time.\n  Every one of them can be answered. Let me tell the principal reason \nbehind this. After we voted Judge Pickering out of the committee a few \nweeks ago, we held a press conference. One of the people who appeared \nwith us at the press conference was one of the leading civil rights \nministers of the South, former head of the ACLU in Mississippi, really \none of the most respected people in the civil rights cause. His life \nhad been threatened. He came and spoke fervently for Judge Pickering. \nBefore he did, I got up and I said: This is all about abortion.\n  After he spoke, he came up to me and he said: Senator, as you know, I \nam pro-choice, but you are absolutely right. This is all about \nabortion. Let me make that case by putting up this chart, the National \nAbortion Rights Action League.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds for each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. The National Abortion Rights Action League, Pro-choice \nAmerica sent this out to everybody they could: ``Urge your Senators to \nstop anti-choice nominee Pickering'' because they know he is pro-life, \neven though he has agreed he will abide by the law. He will abide by \nRoe v. Wade.\n\n[[Page S13571]]\n\nHe will abide by the other abortion cases. That is what this is all \nabout. Frankly, I have it on impeccable information that that is what \nthis is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am sorry the Senator from Utah was unwilling to yield \nfor a question. He mentioned a threatened filibuster on Mr. Holmes. I \nassure him, we have cleared Holmes on our side. The Republicans could \nbring him up any time they want. There is no filibuster being \nthreatened over here. I don't know why they don't bring him up. Gary \nSharpe of New York, I don't know why they don't bring him up. These are \njudges they could bring up any time they wanted. They have been cleared \nfor a vote on this side. We may vote for or against them. But Mr. \nHolmes is not being filibustered. That is a mistake on the part of the \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Charles Pickering has been subjected to \nthe most intense and thorough scrutiny that I can remember any judicial \nnominee enduring since I have been in the U.S. Senate. After all of his \nopinions as a United States district judge have been read and reread \nand dissected, this is what the record shows.\n  In 13 years on the Federal bench, he has demonstrated a sense of \nfairness and good judgment that has reflected credit on the Federal \njudiciary. He has become known throughout our State as someone who is \nabove reproach, who is totally honest and honorable, and who applies \nthe law without regard to race, creed, or ethnicity in an intelligent, \nthoughtful, and sensible manner.\n  He is widely respected as a United States district judge. I have no \ndoubt that if confirmed by the Senate, he will serve with distinction \nand dedication on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  Before he became a Federal judge, Charles Pickering served ably in \nthe Mississippi State Senate and was the chairman of the Mississippi \nRepublican Party. He was elected county prosecuting attorney after he \nhad been engaged in the practice of law for only 2 years. When Charles \nPickering was nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of Mississippi in 1990, he was approved unanimously \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee. And he was confirmed unanimously by \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  As U.S. district court judge, he has become one of the highest rated \njudges in the Nation. Judge Pickering has received the highest rating \nfrom the American Bar Association. He has a lower reversal rate than \nboth the national and Fifth Circuit average. Mr. President, 99.5 \npercent of his cases have been affirmed or not appealed. Of those cases \nthat have been appealed, Judge Pickering has only a 7.9-percent \nreversal rate, which is 20-percent lower than the national average of \nthe Department of Justice, and two times lower than the average \ndistrict court judge in the Fifth Circuit.\n  He has been endorsed by the current president and the past 17 \npresidents of the Mississippi State Bar. He is endorsed by all of the \nmajor newspapers in Mississippi. He has also been endorsed by all of \nour State government officials who were elected statewide, including \nthe Democrats who serve as Governor, attorney general, and secretary of \nstate.\n  The people who know Charles Pickering the best are the residents of \nmy State, and they overwhelmingly support his confirmation as a court \nof appeals judge.\n  It is time to end this effort to discredit and demean this good man. \nIt is time for the Senate to do what is right and confirm this well-\nqualified and honorable nominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has all time been yielded back?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on leader time, I wish to make a few \nclosing statements with regard to this vote and this nomination.\n  In a few minutes, we will have the opportunity to vote on whether \nJudge Pickering, whom the Senate has once before confirmed to the \nFederal district court without blemish, can be given the simple \nfairness, the simple honesty of an up-or-down vote or whether he will \nbe denied that fairness.\n  The vote matters to many people because none of the President's \njudicial nominees has suffered more indignities and distortions than \nthis superbly qualified man, Judge Pickering.\n  Others in the past and over the course of the morning have spoken \nmuch more ably about the qualifications with regard to this superbly \nqualified individual, Judge Charles Pickering.\n  I know the passion of the two Mississippi Senators from whom we just \nheard. We heard Senator Lott speak about this man, and we heard the \nstrong support from Mississippi Senator Thad Cochran for this nominee, \nand we know of the hard work of the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Chairman Hatch--all of whom have worked so hard to bring \nthis nomination to the floor over the last 2\\1/2\\ years since he was \nfirst nominated by President Bush--again, 2\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  It had always been my hope over the last 10 months since I became \nmajority leader that we would be able to put much of the unfortunate \nhistory of the 106th Congress behind us when it came to judicial \nnominations. By that, I refer to the inaction on nominees in committee \nto their outright defeat in committee which denied the opportunity for \nall Senators to exercise the constitutional responsibility of advise \nand consent, and the ability and opportunity to vote up or down on \njudicial nominations. I think we have made huge progress over the \ncourse of this year in that regard, thanks to Chairman Hatch.\n  While in many ways we closed that chapter of Senate history, a new \nchapter has opened and, once again, I believe we will see it today, and \nthat is this unprecedented use of the partisan filibuster in the Senate \nto deny Senators the opportunity and the ability to have an up-or-down \nvote to speak clearly, and the way we have the power to do that is \nthrough our votes, either for a judicial nomination or against a \njudicial nomination.\n  What bothers me as majority leader is what that says about our \ninstitution and about the future of this institution. Many of us have \nspoken to this and have warned over the past several months about the \ndangers of departing from this 200-year history of the Senate, that \ntradition of precedent from which all of a sudden we are seeing this \ndeparture over the course of this year.\n  Today, in just a few minutes, once again we have a choice, an \nopportunity to move ahead and make progress and to discharge that \nconstitutional responsibility of an up-or-down vote. This is not only a \nvote to decide whether the Senate will say yes or no to a man who, as \nwe all know, is perfectly qualified, a good man, a man of high \nintegrity and character, an able jurist who we all know will bring \ncredit to the Federal appeals court.\n  To vote yes on cloture, in my view, is the latest referendum on \nwhether or not we want to reaffirm our history in this body, the \nSenate, whether or not we want to shut this new chapter of \nunprecedented delay and destruction, whether or not we want to return \nthe Senate to the well-worn path that it has tried over the last 200 \nyears but from which over the course of this year we seem to be \ndeviating, a path of men and women coming to this body and by their \nvote being able to take direct responsibility of either confirming or \nrejecting a nomination.\n\n  I represent the State of Tennessee. Right now I represent my party as \nRepublican leader. In addition, I, as majority leader, believe I have a \nresponsibility to this entire body. Together we look to the past and we \nbuild for the future. I appeal once again to my colleagues to remember \nthe history we have as stewards, as servants to this institution; that \nwe remember the responsibilities charged to us by the Constitution, \nresponsibilities of advise and consent, and vote aye on cloture, and \nthen vote up or down but vote one way or another on the nomination of \nCharles Pickering. To do any less than that does fail the history we \nhave had the privilege to recognize and be part of. Indeed, it adds one \nmore obstacle to the progress we could make as we go forward.\n  Finally, it does ensure that with this new course foisted on the \nSenate, we will have to meet that radical departure from 200 years of \nhistory with responses that will reestablish a more regular order of \naction in the future.\n\n[[Page S13572]]\n\n  Mr. President, I close by simply saying I urge our colleagues to \nsupport an opportunity for an up-or-down vote--that is all we ask--on \nJudge Charles Pickering.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Will the majority leader yield for a question not related \nto the Pickering nomination?\n  Mr. FRIST. Through the Chair, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we were originally going to have a vote on \nthe global warming issue. It would have been about 12:45 p.m. This will \nnecessitate that vote occurring around 1:15 p.m., but under the regular \nprocess here, on Thursdays we do not vote during the hour of 1 p.m. to \n2:15 p.m. I wonder if the leader will be able to at this time indicate \nthat the managers of the Healthy Forests issue should be here about \n1:15 p.m., or thereabouts, so they can start on that issue prior to \nvoting on the global warming issue, which I hope can occur at 2 o'clock \nbecause there are a number of people on our side who need to vote on \nthat. I hope the leader understands what I am saying.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do. Let me talk to the managers before \nactually agreeing to anything. I have not talked with them about the \nscheduling. Before committing to a schedule, let me make an \nannouncement right after this vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote be vitiated and that the Senate immediately proceed to a vote to \nconfirm the nomination of Judge Charles Pickering to the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now on global warming. Because of \nscheduling problems, the managers of the bill, Senator Inhofe, Senator \nMcCain, and Senator Lieberman, have agreed to each give up 15 minutes \non their side. Therefore, the vote will occur at 12:45. I ask unanimous \nconsent that be the case--that the vote occur at 12:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Under the previous order, there are 90 minutes equally divided for \ndebate between the chairman and the Senator from Connecticut, or their \ndesignees.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to support the Climate Stewardship \nAct offered by Senators Lieberman and McCain and to cosponsor this \naggressive plan to fight global warming.\n  When President Bush walked away from the Kyoto Protocol negotiations \nin March 2001, he promised the American people he would come up with an \nalternative. More than 2 years later, the President has yet to deliver \non his promise and we simply cannot wait any longer to start making \nprogress.\n  Here in the Senate we have a worthy plan that will cut greenhouse gas \nemissions. I want to applaud Senators Lieberman and McCain for \npresenting this meaningful and comprehensive plan.\n  The McCain-Lieberman bill will require mandatory greenhouse gas \nemissions reductions in the United States from broad sectors of our \neconomy. Rather than just aiming to limit industrial emissions--as \nother plans have done--this legislation will require emissions \nreductions from four major sectors of the economy: electric utilities; \nindustrial plans; transportation; and large commercial facilities. \nThese four sectors contribute 85 percent of the greenhouse gases \nproduced in America.\n  The McCain-Lieberman legislation relies on a national ``cap and \ntrade'' system to reduce the air pollutants that contribute to climate \nchange. Many of my colleagues are familiar with this approach. It was \nfirst used on a national scale to combat acid rain under Title IV of \nthe Clean Air Act\n\n[[Page S13573]]\n\nAmendments of 1990. A cap and trade system establishes an overall total \nlimit on emissions and then allows pollution sources to trade emissions \nallowances. It gives participants the flexibility of the marketplace, \nand it works.\n  In fact, the acid rain program has reduced sulfur dioxide emissions \nfrom power plants--and it has done it at less than a quarter of the \npredicted cost to industry.\n  The McCain-Lieberman program will mandate that by 2010, the four \nsectors involved must reduce their emissions to 2000 levels. This is a \nmeaningful and substantial reduction in emissions--a 5 percent \nreduction over the next 7 years.\n  Some critics suggest that you can't ``grow the economy'' without \nemitting more greenhouse gases. We know that is not true. As the acid \nrain program proved, the cap and trade system works well.\n  There were nay-sayers in 1990, and they were proven wrong. There are \nnay-sayers now, and we must prove them wrong again.\n  This is also an opportunity for American companies to get ahead of \ntrends that we know are coming. We know that the future of energy \nproduction lies in renewable energy and in alternatives to fossil \nfuels. I want American workers to lead the way, and I want American \ncompanies to share in the benefits.\n  It is projected that over the next 20 years, $10-$20 trillion will be \nspent globally on new energy technologies. This is an enormous market, \nand much of the investment will take place outside of the U.S., in \nplaces such as China. I want American companies to sell the \ntechnologies that will be needed and used throughout the world. By \npassing this legislation, we will give American companies incentives to \npursue new, clean energy technologies. And new technologies mean new \njobs--especially compared to older energy sources.\n  Today, for every 1 percent of market share, renewable energy \ntechnologies generate 12,500 jobs. By the same measure, the coal \nindustry only generates 3,000 jobs.\n  So this new technology holds a lot of promise in helping American \ncompanies and the American economy.\n  Let me mention briefly the President's so-called clear skies plan. \nThis administration's approach to global climate change has been to \nfocus on reducing greenhouse gas intensity. That is the ratio of carbon \nemission to gross domestic product. What most people do not know is \ngreenhouse intensity is already declining. As the economy modernizes, \nit naturally becomes more efficient in terms of energy use, so when the \nPresident says he wants to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 18 \npercent over the next 10 years with his Clear Skies Initiative, we \nshould ask how much would the intensity decrease over the next 10 years \nwithout the Clear Skies Initiative.\n  The answer is stunning and underscores how little this administration \nreally wants to do to reverse global warming. According to CRS, \ngreenhouse gas intensity is projected to fall by over 14 percent over \nthe next 10 years under current environmental regulations. The \nPresident's proposal is nearly as weak as existing law. President Bush \nthinks the Federal Government's primary climate change goal should be \nto encourage voluntary measures to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by \nonly 4 percent over the next decade.\n  That is an utterly irresponsible approach to global warming. Our \ncountry should be taking an aggressive lead on reducing pollution. I am \nconfident by using market-oriented strategies and new technologies, \nAmerican ingenuity can find ways to reduce emissions without harming \nthe economy. As I mentioned earlier, it will help our economy.\n  The threat of global warming is real. The Pacific Northwest stands to \nlose much from climate change from increasing severe storms to rising \nsea levels to negative impacts on our forests, our coasts, our salmon, \nand our agriculture. Those resources define the quality of life where I \nlive.\n  In Washington State, increasing temperatures over the next decades \ncould cause salmon in Puget Sound to migrate north. It could cause some \ncrops to shift their natural habitats into Canada.\n  The western governors understand this. In September, the governors of \nCalifornia, Oregon, and my home State of Washington got together to \ncurb greenhouse gas emissions by promoting tougher emissions standards \nfor new power plants.\n  Governors and legislatures in the Northeast have taken similar \nmeasures.\n  Soon the Nation will face a patchwork of regional regulations, making \nit costly and cumbersome for industries to comply.\n  We in Congress need to take action since this White House has failed \nto act. It's time for a real policy to reduce our impacts on the global \nclimate.\n  We know that a clean environment contributes to the health and \nquality of life for every Washingtonian and for every American. The \nMcCain-Lieberman bill is an important first step.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed a New York Times article that \nreported on the regional regulations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 29, 2003]\n\n  The Warming Is Global but the Legislating, in the U.S., Is All Local\n\n                          (By Jennifer 8. Lee)\n\n       Washington, Oct. 28--Motivated by environmental and \n     economic concerns, States have become the driving force in \n     efforts to combat global warming even as mandatory programs \n     on the Federal level have largely stalled.\n       At least half of the States are addressing global warming, \n     whether through legislation, lawsuits against the Bush \n     administration or programs initiated by governors.\n       In the last three years, State legislatures have passed at \n     least 29 bills, usually with bipartisan support. The most \n     contentious is California's 2002 law to set strict limits for \n     new cars on emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas that \n     scientists say has the greatest role in global warming.\n       While few of the State laws will have as much impact as \n     California's, they are not merely symbolic. In addition to \n     caps on emissions of gases like carbon dioxide that can cause \n     the atmosphere to heat up like a greenhouse, they include \n     registries to track such emissions, efforts to diversify fuel \n     sources and the use of crops to capture carbon dioxide by \n     taking it out of the atmosphere and into the ground.\n       Aside from their practical effects, supporters say, these \n     efforts will put pressure on Congress and the administration \n     to enact Federal legislation, if only to bring order to a \n     patchwork of State laws.\n       States are moving ahead in large part to fill the vacuum \n     that has been left by the Federal Government, said David \n     Danner, the energy adviser for Gov. Gary Locke of Washington.\n       ``We hope to see the problem addressed at the Federal \n     level,'' Mr. Danner said, ``but we're not waiting around.''\n       There are some initiatives in Congress, but for the moment \n     even their backers acknowledge that they are doomed, given \n     strong opposition from industry, the Bush administration--\n     which favors voluntary controls--and most Congressional \n     Republicans.\n       This week, the Senate is scheduled to vote on a proposal to \n     create a national regulatory structure for carbon dioxide. \n     This would be the first vote for either house on a measure to \n     restrict the gas.\n       The proposal's primary sponsors, Senator John McCain, \n     Republican of Arizona, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, \n     Democrat of Connecticut, see it mainly as a way to force \n     senators to take a position on the issue, given the measure's \n     slim prospects.\n       States are acting partly because of predictions that global \n     warming could damage local economies by harming agriculture, \n     eroding shorelines and hurting tourism.\n       ``We're already seeing things which may be linked to global \n     warming here in the state,'' Mr. Danner said. ``We have low \n     snowpack, increased forest fire danger.''\n       Environmental groups and officials in state governments say \n     that energy initiatives are easier to move forward on the \n     local level because they span constituents--industrial and \n     service sectors, Democrat and Republican, urban and rural.\n       While the coal, oil and automobile industries have big \n     lobbies in Washington, the industry presence is diluted on \n     the state level. Environmental groups say this was crucial to \n     winning a legislative battle over automobile emissions in \n     California, where the automobile industry did not have a long \n     history of large campaign donations and instead had to rely \n     on a six-month advertising campaign to make its case.\n       Local businesses are also interested in policy decisions \n     because of concerns about long-term energy costs, said \n     Christopher James, director of air planning and standards for \n     the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. As a \n     result, environmental groups are shifting their efforts to \n     focus outside Washington.\n       Five years ago the assumption was that the climate treaty \n     known as the Kyoto Protocol was the only effort, in town, \n     said Rhys\n\n[[Page S13574]]\n\n     Roth, the executive director of Climate Solutions, which \n     works on global warming issues in the Pacific Northwest \n     states. But since President Bush rejected the Kyoto pact in \n     2001, local groups have been emerging on the regional, state \n     and municipal levels.\n       The Climate Action Network, a worldwide conglomeration of \n     nongovernment organizations working on global warming, \n     doubled its membership of state and local groups in the last \n     two years.\n       The burst of activity is not limited to the states with a \n     traditional environmental bent.\n       At least 15 states, including Texas and Nevada, are forcing \n     their state electric utilities to diversify beyond coal and \n     oil to energy sources like wind and solar power.\n       Even rural states are linking their agricultural practices \n     to global warming. Nebraska, Oklahoma and Wyoming have all \n     passed initiatives in anticipation of future greenhouse-gas \n     emission trading, hoping they can capitalize on their forests \n     and crops to capture carbon dioxide during photosynthesis.\n       Cities are also adopting new energy policies. San \n     Franciscans approved a $100 million bond initiative in 2001 \n     to pay for solar panels for municipal buildings, including \n     the San Francisco convention center.\n       The rising level of state activity is causing concern among \n     those who oppose carbon dioxide regulation.\n       ``I believe the states are being used to force a federal \n     mandate,'' said Sandy Liddy Bourne, who does research on \n     global warming for the American Legislative Exchange Council, \n     a group contending that carbon dioxide should not be \n     regulated because it is not a pollutant. ``Rarely do you see \n     so many bills in one subject area introduced across the \n     country.''\n       The council started tracking state legislation, which they \n     call son-of-Kyoto bills, weekly after they noticed a \n     significant rise in greenhouse-gas-related legislation two \n     years ago. This year, the council says, 24 states have \n     introduced 90 bills that would build frameworks for \n     regulating carbon dioxide. Sixty-six such bills were \n     introduced in all of 2001 and 2002.\n       Some of the activity has graduated to a regional level. \n     Last summer, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York invited 10 \n     Northeastern states to set up a regional trading network \n     where power plants could buy and sell carbon dioxide credits \n     in an effort to lower overall emissions. In 2001, six New \n     England states entered into an agreement with Canadian \n     provinces to cap overall emissions by 2010. Last month, \n     California, Washington and Oregon announced that they would \n     start looking at shared strategies to address global warming.\n       To be sure, some states have decided not to embrace \n     policies to combat global warming. Six--Alabama, Illinois, \n     Kentucky, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wyoming--have \n     explicitly passed laws against any mandatory reductions in \n     greenhouse gas emissions.\n       ``My concern,'' said Ms. Bourne, ``is that members of \n     industry and environment groups will go to the federal \n     government to say: `There is a patchwork quilt of greenhouse-\n     gas regulations across the country. We cannot deal with the \n     50 monkeys. We must have one 800-pound gorilla. Please give \n     us a federal mandate.' '' Indeed, some environmentalists say \n     this is precisely their strategy.\n       States developed their own air toxics pollution programs in \n     the 1980's, which resulted in different regulations and \n     standards across the country. Industry groups, including the \n     American Chemistry Council, eventually lobbied Congress for \n     federal standards, which were incorporated into the 1990 \n     Clean Air Act amendments.\n       A number of states are trying to compel the federal \n     government to move sooner rather than later. On Thursday, 12 \n     states, including New York, with its Republican governor, and \n     three cities sued the Environmental Protection Agency for its \n     recent decision not to regulate greenhouse-gas pollutants \n     under the Clean Air Act, a reversal of the agency's previous \n     stance under the Clinton administration.\n       ``Global warming cannot be solely addressed at the state \n     level,'' said Tom Reilly, the Massachusetts attorney general. \n     ``It's a problem that requires a federal approach.''\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McCain-\nLieberman amendment. I would like to begin by thanking the \ndistinguished Senators from Arizona and Connecticut for their work on \nthis bill. Their efforts are moving the Senate and the country forward \non this very important issue.\n  I strongly believe that it is time for the United States to take real \naction against climate change. The science is solid. It is time to stop \ndebating whether to do something and start discussing how to do it.\n  This modest bill is an affordable and crucial step forward. It is \ntime to act.\n  The McCain-Lieberman amendment would create the infrastructure needed \nto track and trade greenhouse gas emissions and require the U.S. to \nreturn to year 2000 emissions levels by 2010.\n  The amendment would give us 7 years to reach year 2000 level \nemissions. Because of the recession, our national emissions actually \nwent down in 2001. So we are actually at about year 2000 levels right \nnow.\n  So we have 7 years just to get back to our current level of \nemissions. This is a modest step but it is a step forward.\n  As the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, the U.S. has a duty to \nact.\n  With only 4 percent of the world's population, we produce 20 percent \nof the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Much of the world is already \nreducing their greenhouse gas emissions. The world is counting on us to \ndo the same.\n  If we continue to ignore the problem, it will only get worse. If we \nwait, we will need to make bigger cuts in our emissions and we will \nhave less time. Action will become more expensive rather than less.\n  I understand that many people are concerned about the costs of any \nefforts to reduce emissions. I also want to make sure that whatever \nprogram we wind up with is a good deal for the American people.\n  I strongly believe that the cap and trade program in this bill is a \ngood deal for America.\n  Concerns about the cost of action are important.\n  But I want to ask my colleagues to consider very carefully the cost \nof doing nothing. The evidence is getting stronger and stronger that \nclimate change will be very expensive.\n  According to the best available research, not acting will cost my \nState dearly. Our large population, our geography, and especially our \nreliance on snow runoff for water make California extremely vulnerable \nto global warming.\n  Frankly, the models predicting the impacts of global warming on \nCalifornia are frightening.\n  Climate change threatens the agricultural and natural resource \nindustries that are central to California's economy and quality of \nlife.\n  As the Senate knows, I am especially concerned about the future of \nCalifornia's water supply. More than 36 million people live in \nCalifornia right now, and we expect to have 50 million people by 2020.\n  Even without climate change, it would be a struggle to supply enough \nwater for all of these people. But report after report indicates that \nclimate change will further threaten a water supply that is already \ntight.\n  Models from NASA, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and the \nUnion of Concerned Scientists all indicate that climate change is \nlikely to increase winter rain and decrease snowfall in California.\n  More winter rain means winter flooding. Less snow means less water \nfor the rest of the year.\n  But California's natural environment as we know it depends on gradual \nrunoff from snow.\n  Furthermore, we have spent billions of dollars on water \ninfrastructure in California that depends on this runoff. And yet we \nalready struggle to provide enough water for our farms, our cities, and \nour fish and wildlife.\n  As my colleagues know, I have worked hard to plan for the future of \nCalifornia's water supply. Climate change threatens even to make those \nplans insufficient.\n  We are already seeing alarming changes. According to scientists at \nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the past century has seen a \ndecline in spring and summer runoff in some California streams.\n  In 1910, half of the Sacramento River's annual runoff took place \nbetween April and July.\n  Today, that number is closer to 35 percent and is continuing to \ndecline. We can no longer count on this runoff.\n  We are also already seeing a rise in sea level. Average sea level has \nrisen considerably in San Francisco since 1850, with the most marked \nincrease occuring since 1925. My colleagues from coastal states \nunderstand the potential cost of rising sea levels to coastal \ncommunities.\n  We are seeing other effects of climate change throughout the world:\n  The Union of Concerned Scientists has found that the global sea level \nhas risen about three times faster over the past 100 years than the \nprevious 3,000 years.\n  In July, the World Meteorological Organization released an \nunprecedented warning about extreme weather events. According to the \norganization's press release, ``recent scientific assessments\n\n[[Page S13575]]\n\nindicate that, as the global temperatures continue to warm due to \nclimate change, the number and intensity of extreme events might \nincrease.''\n  According to the World Meteorological Organization, the United States \nexperienced 562 tornadoes in May of this year. The tornadoes killed 41 \npeople. This was 163 more tornadoes than the United States had ever \nexperienced in one month.\n  We are seeing similar record extremes around the world. These extreme \nweather events are a predicted result of climate change.\n  Climate change is also affecting some of our most treasured places. \nLast November, the Los Angeles Times published an article about the \nvanishing glaciers of Glacier National Park in Montana. Over a century \nago, 150 of these magnificent glaciers could be seen on the high cliffs \nand jagged peaks of the surrounding mountains of the park. Today, there \nare only 35. And the 35 glaciers that remain today are disintegrating \nso quickly that scientists estimate the park will have no glaciers in \n30 years.\n  Closer to home for me, on October 12 of this year, the Los Angeles \nTimes reported that glaciers in the Sierra Nevada are disappearing. \nMany of these glaciers have been there for the last thousand years.\n  We are seeing similar melting around the world, from the snows of Mt. \nKilimanjaro in Tanzania to the ice fields beneath Mt. Everest in the \nHimalayas.\n  Dwindling glaciers offer a clear and visible sign of climate change \nin America and the rest of the world.\n  We are already seeing some of these changes. The science tells us to \nexpect even more. The evidence that climate change is real is \noverwhelming: including reports from the National Academies of Science, \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and even the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  To quote a CBO report released in May, ``scientists generally agree \nthat continued population growth and economic development over the next \ncentury will result in substantially more greenhouse gas emissions and \nfurther warming unless actions are taken to control those emissions.''\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the \nEarth's average temperature could rise by as much as 10 degrees in the \nnext 100 years--the most rapid change in 10,000 years.\n  The latest evidence also indicates that climate change is likely to \nlead to more forest fires. Models indicate that warming will lead to \ndryer conditions in many places. Furthermore, warming is allowing bark \nbeetles to spread farther north and to higher altitudes than ever \nbefore.\n  In parts of Alaska, bark beetles now have two generations per year \ninstead of one, leading to drastic increases in population and \ndestruction of our forests.\n  As we know too well, dry conditions and insect kill makes our forests \ninto tinder boxes.\n  I strongly believe that we have the evidence that we need in order to \nact. Not addressing climate change will cost us dearly.\n  Yet, so far, the United States has not really taken action against \nclimate change. Not only are we not part of the Kyoto Protocol, but the \nadministration refuses to take part in shaping another solution. This \nis a big mistake.\n  We emit more greenhouse gases than any nation on Earth. The world is \ncounting on us, and we have a responsibility to help.\n  We should be a leader--not an obstacle--when it comes to combating \nglobal warming. In his speech to the joint session of Congress--which \nmany of us cited as among the best we have ever heard--British Prime \nMinister Tony Blair challenged the U.S. to take action now. Mr Blair \nsaid:\n\n       Climate change, deforestation, the voracious drain on \n     natural resources cannot be ignored. Unchecked, these forces \n     will hinder the economic development of the most vulnerable \n     nations first and ultimately all nations.\n\n  Mr. Blair went on to say:\n\n       We must show the world that we are willing to step up to \n     these challenges around the world and in our own backyards. \n     If this seems a long way from the threat of terror and \n     weapons of mass destruction, it is only to say again that the \n     world security cannot be protected without the world's heart \n     being won. So America must listen as well as lead.\n\n  Prime Minister Blair is right. If we fail to act now, we will face \ndevastating consequences in the future. We will impose those same \nconsequences on future Americans and the rest of the world.\n  Continued failure to act will also further strain our relationships \nwith our allies. These relationships are already tense enough.\n  The administration has said that we need more research before acting. \nI agree that we should continue to study climate change. But we also \nneed to start reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases now.\n  Prime Minister Blair has committed to a 60 percent cut in Britain's \nemissions by 2050. We need to make sure the U.S. is not left behind.\n  The McCain-Lieberman amendment is the right place to start.\n  This is a modest amendment. We would need to be back to our current \nlevel of emissions by 2010. In reality, much of the reduction in ``net \nemissions'' will come through increased carbon sequestration in forest \nand agricultural land. Emissions could actually increase as long as \nthere is enough sequestration to offset the increases.\n  The amendment is comprehensive. The amendment covers six greenhouse \ngases and the vast majority of our greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The amendment is low cost. Repeated analyses have shown that cap-and-\ntrade programs are the most cost effective way to reduce emissions. \nAccording to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, this amendment \nwould cost less than $20 per household over the life of the program--we \ncan afford this cost.\n  The amendment would not lead to rapid fuel switching to natural gas. \nAccording to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, coal use would \nactually continue to increase under this amendment. Natural gas use \nwould decrease from business as usual because the bill would spur \nconservation measures.\n  During the latest energy crisis, California showed that conservation \ncan make a huge difference. This bill will help us create better \nincentives for conservation.\n  Even the Energy Information Administration, EIA, says that this \namendment would not result in fuel switching. EIA was concerned about \nthe costs of the original Climate Stewardship Act. I believe that the \nagency's models are flawed and biased toward higher costs. But even \nthose models indicate that this amendment will cost little and will not \nlead to price spikes.\n  There is a lot of misinformation floating around about this \namendment. Some of the models were analyzing the Kyoto Protocol, which \nwould have required a 20 percent emissions reduction by 2010. This \namendment requires us to get back to our current emissions by 2010, an \nentirely different proposition.\n  Other models are based on an ``energy shock.'' Coming from \nCalifornia, I am quite familiar with energy crises. Shocks happen when \nbusinesses do not have time to prepare. This amendment is not a shock. \nWe are giving industry 7 years' warning. According to the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology, 7 years is enough time for the economy to \nadjust without job losses.\n  Businesses throughout the country have shown that efforts to reduce \nemissions can increase efficiency and actually save companies money.\n  Voluntary programs simply are not doing the job. We need to give \nincentives for all companies to increase efficiency and cut emissions.\n  We need to move forward with a national solution to climate change. \nSo far, we have placed all of the burden on the states.\n  I am proud to say that California has been a leader. California has \ncreated a registry of greenhouse gas emissions that will be a model for \nthe nation. Several other states are already looking to adopt the \nCalifornia Climate Action Registry's standards.\n  Similarly, California has a groundbreaking regulation affecting \ngreenhouse gas emissions from automobiles.\n  Many states are moving forward, and they are now pressing harder for \nFederal action.\n  Local officials are also pressing for a national plan. My colleagues \nknow that I am partial to mayors. Recently, 155 mayors, including 38 \nfrom my State alone, signed a statement calling for national action.\n  State and local programs are important and I applaud these efforts. \nBut we need national leadership on this issue.\n\n[[Page S13576]]\n\n  The McCain-Lieberman approach has widespread public support. \nAccording to a recent national poll, three-fourths of Americans support \nthis approach to global warming--including solid majorities from both \nparties. We need to listen.\n  We know that agreement on climate change is possible in the Senate. \nThe Senate has passed a modest provision in the Energy Bill 2 years in \na row. The Foreign Relations Committee has recognized the urgency of \nthe issue for our diplomatic relations.\n  It is time for the entire Senate to go on record on this important \ntopic. We need to show Americans and the rest of the world that we are \nlistening and that we are doing something about climate change.\n  I believe we can unite behind this bill and move the debate forward.\n  As Mr. Blair said, we have a responsibility to listen and to lead. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will yield in a minute to the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  Last night we went into a lot of detail in this debate and I used \nthree groups of scientists, numbering over 20,000, who refute the \nscience on which global warming is based. Only two criticisms did I get \nfrom the other side. One was comments I made about supposedly \nmisquoting Professor Schneider. After looking at this, I find I did not \nmisquote him at all. He is one who adheres to the MIT study that says \nthere is far less than 1 percent chance temperatures would rise to 5.18 \ndegrees or higher, while there is a 17 percent chance that temperatures \nwould rise lower than 1.4 degrees. These are the guys who are for this.\n  More significant--and this is setting the framework for this debate \ntoday. This is not about a pared-down bill McCain-Lieberman are coming \nup with now. They have both said this is just a start.\n  I will quote Professor Wigley, one I was criticized for misquoting. \nWe find out I did not. He said:\n\n       Senator Inhofe quotes my 1998 publication . . . where I \n     pointed out that adhering to the emissions reductions \n     outlined in the Kyoto Protocol would have only a small effect \n     on the system. What he fails to point out is this analysis \n     assumed that Kyoto was followed to 2010, and there were no \n     subsequent system climate mitigation policies. The point of \n     the paper was to show that Kyoto was to be considered only \n     the first step of a long and complex process of reducing our \n     dependency on fossil fuels as a primary energy source.\n\n  The chart of Senator Sununu shows how little change would be possible \nunder this.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nebraska for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I very much appreciate the leadership of the chairman on \nthis issue and on this important debate.\n  I am here this morning to discuss the United States response to \nglobal climate change. How our Nation addresses global climate change \nmay prove to be one of the most important economic and environmental \ndecisions of our time. As we debate the McCain-Lieberman Climate \nStewardship Act of 2003, it is important to keep in mind this is not a \ndebate about who is for or against the environment. There is no Member \nof Congress who wants dirty air, dirty water, a dirty environment, or \ndeclining standards of living for their children and grandchildren. We \nall agree on the need for a clean environment. We all want to leave our \nchildren a better, cleaner, more prosperous world.\n  The debate on climate change, however, has moved beyond the Kyoto \nprotocol. In 1997, by a 95-0 vote, this body, the Senate, adopted the \nByrd-Hagel resolution which stated the United States would not sign any \ninternational treaty that excluded action on the part of developing \nnations or that would cause serious economic harm to the United States.\n  However, the concerns about our climate have not abated. We should \nrecognize the efforts of Senators McCain and Lieberman and others on \nthis particular issue. Although I disagree with the approach they have \nproposed, I understand and share their concerns. It is important to \nkeep the debate moving forward in order to develop and implement \npractical policies to deal with climate change.\n  The McCain-Lieberman bill would create mandatory emissions reductions \nfor greenhouse gasses here in this country. The consequences of such \nmandates are severe. This bill would raise energy prices for consumers, \nagricultural producers, business, and industry, and have a very \nnegative impact on our economy. The mandates would also be very \ndifficult to reach.\n\n  The Department of Energy's own independent Energy Information \nAdministration projects the greenhouse gas emission levels in 2010 \nwould have to be reduced by 14 percent in order to achieve the 2000 \nemission level quota set by this bill, not the 1.5 percent reduction \nthat supporters of this bill are claiming.\n  This means utilities and manufacturers will have to find alternatives \nto coal, the predominant fuel used in this country. In most cases, this \nmeans switching to natural gas. That would mean higher costs for \nhomeowners, businesses, industry, and farmers, as well as possible \nnatural gas shortages.\n  A fuel shift of this magnitude demanded by this bill for the utility \nindustry would require natural gas production and pipeline capacity \nthis country simply does not have nor will have in 2010.\n  We have recently seen the effects of high natural gas prices in this \ncountry. A recent GAO report concluded the natural gas price fight in \nthe years 2000 to 2002 led to a 25 percent reduction in domestic \nproduction of nitrogen fertilizer and a 43 percent in nitrogen imports. \nThis was a significant blow to this country, especially to our \nagricultural producers.\n  Record demands and higher prices for natural gas caused America's \nfarmers and ranchers to spend an additional $1.5 billion just to plant \nand fertilize their crops this past spring.\n  The question we are faced with is not whether we should take action \nbut what kind of action would best address the climate change challenge \nwe face now and into the future. Our actions should be focused on \nincentivizing and achieving voluntary emissions reductions in \ndeveloping and disseminating clear technologies.\n  I supported such actions in the past in addressing our national \nclimate change policy: The establishment of a voluntary registry for \ncarbon emissions reductions; tax credits for emissions reductions; and \nresearch into climate change science and carbon sequestration. Closing \nthe gaps in our knowledge, our science, our industry, and our \ntechnology builds a solid foundation for a wise climate policy for the \nfuture.\n  Although there are inconsistencies in the science, there has been a \nhuman impact on the Earth's atmosphere--we all accept that--and we \nshould consider steps to mitigate that impact. The sooner we begin, the \nsmaller and less painful the changes will have to be in the future. \nGlobal warming does not recognize national borders. The changes under \nconsideration today are proposed solely for the United States, but our \nglobal warming policy must be broader. The United States alone cannot \nimprove the Earth's climate. The only way forward is through \ninternational cooperation and collaboration--engaging, helping, \npartnering with all nations, especially developing nations. Developing \nnations are quickly becoming the major emitters of greenhouse gasses, \nbut they are exempted from international agreements to reduce these \nemissions. There are some good reasons for this. These nations cannot \nachieve greenhouse gas reductions until they achieve higher standards \nof living. They lack clean energy technology, and they cannot absorb \nthe economic impact of the changes necessary for emissions reductions. \nOur partnerships with developing nations can help increase the \nefficiency of their energy use and reduce their greenhouse gas \nemissions. Industrialized nations must help less developed nations by \nsharing cleaner technology so developing countries can leapfrog over \nthe highly polluting stages of development that the United States and \nother countries have already been through. The Bush administration has \ntaken the initiative in developing these public-private partnerships \nand projects with all developing nations.\n  The United States Chamber of Commerce has called for a Marshall plan \nfor developing emissions-free technologies. Part of that plan includes \nthe dissemination of those technologies to developing nations. This \nwill take time. We should be thinking and planning 20 to 50 years out.\n\n[[Page S13577]]\n\n  By partnering with developing nations, we will export American \ntechnology and expertise, and improve all economies along the way.\n  These are the types of plans the U.S. should be reviewing. \nInvestments can be spread over time and gradual and effective change is \nthe least painful to individuals, industries and nations--and it is the \nmost lasting. It also allows all nations to participate in workable \nclimate change policies. It is the only way to ensure both global \nclimate change success and global prosperity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield my friend and colleague from \nFlorida 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, thank you. And in 6 short \nminutes I want to give you my observations of why this is an extremely \ncritical piece of legislation to the future of Planet Earth.\n  I bring back to my mind's eye a picture that is embedded in my \nmemory, looking out the window of our spacecraft 17 years ago back at \nPlanet Earth. It is such a beautiful creation, suspended in the middle \nof nothing. It is a blue and white ball--blue from the oceans and white \nfrom the clouds--suspended in the middle of this black backdrop of \nspace that goes on and on for billions of light years--an airless \nvacuum. And there, suspended in the midst of it is life. It is our \nhome.\n  When you look at the rim of the Earth from space, you see a thin \nlittle film, and that is the atmosphere that sustains all of life. From \nspace, the Earth looks so beautiful and yet it looks so fragile. From \nthat experience of 17 years ago, it made me want to be all the more a \nbetter steward of this planet, particularly when, with the naked eye, \nfrom that altitude I could actually see, for example, coming across \nSouth America--with the color contrast--the destruction of the rain \nforest in the upper Amazon region and, from the same window of the \nspacecraft, see the results of that destruction. Looking to the east, \nto the mouth of the Amazon River, I could see the silt that discolored \nthe waters of the Atlantic for hundreds of miles.\n  I give you that backdrop purely as an intro to tell you that when we \nface a major change in climate, it is going to have devastating effects \non the very delicate ecological balance that we have on this Earth.\n  Clearly, one of the places that would be most devastated would be my \nown State of Florida, which has more coastline than any other State. \nThe rising of the temperatures would cause the rising of the oceans. \nThe scientific community, that has been fairly unanimous on this--\ndespite what you hear in this debate, that there is this disagreement \nin the scientific community--it is overwhelming in the scientific \ncommunity that what is going to happen is that the oceans are going to \nrise.\n  Can you imagine what that is going to do to a place such as my State \nof Florida, where most of the development in the State is along the \ncoastline? With the rise of the temperatures, that means the storms are \ngoing to be more ferocious and frequent.\n  Florida is this land we know as paradise, that is a peninsula that \nsticks down in the middle of something we know as ``Hurricane \nHighway.'' The storms are going to become more ferocious and frequent, \nand the plagues are going to be more intense.\n  If that is not enough for passing this legislation and blunting the \ncritics of this legislation--you would think that argument would stand \non its own, but there is even more. And I must say, I was delighted, in \nthe hearing we had in our Commerce Committee on this issue, to see, for \nthe first time, some American insurance companies step up and say this \nis going to be a problem.\n  In the past, European companies have stepped up. But now subsidiaries \nof those companies, doing business in America, are acknowledging the \nsame thing, that it will have devastating effects upon our business \nclimate here in this country.\n  For example, the reinsurance company, Swiss Re--this is their quote \nfrom our Commerce Committee hearing:\n\n       Swiss Re believes the best way to lessen potential loss is \n     through sound public policy, utilizing market mechanisms \n     which strike the right balance between environmental \n     precaution and societal policy objectives.\n\n  Because the person testifying for Swiss Re said, ``Climate change \ndriven natural disasters are forecasted to cost the world's financial \ncenters as much as $150 billion per year over the next 10 years,'' that \nshould be sufficient reason for us to stop putting our heads in the \nsand and saying global warming is not a problem. We know it is a \nproblem environmentally. Now we have to recognize that it is going to \nbe a major problem with regard to American business and all of the \ninvestments we have, particularly since so much of our urbanized area \nis along the coast of the United States.\n  So, Mr. President, I wanted, as one voice, who strongly supports the \nMcCain-Lieberman legislation, to speak in favor of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to Senator Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues in the Senate \nknow, I have been fascinated and awed by the complexity of the climate \nchange issue for quite some time.\n  Certainly, being born and raised in the high desert region of the \nState of Idaho located in the rugged and majestic Pacific Northwest, I \ngrew up with reverence for the natural beauty of our world and a deep \nrespect for the awesome power of nature.\n  I have stated several times on the floor of the Senate that climate \nchange is one of the most significant issues of our time. I have not \nchanged my view.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate today to both compliment my \ncolleagues, Senators McCain and Lieberman, for their determination to \nlegislatively address the issue of climate change and to object to the \nmanner in which they have chosen to do so.\n  Their proposal, S. 139, The Climate Stewardship Act, is portrayed by \nits proponents to be a modest legislative attempt to reduce emissions \nof carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\n  It is hard for me accept the word ``modest'' as an accurate \ndescriptive term for the legislation when I measure the bill by what it \ndoes--it regulates carbon dioxide--a gas that is not a criteria \npollutant under the Clean Air Act is not a poisonous gas or toxic \nsubstance, and does not represent a direct threat to public health.\n  When I decided to enter politics, I was guided by a deep belief in \npersonal freedom--the maximum amount possible for the citizens of our \nNation that is consistent with an orderly society.\n  By freedom I mean the opportunity to achieve one's true potential, \nwhether as an individual, a community, or a business. Freedom spawns \ndiscovery and innovation and in turn discovery and innovation solve \nproblems and create opportunities. Regulation is the antithesis of \nfreedom. It certainly retards, if not completely extinguishes our \nnatural desire to discover and be innovative, and yet, we, as a Nation, \nseem more and more inclined to willingly accept the form of a \nregulatory state.\n  I am periodically awed by the prescience of Alexis de Tocqueville's \n1839 work--``Democracy in America.'' In Part II of Chapter 6, \nTocqueville voiced perhaps his greatest concern for the future \nconditions of American democracy.\n  In general terms, he said that democracies have a sort of soft \n``despotism'' to fear. That is, conditions of democracy include toward \nmen's equality, and in that equality, the government takes care of all \nof man's necessities, needs, and desires, in order to maintain this \npatterned equality among men. Tocqueville's description of this ``soft \ndespotism'' aptly describes the modern regulatory state.\n  I note that there are 2,620 pages in the 1936 Federal Register, a \nyear after the Federal Register Act was passed in 1935. In the Federal \nRegister for the year 2000, there are 74,258.\n  A quote from Chapter 6 of Tocqueville's work is quite pertinent\n\n[[Page S13578]]\n\nto our discussion here. In discussing the regulatory threat, he states:\n\n       That power is absolute, thoughtful of detail, orderly, \n     provident, and gentle . . . It provides for their security, \n     foresees and supplies their necessities, facilitates their \n     pleasures, manages their principal concerns, directs their \n     industry, makes rules for their testaments, and divides their \n     inheritances . . . Thus it makes the exercise of free choice \n     less useful and rare, restricts the activity of free will \n     within a narrower compass, and little by little robs \n     each citizen of the proper use of his own faculties.\n\n  Tocqueville goes on to note that regulation:\n\n     is not at all tyrannical, but it hinders, restrains, \n     enervates, stifles, and stultifies so much that in the end \n     each nation is no more than a flock of timid and hardworking \n     animals with the government as its shepherd.\n\n  Now, let me be clear, regulation, indeed, has its place. But this \nextremely powerful Government tool should be employed only as a last \nresort after facts developed by a comprehensive and systematic analysis \nclearly indicate that it is necessary to protect the public welfare.\n  It is with this analytical perspective that I have reviewed carefully \nthe underlying scientific and economic support for this bill, S. 139.\n  The bill assumes that there is currently a definitive scientific \nbasis for imposing a regulatory structure on industry. I am unable to \nagree with that basic assumption. There is no definitive evidence \nsupporting regulation. Surface temperatures have warmed. We are not \nsure why. Since the mid-1990s, I have paid close attention to the \ndeveloping science on global warming.\n  Indeed, I have organized and attended meetings at scientific research \nvenues, set-up and participated in numerous conference calls with \nscientists from the National Academy of Sciences, and, along with the \nBoard of the NAS convened a high level conference at the Academy's \nheadquarters in Washington, DC to discuss the state of the science on \nglobal warming.\n  That conference, held on June 6, 2001, was a marvelous opportunity to \ntalk with eleven scientists that included several Nobel Laureates who \njust finished responding to the now well publicized ``Key Questions'' \nrequest of President Bush.\n  We couldn't have had better timing for such a conference and the \nconference was set up solely to address concerns of the U.S. Senate.\n  Yet there were only two other Senators besides myself who made the \neffort to attend. Senators Bingaman and Sessions joined me, former \nTreasury Secretary O'Neill and former Chairman of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisors, Glenn Hubbard.\n  I can say to all in the Chamber today that the forum was a veritable \nfeast for the mind and wonderfully successful in explaining matters of \nextraordinary scientific complexity. But it had to be quite a \ndisappointment for the Academy. Only three U.S. Senators took the time \nto attend.\n  The National Academy made extraordinary efforts to get Members of the \nSenate to attend its intensive Climate Science Forum, including sending \na letter one month in advance of the forum to each Member of the \nSenate, followed by a personal phone call to each Senate office.\n  What more could the Academy have done to encourage attendance? I \ndon't think much else could have been done.\n  For some, it appears contentment on the science issue comes from \nsimply learning about it from media reports contained in newspapers and \npopular magazines. Is that a fair knowledge base for regulation?\n  Indeed, a little over a year before the NAS conference I organized \nand attended, with Senator Lincoln Chafee and former Senator Bob Smith, \na meeting of over 30 scientists working at the Woods Hole Oceanographic \nInstitute in Woods Hole, MA, to discuss the state of science on climate \nchange.\n  Again, I could tweak the interest of only a handful of Members to \njoin me at that excellent scientific conference held exclusively for \nmembers of the United States Senate. This issue is too economically and \nenvironmentally important for Congress to continue to have only casual \ninterest in its scientific complexity.\n  Sure, there have been several congressional hearings during the last \nyear debating different views of the science. But how much do we really \nlearn in a couple of hours under restrictive time limits for questions, \nparticularly when we invite mostly ``advocates'' of a particular \nposition, instead of objective scientists? Not much. Surely, not as \nmuch as we learned at reputable scientific forums.\n  So, today, the Senate is asked to pass legislation that will regulate \ncarbon dioxide, an emission that has no health impacts--we humans \nexhale it with every breath--and heretofore has never been listed as an \n``air pollutant.'' Stated simply, the scientific case for regulation is \nunpersuasive.\n  Those Senators who assert that the science is settled are, in my \nopinion, simply wrong.\n  The 2001 NAS Report on the ``Analysis of Some Key Questions,'' often \nquoted to establish the basis for regulatory action, contains a \nsentence that is often half-quoted, and I will read it here in its \nentirety:\n\n       The changes observed over the last several decades are \n     likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out \n     that some significant part of these changes is also a \n     reflection of natural variability.\n\n  This is the third sentence in the summary at the very beginning of \nthe report.\n  Even a cursory reading of the report indicates that the uncertainties \nare real and they are significant. Indeed, the report uses the words \n``uncertain'' and ``uncertainty'' 43 times in its 28 pages.\n  Some press accounts have said that this report acknowledged a dire, \nnear term threat to the environment from climate change. This is not \ntrue.\n  One of the conclusions of the Report was that:\n\n       [a] causal linkage between the buildup of greenhouse gases \n     in the atmosphere and the observed climate changes during the \n     20th Century cannot be unequivocally established.\n\n  Natural variations in climate that occur over decades and even \ncenturies have been identified by the NAS as also playing a role in \nclimate change, and so it is not correct to say that this problem \nresults only from human activities, or that reduction of emissions of \nheat-trapping gases will entirely solve it.\n  Mr. President, 2 years before the NAS prepared its 2001 ``Analysis of \nSome Key Questions'' it issued one of this country's most comprehensive \nreports on climate change science entitled: ``Research Pathways for the \nNext Decade.''\n  The Pathways report is short on creative literature and long on \ntechnical issue framing--not particularly suitable for catchy media \nheadlines, which may explain why many newspapers showed little interest \nin its existence or import. But its critical and thorough scientific \nanalysis of the current state of our climate change knowledge is what \nmakes the Pathways report so important to policy makers.\n  Now, if you are like me and you find out that America's National \nResearch Council has just published the most comprehensive report in \nhistory on the state of Climate Science, you don't want to read all 550 \npages!\n  You want to cut to the chase and read the report's bottom line \nconclusion. And the last thing you want is a report that provides more \nquestions than answers.\n  But the Pathways Report authors are brutally honest. To best explain \nthe current state of climate science they had no choice but to lay out \na whole series of potentially show-stopping questions.\n  Let me stop for a moment and reflect on my trip to Woods Hole, MA, \nthat I mentioned earlier. I spent a day at the Oceanographic Institute \nexploring these questions with over 30 scientists. It was a real eye-\nopening experience.\n  Dr. Berrien Moore, who coordinated the publication of the Pathways \nReport, helped lead a discussion on where science and public policy \nintersect.\n  Two themes came through clearly in those discussions:\n  No. 1, there are significant gaps in scientific understanding of the \nway oceans and the atmosphere interact to affect climate; and\n  No. 2, scientists need more data, especially from the oceans to \nbetter understand and predict possible changes.\n  It was humbling to get a glimpse of how much we don't know.\n  You need to know what is in the ``Pathways Report'' in order to fully \nunderstand the Research Council's ``Analysis of Some Key Questions''--\nif\n\n[[Page S13579]]\n\nread objectively, I think you will find that both Reports are \nconsistent--both highlight the uncertainty of our current understanding \nof climate science.\n  Another important point to highlight is that the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change does not define what is meant by \n``dangerous interference with the climate system'' nor does it specify \na ``dangerous'' level of greenhouse gas concentrations.\n  To my knowledge, no Federal or federally supported scientific entity \nhas firmly established what is a ``dangerous'' level of greenhouse gas. \nWe simply don't know!\n  Recently, James Schlesinger, a former Secretary of Energy under \nPresident Jimmy Carter stated in the Washington Post:\n\n       We cannot tell how much of the recent warming trend can be \n     attributed to the greenhouse effect and how much to other \n     factors. In climate change, we have only a limited grasp of \n     the overall forces at work. Uncertainties have continued to \n     abound--and must be reduced. Any approach to policy formation \n     under conditions of such uncertainty should be taken only on \n     an exploratory and sequential basis. A premature commitment \n     to a fixed policy can only proceed with fear and trembling.\n\n  The President understands that reality.\n  The administration's Scientific Strategic Plan for climate change \nresearch is a valuable effort to develop a framework for acquiring and \napplying knowledge of the Earth's global environment through research \nand observations. It is a long overdue decision and should be welcomed \nby all.\n  The President's approach is most prudent. At this time, it is my \npreferred option over regulation. Despite claims to the contrary, no \ngovernment administration has aggressively pursued a voluntary action \nprogram. The President's plan is well conceived and deserves a chance.\n  The simply truth is that any cap-and-trade scheme is a hidden tax on \nconsumption. Like a tax, it would raise the cost of production.\n  Moreover, a cap-and-trade on CO2 emissions will be a \nregressive tax which will hurt those on low or fixed income--that is \nthe poor and elderly--disproportionately. I will submit for the record \na letter sent to me as Chairman of the Aging Committee from ``The 60 \nPlus Association'' with membership of 4.5 million senior citizens \nincluding 10,000 in Idaho, asking me to oppose S. 139.\n\n  A quote from a June, 2001 CBO study entitled ``An Evaluation of Cap-\nand-Trade Programs for Reducing U.S. Carbon Emissions'' is revealing on \nthis subject:\n\n       This analysis does not address the issue of taxing carbon \n     emissions. However, the economic impacts of cap-and-trade \n     programs would be similar to those of a carbon tax: both \n     would raise the cost of using carbon-based fuels, lead to \n     higher energy prices, and impose costs on users and some \n     suppliers of energy.\n\n  Another instructive quote from that study states:\n\n       The higher prices for energy and energy-intensive products \n     that would result from a cap-and-trade program would reduce \n     the real income that people received from working and \n     investing, thus tending to discourage them from productive \n     activity. That would compound the fact that existing taxes on \n     capital and labor already discourage economic activity.\n\n  The only way to reduce CO2 emissions from powerplants is \nto reduce the amount of coal, oil or natural gas consumed at the power \nplant.\n  Placing a cap on CO2 emissions from powerplants means \nthose plants simply will not be able to generate any significant \namounts of new electricity. There are no control technologies like \nselective catalytic reduction or scrubbers for CO2.\n  Capping CO2 emissions from power plants will make the \ncurrent crisis in electricity markets permanent. It will force \nshuttering of most of U.S. coal fired steam electric generation \nprematurely and will essentially mandate reliance on new natural gas \nfired power plants without any assurance that adequate gas supplies \nwill be available.\n  Further, a report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration found \nthat reductions of SO2, NOX, and CO2 \nat levels consistent with the current proposal drives up electricity \ncosts substantially. The report shows that electricity prices would \nrise by 21 percent by 2005 and 55 percent by 2010.\n  The report goes on to attribute most of the rise in prices to \ncontrolling CO2 emissions.\n  The report, Mr. President, also was prepared when natural gas prices \nwere a third of what they are today which means that future electricity \nprices likely would be much higher because the report assumes that most \nnew generating capacity would be gas fired.\n  The last point that must be addressed is the assertion that the \nUnited States is somehow out of step with the rest of the world on this \nissue. Climate change is as much an economic issue as it is an \nenvironmental issue. We must ensure that our global competitiveness is \nnot compromised. Let's not allow our nation to be duped into assisting \nour competitors in the global market to achieve competitive advantage \nunder the subterfuge of environmental policy. When viewed in \ncomparative perspective, the process by which environmental policy is \ndeveloped and implemented has been far more ``conflictual and \nadversarial'' in the United States than in Europe or Japan. In the \nU.S., while fines for violations have grown larger, numerous violations \nof environmental laws have been reclassified as ``felonies'' and many \nnow carry prison sentences.\n\n  Contrast this with Europe and Japan. Japan implements its policies \nwithout resorting to legal coercion or overt enforcement. Japanese MUST \nnegotiate and compromise to ensure compliance. Europe emphasizes mutual \nproblem-solving rather than arm's length enforcement and punishment.\n  Our legal system allows Third Party lawsuits. Europe and Asian \ncountries do not. In a 2003 study on the direct costs of the U.S. Tort \nsystem, it was estimated that costs equal 2.2 percent of our nations \nGDP. Europe and Asian countries give no standing to Third Parties in \nenvironmental compliance and enforcement cases.\n  Perhaps, if we were a less litigious nation, we could accomplish more \nin environmental compliance, and be less fearful of international \nenvironmental treaties becoming law. However, for better or worse, when \nour nation commits to a particular environmental policy, we enforce \nthat commitment with the heavy hammer of civil penalties and criminal \nprosecution. Europe, Japan, and other nations do not. Our global \ncompetitiveness and economic security is ``in the balance.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from a large \nsenior citizen organization expressing their fear about high costs of \nenergy based on S. 139 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                      The 60 Plus Association,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, October 28, 2003.\n     Hon. Larry E. Craig,\n     Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: As Chairman of the Senate Special \n     Committee on Aging, you are a proven fighter for seniors. \n     Accordingly, I'd like to bring to your attention legislation \n     that, if enacted, would be very detrimental to the elderly.\n       We are very much opposed to S 139, the Climate Stewardship \n     Act, which seeks to do by statute much of what the \n     discredited Kyoto Protocol would have done by treaty. (The \n     Kyoto Protocol was rejected by you and your Senate colleagues \n     in 1997 by a 95-0 vote.) S 139 would seriously adds to the \n     costs of both electricity and gasoline for seniors and others \n     on a fixed income.\n       According to a June 2003 report by the Energy Information \n     Administration at the U.S. Department of Energy, this \n     legislation would increase electricity rates by 46%, natural \n     gas prices by 79%, and the cost of gasoline by as much as 40 \n     cents a gallon.\n       Seniors on a fixed income are least able to afford these \n     higher prices.\n       During the cold winter months, many seniors must choose \n     between staying warm and having enough food to eat and \n     medicine to stay healthy. And in the heat of the summer, an \n     inability to cool a home can be a death sentence to the \n     elderly.\n       The very last thing public policies should do is to add to \n     the costs of electricity and natural gas for the elderly. \n     Likewise, many seniors and their families must be able to \n     afford gasoline to be able to get to their doctor's office, \n     grocery store, and pharmacy.\n       Government mandates which increase the costs of \n     electricity, natural gas, and gasoline are tantamount to a \n     tax on those least able to pay it.\n       On behalf of 4.5 million seniors, including nearly 10,000 \n     in Idaho, please do everything you can to prevent S. 139 from \n     being passed.\n           Cordially,\n                                                  James L. Martin,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have come to the floor on more than one \noccasion over the last 5 years to discuss and debate the issue of \nclimate change.\n\n[[Page S13580]]\n\nMany of us engaged in this issue believe it to be a serious and \nimportant issue. That I cannot deny. The Senator from Florida talked \nabout it being of critical character. I do not dispute that. The \nquestion is, Can we do anything about it and are we the cause of it? \nAnd I am speaking ``we'' as mankind. That is the essence of the debate \ntoday.\n  Also, S. 139, the Climate Stewardship Act, would portray, in part, \nthat we are the cause and, therefore, let us make some moderate \nadjustment changes in our regulatory structure in this country to begin \nto mitigate greenhouse gases.\n  Let me suggest that the word ``modest'' has been used, but I would \nguess if you read the legislation, and then you downstreamed it through \nthe regulatory process, it might be anything less than modest.\n  Here is what is most important about regulating carbon dioxide. It is \na gas. It is not a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. It is not a \npoisonous gas or a toxic substance. It does not represent a direct \nthreat to public health. That is what scientists tell us. Yet somehow \nwe are going to be able to regulate and shape it in a way that controls \nwhat we believe to be the cause of producing greenhouse gas.\n  I suggest that probably the most invasive process we are going \nthrough right here with this legislation is the regulatory process that \nwill ultimately come.\n  The Senator from Arizona and I, more often than not, are critics of \nbig government and the regulatory process. What De Tocqueville said a \ngood number of years ago--in fact, well over a century ago--was about \nthe great democracy of America and the despotism of fear that is \nproduced in the regulatory process that limits freedom.\n  He talks about the regulatory process as being soft despotism.\n  I note that in 1936, there were about 2,600 pages of the Federal \nRegister. In the year 2000, there were 74,258 pages of the Federal \nRegister. We have become a phenomenally regulated and controlled \neconomy and country. In so doing, de Tocqueville would note very \nclearly, as we all understand and as the Senator from Arizona \nunderstands as well as anyone, we begin to shape our freedoms, control \nour freedoms in a very interesting way. That is what this bill is all \nabout, a massive new regulatory process to reshape certain utilizations \nof energy in a way that will have a significant impact on our economy. \nAnd we would be led to believe that somehow it is going to improve the \nenvironment in which we live.\n  That is the issue at hand. That is the one that we now need to \ndiscuss. That is, does scientific evidence support what S. 139 is all \nabout.\n  I have spent a good deal of time on the science. You have to. That is \nprobably the greatest frustration that all of us have, is trying to \ncomprehend this massive body of science that is assembling out there \nand what it means and is it valid and, from it, should we begin to \nreshape our economy; if it is invalid or inaccurate, what would be the \nimpact of the reshaping that S. 139 might accomplish.\n  Organized meetings have been held all over. I organized one with the \nassistance of the National Academy of Sciences in June 2001. It was a \nhigh-level conference meeting here in our Nation's Capital. Every \nSenator was invited to come. Three showed up. Only three showed up to \nlisten. Senator Bingaman and Senator Sessions attended, along with \nSecretary O'Neill, to listen to the President and the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, to listen to some of our noted scientists \nfrom all over the world. No one else came. O'Neill at that time was \nserving as Secretary of the Treasury and was a somewhat outspoken \nadvocate of changing our economy for the sake of climate change. He \nwent away from that meeting not confused but recognizing that there was \na broad field of science out there that he had not yet explored and \nthat scientists had not, in fact, come together in a way to understand.\n  We worked with a variety of scientists from the National Academy of \nScientists. In 2000, I went up to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. \nSenator Chafee and Senator Bob Smith went along at that time. We \nlistened to the best scientists out there, scientists who have studied \nthis for decades. They cannot in any absolute way suggest that \ngreenhouse gases are the creator of a heating trend or a warming trend \nthat does exist and most agree does exist.\n  The Senator from Arizona, the authors of S. 139, would suggest that \nthis is the definitive document, the ``Analysis of Some Key \nQuestions,'' of climate change science by the National Research \nCouncil. This is a total of 27, 28 pages. I am not saying this document \nis wrong, but I am saying, to understand this document, you better read \nthis document: ``Pathways Study,'' 550 pages. Now, it is not a hot \ntopic, and it will put you to sleep. It is all science. From this \ndocument, they concluded this document.\n  And what does this document conclude? That the science today is not \nyet assembled that can in any definitive way argue that greenhouse \ngases and man's presence in the production of those greenhouse gases is \ncreating the heating trend in our global environment at this time.\n\n  There are not many sound bites here. The press did ignore this. Those \nwho want the politics of this issue largely ignored this document. But \nthey must go hand in glove. I am not a critic of this document at all. \nI have not read all of them, not all 550 pages. But I have thumbed \nthrough a lot of it. I have read a good deal of it. Anyone who wants to \nbe the advocate of climate change darn well better read the bible on it \nfirst before they conclude that all of the world's scientists have come \ntogether with a single statement to suggest that the global warming we \nare experiencing can be in any way clearly the product of the \nproduction of greenhouse gas around this globe and as a part of it.\n  Because we have not totally understood it yet, there is no question \nthat we ought to try to understand it before we begin to craft a \nmassive body of regulation to reshape the economy, all in the name of \nclimate change. That is what the President understood. That is why the \nPresident denounced Kyoto.\n  The administration's strategic scientific plan for climate change \nresearch is a valuable effort to build the body of science that can \ntruly allow those of us as policymakers a foundation from which to make \nthe right choices. If we fail to make the right choices, if we head \nthis massive regulatory effort in the wrong direction without \nquestion--and many have spoken to it over the last few hours--we could \nbadly damage, if not curtail, much of the growth in our economy.\n  I think the effort that is underway ought to be the preferred option \nover regulation. Voluntary action based on clear evidence is a much \npreferred way to go.\n  Let me talk for a moment about economic impact because that \nultimately is the issue. S. 139 wants to change our country, wants to \nchange the utilization of carbon and the emission of gases. You do it \nthrough a regulatory process. Between 1990 and the year 2000, \nindustrial GDP increased 35 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The reality is, our industrial growth is climbing. Its \nemissions have rapidly dropped. The emission today of greenhouse-like \ngases, as we would argue, do not come from our industrial base. Yet \nthis is where we send our regulatory effort.\n  I oppose the legislation. I hope the Senate will vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank Senators Lieberman and McCain \nfor developing this amendment. It makes sense. Mr. President, I rise to \nspeak in support of the Lieberman/McCain bill. This bill offers a \nreasonable, proven, market-based approach to addressing the problem of \nglobal warming. It establishes a greenhouse gas ``cap and trade'' \nsystem which is modeled on the most successful pollution reduction \nprogram ever--enacted the Acid Rain Program.\n  Since 1980, that program has reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 40 \npercent--despite significant economic growth during that period. I say, \nit's about time.\n  A few years ago I traveled to Antarctica and I saw the effects of \nglobal\n\n[[Page S13581]]\n\nwarming firsthand. The Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves are melting. \nOver 1,250 square miles of ice have broken off and melted in just the \nlast few years. Scientists believe these massive ice shelves have stood \nundisturbed for 12,000 years. Now they are gone. Many of us were \ndismayed but not surprised by the report last month of the breakup of \nthe Arctic's largest ice shelf.\n  It is stunning that some of the world's glaciers have lost as much as \n70 percent of their ice. Why is all this ice melting? Because, as \nliterally thousands of climate scientists have reported--the earth is \nheating up! Yes, global warming is real and America should be leading \nthe international community in addressing it--not lagging behind. The \nscientific discoveries on climate change are nothing short of \nastonishing. Ice core samples from Greenland and the Antarctica show \nthat atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are at their highest \nlevel in the last one million years. In the Arctic, the permafrost is \nmelting. The average thickness of the arctic ice shelf has decreased by \na staggering 40 percent, just since 1950.\n  All that melting ice is steadily raising sea levels. Globally, the \nsea has risen between 4 and 8 inches. This impact is particularly \ndamaging to flat coastlines like in Texas where the relative sea level \nhas already risen from 8 to 10 inches. From primitive thermometer \nreadings to the analysis of tree rings and coral reefs, the evidence is \nclear: this last century has been the hottest in the last 1,000 years.\n  The evidence of profound climactic change continues to mount. A study \npublished last January in Nature--probably the most respected \nscientific journal in the world--reported some remarkable discoveries. \nIt reported that of 1,700 habitats studied, 370 are moving northward. \nThe habitat of the Red Fox has moved 600 miles to the north in the last \n30 years. Frightening disease vectors, such as the mosquito which \ncarries the deadly West Nile Virus, are pushing into North America. \nPerhaps most ominous of all, night time temperatures are rising. \nMedical authorities tell us that this lack of relief from elevated \ntemperatures at nighttime is a chief reason that 500 to 700 people died \nin Chicago during the 1995 heat wave.\n  While the Federal Government sits fiddling, States are not waiting \nfor Rome to burn. At least 27 States--more than half--have started \ntheir own programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to \nDavid Danner, the energy adviser for the State of Washington, States \nare moving ahead to fill the vacuum left by the Federal Government. \nDanner said, ``We hope to see the problem addressed at the federal \nlevel, but we're not waiting around.'' A number of those States have \ninitiated reasonable regulatory programs that will soon begin to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The Federal Government should be leading this \neffort, but isn't. At the very least, we should start catching up. \nSurely, none of us here doubt the United States possesses the capacity \nand the skill to confront global warming? I for one, do not.\n  Now is the time to harness America's ingenuity and skills and tackle \nglobal climate change. I have to ask: What is there about the facts of \nglobal warming that makes the administration duck for cover?\n  We cannot ``spin'' our way out of the impacts of global warming. But \nthat is the strategy the opponents of this bill are pursuing. Look at \nthis chart: Republican pollster Frank Luntz is urging his side to call \nit ``climate change'' not global warming, because ``climate change'' is \n``less frightening.'' The implication here is that people won't demand \nimmediate action on something that is ``less frightening'' and ``more \ncontrollable.'' How irresponsible. No matter how much word-smithing \nthat's done, no matter how much faux science the other side uses--that \nwill not change the true, consensus, peer-reviewed science that has \naccumulated for 30 years.\n\n  The ominous impacts of Global Warming affect our health, affect our \nsafety, and effect our economy. These impacts will not simply go away \nbecause we turn a blind eye to the facts and pretend the climate is not \nchanging. In 2002, the National Research Council reported on the \nscience of global warming. It said:\n\n       Greenhouse gases are accumulating in earth's atmosphere as \n     a result of human activities. National policy decisions made \n     now and in the longer-term will influence the extent of the \n     damage suffered by vulnerable human populations and \n     ecosystems later in this century.\n\n  Clearly, the decisions we make here and now will determine how much \n``damage'' is inflicted on our children and our grandchildren. The \nNational Research Council represents the brain trust of the most \neducated country in the world. If we cannot believe the Council, who \ncan we believe?\n  Global warming poses a clear and present danger to us all. The global \nwarming bandwagon is getting full--and the President would be smart to \nget on it. A partial list of those who urge market-based action now, \nincludes: 2,500 eminent economists from MIT, Yale, Harvard, Stanford \nand other top universities, including eight Nobel Laureates who said, \n``a market-based policy could achieve its climatic objectives at \nminimum cost.''\n  Major corporations, including the petroleum giant BP--which has \nalready reduced its greenhouse gas emissions 10 percent below its 1990 \nlevels--and saved $600 million in energy costs doing it.\n  Last night we heard from Senators who were repeating the scare \npropaganda that is circulating about higher fuel prices. But what is \nmore reliable, guesses about the future or a record of the past? If BP, \nDuPont and other major corporations can save money by reducing their \ngreenhouse gases--surely they rest of the country can also. Other \nsupporters of a market-based approach include Silicon Valley investors, \nmulti-religion interfaith groups, the world's largest re-insurance \ncompany, a bipartisan group of 155 mayors--the list goes on and on.\n  I urge my colleagues: let's be the leaders we were elected to be. \nLet's act now and vote for the Lieberman/McCain bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to probably the best \ninformed Senator who was the chairman of the Governor's clean air \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I wish to comment on some of the \nstatements made by my distinguished colleague, Senator Lieberman, \nduring the debate last night.\n  Senator Lieberman was correct when he said concerns about climate \nchange and atmospheric concentrations of carbon are widespread and \nbipartisan. He was also right when he said that support for increasing \nour scientific understanding of this issue and reducing atmospheric \nconcentration of carbon is widespread and bipartisan.\n  However, I note that opposition to the language offered by Senator \nLieberman and Senator McCain is both widespread and bipartisan, \nincluding labor and management.\n  The bill is opposed by a large number of stakeholders, including the \nChemistry Council, the American Farm Bureau, the American Health Care \nAssociation, the American Highway Uses Alliance, the American Iron and \nSteel Institute, the National Association of Corn Growers, and the \nNational Association of Wheat Growers, and the list goes on of the \norganizations opposed to this legislation.\n  The legislation is also opposed by a large number of labor unions, \nincluding the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers; the International \nBrotherhood of Boilermakers; the Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, \nForgers, and Helpers; the International Brotherhood of Electrical \nWorkers; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; the Marine \nEngineers Beneficial Association; the United Food and Commercial \nWorkers International Union; the United Mine Workers of America; the \nUnited Transportation Union; the Utility Workers Union of America; and \nseveral locals of the United Steelworkers of America.\n  I also note that Senator Lieberman stated that over 75 percent of \npeople in a recent poll support this language. I would argue if these \npeople had been told of the negative effects of this legislation on \nheating and electrical costs and the loss of jobs, the results of that \npoll would have been much different.\n  As I discussed last night, Thomas Mullen of Catholic Charities \ntestified last year against the Lieberman-Jeffords bill saying it would \nhave a devastating impact in significantly higher\n\n[[Page S13582]]\n\nheating prices on the poor and elderly. I also point out that the \nDepartment of Energy has stated that high energy costs consume a \ndisproportionately large share of the income of the poor and elderly on \nfixed incomes. They are left out of this debate.\n  I would also like to address statements by Senator McCain and Senator \nLieberman that because they offered a substitute to their original \nversion of S. 139, all the comments and analyses cited by opponents of \nthis bill, including myself, are irrelevant. That statement could not \nbe further from the truth.\n  I refer to a letter I recently received from many of the stakeholders \nagainst S. 139:\n\n       The undersigned commercial, industrial, small business and \n     agricultural organizations strongly urge you to oppose S. \n     139, the Climate Stewardship Act, or any substitute that may \n     be offered by its sponsors, Senators Joe Lieberman and John \n     McCain, when this measure comes before the Senate. As they \n     proclaimed, the vote on S. 139 (or its substitute) will be a \n     test vote on the most appropriate response to concerns about \n     our changing climate.\n       Among all the policy options available to the Congress to \n     improve our understanding of climate systems, the arbitrary \n     imposition of energy rationing as embodied in S. 139 is one \n     of the worst possible options the Senate could choose for \n     farmers, industry, the poorest of Americans, and the economy \n     as a whole.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 22, 2003.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned commercial, industrial, small \n     business and agricultural organizations strongly urge you to \n     oppose S. 139, the Climate Stewardship Act, or any substitute \n     that may be offered by its sponsors, Senators Joe Lieberman \n     and John McCain, when this measure comes before the Senate. \n     As they have proclaimed, the vote on S. 139 (or its \n     substitute) will be a test vote on the most appropriate \n     response to concerns about our changing climate.\n       Among all the policy options available to the Congress to \n     improve our understanding of climate systems, the arbitrary \n     imposition of energy rationing as embodied in S. 139 is one \n     of the worst possible options the Senate could choose for \n     farmers, industry, the poorest of Americans and the economy \n     as a whole. The Energy Information Administration projects \n     that electricity prices alone would increase 46 percent and \n     the price of gasoline would rise by 40 cents per gallon if \n     this legislation were adopted.\n       When S. 139 is brought up in the Senate under the July 31 \n     unanimous consent agreement, the sponsors of S. 139 will be \n     permitted to offer an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute. They have announced that, in order to increase \n     votes for their proposal, this substitute will eliminate the \n     bill's unrealistic second phase objective of limiting \n     greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 to 1990 emissions levels. \n     However, make no mistake about it; the equally unrealistic \n     first phase of S. 139's reduction mandate of limiting 2010 \n     emission levels to levels of 2000 will, by itself, highly \n     destructive to jobs and prosperity.\n       The sponsors of S. 139 have stated that the first phase of \n     greenhouse gas reductions in their bill would ``only require \n     a 1\\1/2\\ percent reduction from today's greenhouse gas \n     levels.'' However, the Energy Information Administration \n     projects that emissions levels in 2010 would have to be \n     reduced by 14 percent in order to achieve the 2000 emission \n     levels quota set by S. 139's first deadline of 2010. \n     Moreover, S. 139's first phase of reductions would require \n     the economy to have to make additional cuts in fossil energy \n     use every year following 2010, simply to stay under the 2000 \n     emissions cap in the face of increasing demand for more \n     energy from a growing population and economy. Thus, meeting \n     S. 139's first emissions cap would cause increasing, major \n     economic disruptions for farmers, businesses, industry and \n     the poorest Americans who can least afford higher electricity \n     and natural gas price increases in the future. The modified \n     bill will also result in the export of countless additional \n     manufacturing jobs; a unbearable prospect in light of the \n     more than 2.8 million jobs the manufacturing sector has \n     already lost since the summer of 2000.\n       Addressing the climate change issue does not have to come \n     at the expense of the American economy. Voluntary emissions \n     reduction measures and innovative ideas for market-based \n     incentive programs are needed in the near-term, while \n     progress continues to be made in perfecting new technologies \n     to improve efficiency and sequester greenhouse gases. The \n     Senate/House energy conference report on H.R. 6 is \n     expected to contain many provisions to increase energy \n     efficiency; provide incentives for renewable fuel use, \n     nuclear energy and clean coal technologies; and expand \n     energy research and development programs. The Senate does \n     not need to resort to S. 139's command-and-control \n     rationing program to address energy policy.\n       Finally, S. 139 or its substitute would force electric \n     generators to switch from coal to natural gas in order to \n     meet the limits of the bill. The repercussions of a Senate \n     vote to support S. 139 or its substitute cannot be \n     understated. Any indication that the Senate favors coal-\n     switching to natural gas will immediately influence many \n     investment decisions that will affect, not just the future of \n     natural gas prices for all consumers, but the very \n     availability of natural gas for industry in the future. A \n     vote for S. 139 or its substitute would contribute to the \n     current natural gas supply/demand imbalance and almost \n     immediately exacerbate the high natural gas prices and \n     occasional shortages that are already plaguing the economy.\n       On behalf of the men and women in large and small \n     businesses in agriculture, commerce and industry who depend \n     on reasonably priced energy for a prosperous future for this \n     country, we urge you to oppose S. 139 and the sponsors' \n     substitute when this legislation is concerned by the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.\n       American Boiler Manufacturers Association.\n       American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Iron and Steel Institute.\n       Coalition for Affordable and Reliable Energy (CARE).\n       Council of Industrial Boiler Owners.\n       Edison Electric Institute.\n       IPC--The Association Connecting Electronics Industries.\n       National Association of Manufacturers\n       National Corn Growers Association.\n       National Electrical Manufacturers Association.\n       National Mining Association.\n       National Oilseed Processors Association.\n       National Petrochemical & Refiners Association.\n       Portland Cement Association.\n       Small Business Survival Committee.\n       Society of Glass and Ceramic Decorators.\n       The Fertilizer Institute.\n       The Industrial Energy Consumers of America.\n       The Salt Institute.\n       Toy Industry Association.\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, this legislation is the first step in \nour country toward participating in the Kyoto protocol at a time when \nRussia and Australia have indicated they will not ratify the treaty, \nand when China, India, Brazil, and South Korea are exempt because they \nare ``developing countries.''\n  Our trade deficit with China alone is $103 billion. Yet supporters of \nthis legislation want to shut down American plants and send American \njobs overseas to these ``developing countries'' that do not have the \nenvironmental safeguards that we have in America. I can hear the giant \nsucking sound of jobs leaving our country every time I return to Ohio.\n  Let me be perfectly clear, carbon caps are lethal to our economy. \nCarbon caps--any carbon caps--will cause a switch to burning coal with \nclean coal technology. That will cause fuel switching to natural gas. \nIt will mean the end of manufacturing jobs in my State. It will send \nthousands of American jobs overseas and will significantly drive up \nnatural gas and electricity prices and put millions of Americans out of \nwork.\n  Too many Americans have lost their jobs because we have not \nharmonized our energy and environmental policy in this country. We need \na truly comprehensive energy policy that protects our environment while \nalso protecting our energy security and our economy. We do not need \nlegislation such as S. 139 that attempts to protect the environment \nwhile completely disregarding negative impacts on our energy security \nand economy.\n  As I stated last night, I strongly oppose any legislation that will \nexacerbate the loss of jobs in my State and drive up the cost of energy \nfor the least of our brethren, the poor and the elderly. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Voinovich for making his \nstatement. I will be specific. The amount of jobs in his State alone, \nif this passes, would be 178,000.\n  For any other Members who want to know how their States will be \naffected, we have that breakdown. It is a study by Penn State \nUniversity. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S13583]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, \nSenator Lieberman, for yielding me time.\n  Mr. President, I have heard three arguments against this legislation \nsince I have been privileged to hear this debate. The first argument is \nthere is no such thing as climate change. Climate change is a reality \nif we are to believe the scientists we hire or who are willing to \nadvise us.\n  A clear consensus of the scientific community is there is a change \ngoing on. The global climate is warming, and that is a fact.\n  The second argument I have heard is, OK, even if there is such a \nthing as climate change, there is no real proof human activity is the \ncause of that climate change. Again, I point out the scientific \ncommunity believes it. The scientific community says human activity \nover the last 150 years has been a major contributor to the problem. \nMost of these human activities that contribute to this problem relate \nto energy production and use. Carbon dioxide emissions account for 84 \npercent of the annual emissions of greenhouse gases in the United \nStates and 98 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions are associated \nwith energy production or use.\n  The third argument which I have heard this morning is we do not \ntotally understand this issue and, therefore, the Congress should not \nbe legislating. If we use that standard, we will not legislate on \nvirtually any subject in this body. Clearly, we have to take the best \ninformation we have, make the best judgments we can, and then if we \nfind we are in error, we can adjust our policies as we move forward.\n  As the ranking member of the Energy Committee, I have argued \nrepeatedly for the last several years that part of our national energy \npolicy and part of the energy legislation we were trying to craft \nshould be a recognition of the importance of climate change, and we \nshould include in a bill some provision for dealing with climate change \nissues. Unfortunately, I am informed the energy conference that is \nstill in existence, although it does not meet, will not include any \nlanguage related to climate change, even though the bill the Senate \nproduced does contain some provisions in that regard.\n  This is an issue of global concern. It is sad that the United States \nis not leading this debate. We should have a leadership role, both \nbecause we have the capability to understand the science and to do the \nscience, and the technology. We also have the capability to come up \nwith an appropriate response. It is sad we are not doing that.\n  This administration has totally failed to lead with regard to this \nissue. The President's plan to deal with the greenhouse gases has been \nlittle more than a business-as-usual approach. The President's \nvoluntary target of an 18 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity \nover the next decade sounds impressive until one looks at the data. The \napproach will allow climate-altering pollution to continue to climb as \nlong as it increases more slowly than our economy grows.\n  The voluntary commitments would meet a goal that are no more \naggressive than business as usual. Greenhouse gas pollution intensity \nin the United States has been declining because the part of our economy \nthat is growing the fastest is the service sector, which produces fewer \ngreenhouse gases than manufacturing for certain. President Bush's \nvoluntary approach will not change the trend in greenhouse gas \nemissions over what is likely to happen anyway, and it certainly does \nnot put us on a path to reductions in the future.\n  We have been trying a voluntary approach to reducing greenhouse \npollution for almost a decade, and greenhouse gas emissions have \nactually increased 14 percent. Many of the commitments industry is \nmaking today are the same or similar to what these companies promised \nnearly a decade ago.\n  While negotiations on an international framework to address global \nwarming continue for the next several years, our domestic industry will \nhave to make significant investment decisions on new energy \ninfrastructure. We have no domestic framework on greenhouse gas \nemissions that would guide or even inform these investment decisions. \nAddressing these issues up front would reduce business costs and risks. \nMaintaining our present course will increase the probability of future \neconomic losses and waste in the energy sector.\n  This Climate Stewardship Act is a modest first step in trying to deal \nwith this important issue. Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain deserve \ngreat credit for forcing this issue to be considered in the Senate \ntoday and to be voted on. They have put together an innovative \nframework that deserves our attention. It is unfortunate, frankly, that \nthis bill was not able to receive the hearings in committee it \ndeserves. The debate should be no longer about whether climate change \nis a reality, which is what we have been talking about on the Senate \nfloor, but instead on how we can deal with it. Ideally, the debate we \nwould be having on the Senate floor would be to consider amendments, to \nconsider alternatives to this proposal, so we could come to grips with \nthis very difficult issue. I would prefer to be offering amendments on \nways in which the framework could be improved, but given the \npoliticizing that has surrounded this scientific and environmental \nissue, I am left with only one option, and that is to vote for the bill \nand send a signal that the Senate must show leadership on climate \nchange.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Mr. Sununu. I hope we will look very carefully at the \nchart he has. It is probably the most significant chart, other than the \njobs chart we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, we have heard a number of speakers who I \nthink have raised a number of important points. We have heard questions \nand discussions about the science of climate change. The science is \nimportant, and over time we hope to better understand the Earth's \nclimate. I hope this is an area where we do research, where we can \ndevelop better models. It is one of the most complex areas of \ninvestigation.\n  We have heard about the costs, both direct costs of this legislation \nthat will increase energy costs for everyone in America, but also \nindirect costs, because other countries that have been mentioned by \nSenator Voinovich, for example, such as China, India, Brazil, Russia, \nor Australia, do not adopt such stringent controls on emissions, and \nthey will benefit by American jobs moving overseas.\n  In particular, it stands to reason in those areas of our economy that \nare most dependent on energy as an import, energy incentive industries \nlike manufacturing, steel, smelting, and the like, those are the jobs \nthat will be the first to go overseas.\n  I want to speak about the environmental issue because if we look \nclosely at the environmental impact of this legislation, it actually \nundermines the legislation. It shows its weakness and it illustrates \nwhy it should not be adopted. If we were to agree on the increase in \ntemperature of the last 50 or 100 years, agree there was some \nrelationship between manmade emissions of CO2 and that increase, and \nassume the full impact of the Climate Change Commission, the IPCC and \nthe Kyoto protocols, let us look at what the environmental impact might \nbe. This is a forecast of increasing temperatures over the next 50 \nyears, a forecast projected increase of up to 1.2 degrees Celsius, \nmaybe 2 degrees Fahrenheit. The benefits of Kyoto are enormously small, \nperhaps one or two-tenths of a degree Celsius. Over 100 years, if the \nprojected change is 4 or 5 degrees Fahrenheit, the impact of Kyoto \nmight be four or five-tenths of one degree.\n  The question is: What benefit would that provide at the significant \neconomic costs that are not likely but certain? Supporters have pointed \nout their legislation, but our legislation is not as dramatic as Kyoto. \nIt is not as harsh as Kyoto, and that means the environmental benefit \nwill be even less.\n  Questionable environmental benefit, enormous cost. I certainly urge \nmy colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator's \ntime has expired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n\n[[Page S13584]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes 59 seconds on the minority \nside; 17 minutes 11 seconds on the majority side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Who is the minority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Well, I do not know. That is a good question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time is controlled by Senator Inhofe and how \nmuch time is controlled by Senator Lieberman?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Lieberman has 20 minutes 59 seconds.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield however much of the 10 minutes \nSenator McCain will eventually have as he wishes to consume now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to use 8 minutes of my 10 \nminutes.\n  My favorite author is Ernest Hemingway, as he is of many millions of \npeople throughout the world. One of his most famous short stories is \nentitled ``The Snows Of Kilimanjaro.'' At the beginning of the short \nstory he says:\n\n       Kilimanjaro is a snow covered mountain 19,710 feet high, \n     and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. Its western \n     summit is called by the Masai ``Ngaje Ngaje,'' the House of \n     God. Close to the western summit there is the dried and \n     frozen carcass of a leopard. No one has explained what the \n     leopard was seeking at that attitude.\n\n  As the photograph shows here, the snows of Kilimanjaro may soon exist \nonly in literature.\n  There has been a lot of debate here about the scientific evidence--\n17,000 scientists say this, 10,000 scientists say that, my scientist \nsays this--although clearly the National Academy of Sciences and other \norganizations including the World Meteorological Organization, I think, \nand others, should have some weight with my colleagues.\n  If I might quote the punch line from an old joke, ``You can believe \nme or your lyin' eyes.''\n  These are facts. These are facts that cannot be refuted by any \nscientist or any union or any special interest that is weighing in more \nheavily on this issue than any issue since we got into campaign finance \nreform.\n  That is the Arctic Sea. That is the Arctic Sea. If you look at the \nred line, that is the boundary of it in 1979. Look at it now. You can \nbelieve me or your lyin' eyes.\n  Look at Mount Kilimanjaro. That picture was taken in 1993. That \npicture was taken in February of the year 2000.\n  All of us cherish our national parks. Have a look at the Glacier \nNational Park, which will have to have its name changed. The picture \nabove was taken in 1932. That is a glacier ice cake. This picture is \nfrom the Glacier National Park archives. That is from 1932. Look at it \n50 years later. It is not there. There will be no more glaciers in \nGlacier National Park, so we may have to give it a different name.\n  We see devastating fires across California. It is very interesting \nthat we have this debate while devastating fires, unprecedented in \nnature, are sweeping across California, fueled by unusual drought \nconditions. I don't have to tell people what the consequences of that \nare.\n  An ice dam lake drained recently when the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, which \na century ago rimmed the coast, broke up along the coast of northeast \nCanada. NASA has confirmed that part of the Arctic Ocean that remains \nfrozen year round has been shrinking at a rate of 10 percent per decade \nsince 1980. At a conference in Iceland in August, scientists told \nsenior government officials the Arctic is heating up fast, disclosing \ndisturbing figures from a massive study of polar climate change.\n  Dr. Robert Corell, who heads the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment \nTeam, said:\n\n       If you want to see what will be happening in the rest of \n     the world 25 years from now, look at what is happening in the \n     Arctic.\n  Destruction of 70 percent of heat-sensitive coral reefs, in the \nworld--70 percent of the heat-sensitive coral reefs in the world due to \nincreases in water temperatures--places reef fisheries in jeopardy. I \ndon't know what happens when the beginning of the food chain \ndisappears.\n  There is increasing coastal damage from hurricanes. Researchers at \nthe University of Texas, Wesleyan University, and Stanford University \nearlier this year reported in the journal Nature that global warming is \nforcing species around the world, from California starfish to alpine \nherbs, to move into new ranges or altered habitats that could disrupt \necosystems.\n  In an article in the July 3 Journal of Hydrology, ``Winters In New \nEngland Are Getting Shorter,'' according to the USGS scientists, \nnorthern New England winters have receded by 1 to 2 weeks during the \npast 30 years.\n  Paul Eckstine, Harvard Medical School:\n\n       Concerns about climate change are often mistakenly placed \n     into the distant future but as the rate of climate change \n     increases, so do the biological responses and costs \n     associated with warming and unstable weather. The influence \n     of intensifying drought on the spread of west Nile virus in \n     the U.S., and the impacts of rising carbon dioxide levels on \n     allergies and asthma, demonstrate that global warming has \n     come into our backyards.\n\n  Finally, Dr. Adare of the Climate Research Committee of the National \nAcademy of Sciences, says:\n\n       The planet has a fever and it is time to take action.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues not to listen so much to the \nopinions of labor unions, business special interests, or even \nscientists. Look at what is happening around the world. Use your eyes \nto see what is happening. The devastation wrought by climate change so \nfar has been remarkable.\n  There is a long series of happenings around the world. Key reports \nhave been issued in the last few years by a number of bodies composed \nof the world's most eminent climate scientists, including the United \nNations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the National Academy \nof Sciences, U.S. Global Change Research Program, and these experts all \nreached the same conclusions:\n  No. 1. Greenhouse gasses are increasing in the atmosphere because of \nhuman activities and they are trapping increasingly more heat.\n  No. 2. Increased amounts of greenhouse gases are projected to cause \nirreparable harm as they lead to increased global temperatures and \nhigher sea levels.\n  No. 3. The gases we emit to the atmosphere today will remain for \ndecades or longer. Every time we emit now will require greater \nreductions later, making it more difficult to protect the environment.\n  It is interesting to me that in July of the year 2003, Governor \nPataki of New York announced that 9 States had formally agreed to join \nNew York in developing a regional strategy in the Northeast to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions--10 States. The States agreeing to participate \nare Connecticut, New Jersey, Vermont, New Hampshire, Delaware, Maine, \nPennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. The cap-and-trade \ninitiative recommended by Governor Pataki would include developing a \nmarket-based emissions trading system that would apply to power \ngenerators emitting carbon dioxide, and it is modeled after the highly \nsuccessful acid rain program of the 1990 Clean Air Act.\n  This amendment is modeled on the highly successful acid rain program \nof the 1990 Clean Air Act. It is modest in its proportions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 8 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while I appreciate the comments made by my \ngood friend from Arizona, I would only say some of the things there--I \nknow he doesn't intend to say things that aren't true. I would like to \nquote an article that was in this morning's USA Today. James Morison, \nwho is a scientist with the University of Washington--this is a front \npage article in USA Today--said the temperature increases and the \nshifts in winds and ocean currents occurred early in the 1990s and have \nsince ``relaxed.'' This is a recent discovery.\n\n       These big changes ``are not related to (global) climate \n     change.''\n\n  This was just in this morning's paper, speaking of the Arctic Circle.\n  So if we have time, when I have a chance to wind up, I want to repeat \nsome of the things I said about the flawed science on which all these \nthings are based. Until then, I recognize the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, for a time not to exceed 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S13585]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nvery critical issue of global warming and to summarize events of recent \nyears that have led us to this point. We are discussing the paramount \nenergy and environmental challenge of our time; namely, the inexorable \nincrease in greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere that will lead to \nchanges in the global climate.\n  The primary contributor to global warming is the burning of fossil \nfuels that create carbon dioxide, and it remains in the atmosphere for \nover a century. These human-produced emissions are adding to a growing \nconcentration in the global atmosphere that is expected to more than \ndouble by the end of this century. Therefore, we are bequeathing this \nproblem and its consequences to our children, our grandchildren, and \nour great grandchildren.\n  While I am very concerned about the challenge posed by global \nwarming, let me state at the outset that I have long been a strong \ncritic of climate change policies that are not in the national interest \nof the United States. I will yield to no one on that point. I have \ninsisted on a rational and cost-effective approach to dealing with \nclimate change.\n  As the coauthor, along with Senator Hagel, of S. Res. 98, that passed \n95 to zero in 1997, during the 105th Congress, I sought at that time to \nexpress the sense of the Senate regarding the provisions of any future \nbinding, international agreement that would be acceptable to the \nSenate. The Kyoto protocol, in its current form, does not comply with \nthe requirements of S. Res. 98. That resolution was supported by many \nindustrial trade associations and opposed by many environmental \norganizations.\n  While those on both sides of the issue have attributed many \ninterpretations and misinterpretations to S. Res. 98, no one has \nmisrepresented and misconstrued S. Res. 98 more so than this present \nadministration.\n  S. Res. 98 was intended to provide the sense of the Senate on what \nshould be included in any future binding international treaty. The \nresolution laid out the conditions under which the Senate could agree \nto a new binding treaty that would subsequently be considered at the \nKyoto conference. S. Res. 98 directed that any such treaty must include \nnew scheduled commitments for the developing world in addition to any \nsuch requirements for industrialized nations but requirements that \nwould be binding and mandatory and lead to real reductions in the \nemissions of greenhouse gases over time. This is clearly different than \nthe minimal, vague, and voluntary commitments that we are currently \npursuing.\n  As I explained in 1997, a voluntary approach had already been tried \nand had already failed. The United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change, also known as the Rio Convention, failed to reduce \nemissions largely because it was voluntary. That is why Kyoto concerned \nbinding commitments, and S. Res. 98 was intended to guide that effort \nrather than kill that effort.\n  The administration's climate team has merely returned to the \nvoluntary approach of Rio, despite a complete lack of evidence that \nthis so-called plan will ever succeed. Industrial nations have never \ninitiated significant reductions in pollution of any type on a strictly \nvoluntary basis. This administration must finally come to terms with \ntaking action toward globally binding commitments.\n  As well, developing nations, especially the largest emitters, need to \nbe a part of any binding global climate change treaty. Another point \nthat has been misunderstood is what S. Res. 98 would require of \ndeveloping countries. An international treaty with binding commitments \ncan and should provide for the continued growth of the world's \ndeveloping nations. Unrealistically stringent emissions targets need \nnot choke off their economic growth. The initial commitments could be \nrelatively modest, pacing upwards depending on various factors, with a \nspecific goal to be achieved. Today, however, the world is even further \naway from a credible, workable global strategy to deal on climate \nchange than we were in 1997.\n  The blame for this circumstance can be laid squarely at the feet of \nthis administration which abandoned international negotiations in which \nit could have kept pressure on developing nations to agree to some \nlevel of mandatory emissions reductions. Moreover, developing nations \nshould be a prime market for clean energy technology projects. But, \nwith little pressure on those nations to reduce or contain the growth \nof emissions, a huge and fruitful market for those types of \ntechnologies--technologies that are being developed in the U.S.--is \nlikely to dry up. In other words, while this nation has been making \ngreat strides in developing technologies to use our own energy \nresources more efficiently and more cleanly, significant efforts to \nhelp deploy these technologies overseas have been undercut by this \nadministration's unilateral approach to climate change.\n  Thus, S. Res. 98 was an effort to strengthen the hand of the \nadministration as it undertook international negotiations. It enabled \nour negotiators to walk into talks and point to the ever-present \nCongress, looking over their shoulders, to ensure that the interests of \nthe U.S. would be protected in any agreement that eventually came to \nfruition.\n  The Bush administration has never understood the value of S. Res 98. \nRather than employing that tool to positively influence international \nnegotiations, it used the resolution as cover to simply walk away from \nthe table. Having abandoned a constructive role in the global \nnegotiations on climate change, this administration has left the U.S. \nin a much weaker position globally.\n  The Bush administration must be challenged on its environmental, \neconomic, and energy responsibilities, both domestically and \ninternationally. The U.S. is in the best position of any nation to \npositively influence an international response to global climate \nchange. Yet, we will all suffer from the consequences of global warming \nin the long run because we are all in the same global boat.\n  This administration has attempted to hide behind S. Res. 98 to defend \nits current do-nothing and know-nothing policies on climate change, and \nI strongly object to that. The difference between my view and that of \nthis administration is simple. I believe the problem is real and \ndemands action. The administration does not. The President also claimed \nearly in his administration that his goal was to oppose Kyoto. If the \nPresident's representatives had stayed at the table and negotiated in \ngood faith on a treaty to comply with S. Res. 98, then the \nadministration could have guided the world toward a new binding treaty \nwith mandatory requirements to reduce emissions that would correct the \ndeficiencies of Kyoto.\n  The reality is quite different. Our nation has been represented at \nthe international negotiations in name only. We would be better \nrepresented at the international negotiations by a row of empty chairs. \nThat would at least accurately represent the vacuous nature of our \ncurrent policies. For President Bush not only disavowed the Kyoto \nProtocol; he also turned his back on any negotiations because they \nconcern a binding treaty that includes mandatory commitments. The rest \nof the world was outraged by this unilateral rejection of a decade of \nnegotiations and of the new American isolationist approach to deal with \nclimate change.\n  And what will happen in one year or five years when a new \nadministration enters office? What will happen if Russia does decide to \nratify the Kyoto Protocol, and it enters into force? Will the \nadministration be able to go back to the table and demand changes to \nbinding international law that will have been in force for perhaps many \nyears? The President's industry supporters may one day wake up and \nrealize that they live in a partially Kyoto-controlled world where \nthere is no turning back.\n  One senses confusion and a lack of direction in the administration. \nIt seems that the administration's right hand does not know what the \nfar right hand is doing regarding its climate change policies. The \nWhite House does not know whether to believe the science or not, and \nthey have certainly not articulated a plan of action.\n  Finally, I am compelled to observe that it is the height of hypocrisy \nfor this administration or its supporters in industry to claim that \nthey are defending the goals and provisions of S. Res.\n\n[[Page S13586]]\n\n98. They cannot make such a claim in the debate today or in any \ninternational forum. Nothing could be further from the truth. This \nadministration can no longer hide behind the mantle of that resolution.\n  It is this administration that undermined the tenets of that \nresolution. They now support only vague, voluntary measures. That is \ntrue both domestically and internationally. The evidence suggests that \nthe President's negotiators have even formed an alliance with the key \nemitters in the developing world, and together they oppose any \nadditional discussion during the international negotiations of binding \ncommitments for the developing world as called for under S. Res. 98. \nThat is of course a logical result of the administration's policies, \nsince it is impossible to apply binding commitments to China if we \nrefuse to apply such standards to ourselves. We now have little hope of \nseeing an effort made to produce a treaty that will comply with S. Res. \n98--at least not during the tenure of this President.\n  If there is no prospect for a binding international treaty, then how \ncan we deal with the enormous challenge posed by global warming? The \ncritics of the amendment before us argue that we should stay the course \nand support the President's policies. If I may ask--what are those \npolicies? What concrete programs have been put in place? In point \nof fact, the administration has asked the industry trade associations \nto develop their own voluntary reduction programs. The proposals are \nvague and actually allow emissions to continue to increase. Taken \ntogether, none of these programs is expected to result in any serious \ndecrease in emissions.\n\n  These events over the last three years have led me to conclude that \nwe must look elsewhere for effective action on global warming. The \nSenate should not be put in the position in which it now stands. It \nshould not be faced, as we are now, with the prospect of considering an \nenergy bill devoid of provisions to address climate change. The Senate \nshould be considering our nation's energy security from a broad view \nthat includes a global response to climate change and the international \npolitics of energy.\n  Proponents of the amendment now before us argue that it sends the \nclear message to the White House: If President Bush rejects the advice \nof this body, then he is refusing to negotiate in good faith toward a \nbinding international treaty and is only offering hollow domestic \nprograms. The Senate has little choice but to consider further steps, \nincluding modest mandatory approaches, that would apply to our domestic \neconomy.\n  The amended version of S. 139 freezes emissions at their current \nlevels rather than seeking a sharp reduction as has been the case in \nother approaches. The McCain-Lieberman bill also allows companies to \noffset their emissions, for example by planting trees that absorb and \nsequester carbon dioxide (CO2) or by constructing more \nefficient power plants in the developing world than what those nations \nwould otherwise build--and claim the difference as an earned offset or \ncredit.\n  I would prefer not to be faced with a measure like this today. I note \nthat this bill has not had committee consideration. That said, it is \nvery much the case that several key chairmen with jurisdiction over \nenergy or environmental policy have shown very little interest in \nseriously dealing with climate change. We have certainly witnessed this \nin the energy bill. I want to further commend Senators McCain and \nLieberman for their diligence and hard work to find a middle ground. \nThey have come a long way on this proposal. If the principles of their \nproposal were combined with those of other Members like mine, then the \nSenate could have a strong package to offer the American people. While \nI will not be able to vote for the amendment today, I want to make it \nvery clear that I will work with the sponsors of this bill and other \nRepublican and Democratic Senators who want to go beyond this \nadministration's empty-headed approach.\n  In closing, I want to express my own growing frustration for our \nseeming inability to deal with the problem at hand. I have been \ntroubled by this for a long time. I do not believe I need any more \nscientific evidence to show that we have seen these changes. I have \nseen the changes in weather patterns, and those changes that I have \npersonally seen during my nearly 86 years lead me to believe that there \nis something happening. We need to do something about it. What we do \nmay be painful in some respects, but we owe it to our children and \ngrandchildren to have the foresight to see that something is happening \nand to understand that we ought to do something about it soon. If not, \nwe may be going beyond retrieval.\n  So, I would say again that the two Senators are to be very much \ncomplimented. I will vote with Mr. Inhofe, for the reasons I have \nstated. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Byrd for his statement. \nObviously, I regret that he is not going to support the McCain-\nLieberman proposal today. But I appreciate very much this fact: He \nrecognizes that there is a problem here. I don't know how some of our \ndistinguished colleagues can say there is not a problem. The science is \nthere. The facts are there. We see it with our own eyes. We can \ndisagree on what to do about the problem.\n  But Senator Byrd, with his characteristic directness and honesty and \nsense of history, has recognized that there is a problem. I look \nforward to working with him in the months ahead to see that we can \nfashion together a common ground response that will deal with the \nproblem that he quite honestly has recognized. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I thank \nour colleagues for the work they have done. I, again, thank Senator \nInhofe.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware who has been an active, helpful, and constructive supporter of \nthis proposal, for which I thank him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lieberman and Senator \nMcCain and others who brought this legislation to the floor. I stand \ntoday as a cosponsor of the amended version of the McCain-Lieberman \nClimate Stewardship Act and I will vote for it today. I do so because I \nbelieve it is a sensible first step toward addressing the real problem \nof increasing levels of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming \nabout which Senator Byrd and others have spoken.\n  Senator Byrd, Senator McCain, and others have spoken about the \nconvincing science which shows that not only greenhouse gas emissions \nare increasing but also that those emissions are linked to human \nactivity and are having a negative impact on the climate in which we \nlive.\n  Ten years ago I would not have stood here. Ten years ago I would not \nhave been arguing that we should take mandatory steps toward addressing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. But over the past decade or so as I learned \nmore about the issue and had the opportunity to speak with people on \nboth sides of this debate, and as Senator McCain said, to see with my \nown eyes the changes that are occurring in this world, I have become \nconvinced there is a real problem. It is not going away. We can do \nsomething about it. We can do something about it now. We should.\n  Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain should be commended for their \nwork on this bill and for their willingness to make a significant \nmodification to their original proposal. I don't know that I would have \nbeen so supportive of the original bill because of reductions that were \nrequired in that bill. Having said that, the modified version before \nthe Senate today which seeks to turn over the balance of this decade \ngreenhouse emissions to levels of the year 2000 has my strong support.\n  The fact is, if the Federal Government does not act in a meaningful \nway, and do so soon, the problem will get worse and the solution, when \nit comes, will be even more difficult and more disruptive of our \neconomy and our way of living.\n  Addressing greenhouse gasses is a proper role for the Federal \nGovernment. In yesterday's New York Times, a reporter, Jennifer Lee, \nwrote about the increasing number of States fed up with a lack of \ncertainty from the Federal Government with regard to climate change \npolicy. Half the States, according to the article, have taken steps to \naddress global warming.\n\n[[Page S13587]]\n\n  On the one hand, I view the States' efforts as a positive \ndevelopment. However, regulating greenhouse gasses via 50 different \nlaws is not, my friends, the best way to proceed on this issue. It is \nbest for both the industries that will have to comply with these laws \nand the ecological benefits we expect from the passage that we adopt a \nuniform Federal standard. The Climate Stewardship Act does just that.\n  My own State of Delaware is proud to be the home of the DuPont \nCompany, a global company with products touching each of us every day. \nDuPont is a major producer of greenhouse gasses. One might think they \nwould be opposed to this legislation, but as it turns out they are not. \nThey view this bill as a significant and serious contribution to the \ncongressional debate on how to address climate change.\n  They think it is particularly noteworthy for three reasons, and I \nwill mention those: No. 1, the measure includes market-based systems to \nachieve reductions efficiency; No. 2, it covers more than one sector of \nthe economy; No. 3, it provides credit incentives for early action and \nincludes flexibility mechanisms to allow companies to seek lower cost \nsolutions that achieve the desired results.\n  DuPont is just one example of a company that has stepped forward and \ntaken steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions not because they have to \nbut because they believe it is the right thing to do.\n  DuPont kept its energy use flat between 1990 and 2000, while at the \nsame time increasing production by 35 percent. That means they found \nways to become more efficient and thereby avoid increasing greenhouse \ngas emissions. If a company such as DuPont can find a way to meet the \nrequirements of this bill, I suspect that just about any company can do \nthe same.\n  In closing, today's vote is one of the more important votes we will \ntake during our time in the Senate, certainly one of the more important \nvotes of this year. In my mind, the issue it addresses is as important \nas the vote to authorize the President to use force in Iraq or whether \nwe will make major changes in Medicare prescription drugs.\n  What we decide today will have a significant impact for our future. \nWhile we will not see noticeable, positive or negative effects before \nnext year's Presidential election, or before next year's Senate \nelections, within our lifetime, as sure as we are gathered here today, \nit will be clear that we have made the right choice or, I might add, if \nwe have made the wrong one.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in what I believe is the right choice \nand that is a ``yes'' vote for the Climate Stewardship Act.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \ndiscuss S. 139, the Climate Stewardship Act and lay out the reasons I \nam supporting this bill.\n  The chief reason I support this bill is that I believe, as do the \nmajority of scientists, that global climate change is occurring, and is \ndue in part to human activities. I also believe that the U.S. has a \nresponsibility to provide international and domestic leadership on this \nissue, and to begin to take action. This body, the U.S. Senate, has now \npassed three separate Sense of Congress Resolutions, this year and last \nyear, urging U.S. leadership and reengagement in the international \nprocess to address global warming, and meaningful U.S. domestic action \nto begin to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate \nchange. Two of these resolutions were included in the comprehensive \nenergy bills passed by this body this year and last. Despite these \nresolutions, the United States remains inactive on these issues. We are \nnot displaying enough leadership on combating global warming, either \ndomestically or abroad. And we are beginning to see some early warning \nsignals about the consequences if we persist in our inaction.\n  The World Meteorological Organization, WMO, in July of this year \nissued an unprecedented alert, saying: ``Record extremes in weather and \nclimate events continue to occur around the world. Recent scientific \nassessments indicate that, as the global temperatures continue to warm \ndue to climate change, the number and intensity of extreme events might \nincrease.'' They go on to say that: ``New record extreme events occur \nevery year somewhere in the globe, but in recent years the number of \nsuch extremes has been increasing.'' And, ``(w)hile the trend towards \nwarmer globally averaged surface temperatures has been uneven over the \ncourse of the last century, the trend for the period since 1976 is \nroughly three times that for the past 100 years as a whole.''\n  In the United States, the WMO cited record-breaking statistics in a \nparticularly dangerous category of extreme weather events: nationwide, \n562 tornadoes occurred in May, 2003, resulting in 41 deaths--a record \nfor the number of tornadoes in any month, far surpassing the June, 1992 \nU.S. record of 399 tornadoes.\n  In Iowa, as in much of the midwest, we have been experiencing a \ndrought--a drought that is hurting my states' farmers, and farmers \nacross the midwest and west. These dramatic weather events that we are \nexperiencing--the tornadoes, the drought, the warming--these are \nexactly what scientists have been predicting would occur with \nunmitigated global warming. These events should not come as a surprise \nto any of us, they have been predicted for some years now.\n  The bill we are debating, the Climate Stewardship Act, will take the \nfirst, modest steps to put into place a U.S. system to begin to reduce \nour greenhouse gas emissions, to begin to take action. It will respond \nto the science, and it will do it in a manner that this administration \nhas failed to do--with meaningful policies that will not harm the U.S. \neconomy, but will at least put us on the right path.\n  Now I know some Members of this body and of some organizations and \nindustries have expressed concerns that taking action will harm the \nU.S. economy, and will impact energy supplies. While their concerns are \nlegitimate, they are misplaced, because scientists, economists and \nanalysts in this administration and in the private sector agree that \nthis bill that we are debating will not be onerous for the overall \neconomy or for the various industries it impacts. The Energy \nInformation Agency in the Department of Energy and the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology, in separate assessments of the bill, indicate \nit will have minimal impacts on fuel prices and will even lower fuel \nprices in the case of natural gas, for instance, by generating \nefficiencies and providing market signals to drive efficiency. \nFurthermore, the bill has specific provisions to encourage clean, \nrenewable fuel production from the agricultural sector and other \nsectors, which would not only reduce our reliance on imports of oil, \nbut would also benefit the agricultural economy and the environment by \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. I support those provisions.\n  Some critics have said that this bill would prevent the burning of \ncoal, and would force coal-burning utilities to switch to using only \nnatural gas. That is simply not true. Under this bill, coal use will \nactually increase, and financial incentives for clean coal technologies \nare also provided.\n  According to the MIT analysis of the bill, coal use will continue to \nexpand 12 percent over current usage levels, out to 2025, which is the \ntime frame that MIT looked at. Additionally, coal prices per metric ton \nare expected to drop 4 percent by 2015, and 5 percent by 2020.\n  A portion of the proceeds from the auctioning or sale of allowances \nin the bill will go to technology deployment programs. Specifically, \nintegrated coal gasification systems will receive significant financial \nincentives. Such clean coal technologies are not only beneficial to the \nenvironment, but will ensure continued usage of this valuable fuel \nsource well into the future, in an environmentally benign manner.\n  The agricultural sector and rural areas will continue to bear the \nbrunt of severe weather events that can devastate farmers and rural \neconomies as long as our inaction continues. However, U.S. agriculture \ncan also make important, cost-effective contributions to offset a \nportion of U.S. emissions of greenhouse gasses in the near- and medium-\nterm. With the proper incentives, agriculture can provide a low-cost \nbridge to a less fossil-fuel and greenhouse gas intensive future, while \nimproving the sustainability and perhaps the profitability of this \nvital economic sector. The Climate Stewardship Act,\n\n[[Page S13588]]\n\nprovides some of these incentives. A provision in the bill that I \nparticularly support is financial incentives, through the auctioning of \npermits to capped sectors, to agricultural practices to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, including clean, renewable energy sources, \nsuch as wind power.\n  Agriculture can play an important role in mitigating global warming, \nand can provide valuable benefits to society. Carbon is a commodity \nalready being traded and sold in this country and others, and farmers \ncan not only ``farm'' for carbon, they can reap the rewards under this \nbill, and help keep costs of action down.\n  To make sure farmers can take advantage of this opportunity, I have \nnegotiated with Senators McCain and Lieberman to guarantee that a \nspecific portion of the credits that can be sold into this cap-and-\ntrade system in the bill will be set aside for soil carbon \nsequestration. Soil carbon sequestration reduces U.S. net emissions of \ngreenhouse gasses but also improves air and water quality by reducing \nrun-off, and improves soil moisture retention. Soil carbon \nsequestration occurs through improved management practices such as no-\ntill or reduced-till farming, the use of shelterbelts, grass waterways, \nwetland restoration, and improved irrigation systems, to name but a \nfew. But most importantly for the farm sector, soil carbon enhances \nagricultural sustainability and profitability. We know this because \nagricultural and soil scientists have studied this issue for years--not \nbecause of global warming, but because of the associated environmental \nimprovements and the improved crop productivity associated with greater \nsoil carbon. These are complementary objectives with nice overlap. As a \nkey benefit soil carbon sequestration has the potential to offset fully \n10 percent of U.S. annual carbon emissions.\n  To help ensure that farmers and others in the agricultural sector \nthoroughly understand the issue of climate change, and that they can \nbenefit from an emerging carbon market, we have negotiated additional \nlanguage to institute an education and outreach initiative within USDA. \nThe program would provide detailed information as well as technical \nassistance to these individuals and groups, as well as allow for the \ncreation or utilization of existing centers on climate change.\n  This is a win-win policy for agriculture, for our citizens, and of \ncourse for our environment. That is why I support this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I rise today in support of S. 139, the Climate Stewardship \nAct. I am pleased that the Senate is finally going to have an open and \nhonest discussion about climate change, greenhouse emissions, global \nwarming and their effects on the Nation and the world. It is clear that \nit is time for the Senate to act and pass this important legislation.\n  Climate change and global warming could cause grave problems to our \nNation's economy, especially the economy of the Northeast. The economy \nof my home State of Vermont relies heavily on the revenue brought in \nfrom the maple, forest and ski industries. Maple syrup production is a \nmajor source of revenue in Vermont and there could be a dramatic loss \nof maple production in Vermont and the rest of the Northeast if fuel \nemissions continue to go unchecked.\n  There are about 2,000 maple farms in my home State, and most of them \nare family-owned businesses. Many if not all of these farms could \nsuffer from a decrease in maple sugar income, and eventually they could \nlose their farms altogether. I have heard from many maple producers \nfrom my State who say they are tapping trees earlier every year. It \nused to be that Vermonters were tapping their trees around Town Meeting \nDay, the first Tuesday in March. Now, some are forced to tap a month \nearlier, during the first week in February. According to a report done \nby U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy, sugar maple could \neventually recede from all U.S. regions but the northern tip of Maine \nby 2100. This is unacceptable, but it is also preventable, and that is \nwhy the Senate should pass the Climate Stewardship Act of 2003.\n  One maple syrup producer from Vermont has become so concerned about \nthe negative effects of global warming that he has joined a lawsuit \nagainst the Export Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation. The plaintiffs in this case claim that these companies \nhave illegally provided more than $32 billion for overseas oil fields, \npipelines, and coal-fired power plants over the past 10 years without \nassessing their impact on global warming as required by law. The \nplaintiffs are not seeking financial compensation, only compliance with \nthe National Environment Policy Act, which requires all Federal \nagencies to assess their programs' contributions to global warming.\n  Vermont also relies on revenue from the ski industry. Vermonters and \nothers from all over the country enjoy the ski resorts in Vermont. \nThere is a strong relationship between winter skiing conditions, the \nnumber of customers, and whether a ski resort has a successful or \nunsuccessful ski season. Vermont resort operators have already had to \nmake improvements to snowmaking technology to ensure there is enough \nsnow for the entire ski season. This can cost resorts hundreds of \nthousands of dollars. Warmer weather also means the resorts open later. \nIn 2001, Killington Ski Resort, the largest ski resort in Vermont \nrecorded its latest opening date in more than 15 years.\n  Many ski resorts across the country are doing their part to slow \nglobal warming. Four ski resorts in Vermont: Haystack Ski Area, \nKillington and Pico Resorts, Mad River Glen, and Mount Snow Resort have \nall adopted a policy on climate change to address the problem of global \nwarming. Mount Snow Resort has cut energy consumption in half at the \nMain Base Lodge and Snow Lake Lodge by replacing hundreds of \nconventional light bulbs with compact fluorescents. They have also \ninstalled dozens of energy-efficient snowmaking tower guns, which \nreduce the energy needed to pump water and compressed air. I commend \nthe efforts of these ski lodges and I believe that we should act today \nand do our part to reduce global warming.\n  I have two grandchildren a 5-year-old grandson and a granddaughter \nwho is not quite a year old. I want them to be able to enjoy Vermont as \nI have: snow-covered Green Mountains in the winter, beautiful foliage \nin the fall, and Vermont maple syrup on pancakes as often as they \nplease. It is time the U.S. took action to curb our greenhouse gas \nemissions. We can no longer look the other way as the rest of the world \nmoves ahead while the current administration ignores global warming.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I stand to applaud the efforts of \nSenators Lieberman and McCain for pushing forward with a sensible and \nmodest plan to address the threat of global warming.\n  I would prefer that we were debating a bill reported by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, but the chairman of the \ncommittee has made it clear that he will never act on such legislation. \nThat is unfortunate, since the evidence presented to our committee of \njurisdiction is more than sufficient to justify taking prudent actions \nnow to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  There are those who say that climate change is a hoax, a concoction \nof radical environmentalists and a liberal media. That is simply \nhogwash or maybe the whitehouse effect. Global warming has been \ndocumented by hundreds and hundreds of credible scientific studies, \nincluding many world class institutions such as the National Academy of \nScience, the American Geophysical Union, and the International Panel on \nClimate Change. To ignore and dismiss the threat of climate change to \nthe economy and the environment is like insisting the earth is flat. It \nflies in the face of reality.\n  The Climate Stewardship Act uses the same type of efficient cap-and-\ntrade system that Congress established in the 1990 Clean Air Act \namendments to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain.\n  My bill, S.366, the Clean Power Act, uses that system to reduce \ncarbon dioxide pollution from power plants to 1990 levels. That carbon \ncap and the cap in the bill before the Senate would stimulate the \ndevelopment of domestic technologies, like gasification and renewables. \nThat would allow our Nation to continue burning coal, but more \nefficiently, cleanly and safely and with fewer carbon emissions.\n  Without some kind of carbon cap to drive technology, utilities and \ninvestors will continue turning away from\n\n[[Page S13589]]\n\ncoal and toward natural gas. Without clear action by Congress on this \nmatter, utilities and investors fear the uncertain timing of the \ninevitable carbon controls that are coming.\n  I will not go into great detail about the need to act now. Our \ncommittee's hearing record is replete with peer-reviewed scientific \nevidence that demonstrates that need and refutes the Senator from \nOklahoma's statements.\n  But, I would like to note that the average global temperature in \nSeptember 2003 was the hottest on record, and 1998 and 2002 were the \nfirst and second hottest years on record. That should concern us all.\n  It is urgent that we take action soon. The Senate's decision today \nwill affect the atmosphere and climate for the next 100 years if not \nlonger. Experts have advised us that we and the world must radically \nchange the use of fossil fuels in the next 10 to 15 years or the \nconsequences could be quite severe.\n  The need for the Senate to move this bill is tremendous. The United \nStates emits approximately 25 percent of the world's carbon pollution. \nWe are responsible for approximately 40 percent of the carbon \nconcentrations now in the atmosphere. We have a moral obligation and an \neconomic opportunity in leading the development of technologies and \nsystems that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  This legislation gives businesses and Government a great opportunity \nto promote solar, wind, fuel cells and other sustainable energy sources \nas ``the next high tech revolution'' to meet our growing energy needs. \nIt can also stimulate rural communities by making carbon sequestration \neconomically attractive.\n  Twice now, in the energy bills, the Senate has passed resolutions \nasking the President to enter into negotiations with all nations to \nobtain a binding treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We have \nbeen ignored. The administration has taken no action to accomplish such \na treaty or adopted any policy that will result in real and tangible \nreductions.\n  Senators should not take this vote lightly. This is the first time \nthat the Senate will vote to control emissions that cause global \nwarming. Senators can lead now and contribute to sustainable \ndevelopment and job creation or they can hide their heads in the sand \nand be blamed further for the climate change that is already occurring \nand for the chaos that warming is likely to bring.\n  I urge Senators to support the Lieberman-McCain bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will be supporting the McCain-\nLieberman climate change legislation, and I want to detail the reasons \nfor my support. At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the United \nStates agreed to a goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the \nyear 2000, and we became a party to the Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. As a Member of the Senate, I have supported this agreement. In \norder to meet this commitment, our Government has engaged in a wide \nrange of voluntary programs. But, despite these efforts, U.S. \ngreenhouse gas emissions have increased by 14 percent between 1990 and \n2000. We should take additional nationwide steps to meet this goal, and \nI believe this legislation is an appropriate first step.\n  In this legislation, my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, and my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, would \nimplement Phase I only of their broader bill on greenhouse gases, S. \n139, the Climate Stewardship Act of 2003. This legislation will return \nthe Nation's emissions to 2000 levels by 2010. It will do so by \nreducing emissions in the short term while providing market-based \nflexibility to minimize the cost to industry.\n  I continue to believe that we must take action on the national level \nnow to slow the progression of climatic change. The costs of inaction \nare prohibitive across the country and in my home State of Wisconsin. \nWisconsin's top officials acknowledged that climate change was a \nconcern years ago. Nat Robinson, administrator of the State \ngovernment's Energy Division in the administration of Governor \nThompson, stated back in September of 1997, ``There was a time when the \npossible human influence on the atmosphere was hotly debated by \nscientists and lay persons alike. That time is past.'' In response, my \nhome State has become one of the first with a statewide plan to address \nglobal warming.\n  Numerous signs suggest that the climate in Wisconsin may already be \nchanging, and that the actions that the State of Wisconsin has taken \nare justified. UW-Madison scientist John Magnuson led a dozen other \nscientists in examining actual climate data recorded by a wide variety \nof sources around the world over the past 550 years. These data \ndocumented a steady 150-year warming trend in global temperatures. For \nexample, the ``ice season'' of Dane County's Lake Mendota has decreased \n22 percent since the mid-1800s. Similarly, the Aldo Leopold Foundation \nin Baraboo concluded that spring is arriving a week earlier than it did \n62 years ago based on when various plants are flowering.\n  The Union of Concerned Scientists released a series of studies in \nApril 2003 on climate change in the Great Lakes Region. That report \nstates that by 2030 Wisconsin summers will feel like southern \nIllinois', and by the end of the century, Wisconsin's summer climate \nwill resemble that of current-day Arkansas, with our winters like \ncurrent day Iowa. This will cause a huge change in our life in \nWisconsin, in our climate and ecosystems, in our ability to grow crops, \nin our need for additional summertime cooling for our residents. These \nare huge and costly challenges, and Wisconsin can't solve them alone. \nThe pollutants emitted to the air know no political boundaries, and the \neffects are global, as well as local, in scope.\n  Unfortunately, this administration has chosen to step away from our \ncurrent commitments on climate change and has not recognized state \nefforts on climate change. I too shared concerns about the Kyoto \nprotocol, and joined with the Senate in support of a 98 to 0 vote on \nthe Byrd resolution. That resolution called upon the State Department \nto seek meaningful commitments during the Kyoto negotiation process to \nreduce climate change from developing countries such as China and India \nthat have the potential to develop using significant amounts of fossil \nfuels. I supported that resolution because I wanted any additional U.S. \ncommitments to be to an agreement that addressed all current and future \nsources of climate change worldwide. That vote was not a repudiation of \nmy belief that the U.S. must meet its current commitments.\n  Meeting our international commitment is important, especially at a \ntime of strong anti-American sentiment abroad and challenges to U.S. \nleadership. Some of that sentiment and some of those challenges are a \ndirect response to the Bush administration's misguided policies. Even \nour staunchest friends are troubled by the administration's inclination \nfor unilateral action, its inconsistent words and deeds, and its \ndismissive response to their legitimate concerns.\n  Being part of the international community means engaging \nconstructively with like-minded nations to build strong, sustaining \ninstitutions and alliances--and bringing emerging powers into this \ncommunity so future conflict becomes less likely. The Bush \nAdministration has demonstrated an unhealthy disregard for the opinions \nof fellow nations--a disregard that has squandered some of the support \nwe received after the September 11, 2001, attacks and diminished our \ninfluence around the world.\n  The administration's approach to global warming is one such area. \nThough the United States produces about a quarter of the world's \ngreenhouse gases and will be affected badly by climate change, the Bush \nAdministration has shown no interest in doing anything about the \nproblem. That undermines our stature and credibility and it causes an \nunnecessary rift with our allies. Constituents have approached me again \nand again at the town hall meetings I hold all over Wisconsin every \nyear to share their concerns when the U.S. pulled out of the Kyoto \nnegotiations, and I believe that they make a very strong point.\n  The most powerful Nation in the world must speak with a clear and \nconsistent voice and lead all nations to face major global challenges \ntogether. The U.S. Government has paid dearly for pulling out of the \nKyoto protocol and rejecting the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. \nAlthough each\n\n[[Page S13590]]\n\nof these agreements was imperfect, each became more so when the United \nStates moved to the sidelines. Helping to shape credible international \ninstitutions is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of confidence in \nU.S. strength and ideals. By disengaging, this administration has \nmarginalized U.S. policies, interests, and values.\n  For these reasons, I support the McCain-Lieberman legislation. The \nU.S. should proceed to implement the Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, and we need legislation to do just that.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today the Senate took an important step \ntoward expanding the debate on global warming. Greenhouse gasses and \nglobal warming are a real threat to our environment and our way of \nlife. The National Academy of Sciences has verified the scientific \nevidence backing global warming. And the private sector is facing the \nreal world impact of global warming as they contemplate the insurance \ncosts of rising sea levels and more destructive storms. A decade ago, \ndebate ranged within and without the ivory towers of academia over the \nhazy science backing claims of global warming. Today, the fog has \nlifted and we can see the impact that burning fossil fuels has had on \nthe climate.\n  The changes to our environment are real. Our job now is to decide \nwhat to do about it. The approach set out by this version of the \nMcCain-Lieberman bill is a reasonable first step. It is not perfect, \nand if we would have been able to take up and debate amendments there \nare several, significant changes I would have supported.\n  My biggest concern is that this bill would have us move toward \nreducing emissions without requiring the rest of the world to join us. \nWhile we have a responsibility to reduce our own emissions, we need to \nwork with the international community. China, for example, is \napproaching the United States as a producer of green house gasses and \nmust be a part of any practical effort to reverse global warming. If \nour unilateral efforts convince China they have no need to act, than \nour approach could do more harm than good. I vote for this bill today \nas a message to the administration that it is time to redouble efforts \nto spark a world effort to address global warning. I do not vote to \ncommit the United States as the sole participant in that effort.\n  I strongly support including environmental standards as part of our \ntrade agreements. Clean air and water issues should be discussed with \nour international trade partners during trade negotiations. Letting our \ncompetitors avoid environmental issues that impact everyone around the \nworld is shortsighted. It hurts our environment and our business \ncommunity.\n  The bill before us has other problems that could be addressed with a \nlonger debate time and the opportunity to offer amendments. The Senate \nshould carefully scrutinize the legislation's timetable and should \nconsider giving industry more flexibility in earning credits. But while \nthese issues need to be addressed, every journey starts with a single \nstep, and this vote is that first step. We have begun seriously to \nstruggle with climate change. And ultimately, inevitably, we need to \nmake some tough decisions about climate change. We must reduce \ngreenhouse gasses to protect our environment and our way of life for \ngenerations to come. A yes vote today sets us on the path to confront \nthis issue head on.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nClimate Stewardship Act. I hope the Senate will seize the historic \nopportunity before it today and vote to begin seriously dealing with \nthis worldwide threat.\n  Unfortunately, I am afraid Congress is not very good at passing laws \nthat will only benefit future generations, especially when there might \nbe a cost--no matter how small--for our constituents today. But I hope \nthat this vote will be different and that my colleagues will join me in \npassing this sensible legislation to prevent a costly, and potentially \ncatastrophic, rise in global temperatures.\n  As Senators John McCain, Joe Lieberman, and others have already \narticulated, the scientific conclusion that greenhouse gas emissions \nare contributing to an accelerated rate of climate warming is beyond \ndebate. Thousands of climate scientists convened under the United \nNations and our own National Academy of Sciences have stated \ndefinitively that human activities--primarily the burning of fossil \nfuels--have contributed and will continue to contribute to rising \natmospheric temperatures. I am not an atmospheric scientist, and I \ndon't believe any of my colleagues are, so I hope everyone here will \ndefer to their expertise on this matter.\n  Climate change is an existing and scientifically supported phenomenon \nwhich human beings have a responsibility to mitigate. And since the \nU.S. has the highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions in the world \nand one of the highest emissions rates per dollar of gross domestic \nproduct, we have a particular duty to lead the world on this critical \nissue.\n  Even the Bush administration, whose sincerity in dealing with this \nissue is suspect, acknowledges the reality that human activities cause \nclimate change. Last year, in its United States Climate Report for \n2002, the administration outlined a vast array of consequences climate \nchange would inflict across our country. I would like to highlight some \nof the ``likely'' effects mentioned in that report that would have a \nparticularly harsh impact on my home State of Washington.\n\n       The resulting changes in the amount and timing of runoff \n     are very likely to have significant implications in some \n     basins for water management, flood protection, power \n     production, water quality, and the availability of water \n     resources for irrigations, hydro power, communities, \n     industry, and the sustainability of natural habitats and \n     species.\n       Reduced snow-pack is very likely to alter the timing and \n     amount of water supplies, potentially exacerbating water \n     shortages, particularly through the western United States.\n       The projected increase in the current rate of sea level \n     rise is very likely to exacerbate the nationwide loss of \n     existing coastal wetlands.\n       Habitats of alpine and sub-alpine spruce-fir in the \n     contiguous United States are likely to be reduced and, \n     possibly in the long-term, eliminated as their mountain \n     habitats warm.\n       Rising temperatures are likely to force out some cold-water \n     fish species (such as salmon and trout) that are already near \n     the threshold of their viable habitat . . . .\n       These conditions would also increase stresses on sea \n     grasses, fish, shellfish, and other organisms living in \n     lakes, streams, and oceans.\n\n  The non-profit group Environmental Defense compiled research that \nshows that the winter snow pack in the Cascades could decline by 50 \npercent within 50 years. A reduction even a fraction of that size would \nhave a devastating impact on runoff that is vital for hydropower, \nagriculture, salmon habitat, and drinking water supplies. And I am sure \nmany of my Western colleagues would be similarly alarmed by potential \nreductions in their scarce water resources.\n  Just the damages from decreased runoff would cost my State billions \nof dollars annually, dwarfing even the most pessimistic costs that some \nopponents contend may result from this bill. But besides the costs this \nlegislation can help avoid, I think it is critical that we consider the \ntremendous benefits this bill would initiate.\n  Today, we know that the tired mantra that ``protecting the \nenvironment costs jobs'' is no longer true. In fact, the market-based \nmechanisms used in this bill would unleash unprecedented productivity \nand efficiency gains in our energy sector, as well as catalyze \ncountless new environmental technology industries. That translates into \nmany new high paying engineering and manufacturing jobs and tremendous \nnew export opportunities.\n  A recent report by the U.S. Department of Energy, which included \ncontributions from Washington State's Pacific Northwest National \nLaboratory, forecast significant job growth for jobs in a range of \nemerging ``green'' industries, such as wind power, biomass energy \nproduction, and other energy efficiency specialties.\n  I am proud that my State hosts one of the largest wind farms in the \nUnited States. I visited our Stateline project and saw first hand one \nof the many solutions that the market will find to meet the goals of \nthis legislation.\n  These conclusions were confirmed by a 2001 study carried out in \ncollaboration with public and private partners in the Pacific Northwest \nthat found that the global market for clean energy technologies is \nexpected to reach $180 billion a year--about twice the size\n\n[[Page S13591]]\n\nof the passenger and cargo aircraft industries--within the next two \ndecades. Already, in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia this \nsector is a $1.4 billion per year industry.\n  Despite the potential of these new markets, some of my colleagues \nhave argued that the costs of addressing this problem are too high, \nbecause they believe this bill might raise energy costs. While that is \nhighly disputable, I am curious if opponents of this measure also \nsupport lifting controls on other pollutants? I'm sure we could make \ncoal-generated electricity even cheaper if we did not require pollution \nscrubbers. We could allow millions of tons of sulfur dioxide, mercury, \nand other toxins to flood our nation's air in the name of cheap energy. \nBut of course we wouldn't do that because we know that true costs of \nsuch a policy--whether it be the health of our children, the effects of \nacid rain, or even the visibility at our national parks--would far \noutweigh any short-term financial gains we may achieve by removing \nemission controls.\n  The same principle is true of climate change. We may save some money \nnow by ignoring this problem, but entire industries like timber and \nfishing--key sectors of my State's economy--would be dramatically \nimpacted by climate change. There is no way to deny that greenhouse \ngases, including carbon dioxide, are pollutants and need to be \nmonitored and controlled as such.\n  As I have listened to this historic debate, I have been frustrated by \nthe dueling charts and reports which have been used to support one \nposition or another. While I, along with many of our Nation's Governors \nand world leaders, believe that the scientific evidence is \nindisputable, there may be another important way to view this issue: as \nan insurance policy.\n  I am confident that even the most vocal opponents of this bill would \nbe reluctant to say that there is absolutely no chance that the vast \nmajority of climate scientists are right about this issue and that \ngreenhouse gas emissions are causing global warming. Perhaps the \nclimate skeptics would change their position if they realized that this \nlegislation is really an insurance policy for our children, one that \nguarantees they will be able to enjoy the same natural world that \nbenefits us today.\n  I believe that is how the American people instinctively understand \nthis issue. This is borne out by a recent nationwide survey that showed \nthat three-quarters of Americans support the McCain-Lieberman climate \nchange bill and two-thirds agree that we can control greenhouse gases \nwithout harming our economy.\n  We are a problem-solving nation. When we are faced with a grave \nthreat, we roll up our sleeves, put our heads together, and fix our \nproblems; we don't push them off on our children and future \ngenerations. Like the threat of terrorism, climate change is too \nalarming and disturbing a problem to ignore.\n  The risks of ignoring this problem heavily outweigh the benefits of \npreserving the status quo. Allowing rapid changes in the temperature of \nthe earth's surface and shifts in worldwide weather patterns that \nresult from global warming would be devastating to the economies of my \nstate, this nation, and the world. Let's make sure this problem gets \nthe serious action it deserves. I urge my colleagues to support this \ncritical bill.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this legislation, \nS. 139.\n  We have disputes over the scientific evidence on global climate \nchange. And we can debate that science all day and never agree.\n  I believe the science we have seen does not support the need to \nengage in questionable policies to control so-called ``global \nwarming''.\n  We need more evidence that the climate is actually affected by \nemissions, especially carbon emissions, before we act too quickly.\n  Let's make sure we really look before we leap.\n  Instead of arguing over scientific data, we should examine the impact \nS. 139 could have on American jobs and the economy.\n  This bill limits emissions of greenhouse gases to 2000 levels by \n2010. This includes regulation of carbon dioxide emissions.\n  I am proud to be from a coal state. Generations of Kentuckians from \nPike County to Crittenden County have worked in the coal fields and \nmines.\n  Coal plays an important role in our economy. More than half of our \nnation's electricity is generated from low-cost domestic coal.\n  We have over 275 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves. This is \nabout 30 percent of the world's coal supply.\n  That's enough to supply us with energy for more than 250 years.\n  But this bill places caps on carbon. This has a negative affect on \nenergy production because it affects the amount of coal we can use.\n  This will mean loss of jobs, particularly for workers in Kentucky and \nother coal states.\n  It also increases energy prices. Just as our economy is starting to \nturn around. We just don't need this.\n  I hope the energy bill encourages renewable fuels as well as clean \ncoal so that we are not relying so much on foreign oil.\n  S. 139 goes in the other direction of the energy bill. It drives the \nuse of natural gas instead of coal.\n  Placing caps on carbon means coal production will be 100 million tons \nlower in 2010 than what we expect to produce in 2003.\n  That is 25 percent below our expected 2003 level of coal production.\n  I have heard from coal operators in Kentucky who are on the verge of \nclosing their doors because of natural gas prices.\n  But S. 139 causes an even worse situation. According to one analysis, \nit increases natural gas prices by 79 percent.\n  By forcing reliance on natural gas and a reduction in coal \nproduction, this bill results in a loss of 460,000 jobs through 2025 \nand electricity bills will increase 46 percent.\n  We already have a natural gas shortage. And for a decade coal was on \nthe downturn because of governmental policies.\n  These policies have caused our demand for natural gas to exceed the \nsupply.\n  High gas prices cause Americans to experience difficulties. With the \nwinter coming, prices are expected to go up and put a noose on the \nAmerican pocketbook.\n  We must focus on increasing production and using a variety of energy \nsources. Failing to do this puts our energy independence and national \nsecurity at stake.\n  We are turning the corner on the economy and job growth. The last \nquarter grew by 7.2 percent. We do not need to be losing jobs or \ncausing more companies to shut down business because of increased \nenergy prices caused by the government.\n  The climate issue is being addressed in other ways that are more \nconducive to job creation and economic growth.\n  We are becoming more energy efficient. Energy efficiency has improved \n20 percent since 1990. This means that emissions have declined.\n  In fact, we are expected to reduce emissions by 14 percent by 2012 \nwithout any new emission regulations.\n  Our automobiles are more efficient and running at a higher fuel \nefficiency than they did just a few a years go.\n  However, S. 139 ignores the strides we have made and could bring us \nback to 1970s gas rationing.\n  As a consequence of this rationing, the cost of gasoline is expected \nto increase 27 percent.\n  This increases fuel costs, and further slows our recovery, and takes \nmoney out of the pockets of Americans.\n  I don't see why we should vote to increase energy costs and \nunemployment. Voting for this bill does that.\n  It may make us feel better to support this bill because of its \nenvironmental symbolism.\n  But I will choose substance over symbolism any day.\n  American jobs are of substance. Getting a green star by your name on \nan environmental group's web site is symbolic.\n  And while that may make one feel good, watching Americans lose jobs \nfrom this kind of legislation won't.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the Climate \nStewardship Act, which the Senate will vote on later today. Although I \nrecognize the challenge of global climate change, I must oppose this \nlegislation because of the drastic negative effect it would have on our \nnational economy.\n\n[[Page S13592]]\n\n  Our economy depends on affordable, reliable, and abundant sources of \nenergy. Whether that means natural gas, petroleum, or coal, we have a \nresponsibility to ensure that our businesses, manufacturers, and \nhouseholds have access to energy sources at reasonable costs. We depend \non energy in almost everything we do in our lives, from turning on the \nlight in the morning, to driving our cars to work, to cooking our \ndinner at the end of the day. We need access to these sources of \nenergy, and we need access in a way that doesn't force us to choose \nbetween paying our power bill, buying gas at the pump, or buying \nessentials like groceries and medicine. During my time in the Senate, I \nhave remained committed to keeping energy costs affordable for all \nNorth Dakotans and all Americans.\n  The bill before us would threaten the affordability of these sources \nof energy. It will require companies that produce and use natural gas, \npetroleum, and coal to acquire credits for each ton of greenhouse gas \nemissions for which they are responsible. These credits will have a \nvalue of anywhere from $8 to $13 for each ton of emissions. Our \nemissions levels are in the many millions of tons per year. This means \ndramatic cost increases ranging in the many millions of dollars for the \nenergy industry, costs that will inevitably be passed on to the \nconsumer.\n  According to a recent MIT study--the same study, by the way, that the \nsponsors of this bill cite in making their arguments--national demand \nfor coal would increase much more slowly under the legislation. \nPetroleum and natural gas demand will also increase at slower rates. \nThis is because the costs of these fuels will dramatically increase \nunder the bill. It will mean higher gas prices, higher electricity \nbills, and higher home heating costs.\n  I am particularly concerned about the effects of these cost increases \non our international competitiveness. The Kyoto Treaty has not yet \ntaken effect, and it now appears that Russia may be backing away from \nratification. In the absence of the Kyoto treaty, other nations across \nthe globe will not be subject to strict greenhouse gas emissions \ncontrols. Moreover, even if the Kyoto Treaty does enter into force, \nthere has been bipartisan agreement that the Kyoto treaty contains \nunbalanced provisions that would require disproportionate carbon \ndioxide reductions in this country while other countries would have to \nmake much less significant changes.\n  If we were to adopt the bill before us at this time, we would risk \nputting U.S. manufacturing--which relies on affordable energy--at a \nsignificant competitive disadvantage with the rest of the world. \nAlready, we are losing jobs to manufacturers in Mexico and China. If \nour energy costs were to increase because of this bill, our job loss to \nforeign countries would accelerate. With record Federal deficits and \ndebt, our economy is already in trouble; now is not the time to be \nmaking our economic problems worse.\n  Let me be clear that I am fully aware of and fully acknowledge the \nreality of global climate change. We need only to look to the droughts \nin my part of the country over the last few years to see the very real \neffects of global climate change. Human activity since the industrial \nrevolution is warming the planet, melting the polar ice caps, and \ncausing severe weather events across the globe. These developments have \nvery serious implications for this country, and for the world.\n  I do not dispute this ecological situation and I do not dispute the \nneed to do something about it. Let me also state that I very much \nappreciate the efforts of Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain to try \nto address this issue. They have done so in a way that genuinely \nattempts to address a variety of constituent issues. However, I still \ndo not think the legislation we are considering today is the right \napproach at the right time.\n  We need to continue working for a solution that carefully balances \nthis need for action with the concerns about the impact on our economy \nand our competitiveness, and I hope to be a part of finding innovative \nand creative solutions to global climate change. We need to carefully \nconsider impacts on States with energy dependent economies, such as \nNorth Dakota. We need to carefully consider the impact on different \ntypes of energy and make sure we do not put some forms of energy at an \nunfair disadvantage. For example, to have my support any legislation on \nthis topic must address the unique circumstances of lignite coal, which \nis the primary source of electricity in North Dakota. And we need to \ncarefully weigh the impacts that any plan will have on energy \nconsumers. This will require an enormous amount of careful work, and I \nlook forward to being part of the effort to address this very real \nproblem.\n  These are enormously complex issues that will require very careful \nstudy and an opportunity for extensive public review and comment. \nBecause of the circumstances under which we are considering this \nlegislation, we have not had that opportunity for extensive review. \nWithout that careful study and review to ensure that we understand in \ndetail the impacts on energy production in my State, on our national \neconomy, and on our international competitiveness, I cannot vote for \nthis legislation. For that reason, I must vote against the bill today.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman, have \nbrought to the Senate floor a serious proposal dealing with an \nimportant issue. The issue of climate change and global warming demands \nour attention. We live in this fragile spaceship called Earth, and we \nhave but one environment to sustain us. We ignore the health of our \nenvironment at our peril.\n  So the question is not whether but rather how we address these \nquestions that are being raised about our environment, about climate \nchange and global warming.\n  The proposal we are voting on today is one that I think requires some \nadditional work and some additional thought.\n  We now live in a global economy and these issues must be addressed \nglobally.\n  We cannot create emissions caps and targets that we enforce \nunilaterally in a manner that encourages American companies to move \noverseas and avoid these restrictions. If we do that, we will end up \ndoing little or nothing to protect our environment while harming our \neconomy.\n  In this global economy, where companies can move from one country to \nanother with ease, it seems to me the only way to achieve the goals of \nreducing emissions of greenhouse gases is to engage with all other \ncountries in a global strategy for these reductions. Otherwise, these \nglobal companies will simply move their plants and their jobs to areas \nwhere they are not impeded by emission caps and other restrictions.\n  When a global agreement is negotiated, it cannot be an agreement that \nallows some countries to avoid emission caps while others embrace them. \nFor example, if we through an international agreement will embrace \nemission caps for our country but allow the Chinese or the Indian \ngovernments to avoid them, we will simply be developing a strategy for \ncompanies to move out of the United States and move their plants and \njobs to countries where they will not face such restrictions.\n  That approach would represent the worst of all worlds. There would be \nno environmental benefit but we in the U.S. would suffer a heavy \neconomic penalty from plant flight and job loss.\n  I do not think the McCain-Lieberman proposal is the right way to \naddress these issues, but my vote in opposition should not be seen as a \ndenial that these are serious issues that do need to be addressed.\n  This amendment and today's debate and vote will be a constructive \nstart of a healthy debate about what we do to provide leadership on \nthese issues. While I think this proposal today falls short, I intend \nto be a constructive part of future proposals that can and will offer \nleadership in the right direction.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the Climate Stewardship \nAct of 2003 since its effect, if enacted, will be the loss of more \nmanufacturing jobs to countries which have few, if any, environmental \nstandards. That won't help the environment, and it will hurt our \neconomy. Climate change is not something we can tackle by shifting \nindustries and their emissions to other countries, or by shifting \nmanufacturing jobs to China or other countries which have no limits on \nemissions of greenhouse gases. The bill before us reflects a unilateral \napproach to a problem which can only be solved globally.\n\n[[Page S13593]]\n\n  Let me give one example of how this bill would promote job loss in \nthe U.S. with no benefit to the global environment. In the past decade, \na large number of companies have moved their manufacturing plants \noverseas. Take, for example, a U.S. manufacturing company that had \nseven plants in the U.S. in the 1990s. Today it has only five left, \nbecause two moved to countries with cheaper labor. Assume that those \nfive remaining domestic plants each emit 20,000 metric tons of carbon \ndioxide for a total of 100,000 metric tons. Under this legislation, \nreasonable estimates are that the company's cap could be placed at \naround 90,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide credits. The company, \nalready under heavy competition because of cheap labor costs overseas, \nfaces a choice: pay to reduce emissions at its five plants by 10 \npercent, or move another one of its plants overseas, say to China. If \nthe company moves one of its five plants abroad, it has 10,000 credits \nremaining to play with which it can use to actually increase emissions \nat its four remaining plants, or it can sell them. So this bill adds to \nexisting incentives, such as lower labor costs and no safety standards, \nto move manufacturing plants overseas, and the result is that we lose \njobs and the environment gains nothing. In other words, when this \nbill's mandates are imposed on sectors of the economy that can pick up \nand move overseas, it adds another incentive to do just that.\n  The United States must take a leadership role in addressing climate \nchange, but that leadership must move us in the right direction. It is \nnot sound leadership to give additional incentives to U.S. businesses \nto move their facilities, and the jobs that go with them, to other \ncountries that don't have the costly environmental standards which this \nbill would impose on U.S. businesses. It is not sound leadership to \nsimply shift industrial emissions from American soil to countries which \nhave no emissions standards. And it is certainly not sound leadership \nto act unilaterally in a way that puts U.S. manufacturers at a \ncompetitive disadvantage when there is no built-in incentive for other \ncountries to follow. In fact, the opposite is true: the unilateral \napproach in this bill provides an economic incentive for countries who \nare picking up our manufacturing jobs not to follow our lead.\n  Effective and sound leadership would be to tell competing countries \nthat we are going to adopt high environmental standards if they will \njoin us, or, in the alternative, leadership is getting countries to \nagree (1) to the adoption of tough environmental standards, and (2) to \nrefuse to purchase products from countries which won't adopt those \nenvironmental standards. Sound leadership, in other words, is working \nto create an international agreement where all countries take steps to \nreduce global warming, so that there is no incentive to move jobs and \nemissions from a country with high environmental standards to one with \nlow environmental standards.\n  Climate change cannot be addressed unilaterally. It must be addressed \nmultilaterally. It doesn't help the global environment to push down \ngreenhouse gas emissions in one country only to have them pop up in \nothers. We need a Kyoto-type treaty which binds all countries. \nOtherwise, there is a perverse incentive to move more and more jobs to \ncountries with lower environmental standards. That does nothing to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and does damage to U.S. jobs.\n  To achieve a global agreement will require our putting maximum \npressure on all countries to join it, so that the emissions of \ngreenhouse gases can be reduced, not just shifted. Shifting \nmanufacturing jobs and the production of greenhouses gases from here to \nother countries is not a solution to climate change. It would just be \nanother economic blow to America at a time when our economy is already \nlosing jobs at an historic and alarming rate.\n  We have already lost enough American jobs to countries with cheap \nlabor, no safety standards and no environmental standards. To add more \nincentives for companies to move overseas to countries with no limits \non greenhouse gas emissions, as this bill would promote, is not sound \npolicy. Global climate change is just that: global and it needs to be \ndealt with globally, not unilaterally.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, anyone who has picked up a copy of this \nlegislation and read it has to be forgiven if he or she was soon \nreminded of the words of Yogi Berra, ``It's deja vu all over again.''\n  After all, it is not as if this topic is unfamiliar to us. When the \ndebate first began on the Kyoto talks, the U.S. Senate made a clear and \ndirect statement of principle on the subject. We drew a line that was \nnot to be crossed by the president and his negotiators in their effort \nto reach an international climate change agreement. By a vote of 95 to \n0 the Senate passed Senate Resolution 98, also known as the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution, that sent a clear message to the world that the Senate \nwould not support any climate change agreement that did not include all \nnations equally. We also said we would not support an agreement that \nwould cause serious harm to our economy.\n  We crafted our message to the administration to counter the concerns \nthat had been raised that a global climate change policy could be \nimposed on the United States that would ``result in serious harm to the \nUnited States economy, including significant job loss, trade \ndisadvantages, and increased energy and consumer costs.'' The Senate \nwas also concerned that efforts to reduce global emissions would be \nimposed only on developed nations, where the best emissions controls \nand most advances in emissions reductions already exist, and not on \nunderdeveloped nations where emissions would continue without any \neffective controls.\n  What has changed since then?\n  Nothing.\n  We still need the benefits of a strong economy. We still need to \nprotect American jobs. And we still need to avoid trade deficits and \nensure consumers are not forced to choose between paying their energy \nbills and buying food.\n  We still need to protect American jobs, and global climate change is \nstill a global issue.\n  Unfortunately, this reality contradicts the language of the proposal \nwe are debating today just as surely as it contradicts the message we \nsent the administration with the Byrd-Hagel language.\n  The proposal before us, which is clearly an energy tax, would force \nthe United States to unilaterally disarm its economy and force American \njobs overseas without providing any environmental benefit. An energy \ntax, like the one proposed by Senators Lieberman and McCain would, in \nfact, be an environmental nightmare. Any loss of jobs in the United \nStates would shift production to other parts of the world where there \nare no controls over the manufacturing process.\n  The best way to help the environment around the world is to ensure we \nhave a strong economy here at home.\n  If we, as a Senate, really want to stand for improving global \nconditions then we should stand behind the principles of Byrd-Hagel and \ninsist our global climate change policy does not harm America's \nworkers. If we want to improve global conditions we must insist that \nall nations responsible for emitting greenhouse gasses participate and \nreduce their own emissions.\n  Just in case anyone is not clear about what is going on and what this \nlegislation really does, I want to take a moment and explain how it \nwould slow down our economy and force jobs out of the country.\n  To begin with, the bill establishes a requirement for registering all \nindustrial emissions, and it requires the officials in charge to make \nassumptions about the level of total emissions that are due to \ntransportation.\n  We can only assume that these assumptions are made for one of two \nreasons.\n  We want to know the transportation emissions level so we can blame \nthe rest on industry, or, we want to know the transportation emissions \nlevel so we can start to apply limits and regulate family cars. I have \nhad the opportunity to visit California and noticed a remarkable thing \nabout this State that has done so much on its own to regulate and \ncontrol private vehicles. While the rest of the highway was packed with \ncars, the HOV lanes were wide open and very poorly utilized. And yet \nthis bill does nothing to account for private vehicles which is a major \nsource of greenhouse gas emissions. I wonder, if this bill was so \nserious about\n\n[[Page S13594]]\n\nimproving the environment, why would it leave out such a major source \nof emissions?\n  Don't be fooled. If this program is passed then that will be the next \nstep. Why would we put in place such an ineffective control if we \ndidn't intend to take it to the next step and regulate private \ntransportation? We don't want to, they do.\n  This proposal would hold industry responsible for all other, \nnonindustrial or transportation emissions, emissions including human \nbeings, who breathe out CO2 on a regular basis, animals, \nplants, volcanoes, forest fires, and private homes that burn natural \ngas, fuel, coal or wood. Keep in mind that one natural cataclysmic \nevent, such as a volcanic eruption or a catastrophic wildfire eclipses \nanything, by way of emissions, that all of mankind can produce together \non an annual basis.\n  We also have a situation where our trees that once could have served \nas sponges to soak up greenhouse gasses, are now older and absorb less \nCO2. In fact, because of the age of many of our forests they \nare now CO2 emitters.\n  The bill also completely neglects the most common and prevalent \ngreenhouse gas of all. Of all the gasses found in our atmosphere, this \nparticular gas is the most insidious. It contributes to more \nfluctuations in temperature than any other gas. It has the greatest \nimpact on local and global climate, and it too is emitted by industry \nand by numerous natural sources and yet it is not included anywhere in \nthis bill.\n  What is this gas? It is water vapor, of course. Why, if we are really \nserious about using this legislation to control temperatures and \nclimate, don't we include water? Because this effort is not about \nenvironmental protection. It is about imposing an energy tax and \ncontrolling the economy.\n  The next thing the bill does is impose a cap or limit on otherwise \nunregulated emissions by industry. Once again, this cap does not take \ninto account the emissions generated by other sources. The result is \nthat we would force industry to assume all responsibility and pay for \nall emissions, regardless of where they come from. Whether the \nemissions came from individuals or nature, we would still hold industry \nresponsible. There is a new discovery that was recently made in Wyoming \nthat illustrates the lunacy of holding man responsible for something \nthat nature releases on its own in an abundance that man never has.\n  I will read from an AP article that ran in a Wyoming newspaper on \nOctober 27 of this year. ``Scientists measuring mercury levels made a \nstartling discovery at the base of Roaring Mountain [in Yellowstone \nNational Park]: possibly the highest levels of mercury ever recorded at \nan undisturbed natural area.'' According to their measurements, the \nscientists found that Yellowstone is a potentially big source of our \nnation's mercury. ``It is conceivable . . . that Yellowstone could emit \nas much mercury as all the coal-fired power plants in Wyoming. . . . \n`That's not a real estimate but something based on just a few \nmeasurements,' [one of the scientists said] `It could be even bigger \nthan that, we just don't know.' ''\n  It would be intellectually dishonest, for us to assume that, given \nall of the uncertainty in these issues, that industry will sit back and \nquietly assume the cost and burden of emissions reductions without \neither passing them on to consumers or finding a way to excuse itself \nfrom the limits altogether. The cost of the tax will either be paid by \nconsumers who can barely afford their own energy costs today, or we \nwill force jobs offshore and into areas where there are no limits on \nenergy consumption and pollution.\n  There should be no doubt in anyone's mind that this bill is all about \neconomics, particularly because that's what the entire global warming \ndebate is about. Kyoto was an economic conference disguised as an \nenvironmental conference.\n  EU Commissioner for the Environment Margot Wallstrom once said, \n``This is not a simple environmental issue where you can say it is an \nissue where the scientists are not unanimous. This is about \ninternational relations, this is about economy, about trying to create \na level playing field for big businesses throughout the world. You have \nto understand what is at stake and that is why it is serious.''\n  I had the opportunity to attend the meetings at Kyoto, and while I \nwas there I met with the Chinese and discussed the role that they \nthought they should play in meeting the demands of global climate \nchange. They, and all other developing nations have no obligation to \nparticipate in any climate change agreement. They don't even agree to \nvoluntary participation at a future unspecified date. You can't be more \nopen ended than that. Incidentally, they intend to be a developing \nnation forever, even after 2010 when they will be the world's biggest \npolluter.\n  Should we just sell out to the Chinese?\n  If we were to adjust global emissions and measure them on a per gross \ndomestic product basis, or in other words, measure the efficiencies and \nend product gained for each energy unit consumed, the United States \nwould come out, once again, as the most efficient and most productive \nnation on earth. Europe, on the other hand, come out on the other end \nof the spectrum.\n  Why?\n  There are a number of factors that contribute to this imbalance but \nthe biggest reason has to do with the efficiency of the American \nworker. We produce more goods using less energy than any other nation \nin the history of the world. We are already milking our industrial \noutput to a point where any additional efficiencies will result in \ndramatic increases in costs. We have already made the easy adjustments \nand reduced those emissions that are easiest and cheapest to reduce. \nThe rest of the world is still catching up to us on those respects and \nit would be easy and cheap for Europe then to reach some of its targets \nand reduce emissions. All they have to do is use some of the technology \nwe have already invented.\n\n  For the United States, however, to make the incremental gains it \nneeds to make to comply with the limits that this bill would impose \nwould require us to either assume costs that would be exponentially \ngreater than those assumed by an other nation, or to push those gains \noff onto another sector, more specifically the transportation sector, \nand require us to impose costs on consumers and taxpayers that they \nclearly cannot afford.\n  It is a matter of economies of scale and Europe knows it.\n  The United States is much physically larger than any other nation \nthat we compete against economically. Europe, as a whole, is much \nsmaller, much more densely populated and uses much more efficient \ntransportation. In the United States, we use our trains primarily to \ncarry manufactured goods, as well as clean burning, low sulfur Wyoming \ncoal, while Europe's trains, on the other hand, are used almost \nexclusively to carry people. It is much more practical for us to fly \nfrom Washington, DC to Los Angeles, CA and arrive in a matter of hours \ninstead of wasting days on a train. But airplanes burn fuel in great \namounts and with much less efficiency than other forms of \ntransportation. The logical and most cost efficient controls then are \nnot to limit emissions on industry but to convert those controls into \nlimitations on transportation.\n  I was at the first Kyoto conference, and incidentally, the US was the \nonly country that thought that conference was an environmental \nconference. Everyone else saw it as an economic conference.\n  You can understand why I am greatly disturbed when I see a cap \nproposal like the one put forward in this bill, especially when it \nincludes calculations on transportation emissions. There is no reason \nto pass a bill like this, to create the kinds of agencies and offices \nthat the bill creates and not expect it to lead to the next step where \nits controls over industry emissions-i.e., an energy tax, are converted \ninto controls over transportation in other words a transportation tax.\n  Our Nation's massive transportation needs will never go away. Nor \nwill Europe ever get bigger. As a result of size, then, the energy, or \nrather transportation, taxes required by this bill will put the United \nStates at a tremendous economic disadvantage with regard to its \ncompetitors.\n  Fortunately, we are not the only ones to recognize this imbalance. \nRussia recently joined the United States in rejecting a proposal that \nwould limit its emissions and put a similar damper\n\n[[Page S13595]]\n\non its economy. In making a basic cost/benefit analysis, President \nPutin's chief economic advisor, Andrei Illarinov declared, ``If we are \nto double GDP within the next ten years, this will require an average \neconomic growth rate of 7.2 percent. No country in the world can double \nits GDP with a lower increase in carbon dioxide omissions or with no \nincrease at all.''\n  The great baseball philosopher, Yogi Berra, was right. It is deja vu \nall over again. These are issues we have considered before and we \nalready have a clear statement of policy in place in the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution that says, in responding to global climate change concerns, \nwe cannot agree to any proposal that would result in serious harm to \nthe United States economy. It already says we must work to avoid \nsignificant job loss, trade disadvantages, and increased energy and \nconsumer costs. It also makes it clear that this is a global issue, one \nwe can't tackle alone. If we, as a Senate, really want to stand for \nimproving global conditions then we should stand behind the principles \nof Byrd-Hagel and insist our global climate change policy does not harm \nAmerica's workers and that all nations responsible for emitting \ngreenhouse gasses participate in emissions reductions.\n  This proposal would clearly cause serious harm to our Nation's \neconomy, cost us American jobs, and result in a tax on our nation's \nenergy and transportation systems. These taxes would put our nation at \na serious disadvantage with our competitors and do nothing to improve \nour environment.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, fellow colleagues, please do not overreact \nby the claim that the climate is changing. The climate has always \nchanged naturally. Thanks in large part to scientific research carried \nout in the United States, we know much more about our climate than we \ndid a mere quarter-century ago. More than anything else, we now know \nthat climate never has been, and never will be, constant.\n  When our civilization arose with the flowering of agriculture, some \n5,000 years ago, climate scientists tell us the earth was a few degrees \nwarmer than it is today. At one time, what is now the dry desert \nsouthwest was a much wetter tropical environment. Climate scientists \nalso tell us that 300 years ago it was a few degrees colder, Europe \nsuffered through the Plagues, ice skaters graced the Thames River in \nLondon. Mr. President, 150 years ago, when that ``Little Ice Age'' \nended, America embarked upon its manifest destiny.\n  In the last 100 years, the Earth has warmed an additional degree, \nAmerican crop yields quintupled, life span doubled, wealth became \ndemocratized beyond the wildest dreams of even the most optimistic. In \nthat 100 years, our free economy was powered largely by fuels extracted \nfrom the earth. Some of these produce carbon dioxide, which scientists \nhave known, since 1872, can slightly warm the surface of the earth.\n  At the same time, our competitive economy forced increased \nefficiency. The family car now uses half as much fuel as it once did. \nHybrid automobiles achieve as much as seventy miles to the gallon. All \nin all, we produce a dollar's worth of goods and services with 40 \npercent less energy than we did a mere 30 years ago.\n  This remarkable change, where the freest society on Earth became the \nmost capable large economy, did not happen because of massive taxation \nin misguided attempts to direct the lives of free people. No, it \nhappened because people were free--free to buy the most proficient \ntechnology, and, above all, free to invest in corporations who \nunderstand what people want. And one of those desires is abundant \nenergy, used efficiently. As has been said, over and over, the future \nbelongs to the efficient.\n  And what of the warming of the planet? In the blazing summer of 1988, \nin this Senate Chamber, NASA first raised the spectre of global warming \ncaused by carbon dioxide. The alarm was sounded, even as others argued \nthat the gloom-and-doom forecasts were overwrought and could lead to \ndisastrous policies.\n  Fifteen years later, thanks in large part to research fostered by \nthis body's committees on science, we know that the calm scientific \nheads were right.\n  NASA scientist James Hansen, who first sounded the alarm, now agrees \nwith those who were once his critics. Writing in the Proceedings of the \nNational Academy of Sciences, he recently stated that we know how much \nthe planet will warm in the next 50 years to a very small margin of \nerror. That amount is precisely the small warming that the calmer heads \nhad forecast some 15 years earlier.\n  This same scientist has recently stated that some may have \nexaggerated the threat of global warming for political science \npurposes. Just last month, he wrote in the online journal ``Natural \nScience'': ``Emphasis on extreme scenarios may have been appropriate at \none time, when the public and policymakers were relatively unaware of \nthe global warming issue.'' Moreover, according to a report issued by \nthe Global Climate Coalition, mandatory emissions goals could result in \na loss of gross domestic product equal to $300 billion in 2010 alone, \nassuming that 2010 emissions are held at 1990 levels.\n  How many American jobs would be lost as a result? How many companies \nwill have to close their doors? I would like to read to you, part of a \nletter from the Secretary of Commerce, Don Evans, Secretary of Labor, \nElaine Chao, and Acting Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, Marianne Horinko:\n\n       According to an analysis conducted by the independent \n     Energy Information Administration, S. 139 would cause an \n     estimated average loss of 460,000 American jobs through 2025.\n\n  It goes on to say,\n\n       Instead of improving our economic security through economic \n     growth and job creation, the job losses resulting from S. 139 \n     would place an unacceptable burden on American workers and \n     the American people.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of this \nletter be printed in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALLEN. It is not right for any scientist or any other person to \nexaggerate for political effect. But even as much has been made of the \nvociferous debates before the Senate about past climate change, little \nhas been said about the remarkable scientific agreement about the \nfuture.\n  Scientists all agree that human affect on any climate change would \nwarm the coldest air of winter much more than the heat of the summer. \nWhen Russia's Prime Minister Putin rejected the Kyoto Protocol last \nweek, he noted that, more than anything else, humans have made Siberia \nmore habitable, according to Dr. Pat Michaels, State Climatologist at \nThe University of Virginia.\n  The most recent consensus of scientists is that the rate of any \nwarming over a long period of time is very small. And, the slight \nwarming trend is much lower than the alarmist projections of the United \nNations, or those who may have touted ``extreme scenarios,'' or those \nwho strive to profit politically from climate change scare tactics.\n  Then, one may ask, what is to be done? After all, we cannot go on \nadding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere forever. We won't. If history \nis any guide, our technology will continue to evolve toward increased \nefficiency, new materials and new propulsion methods in the next 100 \nyears.\n  In 1800, we were a Nation and world moved by animals and wind on \nwater. In the next 100 years, the locomotive transformed our economy \nand our Nation. In 1900, the automobile had just been invented. In the \nnext 100 years, transportation and energy fueled the great \ndemocratization of wealth and the spread of culture.\n  In 1900, 7,000 people died in the Galveston Hurricane. Mr. President, \n100 years later a similar storm hit Texas and killed no one, thanks to \nadvances in meteorology and satellite technology. Could anyone have \nimagined this in 1900, as we buried the dead from the largest natural \ndisaster in American history? Hardly. But this is how a free, creative \nworld develops if the governments allow ingenuity to thrive to improve \nour lives.\n  What will be the technology of the future? No one can say for \ncertain. But we all can spur its development by encouraging the \nmarketplace in the vast, diverse fields of nanotechnology or \naeronautics, for prime examples.\n  And that is the state of our climate. Climate will continue to \nchange. That cannot be stopped. But so will technology change, unless \nthe Government\n\n[[Page S13596]]\n\nchooses to hinder new investment in better materials, fuels and \nsystems. Fortunately, now sound science, rather than political science, \nshows warming is a much slower process than was once feared.\n  My bottom line is that I cannot countenance the loss of tens of \nthousands of American jobs based upon the scientific factual evidence \nsurrounding this measure.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 October 28, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: We are writing to state our serious \n     concerns about S. 139, ``The Climate Stewardship Act of \n     2003,'' and to strongly urge that you vote against this bill \n     to avoid the significant job losses and economic harm that it \n     would inflict on our economy, without necessarily achieving \n     any reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.\n       According to an analysis conducted by the independent \n     Energy Information Administration (EIA), S. 139 would cause \n     an estimated average loss of 460,000 American jobs through \n     2025, with estimated job losses reaching 600,000 by 2012. \n     Instead of improving our economic security through economic \n     growth and job creation, the job losses resulting from S. 139 \n     would place an unacceptable burden on American workers and \n     the American people. EIA's analysis further reveals the \n     higher energy costs the legislation would impose on American \n     energy consumers: once fully implemented, S. 139 would \n     require a 40 cent per gallon increase in gasoline prices and \n     cause nearly a 50% increase in natural gas and electricity \n     bills.\n       As a result of these higher energy costs, EIA projects a \n     net loss of $507 billion (1996 dollars) in Gross Domestic \n     Product over the next two decades. These higher energy costs \n     and reduced economic growth would likely lead American \n     businesses to move overseas, taking jobs with them. As a \n     result, S. 139 may actually lead to an increase in global \n     greenhouse gas emissions as companies formerly in the U.S. \n     move their operations (and emissions) overseas to countries \n     that do not require similar emissions reductions. To \n     compensate for the economic dislocation that S. 139 would \n     cause, the legislation establishes a ``Climate Change Credit \n     Corporation'' for ``transition assistance to dislocated \n     workers and communities.'' However, we believe that the \n     Senate should instead reject this legislation and avoid \n     inflicting the harm that would create the need for such \n     ``transition assistance'' in the first place.\n       President Bush has committed the U.S. to an ambitious and \n     comprehensive strategy to address the issue of global climate \n     change. It is based on the recognition that only a growing \n     American economy can make possible the sustained investments \n     in energy and carbon sequestration technologies needed to \n     reduce the projected long-term growth in global greenhouse \n     gas emissions. Because of its negative impacts on jobs and \n     economic growth, we call upon the Senate to reject S. 139 as \n     a misguided means of achieving our international \n     environmental goals.\n     Donald L. Evans,\n       Secretary of Commerce.\n     Elaine L. Chao,\n       Secretary of Labor.\n     Marianne Horinko,\n       Acting Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, to draw to conclusion this debate, let me \nrepeat a couple of things we did last night. I will briefly address the \nscience issue. I know there are people out there thinking the science \nis settled. The science is not settled. Last night I went into detail \nand I will repeat a couple of significant points.\n  First, Frederick Seitz, the past president of the National Academy of \nSciences, compiled the Oregon petition which had 17,800 independently \nverified signatures--most of those holding degrees of Ph.D. They came \nto this conclusion: There is no convincing scientific evidence that the \nhuman release of carbon dioxide, methane or other greenhouse gasses is \ncausing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of \nthe Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.\n  Again, the Heidelberg Appeal, over 4,000 scientists, 70 of whom are \nNobel Prize winners, signed this Heidelberg Appeal that says there is \nno compelling evidence that is existing today to justify controls of \nanthropogenic--man made--greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Dr. Richard Lindzen, MIT scientist and member of the National Academy \nof Sciences, said--and I don't think anyone would question his \ncredentials--said there is a definite disconnect between Kyoto and \nscience. Should a catastrophic scenario prove correct, Kyoto would not \nprevent it.\n  Lastly, the Harvard-Smithsonian study, the most exhaustive study out \nthere, 240 peer-reviewed papers published by thousands of researchers \nover the last four decades, says the science is flawed. It is important \npeople realize that is the situation.\n  Probably the most significant item we should have been talking about \nall the time instead of this science--since it is a fact now, I think \npeople understand there are scientists on both sides of this issue--is \nwhat is the effect.\n  Last night we had a chance to talk about the National Black Chamber \nof Commerce and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, how it would \ndisproportionately hurt them in losing jobs. A study that no one has \nchallenged concluded that Kyoto would cost 511,000 jobs of Hispanic \nworkers and 864,000 jobs held by Black workers. Is this something we \nall understand?\n  My chart is revealing if Members need statistics for their own State. \nThe State of Illinois is losing 159,000 jobs; the State of Indiana \nloses 194,000. This is a study done by Penn State University.\n  The other significant point is that we are voting on an amendment. \nThis amendment is somewhat pared down. Everyone realizes that this \namendment, as has been stated many times by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut as well as the Senator from Arizona, is just a first \nstep. So everyone has to look at this. This is the Kyoto Treaty. It \nneeds to be looked at in that respect.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield to Senator McCain the remaining \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend. Since I will not speak again, I thank \nthe Senator from Oklahoma for engaging in a spirited and, I hope, \ninformative debate. I thank, of course, my friend from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman.\n  Briefly, as to this petition that keeps being referred to--the \npetition was led by Frederick Seitz, former president of the National \nAcademy of Sciences--an article in the New York Times on April 22, \n1998, entitled ``Science Academy Disputes Attack On Global Warms,'' \nstates:\n\n       The National Academy of Sciences has disassociated itself \n     from a statement and petition circulated by one of its former \n     presidents which disagrees with the scientific conclusions \n     underlying international efforts to control greenhouse gas \n     emissions.\n\n  By the way, Virginia Spice of the Spice Girls, BJ Hunnicutt of \n``Mash,'' and Perry Mason were among the signatories to that. They are \nall respected in their individual fields.\n\n  I do not believe that 10 States in the Northeast would agree to a \nproposal that this is exactly modeled on, if there was going to be some \ndevastating effect on the economies of 10 Northeastern States.\n  Let's get real. This is a very minimal proposal, one that is a first \nstep. I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma because it does not begin \nto comprehensively address the problem, but we have to start somewhere. \nWe have to start somewhere. We have to begin to address this issue.\n  This debate is important. I assure my colleagues, we will be back \nbecause those pictures that I showed are going to get worse and worse \nuntil we begin to address this issue.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I inquire as to how much time is remaining \non both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes thirty seconds for the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. The Senator from Connecticut has 3 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. I say to the Senator from Connecticut, if it \nis your wish, I will be very glad to defer to you to conclude debate on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me get back to something the Senator \nfrom Arizona said. He is not on the floor now. He mentioned some of the \nsignatures were not verified. They keep using this same argument, which \nhas been refuted over and over again. The Perry Mason he refers to \nhappens to be a Ph.D. chemist. It is documented. Again, we are talking \nabout some 17,000 scientists there. There are 4,000 scientists on the \nHeidelberg Petition.\n\n[[Page S13597]]\n\n  Of course, Richard Lindzen, I don't think anyone is going to question \nhis credibility. These studies--particularly the Harvard-Smithsonian \nstudy--is a very significant one.\n  I think the debate has been good. I do not question it when the \nSenator from Arizona--who I respect immensely--says we will be back. I \nam hoping it will be necessary to come back because I am hoping we will \ndefeat this amendment. But it is very significant.\n  Lastly, let me mention I do not know how so many of these groups \ncould be wrong. We have almost every union in the country--the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters, the United Mine Workers, the United Steel \nWorkers. We have all these jobs shown up here, some 3.6 million jobs, \nthat would be lost. This analysis was done by a credible organization, \nPenn State University.\n\n  I cannot imagine that any Member of this Senate would come up here \nand look at this chart and not realize that here we are--we have been \ngoing through a recession that began in March of 2000, and we are now \npulling out of this recession. The jobs are looking good right now. For \nsomething such as this to pass would push us right back in a \ndevastating position.\n  So when you look at what we are talking about today, we are talking \nabout something that would pass in America and that would not have \nanything to do with Mexico, anything to do with China, anything to do \nwith India. I can assure you, right now people from those countries are \nsitting back with their fingers crossed, hoping this passes, because \nthis would be the biggest jobs bill for Mexico and India and the other \ndeveloping nations that we could pass.\n  I say to Senator Lieberman, thank you very much for the spirited \ndebate, as I also thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, if there is any.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 1 second.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I reserve that.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma as \nwell. It has been a spirited debate. It has been an important and \nhistoric debate, but it is the first, I would guess, of many on this \ncritical subject.\n  I must say, it has been a disappointing debate in one regard for me; \nthat is, we are still disagreeing about whether global warming is a \nproblem. The fact is, the overwhelming evidence, upheld by scientists \naround the world and in America--the National Academy of Sciences, et \ncetera--says that the planet is warming, and it is happening because of \nhuman activity.\n  You cannot look at this picture, a satellite picture--seeing the \nreduction of the white part from where it was; and the red lines show \nwhat it was in 1979, 24 years ago--and not say it is real.\n  Senator Akaka from Hawaii told us last night that the sea level is \nrising around Hawaii. Senator Snowe of Maine told us that the sugar \nmaples are dying because it is getting warmer. I myself reported on a \nstory from Inupiat Indians in Alaska saying they had seen robins for \nthe first time in their village because it is getting warmer.\n  This is real. I wish we could agree on the reality and then argue \nabout what we should do about it. As I hear the science--so-called--\ncited on the other side, I want to predict, respectfully, that we are \ngoing to look back at those scientific testaments and put them in the \nsame category as the scientific studies that were introduced by the \ntobacco industry years ago, saying that tobacco did not harm health or \ncause cancer, or the studies that were introduced by the chemical \nindustry that said chlorofluorocarbons did not put a hole in the ozone \nlayer, all of which we know now were just plain bunk. I am afraid that \nis the way we are going to look back at this evidence offered in this \ndebate.\n  Secondly, a lot of the argument about the impact of our proposal on \ncosts and cost of living and jobs is not related to our proposal. It is \nabout the Kyoto protocol. It is about earlier legislation. It is not \nabout the McCain-Lieberman amendment before the Senate for a vote.\n  The one study on our amendment, the MIT independent study, says, in \nfact, costs will go down in the energy field, that the average cost per \nhousehold will be $20 a year--well worth what we are going to get in \nreturn for a safer, better life for our children and grandchildren. \nThey say there is no job loss that can be expected. In fact, a lot of \nmajor entrepreneurs and investors--and I put a letter in the Record to \nSenator Snowe from 60 leading entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley, who \nsay our amendment will create hundreds of thousands of jobs. I ask \nunanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Silver Lake Partners,\n\n                                 Menlo Park, CA, October 17, 2004.\n     Senator Olympia Snowe,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe; I am pleased to enclose a letter from \n     60 Silicon Valley business leaders concerned about the \n     growing threat of global warming. This group comprises CEOs \n     and successful entrepreneurs, distinguished engineers, \n     scientists, and investors. Together, we manage companies with \n     total revenues of $70 billion and over 300,000 employees \n     around the world. Our firms have an aggregate market value of \n     over $160 billion. The venture capitalists and private equity \n     investors among us, primarily focused on commercializing new \n     technology, manage over $44 billion in risk capital.\n       Operating at the core of our modern economy, we recognize \n     the role science and industry play in keeping our country \n     vital. While we are Democrats, Republicans and Independents \n     with often contrasting political views, we share a deep \n     concern about the specter of global warming and potentially \n     devastating effects of climate change. We urge you to take \n     appropriate measures to address this critically important \n     issue.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Kind regards,\n                                                       David Roux,\n     Managing Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Open Letter From Business Leaders,\n\n                                                 October 17, 2003.\n     Senator Olympia Snowe,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: We are business leaders and scientists \n     alarmed by the reality of global warming.\n       Schooled in science and innovation, we recognize that the \n     risks and complexities of climate change are significant, but \n     strongly believe that drive and ingenuity can manage those \n     risks and solve those complexities. While any response that \n     is sufficient to avert dangerous climate change will be long \n     term, the nature of the problem requires action now. The \n     required response--global and domestic--must be equitable and \n     support economic growth based on free market principles.\n       As entrepreneurs who co-exist with government policies, we \n     know that truly effective policies set clear goals and leave \n     businesses free to decide how to meet those goals at lowest \n     cost. We trust any policies you propose have serious \n     environmental goals and encourage the prudent use of market \n     forces to achieve them.\n       Policies employing strict goals and flexible means unleash \n     the power of competition and spur innovation to protect the \n     environment. A healthy economy and a healthy environment go \n     hand in hand. American business has the ingenuity to solve \n     the problem of global warming while continuing to prosper. \n     Indeed, businesses that find ways to lead in solving this \n     problem will prosper even more.\n       While there is still debate about the levels of greenhouse \n     gas reductions necessary to stabilize the climate and protect \n     the United States economy, several things are clear:\n       Reductions must begin immediately;\n       Voluntary efforts alone won't do the job; and\n       Any mandatory restrictions must employ market incentives.\n       We congratulate you for recognizing these needs and for \n     your efforts to see that the Senate addresses them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                    Business Leaders Taking Action\n                                                on Climate Change.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is a call to responsibility. It is \na call to leadership.\n  I remember last year, as we were coming close to the vote on the Iraq \nresolution, I met with a group of officials from the administration and \nCongress--members of both parties--with the Minister of Defense from an \nallied government. Somebody from the administration said: How can we \nget the Europeans to support us more on the potential of a war against \nSaddam?\n  The European Minister said: Get the administration to do something \nabout global warming.\n  This inaction, lack of leadership, debunking by the administration of \nthe problem, failure to accept responsibility is part of the reason we \nare so deeply divided from some of our closest allies.\n  Senator McCain and I and our cosponsors on both sides of the aisle \nhave\n\n[[Page S13598]]\n\nput ourselves on a course. History calls us to action. We will not \nleave this course until the day--may it come sooner than later--when we \nadopt this amendment or something very much like it.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I believe, Mr. President, I have 1 second remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in my last second, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the list of labor unions, agricultural organizations, and other \norganizations opposing S. 139 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n What Do All These Groups Agree On?

Mr. President, I have not spoken to the two managers, but I \nfeel confident it would be OK with them. This is not in the form of a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Following the vote, Senator Boxer wishes to speak for 10 minutes. \nFollowing that, Senator Bingaman is ready to offer his amendment. He \nwill take a limited period of time. Following that, Senator Leahy has \nan amendment. He has asked for 30 minutes.\n  So that is just general information we are going to try to move on as \nquickly as possible on the Healthy Forests matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Lieberman-\nMcCain amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) is necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Nelson) is \nattending a family funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNebraska (Mr. Nelson) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 43, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 420 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Edwards\n     Nelson (NE)\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2028) was rejected.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request. We \nhave just voted on the amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the \nunderlying bill be referred back to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after extensive consideration of the \nviews of many constituents who have contacted me on this very important \nbill, I decided to vote against it because of the open questions on the \nimpact on climate and the consequences for the national and State \neconomies, which are very fragile at the moment.\n  It is always a difficult matter to balance environmental protection \nand the need for economic development and jobs. I believe that global \nwarming is a matter of great international importance and the 43 votes \nin favor of this bill puts the administration and others on notice that \nthere is considerable sentiment for stronger action to address this \nproblem.\n  I have voted for environmental protection for renewable energy and \nconservation measures, and I have initiated legislation to limit the \namount of oil which will be consumed at various intervals in the \nfuture.\n  As a Pennsylvania Senator, I have a particular interest in the \ncontinued use of coal, our Nation's most abundant energy supply, \nespecially in the context of the billions of tons of bituminous coal in \nthe western part of Pennsylvania and anthracite coal in the eastern \npart of Pennsylvania. This bill would have a serious impact on our \nsteel industry, our chemical industry, and manufacturing.\n  In this context, it is very difficult to adopt a limit by the year \n2010 since we cannot predict at this time what the situation will be \nwith our national and State economies.\n  In addition, it is very difficult to limit industry in the United \nStates when we do not have a plan for the rest of the world in curbing \ngreen house gas emissions. That would have a harmful effect on the \ncompetitiveness of the United States. An international plan is \nnecessary. Unilateral action by the United States would not solve the \nproblem. I have, with other Senators, urged the President to work \nthrough international means to address global climate change. I support \nhis efforts and those of the individual companies to curb voluntarily \ndomestic emissions, but it is likely that stronger action will have to \nbe taken in the future on a multilateral basis.\n  These questions remain: What would the reductions under this \nlegislation do to climate change? What are the anticipated costs? Who \nwould pay the costs? What are particularly vulnerable industries that \ncould not, for instance, pass on any increased energy costs? What is \nthe expected impact on fuel supply and demand, particularly with regard \nto fuel-switching and natural gas prices? What will happen to economic \ngrowth and overall competitiveness in a global economy if only U.S. \nemissions are reduced?\n\n[[Page S13599]]\n\n  While I was unable to support this particular bill, I believe it will \ngive impetus to action to deal with global warming. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate on this important issue in the \nhopes of finding common ground and a sensible balance between the goals \nof environmental protection and economic development. I encourage \nsupporters and opponents of this bill to consider the concerns of each \nother and work in earnest to bridge the many differences in support of \nthe common good.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, although I am extremely concerned about \nglobal warming, I voted in opposition to Senator McCain and Senator \nLieberman's Climate Stewardship Act. My chief concern was that this \nbill would raise gas and electric prices at a time when Arkansas' \neconomy is struggling to recover and many residents from my state are \nfinding it difficult to make ends meet.\n  I firmly believe that we have a responsibility to seek a solution to \nglobal warming. But at this time, when our economy is struggling and \nour federal deficit is at record levels, I can not support a measure \nwhich in all likelihood will result in higher energy prices for \nconsumers in Arkansas and a loss of jobs in my state. If the United \nStates stands alone on this issue, I fear other countries will be able \nto take businesses away from our country with the lure of weaker \nenvironmental regulations. A comprehensive global solution must be \ndeveloped that includes all nations. I do believe we must continue to \nwork toward initiatives to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and \nencourage cleaner sources of energy, such as the numerous biodiesel \nmeasures I have fought to include in the Energy bill.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to voice my opposition to the \nBush administration's view on this subject. The indifferent and callous \napproach taken to global climate change sent a message to the world \nthat this issue is not a priority. President Bush has stated that \ncompelling evidence of global warming does not exist. I disagree. It is \ntime for the administration to change its policy. It is only through \ncooperation with the global community that we can see these warming \ntrends reversed. I applaud the efforts of Senators McCain and Lieberman \nin bringing this bill before the Senate when few committee chairmen \nshowed interest in it. While I was not able to support them today for \nthe reasons I have stated, I am eager to work with them in the future \nto find a solution to this important issue.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexplain why I had to oppose the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship \nAct.\n  First, let me say that my vote does not reflect a change my belief \nthat global climate change is a serious problem, perhaps one of the \nmost serious long-term environmental and public health problems facing \nthe world over the next century. I am deeply disappointed that this \nadministration has decided not to actively engage the world on this \nissue and has in fact disengaged itself from the world on global \nclimate change. I echo the concerns of the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, Senator Byrd, that the administration's approach is \nshort-sighted, and that it is no longer constructive to argue that \nhuman-caused emissions are not contributing to the warming of the \nearth. The science is just too strong to believe otherwise.\n  The administration's approach is frustrating because engaging the \nworld particularly the developing world--is the only way we will ever \nget a handle on rising greenhouse gas emissions. Small reductions in \nemissions made by the U.S. will be meaningless if those reductions are \nmade unilaterally. We must have assurances that the world is moving \nhand in hand with us--and is making similar sacrifices--before we \nhandicap our own economy.\n  This will take time, but solving the problem of global warming is a \nlife-time endeavor by any estimate, for our generation, and the next. \nPart of this effort will include massive investments in new energy \ntechnologies, in renewables, in alternative energy, in hybrid cars and \nfuel cells, and in making our economy and the world's economy more \nenergy efficient. It will likely, if and when the United States takes \nthe leadership roll on this issue that it should, involve mandatory \ngreenhouse gas reductions by all nations.\n  I would like to compliment Senators McCain and Lieberman for working \nso hard on this proposal, and for attempting to find a balanced \nsolution. If we had more time, and more attention from the \nadministration, I am confident that we could work together on a common \nsense bill that would achieve meaningful reductions in U.S. greenhouse \ngas emissions without threatening the U.S. economy or our global \ncompetitiveness. Such a bill would hopefully complement a meaningful \nand real global consensus on how to address human-caused climate \nchange.\n  I voted against McCain-Lieberman today because I don't think the \ncountry is ready to take the steps outlined in their bill and because I \nwas concerned about the impacts on my state, particularly agriculture, \nfrom increased natural gas prices. But I agree that we must move \nforward aggressively to put the United States and the world on track to \nsignificantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. It will only get \nharder the longer we continue to ignore the problem.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues, Senators \nMcCain and Lieberman, for all their hard work on S. 139, the Climate \nStewardship Act, and express my full support for this legislation. \nUnfortunately, this bill did not pass the Senate. This bipartisan \nlegislation would have been a meaningful step in the right direction \ntoward reducing our Nation's greenhouse gas emissions and would have \nhelped address the problem of global warming.\n  There is no question that climate change is one of the most serious \nenvironmental challenges facing this nation and the world. We know that \nclimate change is real. The overwhelming weight of scientific opinion \nsupports the idea that climate change is occurring, that it is human-\ninduced, that it will have significant and harmful consequences, and \nthat we need to do something about it.\n  California has a great deal to lose if we do not take steps to halt \nand reverse climate change. My State enjoys tremendous ecological \ndiversity ranging from our cool and wet redwood forests of the North \nCoast, to the hot Mojave and Colorado deserts in the southeast, to the \nvast fertile agricultural stretches in the Central Valley. Climate \nchange is a very real threat to those natural ecosystems.\n  Scientific predictions indicate that human-induced global warming may \nproduce a 3- to 10-degree rise in temperature over the next 97 years. \nThat may not initially sound dramatic. But it would be enough to change \nthe timing and amount of precipitation in my State. This could, for \ninstance, lead to decreased summer stream flows, which would intensify \nthe already significant controversy over the allocation of water for \nurban, agricultural and environmental needs.\n  Scientists also predict that by the year 2050, California will face \nhigher average temperatures every month of the year in every part of \nthe State. The average temperature in June in the Sierra Nevada \nMountains, for instance, could increase by 11 degrees Fahrenheit. The \nsnowpack in the Sierra, which is a vital source of water in the State, \nis expected to drop by 13 feet and to have melted entirely nearly 2 \nmonths earlier than it does now. This means that the precious water on \nwhich we now rely for agriculture, drinking water, and other purposes.\n  In light of the threat global warming poses to my State, the Nation, \nand the world, I believe we must take steps to reduce our greenhouse \ngas emissions.\n  The Climate Stewardship Act would have required companies in the \nenergy, transportation and manufacturing sectors to reduce their \ngreenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels by 2010. The bill would have \nprovided tax incentives for the development of energy-efficient \ntechnology. The Climate Stewardship Act would have also encouraged the \nuse of environmentally-friendly manufacturing technology.\n  This bill would have provided a reasonable approach to help us \nachieve the goal of reducing greenhouse gases and addressing global \nwarming. I am extremely disappointed that the Senate did not pass this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S13600]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13600-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13600-S13611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HEALTHY FORESTS RESTORATION ACT OF 2003\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is under the previous order \nthe Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 1904, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1904) to improve the capacity of the Secretary \n     of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to plan and \n     conduct hazardous fuel reduction projects on National Forest \n     System lands and Bureau of Land Management lands aimed at \n     protecting communities, watersheds, and certain other at-risk \n     lands from catastrophic wildfire, to enhance efforts to \n     protect watersheds and address threats to forest and \n     rangeland health, including catastrophic wildfire, across the \n     landscape, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We need the manager of the bill on the floor for the \nmajority. Senator Bingaman is ready to offer an amendment. He was here \nall day yesterday.\n  What we would like to do is have Senator Bingaman offer his \namendment--I have not spoken to the two leaders--have that set aside \ntemporarily and then move to the Leahy amendment. They will both be \nrelatively short in time, and then we can arrange an appropriate time \nfor voting on these.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Good Economic News\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we prepare over the next several minutes \nto shift gears back to a very important piece of legislation, I just \nwant to take this opportunity to comment on another issue and that is \nthe issue of the economy. There is very good news, news that was \nreleased today, and that is that the economy grew by 7.2 percent in \nthis last quarter--in July, August, and September. This to me is really \na spectacular piece of news, especially as we know the people are \nfollowing this economy very closely, especially to see what the \nresponse is to the President's tax relief package several months ago.\n  Mr. President, 7.2 percent is spectacular in so many ways. In fact, \nit has been nearly 19 years--I guess the last date was in 1984--that \nthe economy last saw such growth. This news is not totally unexpected. \nFor the last several days I have come to the Senate Chamber to suggest \nthat this is the sort of figure we could expect, in large part because \nof the policies we enacted earlier this year, specifically the tax \nreductions which we knew would result in such growth. Indeed, we are \nnow seeing that hard data of growth--7.2 percent in the last quarter.\n  This positive news was also reflected and added to by this morning's \nnumbers which showed that personal consumption has increased at 6.6 \npercent as well. It is interesting that consumption makes up about 70 \npercent of our economic growth. That is, 70 percent of all of this \neconomic growth is accounted for by consumption. If we looked at just \nthat impact of consumption alone, we would have seen growth in our \neconomy of 4.6 percent.\n  Equally if not more important for the longer term, another measure, \nbusiness investment, grew by 11.1 percent. To me, this suggests we will \ncontinue to see growth well into the future as they rebuild, as they \nreinvest, as they retool their factories and prepare for the future.\n  Government spending, another component of growth which accounted for \nmuch of the growth earlier this year, was not the most important factor \naccounting for today's news. Indeed, Government spending only increased \nabout 1.4 percent. I say that because a lot of people say we are just \nspending so much these days in terms of Government; that is why the \neconomy is growing. But as the figures show, most of that growth is in \nthis dramatic increase in consumption, an increase of 6.6 percent \naccording to today's news.\n  Maybe lost in the big news this morning is what really matters in \nthis growth--the jobs issue. The Department of Labor reported this \nmorning that the initial claims for unemployment declined by 5,000 last \nweek, affirming this downward trend in unemployment. So this morning we \nhave good news released. The numbers released today indeed indicate a \nramp up to recovery. I do expect the growth in the quarters ahead will \nsettle down to a more realistic and sustainable level.\n  The point is, we are making progress. We are making real progress. \nThe policies we put into place are beginning to take hold.\n  We clearly have a lot more work to do. We must do more to create jobs \nand bring economic recovery to all of our citizens. Thus, we really \ncan't rest on these reports today. But at the same time, in this body \nwe must continue to work toward reducing the cost of doing business in \nthis country.\n  I immediately turn to issues we are talking about, both on the floor \nand off--health care, energy, class action, litigation costs. We need \nto remove barriers to investment and economic growth so employers can \ncreate jobs.\n\n  Our work here in the Congress must go forward with renewed \ndedication. Today we do see firsthand the effects of the President's \neconomic policies. Such results should encourage all of us to work even \nharder to bring economic recovery to the doorstep of every American.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, too, am pleased at the good news that the \nGDP has gone up. But for the 3 million people who have lost jobs, J-O-B \nis more important than G-D-P. This last month, another 46,000 jobs have \nbeen lost in this country; during this administration, more than 3 \nmillion jobs. This is the only President since Herbert Hoover who has \nhad a net loss in jobs. I think this is very unfortunate. I hope the \nGDP continues to grow and in the process create jobs.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the committee that has \njurisdiction of the bill now before the Senate and I spoke with the \nmajority leader and minority leader a few minutes ago. It is the wish \nof the distinguished chairman of this committee, the manager of this \nbill, that when an amendment is offered--unless there is some \nexception--we are going to debate that and vote on it, dispose of it \none way or the other.\n  As we spoke to the majority leader, the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi and I--everyone should be--we were both in tune with the \nmajority leader. Today's votes are going to take 20 minutes. After 20 \nminutes, the majority leader said he is going to ask that the clerk \nannounce the vote. There are going to be people who miss votes, but \nthat is their problem. All staffs who are listening to me, everyone \nshould understand, if the majority leader follows through on what he \nsaid--and I am confident he will--a few people will miss votes. But I \nthink fewer will miss them the second time and fewer the third time.\n  If we are going to finish this most important bill, we cannot have \nvotes going 40 minutes, and that is what they were going yesterday. It \nis unfair to the managers of the bill, unfair to the Senate, unfair to \nthe country.\n  I hope that following the vote of Senator Bingaman, we will stick to \n20-minute votes, no matter who isn't here for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me compliment the distinguished \nacting leader. He correctly states the content of the conversation that \nwe had which included the majority leader. The custom, in recent \nhistory anyway, has been to accumulate amendments and then have the \nvotes stacked to occur at a certain time. That is well and good, if you \nknow how many amendments you have. We don't have a finite list of \namendments. That is one thing we need. If Senators would let us know \nwhich amendments they intend to offer, we can probably manage this bill \nmore efficiently and save time for everybody.\n  We want to finish the bill tonight. That is my intention. I think \nthat is\n\n[[Page S13601]]\n\nthe intention of the acting Democratic leader as well.\n  The regular order is, if you have an amendment, come and offer it. We \nwill debate it and dispose of it. We will give you a vote on it and \nmove to table it or we will accept it.\n  Senator Bingaman is here with an amendment. It is an important \namendment. I understand that he is going to seek the floor and offer \nthat amendment. We will debate it and dispose of it.\n  I very much thank the two leaders for their effort to help move this \nbill along and ensure that the votes we have are held to a minimum \namount of time. We are going to try to enforce that.\n  I thank everybody concerned.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say one additional thing, we have \nrun a hotline on our side. We are very close to having a finite list of \namendments. That will be offered on this side. We know the intense \ninterest in this bill from all sides. No one exemplifies the interest \nin this bill more than the Senator from Oregon. Senator Wyden has been \nvery responsive to the bill that is before us. He has been here \nvirtually every minute this matter has been on the floor. Like so many \npeople who are concerned about this, he wants this bill to be completed \nas quickly as possible. I think with the cooperation of the Senate we \ncan do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I want to recognize \nmy friend from New Mexico who has spent a lot of time on this bill and \nhas an important amendment.\n  As we go to the amendments this afternoon--particularly those from my \nside--I think it is critically important that the bipartisan compromise \nwhich was consummated yesterday in a 97-to-1 vote on the floor of the \nSenate not become unraveled today. This is, in my view, the only bill \nthat can make it to the President's desk. It is a balanced approach on \nmanagement. It ensures that the public has every single opportunity to \nparticipate in the debate about forestry but, at the same time, it does \nnot establish a constitutional right to a 5-year delay on every \nconceivable matter that may relate to the forestry sector.\n  In particular, it provides for potentially lifesaving hazardous fuel \nreduction projects in our national forests. We have to respond to what \nwe have seen in California. It is a heartfelt need in that State.\n  If this legislation as set out in the compromise doesn't become law, \nwhat we have seen in California in the last few days, and as we saw in \nOregon last year, is going to be what the country faces year after \nyear.\n  I am very interested in working with our colleagues in an expeditious \nmanner. I thank Senator Cochran again for all of his cooperation. \nSenator Bingaman has been waiting for a long time.\n  I intend to work with all of our colleagues on this amendments today. \nWhat I especially look forward to is completing the work on this \nlegislation. It was a very exciting development to have yesterday's \nvote by such a large plurality. It shows what you can do if you stay at \nit and try to find common ground in an area that is about as \ncontentious as you can find. As Senator Cochran noted, we hope \ncolleagues will bring amendments to the floor and move expeditiously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2031\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2031.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide the Secretary of Agriculture with the authority to \n   borrow funds from the Treasury to pay for firefighting costs that \n  exceed funds available and to provide funding to conduct hazardous \n  fuels reduction and burned area restoration projects on non-Federal \n                    lands in and around communities)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following two new \n     sections:\n\n     SEC. __. BORROWING AUTHORITY FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall, upon \n     the request of the Secretary of Agriculture, make available \n     to the Secretary of Agriculture, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums as may be \n     necessary in each fiscal year to carry out fire suppression \n     activities. The Secretary of Agriculture may make such \n     request only if fire suppression costs exceed the amount of \n     funding available to the Forest Service for fire suppression \n     in a fiscal year.\n       (b) Audit.--Not later than 180 days after the Secretary of \n     Agriculture exercises the authority provided by this section, \n     the Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture shall \n     submit to the Secretary and to the Congress an audit of \n     expenditures of funds provided under this section. Upon a \n     determination by the Inspector General that specific amounts \n     of such funds were used for purposes other than fire \n     suppression, or upon a determination that specific \n     expenditures of such funds were both unreasonable and \n     excessive, the Secretary, not later than 30 days after \n     receiving the audit of the Inspector General, shall reimburse \n     the Treasury, out of unobligated balances for the Forest \n     Service for the fiscal year in which the funds were provided, \n     for the amounts so identified by the Inspector General.\n\n     SEC. __. COMMUNITY PROTECTION AND BURNED AREA RESTORATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--During fiscal years 2004 through 2008, the \n     Secretaries shall carry out a joint program to reduce the \n     risk of wildfire to structures and restore burned areas on \n     non-Federal lands, including county-owned lands, tribal \n     lands, nonindustrial private lands, and State lands, using \n     the authorities available pursuant to this section, the \n     National Fire Plan and the Emergency Watershed Protection \n     program.\n       (b) Cost Share Grants.--In implementing this section, the \n     Secretaries may make cost-share grants to Indian tribes, \n     local fire districts, municipalities, homeowner associations, \n     and counties, to remove, transport, and dispose of hazardous \n     fuels around homes and property to--\n       (1) prevent structural damage as a result of wildfire, or\n       (2) to restore or rehabilitate burned areas on non-Federal \n     lands.\n       (c) Non-Federal Contribution.--The non-Federal contribution \n     may be in the form of cash or in-kind contribution.\n       (d) Appropriation and Availability of Funds.--The Secretary \n     of Treasury shall make available to the Secretaries out of \n     any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated \n     $100,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2008 to \n     carry out this section, which shall remain available until \n     expended.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, although I interrupted the clerk before \nthe clerk was able to read the entire amendment, I think probably the \nbest way for me to start my description of the amendment is to go \nthrough and read some portions of it so Members know what I am \nproposing.\n  There are two parts to the amendment. It adds two new sections to the \nbill in order to provide meaningful new authority and actual resources \nto protect communities at risk from unnaturally intense catastrophic \nwildfire.\n  We had a little bit of debate yesterday--and we will again today--\nabout what exactly has been the problem and what the policy mistakes \nand failures are here in Washington that have contributed to this \nproblem.\n  I would suggest to you that the major failure which has occurred here \nin Washington that has contributed to the problem is the one I am \ntrying to address with this amendment; that is, inadequate funding with \nwhich to proceed not only to fight fires but to do the necessary \nthinning and the necessary restoration activities that we are all in \nagreement need to be made.\n  The first section that this amendment would add reads as follows: I \nwill read through the most significant parts of it. It says:\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury shall, upon the request of \n     the Secretary of Agriculture--\n\n  And, of course, that is where the Forest Service is located, in the \nDepartment of Agriculture--\n\n     make available to the Secretary of Agriculture, out of any \n     money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums \n     as may be necessary in each fiscal year to carry out fire \n     suppression activities. The Secretary of Agriculture may make \n     such request only if fire suppression costs exceed the amount \n     of funding available to the Forest Service for fire \n     suppression in a fiscal year.\n\n  What we are saying is we are going to do our best here to appropriate \nmoney for fire suppression; that is, firefighting activities. But to \nthe extent that we fall short, the Secretary of Agriculture can go to \nthe Department of the Treasury and get funds with which to do that \nfirefighting.\n  We have a second part of this section. It is an audit provision. It \nsays:\n\n\n[[Page S13602]]\n\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the Secretary of Agriculture \n     exercises the authority provided by this section, the \n     Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture shall \n     submit to the Secretary and to the Congress an audit of \n     expenditures of funds provided under this section. Upon a \n     determination by the Inspector General that specific amounts \n     of such funds were used for purposes other than fire \n     suppression, or upon a determination that specific \n     expenditures of such funds were both unreasonable and \n     excessive, the Secretary, not later than 30 days after \n     receiving the audit of the Inspector General, shall reimburse \n     the Treasury, out of unobligated balances for the Forest \n     Service for the fiscal year in which the fund were provided. \n     . . .\n\n  Essentially, we are doing an audit. If there is any misuse of funds, \nif they are used for anything other than fire suppression, then the \nForest Service in the Department of Agriculture shall essentially take \nthose funds out of their hide and deal with the situation that way.\n  That is the first part of the amendment.\n  The second part of the amendment that I am offering is entitled, \n``Community Protection And Burned Area Restoration.'' It says, in \ngeneral:\n\n       During fiscal years 2004 through 2008, the Secretaries [the \n     Secretary of Agriculture who has jurisdiction over the Forest \n     Service and the Secretary of the Interior] shall carry out a \n     joint program to reduce the risk of wildfire to structures \n     and restore burned areas on non-Federal lands, including \n     country-owned lands, tribal lands, nonindustrial private \n     lands, and State lands, using the authorities available \n     pursuant to this section, the National Fire Plan and the \n     Emergency Watershed Protection Program.\n\n  We are talking about funds to do restoration work on land that the \nFederal Government doesn't own.\n  The second part of this talks about cost share grants. It says:\n\n       In implementing this section, the Secretaries may make \n     cost-share grants to Indian tribes, local fire districts, \n     municipalities, homeowner associations, and counties, to \n     remove, transport, and dispose of hazardous fuels around \n     homes and property to--\n       (1) prevent structural damage as a result of wildfire, or\n       (2) to restore or rehabilitate burned areas on non-Federal \n     lands.\n\n  This is still on non-Federal lands. It says the non-Federal \ncontribution may be in the form of cash or in-kind contribution, and \nthen it authorizes the appropriation of $100 million in each of those \nyears, 2004 through 2008, to do their work, to make these grants, to \nhelp these non-Federal agencies and entities deal with the problems.\n  Much of the fire we have seen on television in recent days is, in \nfact, not on Federal land. They are desperately in need of assistance \nfrom the Federal Government. This is assistance that would be of that \ntype and should be in place every year.\n  I will go through a more complete description of the amendment. The \namendment does add two new sections to the bill to provide meaningful \nnew authority and actual resources to protect communities at risk from \nunnaturally intense catastrophic wildfire. If we are not going to add \nreal resources as part of this bill, we are, in fact, making a false \npromise to the American people. We can give all the speeches about how \nwe are going to pass the bill, the President is going to sign it, \neverything is going to be rosy, the clouds are going to clear, and we \nare going to be in the sunny uplands--the broad sunny uplands, is the \nway Churchill said it.\n  The reality is, if we do not provide resources to help, it is a false \npromise. This amendment will try to help provide those resources.\n  The first part of the amendment allows the Forest Service to borrow \nfunds from the Treasury to pay for firefighting during the years in \nwhich available funds do not cover costs. Someone might say that is a \npretty rare occasion, a year when the funds available do not cover the \ncost. Let me cite the last 3 years: 2001, 2002, and 2003, Forest \nService firefighting funding.\n  We have three columns on my chart: The President's request, what was \nactually appropriated, and what was actually spent, what we wound up \nspending out of Federal Government funds to deal with this problem.\n  In 2001, the President requested the Congress appropriate the budget \nhe sent us of $291 million. Fortunately, through the good offices of \nSenator Cochran and other Members, we did better than that. I very much \nappreciate that. Senator Byrd deserves credit, as do other Members on \nthe Democratic side. We appropriated $469 million--not quite twice what \nthe President asked for, but it is getting close. The amount that was \nactually needed was $683 million. So we missed it by a little--we were \nmore than $200 million short of what the Forest Service actually had to \nspend for firefighting in that year.\n  In 2002, the President asked for more. He said $291 million was not \nenough, how about $325 million. This is for the whole country. He said, \n$325 million ought to be plenty for the whole country. In fact, we \nappropriated a little less than he asked for, $321 million. What was \nactually needed was $1.28 billion. So we missed it by not quite $1 \nbillion. That is $1 billion that was spent by the Forest Service of \nfunds not appropriated to them for this firefighting activity.\n  In 2003, which we just finished, the President said we need $421 \nmillion. The Appropriations Committee said no; let's make it $418 \nmillion. We spent over $1 billion--$1.02 billion.\n  There is a shortfall each year. It is a question of whether the \nshortfall is $1 billion, a couple hundred million, but every year we \nhave done this. At least since this President has been in town, we have \nseen a significant shortfall. What I am trying to do is begin to \naddress that problem.\n  The real problem that needs to be addressed with respect to the \nForest Service situation is the practice of borrowing. Every time we do \nthis, every time we give them much less money that turns out to be \nneeded for firefighting, they have no choice but to take money from \nother accounts in order to deal with that problem. They do that.\n  Let me point out for the year 2002, the year we had the total amount \ntransferred out of other accounts to fight fires was $1.02 billion. \nWhat did that come from? It came from different accounts, but a big \nchunk of it came out of accounts that are the accounts we are saying in \nthe Senate are our highest priority. We want money for forest \nrestoration, we want money for thinning of forests, for getting the \nunderbrush out of the way so we do not have the fires. In fact, that \nfunding is not available to the Forest Service because they are too \nbusy using it to fight fires rather than to get ahead of the problem \nand deal with that.\n  There are many examples I will cite of the problem we are dealing \nwith. In my home State of New Mexico, we have a publication, a 1-page \nsheet the Forest Service issued called ``Effects of Transferring Money \nto Fire Suppression.'' That is what this chart is reflecting. All of \nthe money on the chart was transferred to fire suppression, to \nfirefighting. This was issued in April by the Forest Service with \nregard to New Mexico. It says the 2002 fire season was intense. The \ncost of suppressing these fires was nearly $1.3 billion. The Forest \nService transferred $1 billion from other discretionary and mandatory \naccounts to defray fire suppression costs. Over $55 million was \nborrowed from national forests in Arizona and New Mexico. Some critical \nprojects in New Mexico were postponed for up to 1 year as a result of \nfire borrowing. These included wildland/urban interface fuels projects, \nin the Carson National Forest, in the Gila National Forest, in the \nLincoln National Forest, in the Santa Fe National Forest; a contract \nfor construction of a fuel break around the community at risk in the \nCibola National Forest was postponed for 6 months.\n  What they have to do when they shift the money out of these accounts, \nthey have to put that forest thinning or forest restoration project on \nhold because they cannot afford it. They are too busy fighting fires. \nWe need the money to fight fires. We have caused them to do that every \nyear.\n  A similar problem exists in many other States. I will indicate a few \nof those, States that have a great interest in this legislation. I have \na document called ``Summary of Effects of Transferring Money to Fire \nSuppression.'' As a result of recent fire transfers in which money has \nbeen transferred from various Forest Service accounts to pay for \nemergency wildfire suppression, critical Forest Service projects were \npostponed or canceled throughout the West. There are literally hundreds \nof examples of unfortunate consequences\n\n[[Page S13603]]\n\nthat resulted, including canceled prescribed burns, thinning projects, \ntimber sales, evasive weed control programs, and emergency burned area \nrehabilitation projects.\n  The consequences are felt beyond dangerous forest conditions, and \nthey range from the postponement of dam safety inspection to the \ninability to finalize a tribal energy development agreement.\n  I have already given examples from my State of New Mexico. In Idaho, \nspring burning projects in the Nez Perce National Forest were \npostponed.\n  A brush-cutting project in Clearwater National Forest could not be \ncompleted.\n  In Montana, a hazardous fuels reduction project in the wildland/urban \ninterface of the Bitter Root National Forest was postponed and slated \nfor possible cancellation.\n  In Oregon, watershed assessments and restoration activities \nassociated with the Biscuit Fire were delayed. Numerous timber sales \nand wildland/urban interface thinning work was postponed.\n  In Washington, white pine blister rust thinning and pruning projects \nwere deferred.\n  In California, nearly $6 million was transferred out of forest health \nvegetation management and ecological restoration accounts in 2003, \nresulting in having to withdraw stewardship contracts for wildland/\nurban interface fuels reduction projects and the failure to complete \nprescribed burns.\n  So this issue of borrowing is serious. It is one that we need to \naddress as part of this bill.\n  I commend Senator Burns and Senator Dorgan, who are the chairman and \nranking member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, for their \nefforts to secure $400 million to repay the accounts from which the \nagencies have borrowed to fight fires.\n  Now, what happens each year, when we, in fact, give the Forest \nService less money for firefighting than they need, we have to come \nback the next year in supplemental appropriations and ask for funds \nwith which to pay back those accounts so they can hopefully get back to \nthose projects they had to postpone.\n  My understanding is that this amount, this $400 million, was included \nin the conference report that was agreed upon Monday night. I also \nappreciate Senator Burns' comments that the $400 million is not the \nfinal word. I believe he said this is especially true since the Forest \nService alone actually borrowed $695 million from other programs so far \nin this last year.\n  However, this year-to-year approach to the fire-borrowing problem is \nnot an adequate solution. Even when our Senate appropriations \ncolleagues do everything they can to make sure these accounts are \nrepaid every year, on-the-ground restoration work is delayed--it is \nsubstantially delayed--while the Forest Service waits for Congress to \npass a supplemental appropriations bill to once again give them the \nmoney they had originally been given but could not use for that \npurpose. They had to use it for firefighting.\n  The events that occurred earlier this year are a devastating example \nof that. I have sort of gone through that on this chart. The Senate \napproved $289 million in extra wildfire funding in the fiscal year 2003 \nsupplemental spending bill. However, the House dropped it.\n  On July 28, Senator Burns correctly stated on the floor:\n\n     . . . without work in the House to help get these funds, we \n     will be facing an even more drastic situation.\n\n  Nonetheless, the bill that was sent to the President did not contain \nthese urgently needed funds.\n  In my State of New Mexico, some critical Forest Service hazardous \nfuels reduction projects were postponed for up to a year, last year, as \na result of borrowing to fight fires. These include projects in all \nthese national forests I have mentioned.\n  In February 2003, the Missoulian, which I understand is a Montana \nnewspaper--I assume in Missoula--reported that because of fire \nborrowing, Montana and northern Idaho forests ``lost about $80 million, \nincluding $25 million intended for the repair and replanting of forests \nburned two years earlier on the Bitterroot National Forest.''\n  Moreover, as evidenced last year by a $200 million shortfall, the \nsupplemental appropriations often are not sufficient to provide full \nrepayment to the programs that have been raided.\n  So what you have, as we spend what we have on fighting fires--and \nthere is no choice about that--the Forest Service gives up funds that \nwere intended for other purposes. In many cases, this restoration work, \nthat we all are now saying is so important--and I certainly agree is so \nimportant--then we never get around to giving them the full money. We \nnever get around to replacing all the funds that we have taken.\n  Mr. President, let me talk a little about the second part of my \namendment. The second part of the amendment provides $100 million \nannually to reduce fire risk and restore burned areas on non-Federal \nlands.\n  The Forest Service's own researchers state that 77 percent of all \nhigh-risk areas are on non-Federal lands. In addition, the National \nAcademy of Public Administration, in their 2002 report, found that 47 \npercent of acres burned each year are on non-Federal lands. They \nconcluded that decreasing the fuel on all owners' lands is needed to \naddress the large scope of the fire hazard problem.\n  So the second part of the amendment I am offering provides real \nassistance to States and to local partners to conduct projects that \nwill complement the work we are trying to do in national forests and on \npublic lands.\n  If we send a bill to the President which just deals with the issue on \nFederal lands, and then declare victory, the truth is, we will not have \ndealt with the biggest part of the problem. Mr. President, 77 percent \nof all high-risk areas are not on Federal lands; they are on land owned \nby someone else. This second part of my amendment tries to provide some \nlevel of Federal support to those other entities to do the clearing \nthey need to do.\n  Many communities that are adjacent to national forests are doing \ntheir part to better protect themselves from the risk of these \ncatastrophic wildfires.\n  For example, last year--this, again, is an example from my home \nState--the village council in Ruidoso, NM, adopted new laws that set \nfire-resistant construction and landscaping standards and established \nforest health and fire danger reduction requirements. However, even \nwith these new requirements, just a few months ago homeowners in \nRuidoso received notices from insurance companies warning them to thin \nthe trees on their lots or risk losing their coverage altogether.\n  Clearly, we need to assist these communities and these homeowners to \nquickly accomplish that needed work. We need to attack the problem in a \ncomprehensive way. If we reduce fuels on public lands, Federal lands, \nwithout also treating the adjacent non-Federal lands, we will not \nadequately protect our communities.\n  I think anyone who has watched television for the last several days \nhas to believe that is the case. Obviously, many of these subdivisions \nare not on Federal land. They are, in some cases, adjacent to Federal \nland, but much of the thinning that has to occur, in order to protect \ncommunities, is not thinning on Federal lands.\n  A lack of adequate funding for forest health projects continues to \nconstrain our efforts to actively manage the forests to reduce the \nthreat of fire and insects and disease.\n  Three years ago, Congress found that funding was the main obstacle to \nimproving forest health and reducing the threat of unnaturally intense \ncatastrophic fire.\n  Specifically, we created the National Fire Plan. The National Fire \nPlan talked about $1.6 billion in new funding for programs to improve \nforest health conditions. At that time, we all agreed on the need to \nsustain a commitment to the National Fire Plan over a long enough \nperiod to make a difference. We were talking about perhaps 15 years.\n  That meant, at a minimum, sustaining the fiscal year 2001 funding \nlevels for all components of the fire plan. Unfortunately, we have not \nfollowed through. The administration has systematically and continually \nproposed major cuts from that level. In some cases, they have proposed \nzeroing out critical programs within the National Fire Plan, including \nthis burned area, restoration, and rehabilitation, the economic action \nprograms, the community and private fire assistance.\n  The administration proposed these extreme cuts and the elimination of\n\n[[Page S13604]]\n\nfunding, notwithstanding the clearly identified demand for these \nprograms. We hear that demand from communities in all of our States \nwhere forest fires have burned in excess in recent years.\n  This provision, this amendment that I am offering, will also provide \nactual dollars to restore the burned areas on non-Federal lands. After \na fire is extinguished, communities often face equally hazardous \nthreats from landslides and flooding. There has been very little \nattention to that as yet because the fires continue to burn in \nCalifornia. But once those fires are out, we will start hearing about \nflooding and landslides. There needs to be assistance to deal with that \nas well.\n  In creating the national parklands 3 years ago, Congress provided \n$142 million for burned area restoration and rehabilitation. \nNonetheless, in its fiscal year 2002 budget request, the administration \nrequested $3 million--not $142 million--for burned area restoration and \nrehabilitation. In fiscal year 2004, they requested no funds for this \naccount.\n  The amendment I am offering will provide funds for urgent community \nneeds for activities such as soil stabilization after fires occur. The \nquestion we are faced with today is: Are we going to legislate \nsolutions that will really make a difference on the ground?\n  I very much appreciate the provision in the Cochran amendment that \nauthorizes $760 million, but as we all know, authorizing a certain \nlevel of funding in the Congress is not an adequate solution. In fact, \nagency officials tell me under current law there is no ceiling on the \namount of money that could be appropriated to address this problem. \nProviding actual dollars, as my amendment does, clearly is part of the \nsolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both sections of this amendment. This \nis an important issue. I believe that if we pass this legislation \nwithout dealing with both of these issues--the borrowing problem and \nthe problem of not providing funds for work on non-Federal lands--we \nwill be falling far short of where we should be.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reid of Nevada be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, after looking at this amendment, I see it \nclearly increases mandatory spending and, if adopted, would cause the \nunderlying bill to exceed the committee's section 302(a) allocation. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to \nsection 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the applicable sections of the \nBudget Act be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator making a motion?\n  Mr. REID. I am.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask for the yeas and nays on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me speak very briefly to the amendment \nof the Senator from New Mexico. I will be very brief. It is a debatable \nmotion.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has the floor. Will the \nSenator yield for an inquiry?\n  Mr. CRAIG. For a parliamentary inquiry only.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized very briefly \nafter Senator Craig before we go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief. The Senator from New \nMexico makes eminently good sense. There is no question that we have a \nfunding problem. I have spoken with the Assistant Secretary and the \nChief. I chair the Forestry Subcommittee and the committee on which the \nSenator is the ranking member. What I am suggesting we do--because the \nmotion that has just been made in this budget point of order is an \nappropriate one--is to reexamine the whole funding mechanism of the \nForest Service. Your figures are accurate. The kinds of programs that \ngo unfunded now, that would help to begin to correct our forest health \nproblem that is in part driving these fires, is a very real question.\n  As you know, the Forest Service used to have a cash cow. We called it \nlogging. Those revenues flowed in, and money moved around from \ndifferent accounts. You could borrow, as we did during fire seasons, \nand they got replenished. So you raise a very important point. But it \nis a point that we need to totally reexamine. To actually allow the \nForest Service to borrow from the Treasury without going through the \nappropriating process, in my opinion, doesn't really give us the kind \nof fiscal control and responsibility we all ought to have.\n  Certainly as ranking member of the authorizing committee and as a \nmember of the authorizing committee myself, you and I, on an annual \nbasis, ought to aggressively look at this budget, knowing that we have \nfallen far short, and deal with it in an appropriate way. But we have \nnot done that.\n  You recognized, appropriately, the Senator from Montana, who chairs \nthe Subcommittee on Interior that funds this, and others. We ought to \nget at it in an aggressive way. I have already tasked the Assistant \nSecretary and the Chief to look at a variety of mechanisms that fit the \nfunding shortfalls that we need to create the new mechanisms necessary. \nBut I don't believe that direct ability to borrow from the U.S. \nTreasury by an agency itself, without the authority of the authorizing \ncommittee and the appropriators, is an approach we ought to undertake \nat this time. It is, however, an issue whose time has come, and we \nought to deal with it in the appropriate fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have already indicated I want to make \nsure the compromise we voted on yesterday does not unravel. I will \nsupport the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico because I believe \nit will allow us to go forward and make sure the work that the \nbipartisan group did is not in vain.\n  The bottom line is very simple: To get the money to put the fires \nout, fire suppression, you have to go out and steal from every single \nForest Service program around and then hope that at some point down the \nroad you are going to get repaid. It makes a mockery out of any effort \nto responsibly budget in this area. In our part of the world, we see, \nin effect, funds robbed from nonprofit organizations such as Wallowa \nResources, a small nonprofit in eastern Oregon.\n  My only concern about putting this off is that if we don't deal with \nthis issue now, the question is, When will we deal with it? This is an \nextraordinarily important question. It will not, in my view, unravel \nthe compromise which I will fight like crazy to protect, despite the \nfact that I think what the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator \nfrom Idaho have said has considerable validity as well.\n  I hope we will support this amendment and then figure out in the \ncourse of the afternoon some way in which we can find some common \nground on this issue. Today the process of just stealing from every \nprogram around to fight fires really becomes almost farcical. The \nBingaman amendment responds to that. I hope my colleagues will support \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me briefly respond. I know the point \nof order has been made. A motion has been made to waive the Budget Act.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Cantwell as a cosponsor \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the good intent of my friend from Idaho in \nsaying that this is something on which we ought to start working or on \nwhich we ought to work. The reality is, this is our best chance. This \nlegislation is likely to go to the President, likely to be signed into \nlaw in some form. If we don't take the opportunity this legislation \npresents to fix this problem, it\n\n[[Page S13605]]\n\nwill remain unfixed. We can have all of the assurances we want from the \nadministration, but the reality is, the administration is under very \nsevere budgetary restraints as it goes into this next year. We in \nCongress are under very severe budgetary restraints. Everyone around \nthis place is going to be looking for ways to save money. That means \nthat when it comes to actually providing the resources to fight fires, \nthe course of least resistance is to do what we have always been doing, \nwhat President Bush has done in the last several years: Ask for way too \nlittle money for firefighting. And then, when it turns out that you \nneed an extra billion dollars, tell the Forest Service to take it out \nof their other accounts.\n  That is exactly what we have done in the last several years. We are \ngetting ready to do that again. I, for one, am not persuaded that the \nconcern the Senator from Idaho has expressed here is shared by all in \nthe administration. I am confident he believes the issue is one that \nshould be addressed. But each of us, as we know, has different \npriorities for what needs to be addressed. I would say this is a fairly \nlow priority for the people putting the administration's budget \nproposal together, which we are going to receive this next January.\n  I very much think this issue needs to be addressed as part of this \nbill. Again, as I said a couple of times in my earlier statement, if we \npass this bill without addressing the resource problem and the \nborrowing problem I am trying to get at in my amendment, we can give \nall the speeches we want, issue all the press releases, have all the \npress conferences we want saying what a great thing we have done for \nthe American people, but 77 percent of the areas at highest risk are \nnot going to have any Federal resources available to them.\n  In addition to that, the thinning activity, much of the forest \nrestoration activity we all say we favor, is not going to be funded. So \nwe need to deal with this as part of this bill.\n  Frankly, I am sorry to see the decision has been made to try to deal \nwith this as a procedural vote. I think this is an important enough \nissue that we ought to have an up-or-down vote on it and let people \nexpress their point of view. When you raise a Budget Act point of \norder, basically what you are saying is this is not a big enough \npriority to justify changing the way the budget now sits. If that is \nthe conclusion of most Members of the Senate, then I think shame on us. \nIf we have the fires going in California, we have all the other \nproblems we all talk about, and we are not willing to put that to the \nfront of the priority list, then I think shame on us.\n  I very much prefer to see us have an up-or-down vote on this \namendment. Obviously, that is not possible now with the Budget Act \npoint of order and the motion to waive the Budget Act.\n  I will yield the floor, but I urge my colleagues to support the \nmotion to waive the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Nelson) is absent \nattending a family funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 36, nays 60, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 421 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--36\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--60\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n     Nelson (NE)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 36, the are nays \n60. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to ask how long that vote took.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-nine minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't know what more we can do here. I \nwant everyone to know we are doing our best over here to move these \namendments. We have a lot of them over here. We are trying to move \nthem. We can't do it if we waste a lot of time on these votes. I want \neveryone within the sound of my voice to know that we cannot finish the \nbill if these votes take 30 or 40 minutes. Everyone should understand \nthat.\n  There are going to be people coming and asking: When can we leave? I \nhave a plane. Are we going to have votes tomorrow?\n  We will have votes for days, the way this is going. We cannot finish \nthis bill tonight with these votes taking as long as they are taking. I \nam disappointed, frankly, that the majority leader wasn't here to \nterminate the first vote. If we limit votes to 20 minutes, people would \nstop straggling in. It is not fair to the Senate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada is exactly \ncorrect in the fact that we are going to have to have more cooperation \nto move this bill along. We agreed before this vote that we could cut \noff votes after 20 minutes. We had the endorsement of that by the \nmajority leader. But because Senators were on their way to vote and \npeople told us they were on their way to vote, the vote dragged out \nlonger than that.\n  I hope Senators will cooperate with the managers of the bill and \nleadership and let's get here and vote when the buzzer sounds and not \nwait until the last minute. These votes are going to be cut short. I \nhope everyone will cooperate with us.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with the understanding of the manger of this \nbill, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Montana, Mr. \nBaucus, be recognized for 15 minutes to speak on the bill and whatever \nelse he wishes to speak on; further, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman, who still has a number of other amendments that he wishes to \nbe offered be recognized to offer the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nNevada, and the managers of the bill for their accommodation.\n  It is vital that we pass this legislation this year.\n  Montana recently suffered from devastating wildfires, as have other \nwestern States. As the Senator from California, Senator Feinstein \npointed out repeatedly, the current news from Southern California is a \npainful reminder of a very large problem.\n  Across this country forests are threatened by insects, disease and \nthe build up of hazardous fuels. The impacts of these conditions are \nreal. And they play out year after year, fueling large fires that \ndestroy lives and homes, diminish water and air quality, and destroy \nwildlilfe habitat.\n\n[[Page S13606]]\n\n  The cost of containing these large fires is staggering, straining \nState and Federal budgets and devastating local economies.\n  There are many reasons for the situation we are in today, ranging \nfrom weather and natural cycles to urban sprawl and the fire \nsuppression policies of the past.\n  We can't do anything to change the weather and we certainly can't \nchange the past, but we can use today's knowledge and the wisdom of our \nexperience to do better.\n  Neglecting the problem is not the answer; nor is more talk. We have \nto try a new approach. The compromise healthy forests bill is not \nperfect, but I believe it offers options to more efficiently address \nour forest health problems and the consequences they have on real \npeople. I also believe this bill will help put people in rural \ncommunities back to work in the woods, especially in my State of \nMontana.\n  I have said over and over again that a healthy forests bill must \nfirst allow federal agencies and communities to address dangerous fuel \nloadings on a local level, quickly and efficiently. Second, it must \nsupport small, independent mills and put local people to work in the \nforests and the mills. Third, it must promote and protect citizen \ninvolvement and be fair to the principles underlying the federal \njudicial system. And finally, it must protect and help restore special \nand sensitive places like wilderness areas.\n  I think we have achieved that with this legislation.\n  People impacted by forest health problems don't belong to just one \npolitical party.\n  This is a problem that requires all sides to work together. I would \nlike to commend the tremendous efforts of my Democratic and Republican \ncolleagues, including Senators Feinstein, Wyden, Cochran, Craig, Crapo, \nMcCain and Lincoln, who along with several other Senators and myself \nworked very had to put together the compromise on healthy forests that \nI am proud to support and co-sponsor.\n  This was no small feat; this bill touches on some very divisive \nissues that I wasn't sure we would ever find a way to solve. But, we \ndid and that is why we are here today having a serious conversation \nabout actually passing a bill.\n  I believe the compromise healthy forest bill is responsive to our \nneed to more efficiently reduce the threat of wildfire while ensuring \nadequate environmental protections, citizen participation, and an \nindependent judiciary.\n  There is nothing in this legislation that undermines existing \nenvironmental laws, or a person's ability to be involved in decisions \nthat impact their public lands. In fact, this legislation requires \ncitizen collaboration beyond existing law--current law does not require \nthe secretary to encourage citizen collaboration or to hold a public \nmeeting on proposed projects.\n  What I believe this legislation does do is help keep the process open \nand honest. I ask unanimous consent that an article for today's \nMissoulian newspaper, from Missoula, MT, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Groups File Lawsuit Over Kootenai Forest Timber Sale\n\n                           (By Sherry Devlin)\n\n\n            Harvest threatens water, environmentalists argue\n\n       Environmentalists filed another lawsuit against the \n     Kootenai National Forest on Tuesday, hoping to stop a 12.5 \n     million-board-foot timber sale they believe would pollute an \n     already degraded stream.\n       At almost the same time, not knowing a lawsuit had been \n     filed, the Forest Service awarded a contract for the Garver \n     timber sale to Riley Creek Lumber Co.--which bid $1.3 million \n     over the advertised price of $230,000.\n       Filed by Alliance for the Wild Rockies and The Lands \n     Council, the complaint seeks to stop the Garver sale on \n     grounds it violates the Clean Water Act and destroys habitat \n     for species that depend on old-growth trees.\n       The groups used a similar lawsuit to stop the Lolo National \n     Forest from logging in areas burned by wildfires during the \n     summer of 2000.\n       In that case, environmentalists successfully argued that \n     the logging would degrade water quality in streams identified \n     as ``water-quality impaired'' by the state of Montana.\n       Until the state of Montana sets ``total maximum daily \n     load'' figures for the streams, the Forest Service cannot \n     adequately judge how much additional sediment the streams can \n     handle, the lawsuit said.\n       Federal District Judge Don Molloy agreed, shutting down all \n     post-burn logging until TMDL figures are available.\n       In the Garver sale, the at-risk stream is the West Fork of \n     the Yaak River, which is also listed as water-quality \n     impaired.\n       Logging caused the West Fork's problems, and more logging \n     will make them worse, said Michael Garrity, executive \n     director of Alliance for the Wild Rockies.\n       ``It is exactly the same issue as in the Lolo,'' Garrity \n     said. ``Instead of wasting the court's time and money, the \n     Kootenai should just follow the judge's ruling.''\n       (The Forest Service has appealed Molloy's decision to the \n     9th Circuit Court of Appeals.)\n       At Kootenai forest headquarters, Supervisor Bob Castaneda \n     did not know a lawsuit had been filed until contacted by the \n     Missoulian. He quickly and vigorously defended his staff, \n     which had just awarded the timber sale to Riley Creek Lumber.\n       ``Ever since the Lolo decision, our approach has been to \n     have a good analysis of the watershed and to use best \n     management practices,'' Castaneda said. ``We think through \n     some restoration efforts and by following BMPs, we can \n     improve the current watershed condition.''\n       Would the logging pollute the West Fork of the Yaak? \n     ``No,'' Castaneda said. ``I just don't agree with their \n     statement. We worked very closely with the Yaak Valley Forest \n     Council and used a lot of their recommendations in making the \n     decision. They worked closely with us.''\n       The Kootenai forest did a number of water-quality surveys \n     in the Yaak this past summer, he said, and the preliminary \n     results are encouraging.\n       ``They're telling us the water quality is much better than \n     what the state suggested,'' Castaneda said.\n       He also rebutted the lawsuit's contention that the timber \n     sale would cut into the Kootenai forest's declining base of \n     old-growth trees.\n       The forest is, in fact, staying out of designated old-\n     growth areas, Castaneda said.\n       In the lawsuit, the Alliance and the Lands Council cite the \n     Forest Service's own environmental impact statement, which \n     said the Garver sale would likely have adverse affects on \n     every sensitive old-growth species in the Kootenai: fishers, \n     wolverines, flammulated owls, black-backed woodpeckers, \n     northern goshawks and others.\n       ``It is time for the Forest Service and the Bush \n     administration to start cleaning up our streams and \n     protecting our wildlife instead of subsidizing timber \n     corporations and breaking the law,'' Garrity said.\n       News of the lawsuit was a double-blow to Jim Hurst, co-\n     owner of Owens and Hurst Lumber Co. in Eureka. He, too, had \n     bid on the Garver sale but lost out to the north Idaho mill.\n       Now, he said, the lawsuit has the potential to make things \n     even worse for lumbermen.\n       ``It's just more of the same,'' Hurst said. ``Nothing \n     coming from the environmental community would surprise me \n     anymore.''\n       Another lawsuit filed earlier this year by The Ecology \n     Center stopped several timber sales on the Kootenai forest, \n     some of which were bound for Hurst's Eureka mill.\n       The Kootenai's timber sale program has decreased by 75 \n     percent since 1989.\n\n   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this article demonstrates why the \nprovisions of this bill would be beneficial to moving fuel reduction \nprojects forward.\n   This article describes a lawsuit filed to stop a timber sale after \nthe timber sale had been awarded. As I understand the situation, the \nlawsuit was based on an issue that had not been raised at any time \nduring the environmental review process or the administrative appeals \nprocess. It was sprung at the last minute just to delay and stop the \nsale. It was sprung even after the Forest Service was thanked by other \ngroups for doing a better job to address old growth issues that had \nbeen raised earlier.\n   Now, I know that this article is about a timber sale and not a \nhazardous fuels project, but the same concerns apply. If someone has \nparticular concerns about the impact of a proposed project, the \ncompromise healthy forests bill very appropriately requires that they \nraise that issue during the administrative review process before they \ncan file a lawsuit.\n   No one is saying the public's concerns are not valid and that they \nshould not have every right to raise those concerns, and appeal \nprojects that they do not feel address their concerns. But, they should \nnot be allowed to use the process simply to stop and delay. That's only \nfair. Particularly when we are talking about projects like those \ncontemplated by the compromise healthy forests bill, which are projects \nintended to reduce the risks of dangerous fires. The compromise Healthy \nForests bill simply requires citizens to be thoughtful and thorough \nwhen they oppose projects.\n   This in turn helps the agencies be more efficient, because they can \ndo a better job of addressing controversial\n\n[[Page S13607]]\n\nissues--like old growth--earlier in the process, without wondering what \nmight be coming at them from left field. This is a good example of why \nthe compromise bill will have real, positive impacts on the ground.\n   Keeping Montana's small timber mills and forest workers in business \nis a top priority for me because of their importance to rural \neconomies. But, the fact, is we also need this industry to accomplish \nthe hazardous fuel reduction work on the ground.\n   I worked in committee to ensure this legislation provides support \nfor building a thriving forest industry in rural communities. In \nparticular, I worked with Senators Crapo and Leahy to develop the Rural \nCommunity Forestry Enterprise Program, included in Title VII of the \nbill. The Rural Community Forestry Enterprise Program, is intended to \ngive a much needed economic boost to small businesses and small mills \nin rural communities, particularly those in Montana that have been hit \nhard in recent years.\n   The Program would establish forest enterprise centers around the \ncountry, including one in Montana, that would do the following: Ensure \nthat the Small Business Administration timber set-aside program works \nbetter for Montana and other small mills; enhance technical and \nbusiness management skills training; organize cooperatives, marketing \nprograms, and worker skill pools; facilitate technology transfer for \nprocessing small diameter trees and brush into useful products; and \nenhance the rural forest business infrastructure needed for a fuel \nreduction program on both private and public lands.\n   Keeping small mills in Montana in operation is a top priority for \nme. These businesses are vitally important to rural economies, \nproviding good-paying jobs and revenue to local communities. I support \nthis legislation because I believe we do have a serious problem with \nhazardous fuel build-up in our National Forests that we must solve \nsooner rather than later.\n   I also believe the bi-partisan Healthy Forests bill has the elements \nnecessary to allow local citizens and leaders to make wise decisions \nthat address this problem efficiently and effectively. We need to pass \nthis bill.\n   This is not a problem that we will solve overnight, or even in the \nnext few years. But, we have to start somewhere, and this is a great \nplace to start.\n   I am proud to support this compromise. I ask all of my colleagues to \ntake a bold step and support it as well.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding the order previously entered, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine be recognized up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nhis courtesy and also for the extraordinary job he has done in bringing \ntogether people of diverse views on this critical issue of forest \nmanagement. I also thank the Senator from New Mexico for agreeing to \nlet me deliver my comments before he offers his amendment.\n  Responsible management of our Nation's forests is vital to preventing \nthe highly destructive forest fires that we are seeing plaguing the \nWest and also to protecting our ecosystems. I am very pleased the \nSenate is moving forward with this important issue which I know matters \ngreatly to the Presiding Officer as well.\n  No discussion of a responsible forest management system would be \ncomplete, however, without addressing another threat to our Nation's \nworking forests and open spaces; that is, suburban sprawl. Sprawl \nthreatens our environment and our quality of life. It destroys \necosystems and increases the risks of flooding and other environmental \nhazards. It burns the infrastructure of the affected communities, \nincreases traffic on neighborhood streets, and wastes taxpayer money. \nIt leads to the fragmentation of wood lots, reducing the economic \nviability of the remaining working forests.\n  Sprawl occurs because the immediate economic value of forests or \nfarmland cannot compete with the immediate economic value of developed \nland in the areas that are experiencing rapid growth.\n  No State is immune from the dangers of sprawl. For example, the \nVirginia State Forester says that since 1992 the Commonwealth of \nVirginia has lost 54,000 acres of forest land per year to other uses. \nThe Southeastern Michigan Council of Governments recently reported that \nsoutheastern Michigan saw a 17-percent increase in developed land \nbetween 1900 and 2000.\n  In my home State of Maine, suburban sprawl has already consumed tens \nof thousands of acres of forest land. The problem is particularly acute \nin southern Maine where a 108-percent increase in urbanized land over \nthe past two decades has resulted in the labeling of the greater \nPortland area as the ``sprawl capital of the Northeast.''\n  I am particularly alarmed by the amount of working forest and open \nspace in southern and coastal Maine that has given way to strip malls \nand cul-de-sacs. Once these forests, farms, and meadows are lost to \ndevelopment, they are lost forever. Maine is trying to respond to this \nchallenge. The people of my State have approved a $50 million bond to \npreserve land through the Land For Maine's Future Program, and they \ncontribute their time and their money to preserve important parcels and \nto support our State's 88 land trusts. It is time for the Federal \nGovernment to help support these local community-based efforts.\n  For these reasons, I will be offering an amendment, along with \nSenator Harkin, that establishes a $50 million grant program, the \nSuburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Program, within the U.S. \nForest Service, to support locally driven, market-based land \nconservation projects that will preserve our working forests and farms.\n  Locally driven and market based are the essential aspects of this \nprogram. This program is locally driven because it encourages \ncommunities and nonprofit organizations to work together with \nlandowners to help promote sustainable forestry and public access. The \nprogram will allow local governments and nonprofits to compete for \nfunds and hold title to land or easements purchased with programmed \nfunds. Projects funded over this initiative must be targeted at lands \nlocated in parts of the country that are threatened by sprawl. In \naddition, the legislation requires that Federal grant bonds be matched \ndollar for dollar by State, local, or private resources.\n  This program is market driven because it relies upon market forces \nrather than government regulations to achieve its objectives. Rather \nthan preserving our working forests and open spaces by zoning or other \ngovernment regulation at the expense of the landowner, this program \nwill provide the resources to allow a landowner who wishes to keep his \nor her land as a working farm or wood lot to do so.\n  The legislation also protects the rights of property owners with the \ninclusion of a ``willing seller'' provision that will require the \nconsent of a landowner if a parcel of land is to participate in the \nprogram.\n  The $50 million that would be authorized would help achieve a number \nof stewardship objectives. First, the amendment would help prevent \nforest fragmentation and preserve working forests, helping to maintain \nthe supply of timber that fuels Maine's most significant industry. \nSecond, the resources would be a valuable tool for communities that are \nstruggling to manage growth and to prevent sprawl.\n  Currently, if a town such as Gorham, ME, or another community is \ntrying to cope with the effects of sprawl and turns to the Federal \nGovernment for assistance, they would find there is no program. My \nproposal would change that by making the Federal Government an active \npartner in preserving forest land and managing sprawl, while leaving \ndecisionmaking at the State and local level where it belongs.\n  There is great work being done in Maine and in other States to \nprotect our working forests for future generations. I am grateful for \nthe many organizations that are lending support to this effort and \nwhich have also endorsed my legislation. There is a nationwide network \nof organizations that have endorsed my proposal, including the National \nAssociation of State Foresters, the New England Forestry Foundation, \nthe Nature Conservancy, the Trust for Public Lands, the Land Trust \nAlliance, and many others.\n  By adopting this proposal and incorporating it into this bill, \nCongress can\n\n[[Page S13608]]\n\nprovide a real boost to conservation initiatives, help prevent sprawl, \npreserve special open places, forest lands, and farms, and help sustain \nnatural resource-based industries.\n  I thank Senator Cochran in particular for his assistance on this \nlegislation. It is always a great pleasure to work with him. I hope \nthis proposal will be incorporated into the final bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaine for her contribution to the legislation we have before us today. \nShe has been a leader in this effort, and we always appreciate the \nopportunity of working with her. I thank her for her kind comments as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2035\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2035.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the treatment of slash and other long term fuels \n           management for hazardous fuels reduction projects)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC.   . LONG-TERM FUEL MANAGEMENT.\n\n       In implementing hazardous fuels reduction projects, the \n     Secretaries shall ensure that--\n       (1) a slash treatment plan is completed;\n       (2) acres are not identified as treated, in annual program \n     accomplishment reports, until all phases of a multi-year \n     project such as thinning, slash reduction, and prescribed \n     burning are completed; and\n       (3) a system to track the budgeting and implementation of \n     follow-up treatments shall be used to account for the long-\n     term maintenance of areas managed to reduce hazardous \n     fuels.''\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment deals with the issue of \nthe treatment of long-term fuel management and treating what is called \nslash. Many fuel reduction projects require two or more sequential \ntreatments over several years on the same parcel of land--for example, \nan initial timber harvest, followed by the piling and burning of slash, \nwhich is, obviously, the brush and trees that have been cut down.\n  Completing these followup slash treatments in a timely manner is a \nvery important part of forest restoration work. It is important because \nthe slash provides fuel for wildfires, and it provides habitat for \nbeetles and other insects.\n  I think we have some studies that demonstrate the insect disease \nproblem expands where this slash is not properly treated. Everyone \nagrees it is important to conduct these followup treatments in \nlocations where fuel reduction projects have been completed in order to \nprevent the area from returning to the condition that puts these \nlocations at high risk of unnaturally intense catastrophic wildfire.\n  There is a recent GAO analysis in my State that found the Forest \nService and the BLM completed about only 19 of 39 followup slash \ntreatments in a timely manner.\n  In addition, the GAO found the agencies' reported figures for the \nacres treated were inflated because they had double-counted acres where \nthe same acreage was treated in multiyear phases. Where you have this \nkind of a slash treatment necessary, we are getting inaccurate \naccounting by the Forest Service and by the BLM.\n  This is troubling because it means the Forest Service and the BLM are \nproviding inaccurate data with respect to the number of acres on which \nthis fire threat is actually being addressed. My amendment tries to \nensure there is accurate accounting. In my view, it is a simple and \nstraightforward amendment. I do not see why it should be controversial. \nIt is a minor matter in the eyes of some, but the Forest Service's \nfailure to properly manage this slash treatment has worsened the fire \nrisk in some areas. Obviously, the focus of this legislation is to \nreduce that fire risk.\n  I think it is an appropriate amendment. I hope this is something the \nmanagers of the bill could accept. If not, obviously we can have a vote \non it.\n  Let me just briefly describe the amendment in a little more detail \nand essentially read it. It says:\n\n       In implementing hazardous fuels reduction projects, the \n     Secretaries--\n\n  That is the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the \nInterior--\n\n     shall ensure that--\n       a slash treatment plan is completed;\n       acres are not identified as treated, in annual program \n     accomplishment reports, until all phases of a multi-year \n     project such as thinning, slash reduction, and prescribed \n     burning are completed; and\n       a system to track the budgeting and implementation of \n     follow-up treatments shall be used to account for the long-\n     term maintenance of areas managed to reduce hazardous fuels.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am advised this amendment would really \nbe a recipe for gridlock in that it mandates new requirements for the \nForest Service as well as the Bureau of Land Management--processes they \nhave to carry out and go through before they can engage in any fuel \ntreatment processes.\n  It would require the Forest Service, for example, to prepare a plan \nfor treatment of slash that contains all of the information and data \nspecified in the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico. It opens up \nthe Forest Service to legal challenges if someone has the opinion that \nthe plan is inadequate for some reason. It forces the Forest Service to \nset up a new system for tracking the implementation of fuels treatment \nprojects, and any followup treatments to them.\n  The amendment would add new reporting processes to hazardous fuel \nwork. The amendment calls for the development of a plan which is \nalready required but requires the agencies to develop multiyear \ntreatment plans and report on those plans on an annual basis.\n  The whole purpose of this legislation is to try to help simplify and \nget the work done that needs to be done to reduce the chances of \ndevastating fires like we have seen in California, to manage the \nforests in a more effective way, a safer way, for those who live in \nthose areas, and to get more done in terms of enhancing survivability \nfrom insect infestation and generally improve the overall health of our \nnational forest resources.\n\n  The Forest Service is going to end up spending more time, the Bureau \nof Land Management as well, in their offices working on plans, than out \ndoing the work that they were actually hired to do under existing \nlegislation. This amendment is, as I have said before, a recipe for \ngridlock. I urge that the amendment be opposed.\n  I don't know of any other Senators who wish to speak on the \namendment. I will be prepared to move to table the amendment when those \nwho want to speak have been heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just say that I think this \namendment is anything but a prescription for gridlock. There is the \nsuggestion that all sorts of new program accomplishment reports are \ngoing to be required. Those reports are currently produced. And the \nreal issue is, do we get proper accounting in those reports or do we \nnot? The GAO has told us we do not. Each year they give us an \naccomplishment report, and they list acreage on which they have not \ncompleted the forest restoration work. They have done one of the phases \nof that forest restoration work, and then the next year they take \ncredit for that acreage again by doing another phase. The next year \nthey take credit for that acreage again by doing another phase.\n  All we are saying is that acres should not be identified as having \nbeen treated in these annual reports, which are already provided, until \nthey have done all of the different phases--the thinning, slash \nreduction, and the prescribed burning.\n  We are not requiring additional reports. We are requiring accurate \nreports. That is not an unreasonable request.\n  I am somewhat disappointed. This is an amendment we delivered to the \nmanagers of the bill yesterday, to their\n\n[[Page S13609]]\n\nstaff. We asked them to review it, to give us suggestions. If they had \nproblems with any aspect of it, they did not get back to us, except to \nsay it is unacceptable. That seems to be the position they are taking \nwith regard to any and all suggested amendments to the bill.\n  This is intended as a constructive amendment. I see it as a \nconstructive amendment to deal with a specific problem that the GAO has \nidentified as existing with regard to management of the long-term fuel \nsupply.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n2035.

Mr. President, this amendment requires the Forest \nService and the Bureau of Land Management to establish a collaborative \nmonitoring process in order to assess the environmental and social \neffects of a representative sampling of projects implemented under this \nact. There are many forest-dependent communities that support \ncollaborative monitoring of forest projects on public land. This simply \nmeans it is collaborative monitoring. That phrase simply means that \ninterested communities and individuals may participate with Federal \nagencies in monitoring the ecological and social effects of forest \nhealth projects.\n  Proponents of the legislation that we are considering today \ncontinually state that they want more collaboration at the beginning of \nthe process. However, unless there is collaborative monitoring of the \neffects of the projects, we will never be able to rebuild trust between \nrural communities and these agencies.\n  Congress enacted a similar requirement when authorizing the \nStewardship Contracting Program. In addition, Senator Craig and I \nsponsored the community-based Forest and Public Land Restoration Act. \nThat bill, which was passed by the Senate unanimously, also required \ncollaborative monitoring. This is a simple amendment. I believe it is \nnoncontroversial. I hope this is acceptable to the managers of the bill \nand can be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico for this suggested change to the bill. It actually could be \nargued it is duplicative of a provision that is already in the bill at \nthe request of Senator Wyden and Senator Feinstein, but it is not \nwholly inconsistent. We think it can be worked into the bill and will \nnot cause confusion, so I am prepared to recommend that the Senate \naccept the amendment. I hope the Senate will vote for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, just very briefly, Chairman Cochran has it \nexactly right. If there is one thing we want to accomplish in the \nnatural resources area, it is to try to move this bill away from \nconfrontation to collaboration. That is what we tried to do in the \nbipartisan compromise. I think we can reconcile that with the Bingaman \namendment. I urge its support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2036) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2039\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am soon going to send to the desk an \namendment.\n  The people of my State of Vermont, and Americans across the Nation, \nmourn with our colleagues, Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer, and \nwith the people of California, over the tragic loss of life and \nproperty from the wildfires in San Diego County.\n  Today, we lost a firefighter from Novato, CA. These brave men and \nwomen on the front lines need to be recognized first in this debate. \nOur hearts go out to the firefighters' families and friends.\n  We have all been riveted by the vivid images we have watched, day \nafter day, and by the heart-wrenching stories of loss and of bravery \nthat go with these pictures.\n  Our hearts go out to all of these families that have lost so much. \nAnd our thanks go out to the courageous and diligent firefighters and \nemergency response team members who are fighting those fires and are \ndoing all they can to protect these communities.\n  Here in the Congress, we need to do more to protect forests and \ncommunities from wildfires. That is why I introduced the Forest and \nCommunity\n\n[[Page S13610]]\n\nProtection Act this summer. This is a bill and an approach that would \nmake a real difference for communities facing this kind of potential \ndevastation.\n  The bill before us now, unfortunately, would not offer the same level \nof help.\n  The bill before us is a well-camouflaged attempt to limit the right \nof the American people to know and to question what their government is \ndoing on the public's lands.\n  When you look at the tidal wave of regulatory changes the \nadministration has produced in the last year to cut the public out of \nthe process, it could not be clearer that the administration does not \nwant the public or the independent judiciary looking over its shoulder.\n  Communities that face wildfire threats need real help, not false \npromises.\n  As this chart shows, the administration has been busy creating a \nbroader number of projects that will be excluded from environmental \nanalysis under the National Environmental Policy Act, limiting how, who \nand when citizens can appeal agency decisions, and even cutting out \nother agencies, such as the Fish and Wildlife Service, from advising \nthe Forest Service on the impact of the actions on endangered species \nhabitats.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us today could be the last in this \nseries of steps that completely erode the public's trust of the Forest \nService. Many of us saw the aftermath of the salvage rider on our \nforests and the public trust. We should not go down that road again.\n  That is why I am offering an amendment today, along with Senators \nBingaman, Durbin, Harkin and Boxer, to strike sections 105 and 106 of \nthe bill. These sections go too far in undermining the decades of \nprogress we have made in public participation and judicial review.\n  The administration has worked overtime to try to sell the false idea \nthat environmental laws, administrative appeals and the judicial \nprocess are the cause of wildfires. But they have not been able to back \nup their scape-goating with facts. And the facts themselves contradict \ntheir claims.\n  In May, the GAO issued a study examining delays in all Forest Service \nfuels reduction projects, from appeals or litigation, during the last 2 \nfiscal years.\n  Contrary to what some advocates of this bill will tell you, the \nresults show that neither appeals nor litigation have delayed fuels \nreduction projects.\n  As you can see, out of 818 projects, only a quarter were appealed. Of \nthose, even fewer took more than the standard 90-day review period. In \nfact, only 5 percent of all the projects took more than 90 days.\n  And they can't honestly blame litigation, either, for the delays. \nAgain, of the 818 projects, only 25 were litigated. Of those, 10 were \neither settled or ruled in favor of the Forest Service--meaning that \nonly 9 out of 818 projects were delayed by court order.\n  That is only one percent. Where is the ``analysis paralysis'' my \ncolleagues like to talk about so much?\n  On the ground, these appeals had even less effect. Of the 4.8 million \nacres covered by fuel reduction projects, only 111,000 acres were \nimpacted by litigation. The numbers simply do not back up the \nadministration's assertion that appeals and litigation are delaying \nprojects.\n  The bill before us today rolls back environmental protections and \ncitizen rights with no justification at all.\n  Enough about numbers. The bill before us is really a solution looking \nfor a problem. So let's take a closer look at the solution on the \ntable.\n  First, the bill would make it much more difficult for the public to \nhave any oversight or say in what happens on public lands, undermining \ndecades of progress in public inclusion.\n  In this new and vague pre-decisional protest process, this bill \nexpects the public to have intimate knowledge of aspects of the project \nearly on, including aspects that the Forest Service might not have \ndisclosed in its initial proposal.\n  Section 105 gives the Forest Service a real incentive to hide the \nball or to withhold certain information about a project that might make \nit objectionable such as endangered species habitat data, watershed \nanalysis or road-building information.\n  If concerns are not raised about this possibly undisclosed \ninformation in the vaguely outlined predecisional process, the Forest \nService can argue to the courts that no claims can be brought on these \nissues in the future when the agency either through intent or \nnegligence withheld important information from the public.\n  I want to take a couple of minutes to respond to a couple of \nstatements that my colleagues have made over the last 2 days with \nregard to appeals and judicial review.\n  First, my colleagues keep talking about ``analysis paralysis.'' This \nhas become a mantra for those who want to cut the public out of \ndecision-making and blame appeals and litigation.\n  When the administration went looking for a problem to fit their \nsolution of cutting out appeals and judicial review, they came up with \nanalysis paralysis.\n  When they went looking for facts to back up this new mantra, they \nthrew together a Forest Service report that argued that 48 percent of \ndecisions were appealed.\n  But when people starting asking questions about the report though, \nthey found that the Forest Service spent just a few hours gathering \ninformation for the report. The so-called data it was based on was just \nphone conversations made in an afternoon.\n  In fact, the Forest Service does not actually track appeals. Until \nthe GAO did its independent report, they really had no idea what impact \nappeals were having on fuel reduction projects.\n  But they, and many of my colleagues, already had their talking \npoints. As we have seen with many other so-called environmental \npolicies of this administration, facts are never allowed to get in the \nway of rhetoric.\n  When the facts did start coming out this spring, with an independent \nstudy by Northern Arizona University and the GAO, they showed that only \n5 percent of projects are appealed and only 3 percent are litigated.\n  The report also found that opposition was not a leading factor in \nslowing fuel reduction projects:\n\n       While the issue of formal public resistance, such as \n     appeals and litigation, has recently been contentious, only a \n     few local land unit officials we visited indicated that this \n     type of resistance had delayed particular fuels reduction \n     treatments.\n\n  What the facts do tell is that the main reasons fuel reduction \nprojects could not proceed were due to the weather and the diversion of \nfuel reduction funds to fight wildfires.\n  Just this summer, while the President was out in Oregon pushing this \nbill, the Forest Service was back here cutting fuel reduction projects \nbecause the House Republicans refused to pass emergency funding for \nfire suppression.\n  Let's cut through the smokescreen and focus on the facts before \nleaping on board to a solution that will let the administration pick \nand choose 20 million acres of forestland around the country to cut \nwith little real public accountability.\n  This is not a problem of analysis paralysis but a problem of \nsituation exaggeration.\n  Essentially, this provision penalizes citizens and rewards agency \nstaff when the agency does not do its job in terms of basic \ninvestigation and information-sharing regarding a project.\n  The other significant change to judicial review is section 106. Even \nunder the ``compromise'' version of H.R. 1904, the provisions will \ninterfere with and overload judges' schedules.\n  This section will force judges to reconsider preliminary injunctions \nevery 60 days, whether or not circumstances warrant it.\n  In many ways, this provision could backfire on my colleagues' goal of \nexpediting judicial review. It will force judges to engage in otherwise \nunnecessary proceedings slowing their consideration of the very cases \nthat H.R. 1904's proponents want to fast track.\n  Moreover, taking the courts' time to engage in this process will also \ndivert scarce judicial resources away from other pending cases.\n  It is also likely to encourage more lawsuits. Requiring that \ninjunctions be renewed every 60 days, whether needed or not, gives \nlawyers another bite at the apple. Something they often find hard to \nresist.\n  Instead of telling the courts when and how to conduct their business, \nwe should instead be working to find a workable and effective approach \nto reducing wildfire risks.\n\n[[Page S13611]]\n\n  This bill does not achieve that, but through sections 105 and 106, it \ninstead poses a real risk to the checks and balances that the American \npeople and their independent judiciary now have on government decisions \naffecting the public lands owned by the American people.\n  Sadly, this bill is just a Halloween trick on communities threatened \nby wildfires. It is not fair to rollback environmental laws, public \noversight or judicial review under the guise of reacting to devastating \nwildfires.\n  It will do nothing to help or to prevent the kind of devastation that \nSouthern California is facing. It is a special interest grab-bag \nshrouded behind a smokescreen.\n  Let us offer real help and real answers, and let us not allow fear to \nbe used as a pretext for taking the public's voice out of decisions \naffecting the public's lands and for ceding more power to special \ninterests.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in striking these provisions.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2039\n\n       (Purpose: To remove certain provisions relating to \n     administrative and judicial review)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Mrs. \n     Boxer, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2039:\n\n         Strike sections 105 and 106.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there has been considerable attention \npaid to the provisions of the House-passed bill which was referred to \nin our Committee on Agriculture. The version the House passed has the \nsame provisions that would change substantially the judicial review and \nappeals provisions of current law. When we were looking at the bill in \nour committee, it was decided that while we didn't disagree with the \nobjectives of the House, we thought that there could be more \nappropriate language which would help ensure that litigation and \nappeals weren't abused to the extent that they created impasses and \ngridlock in the process.\n  I have to give credit to the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. \nWyden, and the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, \nfor coming up with suggestions for changes that were included in this \nbill that is now before the Senate. It was included in the language of \nthe compromise that we made to substantially change title I as it \nrelates to the judicial review section of the bill.\n  Let me point out that it balances risk, which is what this is about. \nLooking at ramifications of approving or not approving a fuel reduction \nproject can be explained by looking at certain examples from which we \nhave learned. On the Kenai Peninsula in south-central Alaska, for \ninstance, over 300,000 acres of forest have been lost to a spruce bark \nbeetle infestation which we are told could have been avoided but was \nnot because of litigation and appeals that were generated over the \nproject's proposal. The Dixie National Forest has 112,000 acres that \nhave been devastated by the spruce bark beetle as well which could have \nbeen prevented with treatment but was slowed by the appeals and \nlitigation in that situation.\n  Over the last 3 years, bark beetles have ravaged forests around Lake \nArrowhead in the San Bernardino National Forest in southern California \ncausing an 80-percent mortality rate and substantially increasing the \nfuel loads of that forest.\n  What I am afraid we are going to see if the Leahy amendment is \napproved is a reversal of efforts that we have made to come to a new \napproach which we think will improve forest help. We still have \nrigorous environmental safeguards in place, but the suggestions that \ncourts do not bog down the process with endless appeals and litigation \nis one of the goals of this legislation.\n  I don't know if other Senators want to be heard on this amendment. \nBut I would be prepared, after Senators have had an opportunity to \nexpress themselves, if they want to debate this issue, to move to table \nthe Leahy amendment.\n  I move to table the Leahy amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings), the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Nelson) is absent \nattending a family funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion to table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from Wyoming a \nquestion.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Were you going to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. THOMAS. No, I am not. I wanted to speak in support of the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if I might have 5 minutes following the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that I follow him for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have been at this now for a couple of \nyears. I have risen before a number of times and we are back again. I \njust want to urge the Senate to pass this Healthy Forest legislation \nand invest more in preventing deadly wildfires. The latest thing we \nhave seen, of course, is in California. That was not unexpected. These \nwoods had insect infestation.\n  We have to do something. Many of us in the West are continuing to \nfight this. S. 1904 includes carefully crafted bipartisan language. If \nwe oppose that, we are really not serious about reform. The amendments \nthat weaken the appeal process, judicial review, NEPA requirements, \nwould deprive the legislation of some of the very reforms that are \nneeded that we have seen through the years in the West.\n  I want to see us move forward. I think this is a commonsense \napproach. We have been at it a very long time. This is not even the \nfirst year we have been at it. I hope we can pass it and pass it right \naway.\n  I support this legislation and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico, by previous \norder, is recognized.\n\n\n                               GDP Growth\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while what is going on in Russia may be \nsome of the worst news that could beset the free world, including our \ncountry, because of the acquisition of majority control of the third \nlargest oil company by the Government of Russia in one sweep today, who \nknows what that means in terms of oil production and stability. But I \nrise because, on the other hand, while that bad news is occurring, the \nannouncement today as to the status of the American economy is about \nthe best news we have had in 20 years.\n  Today it was announced that the economy grew by 7.2 percent in July. \nThat is July, August, September, that quarter. It has been almost 19 \nyears. Not since 1984 has this economy seen such GDP growth. This news \nwas not unexpected. Many have been saying--certainly I have--for some \ntime the policies we have adopted, specifically the tax reductions, \nwould result in this kind of event being announced now or very close to \nnow.\n  In addition, this was reflected in the morning numbers today which \nshowed personal consumption was at 6.6 percent. Interestingly, since \nconsumption makes up 70 percent of the economy, growth accounted for by \nconsumption would on its own have resulted in the economy growing 4.6 \npercent all by itself. Equally, if not more importantly, the long-term \nbusiness investment grew by 11.1 percent in this quarter.\n  To me, this suggests we will continue to see this growth well into \nthe future as businesses rebuild their investments and their \ninventories and retool their factories. Government spending, which \naccounted for most of the growth in earlier parts of this year, was not \nthat important. It represented only 1.4 percent.\n  Maybe lost in this big news is what really matters, and that is, with \nreference to growth, the Department of Labor reported initial claims \nfor unemployment declined by 5,000 just this week, affirming a downward \ntrend in unemployment. So the news is good on the home front. The \nnumbers released today indicate a ramp-up to recovery and growth in \nthis quarter and in quarters ahead. Policies we put into place are \nbeginning to take hold.\n  I commend all of those who have been part of that and commend our \nPresident as our leader for asking for most of the tax cuts and other \nitems that have caused this growth to occur.\n  Still, we have a lot more work to do. We must do more to help create \njobs and bring economic recovery to all of our citizens.\n  We cannot rest therefore on these reports today. We must continue to \nwork toward reducing the cost of doing business in this country in such \nareas as health care, energy, and litigation costs. We need to remove \nbarriers to investment and economic growth so employers can create new \njobs.\n  Our work here in the Congress must go on with renewed dedication. \nToday we see first hand the effects of the President's economic \npolicies. But such results should encourage all of us to work even \nharder to bring economic recovery to the doorstep of every American.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, of course, am also happy about the growth \nof the domestic product last quarter. It is very important. But before \nwe get too elated over this economic news, we have to also understand \nthat in addition to the need for growth for corporate America, we need \njob growth.\n\n[[Page S13614]]\n\nLast month we lost 46,000 jobs. During the years this man has been \nPresident, President Bush, we have lost over 3 million jobs.\n  I would hope the next quarter, in addition to having good domestic \nproduct growth, we also would have job growth. People in Nevada and \naround the country are more concerned about J-O-B than G-D-P.\n  The Senator from California is here. She is ready to offer her \namendment. She offered two very important amendments yesterday.\n  I have spoken with Senator Cochran and the Senator from Idaho, who is \nnow managing the bill. It is my understanding that the Senator from New \nJersey is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1618\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 282, S. \n1618, the 6-month extension of the FAA authorization; that the bill be \nread three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and further, \nparliamentary inquiry, I was under the impression the Senator from New \nJersey was going to offer an amendment, but he propounded instead this \nunanimous consent request.\n  Further reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we have a \nFederal Aviation Administration conference report that is due for \nconsideration in the House maybe today or early next week. That issue \nwill be coming to the floor of the Senate, I presume, shortly \nthereafter. It is a 4-year, $60 billion bill that is critical for our \nairlines, our airports, for general aviation, and for security in \naviation. It reminds me of this Healthy Forests bill. A week ago, there \nwere objections to the Healthy Forests bill. This week, with half the \nState of California on fire, all of a sudden we are going to get this \nHealthy Forests legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to look seriously at this legislation and what \nit means for this great industry in our country, an important part of \nour economy--aviation--and for security in aviation before we just say \nwe are going to go with the status quo. If a week from now or a month \nfrom now there is an explosion in an airport or a plane is driven into \na twin tower somewhere, I would not want to be the one who is \nnot passing this huge FAA reauthorization extension.\n\n  Further reserving the right to object, I don't like all that is in \nthis bill either. I am not an advocate of some of the provisions that \nare in this bill or not in this bill. I am not even necessarily an \nadvocate of privatization. But to threaten to kill this major \nlegislation with an extension over that one issue is very dubious \naction.\n  I, with great pleasure, object to this unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I can obtain the floor, not to \nbring up an amendment, but rather to have a few minutes to explain what \nit is that I would like to do. I ask if the Senator from Mississippi, \nsomeone with whom I have worked closely on several issues related to \nthis, will enable me, by unanimous consent, to have up to 10 minutes to \ntalk about the issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can speak on any subject he \nchooses, but the request was made.\n  Mr. LOTT. If there is going to be a unanimous consent request, I ask \nthat there be an equal amount of time, if needed, for the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request, as modified, is for 10 minutes on \neach side to talk about the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I had been recognized. I respect the \nviewpoint of the Senator from Mississippi, but I disagree with it, and \nI would like to talk about the mission I see in front of us and \nwithdraw my request that the bill be read three times and passed. I \nwant to discuss what we think is coming over soon from the House.\n  Contrary to the remarks my friend and colleague from Mississippi \nmade, in terms of his objection, I agree totally that we do not want to \nhold up the funding of this bill. I want to get the money invested. We \nhave to take care of the requirements of our aviation needs. While we \nwant to make sure we get these funds on their way, we want to make sure \nwe don't throw a blanket opportunity out there to terminate 23,000 \nloyal, hard-working, safety-oriented employees from the FAA control \nsystem; that is, those in the towers, those who are service operators, \nthose who are technicians, because we have a system that has been so \nsafe.\n  We handle over 700 million airline passengers a year. The numbers are \nincredible. We saw them, when our FAA controllers were called upon on \n9/11, bring 5,000 airplanes out of the sky safely. They got everybody \non the ground when it looked as if total chaos was raining on our \nsociety.\n  What I propose to do is say let's just have a 6-month extension, not \npermit the commercialization of the FAA system to take it away from \nGovernment hands. I see this as the fifth branch of the military. We \nare relying on them 24/7. Without a question of doubt, we need those \npeople in their positions.\n  We are facing a time within the next 10 years when over 10,000 FAA \ncontrollers will be retiring; 23,000 jobs are at stake, and we are \ngoing to say they are going into commercial hands--Acme Air Service, or \nwhoever it is.\n  There is something else that is taking place here. We see a vote \ncoming in the House that looks as if it may carry. Do you know how the \nvotes were obtained? Not on substance but on excluding particular \nairports from going into private hands and securing votes. That means \nif you happen to live in one of those areas that is not protected by \nthe sale of a vote, your family could be getting onto an airplane and \nperhaps not have it handled as perfectly as it could. I know I want my \nkids and my grandchildren protected to the best of our ability. We have \nseen it done year after year in the United States with our FAA \ncontrollers, with our air control system.\n  I urge we have a chance to vote on whether we can extend this \nauthorization, have time for discussion to permit the funding and the \nother elements of the bill. But let's have a serious review. This \nsuddenly has come up as a change in the conference report as a result \nof a decision by the administration to suddenly change the rules. They \nwant to move toward privatizing the U.S. air traffic control system, \nbut 11 Republican Senators joined me and the remainder of the \nDemocrats, and we had 56 votes in favor of keeping the system in \nGovernment hands.\n  We just recently took the baggage screeners from private hands, from \ncommercial hands, and put them into Government hands. We thought it was \na good move. That was 28,000 people. We transferred them over to the \nGovernment so we can control them. Those people control the baggage \nthat is going aboard. These people control 700 million lives that fly \neach and every year. We quickly are saying discard that, forget that, \nwe have our deals, we have our airports protected. We have two in \nAlaska protected. We have others in other States that are protected and \nwe will worry about the safety later. That is wrong.\n\n  I hope people across the country recognize what is happening, that we \nare putting this on the sale block, that it is part of a scheme to have \nGovernment privatized--over 850,000 is the mark--and it should not be \ndone on the backs of safety. That is the issue.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Mississippi, a very knowledgeable and \nlongtime Government servant, a man who has been responsible for lots of \ngood things, but 71 percent of the Americans who were polled who were \nasked the question about what they think we ought to be doing with the \nFAA about keeping it in Government hands or going private with it, 71 \npercent of the people across this country--and I want everybody to hear \nit--our constituents, agree we ought to keep the FAA in Government \nhands.\n  I am not saying we are going to extend it a long time. I am saying, \ngive\n\n[[Page S13615]]\n\nus a chance to review it. Let us take it up and have a discussion about \nit and not simply have something jammed through the House and us be \nlike the second body, here it is, take it or leave it. I would like to \nsee if we can talk to the 11 Senators who voted with us the last time \nand see if they will vote with us another time. I think it is \nreasonable in the interest of safety.\n  I just received a letter dated today. It is signed by a \nrepresentative of the Consumers Union of the Public Citizens Congress \nWatch, Consumer Federation of America. It is addressed to me:\n\n       Senator Lautenberg: We commend you for your leadership and \n     strong opposition to the most recent version of the FAA \n     authorization conference report. The new conference report \n     does not restore the original House and Senate language \n     prohibiting privatization of air traffic control services. \n     Instead, the report leaves the door open for future \n     privatization attempts going against the will of the American \n     people and jeopardizing the safety of our skies.\n\n  The letter goes on. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 October 30, 2003.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: We commend you for your leadership \n     and strong opposition to the most recent version of the FAA \n     Authorization conference report. The new conference report \n     does not restore the original House and Senate language \n     prohibiting privatization of air traffic control services. \n     Instead, the report leaves the door open for future \n     privatization attempts, going against the will of the \n     American public and jeopardizing the safety of our skies.\n       Our air traffic control network is far more complex than \n     any other in the world, with more than nine million flights \n     and nearly 700 million passengers moved through the system \n     annually. We believe that our air traffic control system must \n     remain a federal responsibility, with employees entirely \n     accountable to the public and not a company's bottom line.\n       It appears the Administration is intent on moving ahead in \n     contracting out air traffic control, as has been clearly \n     demonstrated by the intense pressure it has applied to \n     Congress. Only an explicit prohibition against privatizing \n     air traffic control will assure the flying public that their \n     safety will be secured.\n       Again, we commend you for your leadership on this critical \n     public safety issue. We urge all Members of Congress to \n     follow your lead and vote against the conference report as \n     currently written.\n           Sincerely,\n     Adam J. Goldberg,\n       Policy Analyst, Consumers Union.\n     Winifred DePalma,\n       Regulatory Affairs Counsel, Public Citizen's Congress \n     Watch.\n     Travis Plunkett,\n       Legislative Director, Consumer Federation of America.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I hope we can test the will of the Senate and test \nthe determination of the American people to have it done in a way that \nsatisfies them and their families.\n  A reference was made by the distinguished Senator about what might \nhappen if there was an accident, a crash, as a result of not having \nfacilities up to snuff because of the bill not being passed.\n  I will say if we look at the record in the U.K. and Canada about what \nhappened after they turned those operations to business hands, to \nprivate hands, we will see that the number of near-misses went up \nsubstantially in the U.K. That means near-misses in the air.\n  Many times I sit in the second seat on a small airplane and I want to \ntell my colleagues something, to find out where another airplane is at \nthe last moment is a life-remembering event.\n  In Great Britain, since privatization, near-misses of crashes or \nother problems have increased by 50 percent.\n  There is something new of which I think we ought to be fully aware, \nand that is that the space between airplanes is being narrowed in the \ninterest of taking more airplanes into the sky. This is no time to be \nsaying, turn over our safety function, the maintenance function, to \nprivate hands, to Acme Air Service.\n  I do not ask for a lot, but I ask for it on behalf of the American \npeople, 71 percent of whom said they want to keep these services in \nGovernment hands because they know Government can manage it best. I \nwant to be able to bring up an amendment and have it voted upon. I am \nasking for a 6-month extension, and that is it. Give us a chance to \nreason in a more comfortable time frame. Right now, there is enormous \npressure to conclude our business so we can go home, but I do not want \nto go home in an airplane that I do not think is the safest place I can \npossibly be, or my kids flying with me on a vacation or my \ngrandchildren flying with me on a vacation over the Christmas holiday \nnot feeling like we had the best possible people in the towers watching \nus in our flight.\n  I hope we will reconsider where we are and have a chance to discuss \nthis at length.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I realize we need to get back to amendments \non this legislation so we can complete Healthy Forests so I will try to \nbe brief, but I have to respond to some of the things that were said.\n  First, the Senator from New Jersey and I have talked about this issue \nand about this legislation in the past. He knows that I was in hopes we \ncould work out something in this area, but now we are talking about not \ngoing forward with the conference report and doing a 6-month extension \nfor what is not in a bill.\n  We were told there was a problem with the language that was in the \nbill because it said, by the way, there cannot be any private takings \nof air traffic controllers. That was in the conference report, that \nthere would be 69 medium and smaller airports that would be subject to \npossible contract towers. We were told that is a problem. The people \ndid not like the contract tower concept. Others did not like the \nprohibition, by the way, on privatization of the air traffic \ncontrollers. So the conference took those two provisions out.\n  Basically, the conference says in that area you just had a 6-month \nextension, extend the current law. What are you gaining? There are a \nlot of things that are in this bill that make a huge difference that \nwill not go forward if we do not pass the conference report: $60 \nbillion, money that is needed for security in our airports; funds for \nthe first time, over $100 million, that would go to the regional \nairlines, airport security, expansion, and improvement. We let $500 \nmillion go from the airport improvement fund into airport security. \nThis legislation says, no, you cannot do any more of that. The security \nfunds will have to come from other fees, but airport improvement money \nwill go to improve the airports.\n  It has to do with general aviation, and we have some significant \nlanguage in there for them. Manufacturers of airplanes from Kansas and \nWashington and parts suppliers all over America, all of that would be \nput on hold.\n  We are behind the curve already. Does anybody really think the \nairports are secure and that the airlines are secure, and that we have \ndone all we need to do? I am not that critical of TSA. I think they are \nworking hard and I think it is better, but we have a long way to go.\n  Then we are going to put a timeout on this huge, important part of \nour infrastructure? We want to create jobs. How about improving our \nairports and our air service and all the concessionaires that are \ninvolved in the airports, all the people who lost their jobs after 9/11 \nin the aviation industry? If we do that and do the highway bill, we are \ntalking about thousands of jobs in America.\n  Also, the Senator is suggesting that we have no privatization in FAA \nat all, not just air traffic controllers but I guess the flight weather \nservice people, the maintenance people, the service people.\n  Now, I am not particularly an advocate--in the past I have not been--\nof privatization of air traffic controllers. But some of these? \nMaintenance service not even being possible to consider for the private \nsector? It is almost as if the private sector is incompetent; the\n\n[[Page S13616]]\n\nFederal Government can do it better. I do not think that is usually the \ncase. I think most American people think when the Federal Government \ndoes it it gets worse and more expensive.\n  Then there is one other point. The President of the United States is \nnot going to sign a bill that says there cannot be any privatization \nanywhere anytime in the FAA. We have tried to be accommodating, to go \nback to the conference and take out what we thought was the offending \nlanguage.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could, let me complete, and then I will yield for a \nquestion, although we prolong this agony, which is not going to achieve \nanything right now.\n  If we took out the 69 contract towers, there are a lot of places in \nAmerica which wouldn't have a tower. In fact, that is bipartisan. The \nidea of contract towers, I can tell you, came from a Democrat, a well-\nknown one in a previous administration. I thought it made sense.\n  I don't understand. If we cannot have 100 percent purity, we don't \nwant this bill. We don't want $60 billion. Aviation is about more than \njust the guy in the air traffic control tower. It is about security on \nthe ground.\n  I plead with my colleagues to think this through. We are not pulling \nback and saying we are going to privatize. In fact, there is a letter \nfrom the Secretary of Transportation, Norm Mineta--not your basic \nevery-day, run-of-the-mill Republican, a Democrat--the Secretary of \nTransportation, says we are not going to privatize air traffic \ncontrollers.\n  We are fighting ghosts here. If we don't watch it, we will be \ncreating ghosts. We will talk more about this when this conference \nreport comes up. But I plead with my colleagues. I talked about this \nwith my colleagues. I tried to make sure it was bipartisan. It passed \nthe Senate overwhelmingly. There have been some changes made from that, \nobviously. But if we leave here this year having not passed a Federal \nAviation Administration bill or an Energy bill or a Healthy Forests \nbill, heaven help us when our constituents get hold of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho, the manager of the \namendment, has previous recognition.\n  Mr. CRAPO. As we move forward on the Healthy Forests legislation, it \nis my understanding we have worked with all those interested here.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask for no more than 5 minutes to \nconclude my remarks in response to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAPO. I will not object.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n  What I want to ask the Senator from Mississippi--he said: People know \nwhen things get in government hands, they are in worse shape. What are \nwe doing with the baggage screeners? We transferred 28,000 of those \nfolks, took them off the line, gave them a raise in pay, took them away \nfrom the private handlers and said, No, we want to know our baggage is \nbeing thoroughly inspected.\n  I also remind the Senator in the CR which looms directly in front of \nus, there is no provision for increased funding for the aviation bill.\n  When we see what is happening in southern California, our hearts go \nout to them. The air is full of smog. There is smoke all over the \nplace. You need people on the ground who know exactly how to direct \nthose flights to make sure they travel at appropriate intervals.\n  When we had the hurricane on the east coast, we had to make sure we \nwere conscious of the fact that weather changes were looming in front \nof us. This is a different world than we used to know. What a time it \nwould be to turn all of this over to private hands.\n  Security on the cheap? I know the Senator from Mississippi doesn't \nreally think that is a good idea. But, on the other hand, that is what \nis going to be happening.\n  I thank the Senator from Idaho, who is very kind, and my good friend \nfrom New Mexico, for their indulgence for these last few remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from New \nMexico be recognized for the purpose of offering an amendment. \nFollowing that, the Senator from California, Senator Boxer, be \nrecognized to offer her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2042\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2042.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To require best-value contracting)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following--\n\n     ``SEC. __.  BEST-VALUE CONTRACTING.\n\n       (a) To conduct a project under this Act, the Secretaries \n     may use best value contracting criteria in awarding contracts \n     and agreements. Best value contracting criteria includes--\n       (1) the ability of the contractor to meet the ecological \n     goals of the projects;\n       (2) the use of equipment that will minimize or eliminate \n     impacts on soils; and\n       (3) benefits to local communities such as ensuring that the \n     byproducts are processed locally.''\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment simply gives the Forest \nService and the Bureau of Land Management the authority to consider \nbenefit to local communities when determining which company or \nindividual is going to receive a contract to conduct a hazardous fuels \nreduction effort on the national forests and the public lands.\n  Currently, the authority the agencies have limits them to accepting \nonly the high bid for a timber sale contract or the low bid for a \nservice contract. Unfortunately, numerous forest-dependent rural \ncommunities have discovered this practice means the contracts are often \nawarded to large companies from urban areas, and in many cases from \nStates other than where those communities are located. In my State of \nNew Mexico, many rural communities are trying desperately to find ways \nin which they can create and maintain decent jobs. Because these \ncommunities are often surrounded by national forests and public lands, \nI believe that, where possible, we should provide tools to create jobs \nin these communities by restoring the health of the forests.\n  Best-value contracting is one such tool. This amendment, as currently \ndrafted--and this is a change from the earlier draft--says that ``to \nconduct a project under this act, the Secretaries''--that is the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Interior--``may use best-\nvalue contracting criteria in awarding contracts and agreements.'' It \ngoes on to define what best-value contracting criteria include.\n  I think it is important to realize here that this best-value \ncontracting criterion does include consideration of the benefits to \nlocal communities such as ensuring that the byproducts are processed \nlocally.\n  Congress enacted a very similar requirement when authorizing the \nStewardship Contracting Program.\n  In addition, last year Senator Craig and I sponsored the Community-\nBased Forest and Public Lands Restoration Act. That bill, which was \npassed by the Senate unanimously, also authorized best-value \ncontracting.\n  I believe this is a simple amendment. It should be noncontroversial. \nI hope it can be accepted by all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, we have reviewed this amendment. We don't \nfind it objectionable. We are prepared to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2042) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to send an amendment to the \ndesk in a moment. Before I do, I wanted to give the Senate an update on \nwhat is happening with the fires in California, and pay a very special \ntribute to a fallen firefighter. As of 3 p.m.\n\n[[Page S13617]]\n\ntoday, the fires in California have consumed more than 722,000 acres, \nor roughly 1,100 square miles. Many of these acres are on public lands. \nMany are on private lands. More than 2,600 homes have been destroyed, \n20 people have been killed, and there are more than 12,000 firefighters \nbattling the flames. These firefighters are very brave. I will show you \none of them right now.\n  I rise with a very heavy heart to pay tribute to a fallen California \nfirefighter. It is an honor for me to do this, but it is a very sad \nmoment for me to do this.\n  Steven L. Rucker, a fire apparatus engineer from Novato, CA, was just \n38 years old. Novato, CA is nowhere near southern California. Novato, \nCA is in the northern part of our State, in the San Francisco Bay area. \nBut Steven Rucker and others from his fire department risked their \nlives and, indeed, Steven gave his life, to help our southern \nCalifornia communities. Steven Rucker comes from my home county, a \ncounty where I was a supervisor for 6 years before I went to the House \nof Representatives, in the early 1980s.\n  He was killed on Wednesday, October 29, at 12:30 p.m., when his unit \nwas overwhelmed by flames as they battled on foot to protect a home \nthreatened by the Cedar Fire in San Diego County.\n  I want to show you a picture of some of the firefighters and what \nthey are up against. Have you ever seen a more telling picture of what \nthese firefighters are up against, standing close to these flames in \nair that is so polluted it is beyond description?\n  Steve fell. He was nicknamed ``the Ruckster'' by his friends and \ncolleagues. He grew up in Freemont, CA, in the San Francisco Bay Area. \nHe was the youngest of four children. After completing paramedic \ntraining in Contra Costa, Mr. Rucker went on to realize his childhood \ndream of becoming a firefighter in Novato. In his 11 years with the \nNovato Fire Protection District, Mr. Rucker wore the badge and his \nhonor proudly. His car carried a license plate that read ``Fire Ruck.'' \nHe was known for organizing toy drives and children's events for \nChristmas and for Easter.\n  Steve Rucker is a true example of why we call firefighters heroes. He \nbravely and selflessly risked his life time and time again trying to \nprotect the homes of families he didn't even know in a community far \nfrom where he lived. Tragically, he has fallen in one of those battles. \nIt is easy to see why we mourn his loss and why his friends and family \nare so proud of him.\n  I send my sincere condolences to his family, to his wife, and their \ntwo young children, the communities of Novato which mourns his loss, \nand all of the firefighters who had the honor of serving with Mr. \nRucker over these years. I know they are devastated by this tremendous \nloss, and I know the loss is reverberating through the fire lines. I \nknow how hard it is for them to cope with this.\n  In this time of crisis in California, we must carry on, and we will. \nWe always have. People say to me even here in the Senate: Your State \nalways has some kind of crisis, some kind of problem. Why do so many \npeople live there? What draws them there? I always explain that you \nneed to be there to understand the beauty of our State. You need to be \nthere to understand it. You need to be there to understand the \nincredible diversity of our people. In politics, we reason from one \nside to the other. Diversity? We have every one. The beauty of our \nState holds us all together. It has brought us to that State.\n  We will carry on, but we are not going to forget Steve. We are also \nnot going to forget Doug MacDonald. I send my prayers to Fire Captain \nDoug MacDonald who is a 17-year veteran of that Novato Fire District. \nCaptain MacDonald suffered severe burns and injuries when he went back \ninto the fire to search for his missing colleague, Steve Rucker. \nCaptain MacDonald is in critical condition at the San Diego Burn \nCenter. We pray and pray that he will come home soon. I know his wife \nand his two children are with him.\n  It says something about Captain MacDonald, and it says something \nabout the Novato Fire Department, that Captain MacDonald, a 17-year \nveteran, went back and risked his own life to save Steve Rucker. It \nsays a lot about Steve Rucker in that he would inspire people to risk \ntheir lives to save him. These firefighters are extraordinary heroes.\n  Yesterday, I was so proud that the Senate overwhelmingly passed my \namendment to ensure that those first responders, those firefighters, \nwill receive the best health care available to minimize their injuries \nwhen they fight in such natural disasters--fires.\n\n  I thank the President at this time. He has now declared Riverside \nCounty a Federal disaster area. This is now our fifth county, and we \nhave been asking him to do this. We are very glad he has done this \nbecause even though we know in Riverside we have had less loss of homes \nand property, we have homeowners there who will need the help that such \na declaration will bring.\n  Before I send my amendment to the desk, I wish to make one more \npoint. We still have fires burning out of control in my State. We still \nneed help, particularly in the San Diego area. We now need, according \nto Deputy Chief Arta, 26 type I strike teams, we need 48 type III \nstrike teams, we need 2 strike teams of dozers, and we need 15 hand \ncrews at the Cedar Fire in San Diego.\n  For the Paradise Fire--and my understanding is that these fires are \nabout 5 miles apart and the big issue is to stop them from joining. At \nthat Paradise Fire, we need 31 engine strike teams, we need 9 type III \nstrike teams, and we need 33 hand strike crews.\n  I mention this because we still have work to do to wrap our arms \naround this. We need this help now. We needed it 2 days ago. We have \nasked everyone who could help us with this--particularly our FEMA \nDirector who is working hard with us to get this equipment--to get \nthese people to help our 12,000 firefighters.\n  I want to look at Steve one more time, our firefighter, our 38-year-\nold firefighter, from Novato, CA, in Marin County, who traveled miles \nand miles with his colleagues in that department to help people far \naway from where he lived. In his name, please send the help to 12,000 \nfirefighters. We need to help them. We need to cut through all of the \nbureaucracy and all of the excuses. We need to get the help there in \nSan Diego.\n  Look at what is happening. Look at what it looks like. We need help. \nWe are getting a little help from the weather--a little bit of a \nchange, but not enough of a change, in our State. We really do not get \nthe heavy rains in November. In San Diego and Riverside, they do not \nget that much. We are getting some moist air in from the ocean. That is \ngood. We need more help.\n  We need to be strong, and we need to get this help. We need to see \nthe end date when we will have these fires 100 percent contained.\n  This bill that we are working on today does more than current law to \nprevent this kind of tragedy from happening. It doesn't do as much as I \nwould like. Senator Leahy wrote a bill which I was proud to co-author \nthat did much more than this bill in front of us. But this bill in \nfront of us is more than current law. It certainly does more than the \nHouse bill, which does, in essence, in my view after I have looked at \nit, hardly anything at all to help these communities--hardly anything \nat all.\n  We have an opportunity to make this bill even better.\n  Then Senator Bingaman got a couple of amendments through. I thank \nSenator Wyden for helping get some of these amendments through, Senator \nCochran for supporting some of our amendments, and my colleagues on the \nother side.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2043\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the minimum percentage of funds allocated for \n  authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects in the wildland-urban \n                               interface)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I send an amendment to the desk and ask that it be read \nand considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California, [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2043:\n       On page 25 of Amendment No. 1828, line 7, strike ``50 \n     percent'' and insert ``70 percent''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is a very straightforward amendment. In the \nunderlying bill, 50 percent of the funds are allocated to help \ncommunities that are close to areas that are high risk for fire. These \nare high-risk communities. We have these in our State. We have them up \nand down the west coast. We\n\n[[Page S13618]]\n\nhave them in the western part of our country. Frankly, we have them in \na number of communities. We need to get on top of things before we see \nthis kind of fire. The way to do this is to take as much of the \nresources as we can and go to these communities--whether they are large \nor small, it does not matter--and work with them.\n  In April, Governor Gray Davis, our outgoing Governor, declared \nseveral counties that are now burning disaster areas because of the \nbark beetle. We asked the President to please declare an emergency, a \ndisaster, so we could spend what it would take to get rid of those \ndying trees that sat out there. We knew they were waiting to burn. We \npredicted--I hate to say this; there were 12 of us in the bipartisan \nletter, the two California Senators and a bipartisan team from the \nHouse--we predicted in almost an eerie way that we would have \nuncontrollable fires if we did not have this disaster declared. It did \nnot happen.\n  Now we have a chance. A lot of my constituents will not have that \nchance. But now we will have a future chance to protect communities \nthat are at risk by taking funds in this bill, the majority of them, \nand putting them toward these communities.\n  I will show a couple of other pictures. The first photo shows what it \nlooks like before the fire engulfs the community. This photo shows what \nwe are dealing with--dreams gone. I have lived in the same house for 38 \nyears in a hillside community. Every time I look at one of these \nfamilies, I know how I would feel if I lost my home of 38 years with \nall of my memories--yes, we would move on; we would move ahead, but it \nis very difficult. Whoever said your home is your castle is right. It \ndoes not matter if it is one bedroom or one room or a mansion. It does \nnot matter; your home is your castle. When you are home, this is your \ndomain. This is your place. This is the place for your family.\n  You lose your home, you lose a sense of order. You lose a sense of \nsecurity. You lose a sense of peace. This is a very hard time for my \nState.\n  What would this amendment do? I hope it is voted on, and I hope we \npass it. It would help protect communities from wildfire by directing \n70 percent of the funds for wildfire prevention in the wildland/urban \ninterface; in other words, where the wildland and the urban areas \ninterface, where communities face the greatest risk from wildfire.\n  The amendment happens to be consistent with what the President \nrecommended in his budget for fiscal year 2003. We did not pick this \nnumber out of the hat in any way, shape, or form. We actually have \nprecedent for this number.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the USDA Forest \nService fiscal year 2003 President's budget.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       USDA Forest Service--FY 2003 President's Budget--Overview\n\n       The NFS appropriation also includes $15 million to \n     reimburse Federal agencies responsible for expedited \n     Environmental Species Act consultations, one of the \n     components necessary to ensure the success of the National \n     Fire Plan.\n       Wildland Fire Management (FY 2003 President's Budget \n     Request--$1,425,723,000).--This appropriation provides \n     funding for Forest Service fire management, presuppression, \n     and suppression on National Forest System lands, adjacent \n     State and private lands, and other lands under fire \n     protection agreements. The Forest Service's program \n     recognizes that fire is a critical natural process and that \n     it must be integrated into land and resource management plans \n     and activities on a landscape scale across agency boundaries. \n     The program also recognizes that wildland fire management \n     must be based on the best available science. The budget \n     continues to place emphasis on economic opportunities for \n     rural communities with a significant threat from wildfire \n     that have also experienced job losses from reductions in \n     Federal timber harvest.\n       In conjunction with the Department of the Interior, the \n     Forest Service will develop a performance-based preparedness \n     model to replace the current formula that describes \n     preparedness funding in terms of the ``Most Efficient \n     Level.''\n       The budget request for wildfire suppression costs is $423 \n     million, which is the average cost per year from 1991-2000. \n     Seventy percent of the funding for hazardous treatment is to \n     be targeted to the wildland-urban interface, to protect \n     communities and reduce suppression costs over time.\n       Capital Improvement and Maintenance (FY 2003 President's \n     Budget $568,004,000).--The Capital Improvement and \n     Maintenance program provides funding to improve, maintain, \n     and operate the infrastructure of facilities, roads, and \n     trails related to recreation, research, fire, administrative, \n     and other uses. The program emphasizes better resource \n     management decisions based on the best scientific information \n     and knowledge, an efficient and effective infrastructure that \n     supports public and administrative uses, and quality \n     recreation experiences with minimal impact to ecosystem \n     stability and conditions. Infrastructure improvement was \n     established to reduce the rate of accumulation of deferred \n     maintenance, which leads to deterioration of performance, \n     increased repair costs and decreased values of real property \n     assets. The Deferred Maintenance program enhances the \n     facilities, roads and trails programs by specifically \n     directing resources towards critical deferred maintenance \n     projects.\n       As part of the President's Management Reform Agenda, the \n     agency has established a target of co-locating Forest Service \n     and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) offices at 22 sites for \n     the period FY 2003 through FY 2005. This co-location effort \n     is part of Service First, a joint venture between BLM and the \n     Forest Service to create seamless, citizen-centered service \n     and more efficient land management. The President's budget \n     request for FY 2003 includes $10 million to facilitate co-\n     location activities (such as buying out existing building \n     leases in support of co-locations). In addition, the budget \n     includes funding for facility enhancements for anti-terrorism \n     protection.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Now, if we pass this amendment, we are coming up with a \nstronger bill because it is just common sense that the real purpose \nbehind this bill should be protection of our people. That is the real \npurpose. It should not be to make it easier for big loggers to go deep \ninto the forest and take out old-growth trees. I know we protect them \nin here but not as far as I would want to. The real purpose of this \nshould be to protect our communities. As I said, the House-passed bill \ncertainly did not do that.\n  We will hear a lot of talk from the House side, and I encourage my \ncolleagues, Senator Cochran, Senator Wyden, Senator Feinstein, Senator \nCrapo, and the others to stand strong for the Senate bill because the \nHouse bill would do nothing--I say this sincerely--to help us. It would \nnot have helped in our circumstance. I will explain why.\n  The House bill fails to emphasize and prioritize removal of flammable \nvegetation. This is chaparral. This is not what the House bill deals \nwith. The House bill deals with trees. It also does not allow for \nprojects on non-Federal land where many areas are burning. I don't have \nthe exact stats, but we are looking at maybe 50-50 here on Federal land \nand non-Federal land. Clearly, if we just have a bill that focuses on \nFederal land, we are missing a lot of other land and our communities \ncould burn.\n  The bill Senator Wyden, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Cochran worked \non does not have that prohibition. We need to have a bill that deals \nwith the chaparral, that deals with this vegetation that is going up in \nsmoke, and that does not just deal with the large trees.\n  The Senator from Nevada is here. There is certainly a lot of growth \nlike this in his State, including in Lake Tahoe as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Reid of Nevada be added as a \ncosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The House bill fails to focus the limited resources for \nwildfire prevention projects near at-risk communities where these \nresources are needed the most. We can see the communities right around \nhere. Many are not that populated, but they are communities that would \nqualify in the underlying bill. In my amendment, more funds would go \nhere.\n  By not focusing its resources near at-risk communities, the House-\npassed bill keeps homes, businesses, and communities in this wildland/\nurban interface area in harm's way. In other words, where the beautiful \nwildlands meet the suburban-urban communities, that is where we have \nour problems. This is what we have been talking about. This is what \nSenator Leahy and I have been talking about and why we know we need \nmore funding.\n  By the way, we have much more funding in that bill. The bill before \nthe Senate is a compromise. It is not enough. It is better, certainly, \nthan\n\n[[Page S13619]]\n\nwhere we are, and it is much better than the House bill which actually, \nto be honest, again, would do absolutely nothing, absolutely nothing to \nhelp us in this type of circumstance.\n  Now, in the bill before us, that I am amending, we know hazardous \nfuels reduction projects on non-Federal lands would qualify for the \nfunding. This is important. I thank the authors for that. Additionally, \nthe underlying bill emphasizes the thinning and removal of small-\ndiameter trees for wildfire prevention and seeks to implement standards \nthat protect old-growth trees.\n  Then it says at least 50 percent of the funds should go to these at-\nrisk communities. This is where I am trying to strengthen it and say it \nought to be 70 percent. Again, I think this bill is getting better.\n  I was so happy to tell my firefighters we are going to take care of \ntheir health. I was happy to tell my communities that the EPA, if this \nbill becomes law, will monitor the toxins in the air, not the usual \npollutants that we follow, but the toxins that are in the air from \nthese fires. So I am happy about that.\n  Again, I hope this amendment will be adopted. I really do not know \nwhat the end result will be, but clearly, if you increase the \npercentage of the funds that you can spend in these communities that \nare at risk, common sense tells you we will not have the type of fires \nwe are seeing in California today.\n  We cannot waste our resources. We do not have enough resources. In \nthis bill, therefore, the 70 percent ought to be directed here. So we \nbelieve there are strong arguments why we need to focus a greater \npercentage on these high-risk communities.\n  We believe there is precedent setting for this, given the President's \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, I am so hopeful we will get agreement on this \namendment because, again, it will make this a far better bill.\n  I yield the floor at this time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the proposed amendment \nfrom the Senator from California, not because I disagree with her point \nthat we need to make sure we adequately protect the wildland/urban \ninterface, but because the bill, as it is currently drafted, not only \nadequately provides for that but provides even broader flexibility so \nwe can, in addition, protect the watersheds, the water quality for \ncommunities. It will actually allow communities to have a greater input \ninto the management decisions relating to the forests that surround \nthem.\n  The amendment would require that 70 percent of all of the money that \nis provided in this bill for fuels reduction be expended in the \nwildland/urban interface. The bill, as drafted, provides that not less \nthan 50 percent of the funds will be allocated for projects in the \nwildland/urban interface.\n  Nothing in the bill, as drafted, would prohibit our forest managers \nfrom doing exactly what the Senator from California says she thinks \nthey ought to do, if that is the right decision. On the other hand, our \nbill follows the recommendations of the Western Governors' Association, \nwhich allows communities to make proposals to the Forest Service about \nhow the forests in their communities should be managed.\n  Frankly, the opportunity for communities to say they would like to \nsee management reach out a little further than just a quarter of a mile \naround their homes, into the forest in general, or into the watershed, \nso they can protect their watershed as well as their homes, is an \nopportunity that we believe is one that should be maintained for our \ncommunities and for the flexibility of our forest managers.\n  Now, let me repeat. Nothing in the bill, as drafted, would stop the \nForest Service from expending not only 70 percent but even more than 70 \npercent on the wildland/urban interface if it is determined that is the \nbest place for the allocation of these resources.\n  What the bill says is, no less than 50 percent must be allocated, but \nit does not prohibit any allocation above 50 percent if the Forest \nService and the affected communities can reach an agreement.\n  The issue here is one of flexibility. Very often, in Washington, as \nwe put together legislation--whether it be over forests or any other \nissue--one of the tendencies is for us to try to determine every \nsituation around the country and how best to manage it.\n  The problem here is, not every circumstance is the same around the \ncountry. The need is not the same throughout every forest that will \nneed to be treated. In some forests, I am confident that far more than \n70 percent of the resources would go to the wildland/urban interface. \nIn other forests, for example, the one I talked about yesterday, which \nsurrounds Elk City, the residents there are very concerned that the \nentire watershed is threatening to them, and their one route of exit \nfrom their community is threatened along an entire corridor. They would \nneed to seek protection along the entire exit corridor to literally \nsafely protect their lives if they needed to evacuate.\n  It is because the situation in Elk City is very different from the \nsituation in Los Angeles and different from the situation in other \ncommunities which have forest environments that our bill seeks to \npreserve the flexibility that we need to be able to manage these funds \nadequately.\n  I encourage all Senators to reject this amendment and to move forward \nwith the provisions as we have provided them, which, again, gives the \nForest Service the flexibility to not have to be bound by the cookie-\ncutter solutions that we often want to put in place in Washington and \nhave the flexibility to be able to manage as the communities and the \nfire and forest experts know would be the best way to approach it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to respond to my friend with great \nrespect because we do not change a thing about your bill, except change \nthe percentage of 50 to 70. We leave you all the flexibility. If a \ncommunity says they think it is important to go inside the forest to \nprotect a watershed, to protect the supply of water, or there is bark \nbeetle infestation, that is not a problem. The fact is, we just say \nthat the communities ought to have 70 percent of this rather than 50 \npercent.\n  I say to my friend, who is going to show us pictures here--I don't \nknow if he was present--12 of us, in April, wrote the President about \nthe severe danger. We named three of the four counties that are up in \nsmoke. We begged him to declare a disaster, we begged him.\n  I want you to know who signed that letter: Senator Feinstein and I, \nCongressman Jerry Lewis, Congresswoman Mary Bono, and the San Diego \ndelegation--Republicans and Democrats.\n  We saw this coming a mile away. The importance of this bill is \nbecause we do not know what future Presidents might do. We may have the \nsame trouble in the future, and they just don't pay too much attention \nto it. We can't get our needs taken care of.\n  This bill is very important, but if we don't take that money and \nspend it where the people are, then, to me, we have not learned a \nlesson from these California fires.\n  I thank my colleague very much. I am disappointed we cannot agree. I \nunderstand, but I am disappointed. I hope we will have a good vote for \nexpending funds where the people are because that is what we need to \ndo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate the passion by which the \nSenator from California approaches this issue. I would like to have her \nattention for a few moments because she is most sincere in what she \nsays.\n  Forest scientists--not a year ago--5 years ago, were pleading with us \nto create activity in our forests and in San Bernardino to stop a \ncatastrophic fire that was going to happen someday. Yet this Senate--\nand my guess is, the vote of the Senator from California--denied those \nkinds of actions, a more interactive approach and active thinning and \ncleaning.\n  We have been talking about forest health on the floor of this Senate \nnot for 1 year, not for 2 years, not for 3 years, but 5 years. Why?\n\n[[Page S13620]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No, I won't yield at this point.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is talking about my vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will not yield at this moment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, the Senator is talking about me.\n  Mr. CRAIG. No, I will not yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I think that is fairly rude, but I will wait for my \ntime.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me complete my thought, Senator, and then I will be \nhappy to yield to you.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is all right. That is OK.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have been in the San Bernardino and so have you. For 15 \nyears that forest has gone relatively untouched.\n  So I appreciate the Senator's passion. What we have tried to strike \nhere is a balance.\n  The picture I am demonstrating is not unlike the picture the Senator \nfrom California brought. Why aren't the trees burned around the homes \nthat are gone? The reason they are not is because 60-mile-an-hour winds \nspread fire in many instances a mile or a half a mile beyond where the \nfire is burning. Embers fell on the roof of the shake roof homes in \nCalifornia, and the homes are gone because the trees in the immediate \narea stand.\n  So when the Senator from Oregon and this Senator from Idaho and the \nother Senator from California were trying to strike a balance, we knew \nthat reaching out as far as we possibly could was where we needed to \ngo, along with recognizing that the urban interface was critical.\n  We believe we have struck that kind of balance. We want to sustain \nthat balance. The money goes where the people exist.\n  Let me reference another fire that occurred in early summer. The \nSenator from California witnessed it, as we all did. It was called \nSummer Haven on the mountain above Tucson. Summer Haven had been \ntreated. Thinning and cleaning had gone on around that little urban \nenclave interface. But the community no longer exists today. It burned \nup in a wildfire. Why? Because the fire started down the canyon in \nareas that had not been thinned and cleaned, and it swept up the \ncanyon, burned out the areas that had been thinned and cleaned, and \ntook out all the homes.\n  The point I am making--and I will be happy to respond to a question \nfrom the Senator from California--is that we tried to strike a balance. \nWe need to go where the people are. And California cries out for that \nat this moment.\n  I hope the Senator will continue to work with us. It isn't just \nhappening on the San Bernardino. Tens of thousands of acres are dead \nand dying in the Sierras. The Tahoe Basin is in trouble. The Senator \nfrom Nevada attempted to address that along with us a few years ago. We \nare beginning to try to get some active management there. It is a \ntragedy waiting to happen again. It is happening in thousands of acres \nof forested lands across this country.\n  That is why we are trying to strike the balance. Not only do we have \nbug kill in the urban interface; we have it out there in lands that we \nhave agreed, under a certain process and procedure, we might try to \ntreat. That is my point. That is why I think you can be arbitrary here \nand have good logic for that arbitrariness. The Senator from California \nis arbitrary, as are we. She has a set of logic. I am trying to suggest \nthat in a 60-mile-an-hour firestorm, fires do not listen to borders. \nThey do not react to them.\n  Now if the Senator from California has any questions, I would be more \nthan happy to respond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the 70-percent number was taken out of \nPresident Bush's own budget request. This is not an arbitrary figure. \nIt is a figure that was put in his budget. We have put it in the \nRecord.\n  I don't want to talk about 5 years ago. But I will be happy to \ndiscuss the forest plans I have supported, because they always dealt \nwith what the problem is, which is making sure we get rid of the brush, \nwe get rid of the infestation, and we don't use this as a way to say \nthe only way to have a healthy forest is to cut down every tree, \nparticularly old growth. Then you don't have any forest. That is not my \nidea of healthy forests.\n  I don't have to go 5 years to prove where I have been. I ask \nunanimous consent to print in the Record this letter, dated April 24, \n2003.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 2003.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing you today to encourage \n     your swift approval of California Governor Gray Davis' \n     request of a Presidential emergency declaration for \n     Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties relative to \n     the high threat of forest fire in these regions.\n       Due to drought conditions and infestation by the bark \n     beetle, our national forests have been met with an \n     unprecedented danger as the bark beetle has attacked over \n     415,000 acres of trees in these three counties. Because of \n     the unique urbanization in and around the forests, this \n     infestation has created a tinder box of such magnitude that \n     the loss of life and resources would be incomprehensible \n     should fire break out.\n       Most of the affected trees are on or adjacent to federal \n     lands, making this crisis well beyond the ability of state \n     and local authorities to manage. Therefore, it is critical \n     that the federal government help provide financial assistance \n     for infested tree removal from public and private lands, as \n     well as assist with other mitigation measures. Now that the \n     State of California has requested a federal emergency \n     disaster declaration, your help at this juncture remains \n     critical and would make a positive impact in these areas of \n     Southern California.\n       Mr. President, we appreciate the various burdens being \n     placed upon you in these challenging days. However, we urge \n     you to consider this matter as expeditiously as possible \n     since these areas are in need of immediate federal \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mary Bono, Jerry Lewis, Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein, \n           David Dreier, Duncan Hunter, Joe Baca, Ken Calvert, \n           Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, Darrell Issa, Bob Filner, \n           Susan Davis.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. It reads:\n\n       We are writing you today to encourage your swift approval \n     of California Governor Gray Davis' request of a Presidential \n     emergency declaration--\n\n  Not just for San Bernardino--\n\n       for Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego counties \n     relative to the high threat of forest fire in these regions.\n\n  We knew that. The people knew that. We were trying to get help. We \nsaid:\n\n       Due to the drought conditions and the infestation by the \n     bark beetle, our national forests have been met with an \n     unprecedented danger as the bark beetle has attacked over \n     451,000 acres of trees in these three counties. Because of \n     the unique urbanization in and around the forests, this \n     infestation has created a tinder box of such magnitude that \n     the loss of life and resources would be incomprehensible \n     should fire break out.\n\n  This is uncanny.\n\n       Most of the affected trees are on or adjacent to federal \n     lands, making this crisis well beyond the ability of state \n     and local authorities to manage. Therefore, it is critical \n     that the federal government help provide financial assistance \n     for infested tree removal from public and private lands, as \n     well as assist with other mitigation measures.\n\n  So we didn't just limit it to removal of the bark beetle. We called \nfor other mitigation measures. We said:\n\n       Now that the State of California has requested a federal \n     emergency disaster declaration, your help at this juncture \n     remains critical and would make a positive impact in those \n     areas of Southern California.\n\n  We close with this:\n\n       Mr. President, we appreciate the various burdens being \n     placed upon you--\n       Because this was at the time we were at war with Iraq--\n\n     In these challenging days. However, we urge you to consider \n     this matter as expeditiously as possible since these areas \n     are in need of immediate federal assistance.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, please, let's not stand up here and point \nfingers at each other. The fact is, this is a bipartisan group of \ncolleagues begging for help, recognizing the fact that near at-risk \ncommunities we have work to do. I am happy this bill is before us \ntoday. I am thrilled at that. I thank my friends for helping me protect \nthe health of firefighters and the children and the elderly there, as \nthey did yesterday.\n  All I am saying is: Please, I don't change one word of your brilliant \nlegislation. I don't take a word. I just say, take it up to 70 percent \nfor the communities that live near these at-risk areas.\n\n[[Page S13621]]\n\n  I will close by reading the people who signed this letter. By the \nway, it is a beautiful representation of California politics, from the \nmost liberal to the most conservative. Signing this letter: Jerry \nLewis, Mary Bono, Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein, David Dreier, Duncan \nHunter, Joe Baca, Ken Calvert, Randy Duke Cunningham, Darrell Issa, Bob \nFilner, and Susan Davis.\n  This isn't the time to have a finger-pointing argument, while I just \nlost a firefighter because no one declared this a disaster. That was \nthe way it went. Please, let's not do that. Why don't we use this \nopportunity to come together across party lines, as my colleagues did \nwith the underlying bill, and just realize that this fire says \nsomething to us. What it says to us is that these at-risk communities \nneed more attention.\n  I guarantee you, if you support this, and we have a bill that really \ncarries out what President Bush said should be the case--70 percent of \nthe money being used at these communities--we will have made a great \nleap forward.\n  I hope we won't have a circumstance where we are going: What did you \ndo 7 years ago and 10 years ago and 5 years ago and 4 years ago.\n  I will tell you what I did. I have been saying we have to clear brush \naround these communities. We have to clear trees, dead and dying trees \nin these forests. We have to thin. We have to go after the chaparral. \nWe have a lot of work to do. Let's meet somewhere in the middle between \nthose people who want to see more aggressive logging of old-growth \ntrees. I respect your view. I don't attack you. I just don't agree with \nyou. I don't think that is the answer to protecting our communities. \nThe answer is helping us near these at-risk communities.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from California for \nthis amendment, and the people who have joined with her, as indicated \nin the letter, are certainly headed in the right direction. What the \nSenator from California has stated is we should direct this very \nimportant legislation toward people. That is what this amendment is \ndirected toward--toward people, communities, and areas.\n  Take, for example, this terrible tragedy in California we see every \ntime we turn on the television set. If there had been hazardous fuel \ntreatment around populated areas, some of these fires may have \nhappened, but most of them would not have happened. This amendment is \ngood for the firefighters. It is certainly good for the people who live \nin these communities.\n  As generous and as rich as we are in this country, there is not \nenough money to take down all the dead and dying trees and other trees \nthat need to be taken down to have good forest health. We simply don't \nhave enough money. But certainly we have enough money to take care of \nthe populated areas of our country, and that is why the Senator from \nCalifornia says we have a limited amount of money, so let's put most of \nit toward protecting people. That is what this amendment does.\n  I hope this very reasonable amendment which is directed toward people \nis adopted. It is important.\n  I again applaud the Senator from California for bringing this to the \nattention of the Senate, and I am happy to be a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I intend to move to table, so if anybody \nwants to debate before I do that, I will look around and see if someone \nwants to speak. I wish to make two quick comments about the debate \nbefore I move to table the amendment.\n  First, it has been suggested the intent of those who want to keep the \nbill the way it is is to allow cutting of old-growth forests. That is \nsimply not the case. First of all, as everyone who has focused on this \nbill knows, we have provisions in the bill that protect old growth in \nthe forests.\n  Second, the fact is, as I will say again, the bill gives communities \nand the Forest Service managers the flexibility to make the decisions \nabout where the fuel reduction will be most effective to preserve and \nprotect our forests and the people who live near the forests. \nCertainly, our focus on the Western Governors' proposal and the \nprotection of communities is what we ought to be doing in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n2043.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings), the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Nelson) is \nattending a family funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 61, nays 34, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 424 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--61\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--34\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Graham (FL)\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Edwards\n     Hollings\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n     Nelson (NE)\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion of the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2030\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have an amendment, No. 2030, at the \ndesk. I call that amendment up, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2030.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n          (Purpose: To ensure protection of old-growth stands)\n\n       On page 17, line 16, after ``(3)'' insert ``(4)''.\n       On page 18, line 23, strike ``by implementing'' and insert \n     ``and implement''.\n       On page 19, line 11, strike ``by implementing'' and insert \n     ``and implement''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as all of us know, the Senate right now \nis debating the Healthy Forests bill, and I believe we need to do more \nin this bill to help protect America's old-growth forests.\n  Old-growth forests are stands of trees that have tremendous historic \nand cultural value.\n  I think we need to work hard to clarify a few parts of this bill so \nthat Federal agencies do not misinterpret congressional intent in \nprotecting historic and ecologically important resources.\n  This evening I am offering a perfecting amendment that will close two \nloopholes in this bill to ensure that our old-growth forests get the \nprotection they deserve.\n\n[[Page S13622]]\n\n  Before I turn to the details of my amendment, I want to comment on \nthe horrible devastation we are seeing in California from wildfires. \nLike all Americans, I have been watching the shocking news coverage. My \nthoughts and my prayers are with everyone who has been affected. My \nbrother is a firefighter. So I appreciate the sacrifices that are made \nby these brave men and women.\n  In my home State of Washington, we have been touched by terrible \nlosses in recent years, including four young firefighters who died in \nthe Thirtymile Fire on July 10, 2001, at Okanogan County.\n  It is clear that we have to take smart, responsible steps in this \nbill to reduce the dangerous fuel loads in our forests.\n  While it is too soon to draw any final conclusions about the fires in \nCalifornia, I think the fires highlight two challenges that ought to be \na part of this debate.\n  First, it is clear that we don't have enough money in the budget to \naddress our firefighting and fire prevention needs. In fact, today the \nForest Service is borrowing from its fuel reduction accounts to pay for \nfirefighting operations; that is, robbing Peter to pay Paul. The money \nreserved for fuel reduction, if it is used wisely, helps to prevent \nfires in the first place. The current budget is inadequate, and we are \ngoing to pay a greater price down the road if we don't address the \nresource issue.\n  Second, because the funds are limited, we have to do a better job of \nprioritizing how we spend the money that we do have. Specifically, we \nneed to give a higher priority to those vulnerable lands in areas where \nwildlands and urban lands intersect. Those are spots where people and \nproperty are threatened.\n  If we address the hazards there--and if we educate homeowners--we \nwill have a bigger impact with our limited funds.\n  I am looking for an aggressive plan to reduce the fuel loads in our \nforests, especially in the urban/wildland areas where people and \nproperty are endangered.\n  Old-growth forests are important for many reasons.\n  First of all, they represent ecosystems that are unique in nature. \nThese forests are made up of a complex web of plants and animals, and \nclimate and ecological conditions that are extremely different from \nwhat is found in younger or plantation forests. Certain animals and \nplants only live within these old-growth ecosystems.\n  If we are going to maintain a diverse species, we have to protect \ntheir habitat. Old-growth forests also have the cleanest drinking \nwater, they provide structures for good salmon habitat, and they \nmitigate the effects of flooding and global warming.\n  Finally, these forests have great historic, recreational, and \nspiritual value which is important to all of us.\n  Hiking through an old-growth forest is truly a remarkable experience. \nI invite any of my colleagues who have not had that kind of experience \nto come to my State or to another State with a lot of old growth and \nhave that kind of experience. You will understand why those of us who \nspeak out on this floor are so passionate about this issue. In fact, in \nour old-growth forests perhaps is the only place where you can feel \ntransported back hundreds of years and see what the very first \nexplorers saw when they encountered these cathedral forests. They are a \npart of our history, and we cannot afford to lose them. Unfortunately, \nwe have already lost many of these unique lands.\n\n  Old growth used to sweep across the Pacific Northwest, but recent \nstudies estimate that old growth makes up between 10 and 18 percent of \nthe lands in the Pacific Northwest and a mere 3 percent of lands \nnationwide. There is very little left today. We have to do all we can \nto ensure their survival.\n  I want to recognize my colleagues from Oregon and California who made \nthis bill better by including an old- growth section in title I. As a \nresult, this bill is now much better than what the President and the \nHouse first proposed.\n  But as I read the provisions, I saw two loopholes that we should \nclose.\n  First of all, the bill lets the Forest Service and the BLM treat \ndangerous forests, and it provides protection for old-growth stands. \nOld growth can still be treated. It just has to be treated in a way \nthat protects its unique character.\n  But if an area has insect infestations or is subject to trees being \nblown over, then the old-growth stands lose all of their protection. \nThat is a big loophole. Any forest could be subject to strong winds \nthat knock down trees. Any forest could experience insect infestation. \nAny forest could be subject to disease. Almost any forest could be \ndamaged by an ice storm. It is just one of those things that happen. An \nold-growth forest could be drastically altered in ways that destroy its \nunique characteristic.\n  The underlying bill has a massive loophole in it that threatens old-\ngrowth forests and subjects them to unrestrained thinning. My amendment \nwould simply close that loophole by making those lands subject to old-\ngrowth protection. My amendment, importantly, allows treatment of old \ngrowth. I know that is a concern to other Senators here on the Senate \nfloor. It still allows treatment of old growth. It still must protect \ncharacteristics that we all recognize as important.\n  There is a second loophole that my amendment addresses. This bill has \na fine directive to protect the integrity of old-growth stands. That is \nsection 102, subparagraph (e)(2). I think we all can accept that \nstandard. But I am concerned that it won't be carried out because it \nrelies on forest management plans to be implemented.\n  Here is the problem with that. If the forest has a management plan \nthat is less than 11 years old, that plan will not need to be updated \nto meet the new standards. That is a big loophole. It could mean that \nforests with relatively recent management plans don't have to enact the \nprotections we are calling for in the bill. Fortunately, there is an \neasy way to close that loophole. It involves just changing four words \nin the bill.\n  My amendment does two things.\n  First of all, it ensures that all hazardous fuel reduction projects \non Federal lands will protect old-growth forests.\n  Second, my amendment ensures that the old-growth standard in the bill \napplies to all Federal forests--not just those with older management \nplans.\n  I thank all of my colleagues and their staff who have worked very \nhard on this legislation.\n  The chairman and ranking members of the Energy Committee and the \nAgriculture Committee have been tireless on this bill.\n  My western colleagues from Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and California \nhave all been looking after the best interests of their States and \ntheir constituents. I thank them all, and I appreciate their \nconsideration of my amendment.\n  Old growth makes up just a fraction of our remaining public lands \ntoday. Many of these stands of trees are older than our Union. They are \nolder than the settlement of the West. Some are older than Columbus' \narrival in the New World.\n  We would not be doing our duty here on the floor of the Senate if we \ndidn't do everything we could to protect them for future generations.\n  The amendment I am offering this evening will strengthen the \nprotection in the underlying bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer and Senator Reid of Nevada \nbe added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, Senator \nMurray, from the great State of Washington and the great job she does \non behalf of her State. I appreciate all the hard work she has put into \nlooking toward this amendment and others.\n  I hope in my opposition to this amendment I can at least provide some \ncomfort that we have looked at trying to make sure the old growth in \nthis Nation is protected. I rise today to oppose this amendment that \nwould apply old-growth restrictions to insect and disease treatments, \nas well as to clean up after severe weather events. Part of why I do \nthat is, simply, our forests are very different across this land. We \nwant to make sure everyone is participatory in what we are doing in \nprotecting and keeping healthy our forest lands.\n  Insects do not care about the size of the tree. In fact, as many \nscientists\n\n[[Page S13623]]\n\nhave stated for years, they prefer older trees that are in poor health. \nOld growth, as I said, is very relative. In these older stands where \ntrees are stressed for water and nutrients, insects will go after both \nlarge and small trees. The idea is to allow forest managers to go there \nand remove the problem trees, reducing the density of the stressed \nstands to immediately address the insect or disease problem which in \nour forests in the South are our most common and immediate problem. \nInsect and disease treatments are vastly different from preparing for a \npotential fire somewhere down the road.\n  I join my colleague from Washington in sending our prayers and \nthoughts to all of those who are valiantly fighting the wildfires in \nCalifornia and the families and the communities that are affected by \nthose.\n  Fighting against an insect or disease outbreak is not like preparing \nfor a fire. It is exactly like fighting a slow-moving wildfire. You \nwould not ask firefighters to only fight a fire in certain sections of \nthe forest, would you, and require them to skip around certain stands \nin the forest? It would seem ludicrous to do that. You could not \neffectively fight a fire that way.\n  That simple logic is why Chairmen Cochran and Domenici, and Senators \nCrapo, Craig, Feinstein, Wyden, McCain, Kyl, and myself, have worked \nhard to craft some compromise language. We ensure that when our forest \nmanagers treat and prevent the spread of insect and disease outbreaks \nor attempt to clean up after a severe weather event, they do not have \ntheir hands tied to only treating a certain portion of the forest. \nManagers must be able to treat all of the forest or we are all just \ngoing to watch the forests die--both inside old-growth stands and \nthroughout all of the forests of this Nation.\n  Forests in my State of Arkansas and throughout the country are being \naffected by unprecedented and catastrophic outbreaks of insect and \ndisease. Whether it is the southern pine beetle in the Southeast, the \nsudden oak death in California, or the red oak borer in Arkansas, this \nNation's public and private forests are under attack.\n  In Idaho, the Douglas-fir bark beetle is another predator of our \nforests. This beetle seldom attacks trees that are less than 12 inches \nin diameter. These bugs like large trees, optimally 24 inches in \ndiameter and larger.\n  In this case, to prevent or mitigate an infestation, in many \ncircumstances it is absolutely necessary to remove some of the larger \ntrees in order to treat the insect outbreak. The larger trees have been \ndevastated.\n\n  The southern United States and the Rocky Mountain West are currently \nexperiencing outbreaks of bark beetles, including the southern pine \nbeetle and the spruce beetle at levels unprecedented in historical \ntimes. As Senator Murkowski demonstrated earlier, over 90 percent of \nthe spruce trees have been killed in Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. In the \nSouthwest, the pinion pines have suffered severe mortality. The Lake \nArrowhead region is a horrifying example of where forest managers were \nunable to address the overdense stand conditions in a timely manner.\n  Right now, on the San Bernardino National Forest, over 230,000 acres, \nhalf of the forest land, have more than 40-percent tree mortality \nbecause of an outbreak of western pine beetle. This is a case in point \nwhere forest managers were unable to actively treat the area and it \nresulted in a massive insect infestation and right now is at a very \nhigh risk of catastrophic wildfires, as well.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, the red oak borer is attacking older, \nliving oak trees at unprecedented magnitudes. Again, older growth is \nrelative to the forest that you are talking about. This outbreak is \nrampant throughout the oak forests of Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma \naffecting roughly one-third of the interior highlands.\n  The red oak borer complex is the greatest threat to the oak component \nin the interior highlands in recent history. This is from a native \ninsect never before considered anything other than a minor pest or \nconcern to the forests. These are insects that have been there forever. \nThis is not something new that has just been introduced to our forests.\n  It is essential that we allow the Forest Service the flexibility it \nneeds to attack this overwhelming problem wherever it happens \nthroughout our forests.\n  This legislation is about forest health. We have done everything in \nworking to bring about compromises in good conscience that are going to \nprotect the health of our forests. It is about restoring forests to \nmore resilient ecosystems, making these systems less susceptible to \ndisturbances such as wildfire, insects, disease, and invasive species.\n  In my mind, reducing the flexibility to address these forest health \nissues will eventually destroy the very trees we have been trying so \nhard to protect. If we do not enable our forest managers to proactively \naddress insect and disease outbreaks wherever they happen and before \nthey become extensive, you can be sure insects such as the Douglas-fir \nbark beetle will be certain that there are no old-growth forests to \nprotect.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to remember one of \nthe most critical parts when we are talking about old growth; that is, \nthis is the first statutory protection for old growth that we have ever \nseen. There are protections throughout this bill for old growth, many \nfocusing on smaller trees, but without a doubt, making sure the \nprotections for old growth are there and recognizing this is the first \ntime we have had statutory protection for old growth.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a good look at this and to defeat \nthis amendment and rest assured that we have done everything we can in \nthis compromise to make sure we will protect that old growth, \nparticularly with the statutory language we have but ensure the \nflexibility that we can also protect and save our forests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise for a few moments to second the \nremarks of the Senator from Arkansas and say this amendment, although \ncertainly well intended, is a threat to forests, including old-growth \nforests in Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma.\n  We have 300,000 acres of forests in those States that right now, as \nwe speak, are infested with pests such as the red oak borer. The Senate \nneeds to understand what happens when these pests descend upon the \nforests. The red oak borer will bore into a tree, create a huge gash, a \ndeep hole in the tree. If you have ever seen it, it makes you feel for \nthis tree. It lays its eggs in the tree so it interrupts the tree's \nability to pass nutrients up and down the trunk, eventually killing the \ntree and laying other eggs that burrow deep into the tree or fly out \nand infest other trees.\n  The pest is getting stronger because we have not been able to manage \nit. They used to spawn every 2 years and now they spawn every year. We \nare in danger of losing whole forests, including old-growth forests.\n  As the Senator from Arkansas said, it is the older trees that are the \nmost liable and the most vulnerable to this infestation. I don't want \nthat to happen. There is no reason for it to happen. All we have to do \nis empower our Forest Service to manage the forests to take care of \nthese trees, the old growth as well as the new growth, and prevent the \nspread of these pests.\n  I have talked to experts in Missouri. They are sad at what is \nhappening. You cannot observe it without being depressed at what is \nhappening. The trees die. When they die, the deadwood litters the floor \nof the forests. That is additional fuel which increases the risk of \nfire not only to the national forests but to the private landholders \nnearby. That increases the risk of property loss, of loss of life.\n  We do not want to have happen in Missouri what is happening in other \nparts of the country. We want to stop those fires that are occurring in \nCalifornia, as well.\n  This is a very important provision that a number of Senators have \nworked on for a long time. It is a carefully tailored compromise. It is \na good compromise and one we ought to pass.\n  I respect the purpose of the amendment, but I encourage the Senate to \nvote against the amendment, and vote to table it if that motion is \noffered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I do not want to prolong this debate. I \nknow\n\n[[Page S13624]]\n\nthe managers have been here all day long and they want to move to a \nvote on this amendment.\n  Let me simply respond to my colleagues from the South and tell them \nthat I understand insect infestation is a key concern in national and \nprivate forests.\n  I know my colleagues from the South face significant insect and \ndisease issues. We certainly face them in the Pacific Northwest. \nHowever, I strongly believe we do not need to abandon the old-growth \nprotections in this bill. The bill already allows old-growth stands to \nbe treated for hazardous conditions. They simply must be treated in a \nmanner to protect the old-growth characteristics.\n  Again, I know in most of the Nation 3 percent of the land is old \ngrowth. In the Pacific, it is 18 percent. It is a tremendous part of \nour heritage. It is something of which I think all of us should be very \nproud.\n  We need to be careful we do not take steps this evening with this \nbill that undo the heritage most of us are very proud of in this \ncountry.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I know my colleague from \nIdaho wants to move forward with a vote on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, before I make a motion to table, I thank my \ncolleague, Blanche Lambert Lincoln, for her efforts in protecting our \nforests in this bill against insect infestation. She has been working \nvery hard and very closely with us in building this compromise.\n  This legislation does a tremendous job of making sure we can address \ninsect infestations throughout our forests. It is a well-crafted \ncompromise. And the legislation will be a significant benefit to our \nnational forests.\n  With that, Mr. President, I move to table this amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n2030.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, as far as we know on this side, there are \ntwo more amendments to be offered. If there are more, Senators should \ncome forward and tell us. The amendments remaining are an amendment by \nthe Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, and the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Harkin, has an amendment. As far as we know, those are the only two \namendments.\n  When these amendments are disposed of, we will go to final passage, \nas far as I know.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we have a few \nother amendments being discussed. We think we will be able to clear \nthem. Discussions are underway. Other than those two amendments, I \ndon't think any other amendment will require a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2038, As Modified\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2038, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington (Ms. Cantwell) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2038, as modified.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Comptroller General to study the costs and \n benefits of the analysis of alternatives in environmental assessments \n                  and environmental impact statements)\n\n       In section 104, strike subsection (b).\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nJeffords be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I know the hour is already late for some Members. I \nbelieve we have had much time to discuss this legislation, but I do \nbelieve there are a couple of important amendments that are still yet \nto come that raise issue that are important for Members to understand. \nI am concerned that the underlying bill amends the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, a benchmark statute that has been on the \nbooks since 1969. Because this is an important act, I believe I must \nstand up and offer this amendment.\n  I take great pride in the fact that I sit at the desk of Senator \nHenry M. Jackson who served as chairman of the Senate Interior \nCommittee for many years. He was the prime sponsor and mover behind the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, a landmark piece of national \nlegislation that sets the tone for how our environment should be \ntreated as we review the work of Federal agencies' actions.\n  I know my colleagues from California, Oregon, and Idaho are trying to \nmove forward on hazardous fuel reduction projects. I am asking them to \nconsider the impact of the major changes that bill proposes to make to \nthe National Environmental Policy Act process with respect to hazardous \nfuels reduction projects. In addition, the bill before us leaves the \ndoor open for further changes in the National Environmental Policy Act \nin other areas besides hazardous fuel reduction, and that concerns me.\n  First of all, I really do believe that at the heart of this problem \nassociated with hazardous fuels reduction is funding. It was the case \nin 2000 when we had a lot of fires throughout the West, and the Western \nGovernors Association came together and said: Let's fund a hazardous \nfuel reduction account. The problem with the current practice is that \nCongress provides money for hazardous fuels reduction projects, but the \nfunds are taken out of these accounts and used to fight fires, and the \nprojects are not funded. In addition, we are not providing enough \nfunding for hazardous fuels reduction projects.\n  I estimate that we need approximately $1 billion a year to do \nadequate hazardous fuel reduction in wildland-urban interface areas. \nUnfortunately,\n\n[[Page S13625]]\n\nthe President's budget request for this fiscal year included \napproximately $300 million for this purpose.\n  I think all of my colleagues can agree that we have to come together \nto authorize and appropriate adequate resources to prevent fires ahead \nof time. We should not short-fund hazardous fuels reduction and take \nthose limited resources to fight fires when they happen.\n  I applaud my colleagues for their leadership on this issue, \nparticularly the Senator from Oregon, and for putting this legislation \nforward.\n  My colleagues on both sides of the aisle are also trying to bring up \nthe fact that they think it is important that hazardous fuel reduction \nprojects proceed smoothly. That is why I would like to point out to my \ncolleagues that the Forest Service does provide categorical exclusions \nfor hazardous fuels projects. According to the U.S. General Accounting \nOffice, sixty percent of projects in 2001-2002 received categorical \nexclusions. These projects did not require the agency to prepare an \nenvironmental impact statement (EIS) or an environmental assessment.\n  A second group, about 34 percent, has been approved via environmental \nassessments, which are much shorter than an EIS.\n  Only 6 percent of the projects have had to go through the full EIS \nprocess.\n  These figures are outlined in an October 2003 GAO report that clearly \nshows that the National Environmental Policy Act has not held up \nprogress on hazardous fuel reduction. What has held up progress is the \nfailure to provide adequate funding in this area.\n  So I ask my colleagues why should we change the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, a landmark piece of Federal legislation that \nhas protected the environment since 1969?\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that the law's requirement that \nthe Forest Service consider alternatives has delayed hazardous fuels \nreduction projects. However, numerous court cases have held that in \nsome circumstances two or three action alternatives are adequate to \ncomply with NEPA. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit held that in the \ncases of Friends of Southeast's Future v. U.S. Forest Service and the \nMuckleshoot Indian Tribe v. U.S. Forest Service, that two or three \nalternatives, in addition to the preferred alternative and the no-\naction alternative, will satisfy NEPA.\n  The case law does not say that 30 different alternatives must be \nconsidered, or 10 different alternatives, or 7 different alternatives, \nor 6 different alternatives, or even five different alternatives. It is \nsaying that in certain cases, two or three can be adequate.\n  I think my colleagues are well intentioned. However, I have real \nconcerns about the proposed change to the National Environmental Policy \nAct, that has been on the books since 1969. The bill before us would \nlimit the number of alternatives to: one, the proposal for hazardous \nfuel reduction; two, the alternative of doing nothing or; a third \nalternative, which is the only real alternative. In the case of a \nproposed fuel reduction project in the Northwest, someone could propose \ntaking no action because we do not have to do that hazardous fuel \nreduction, and then someone else says, maybe here is an alternative.\n  Well, my concern is that we are throwing the baby out with the \nbathwater. If only 6 percent of these cases really have not had the \ncategorical exemption of not having to go through an EIS and only three \npercent are ending up in court, then the National Environmental Policy \nAct is not the cause of the holdup.\n  Washington State has been the subject of many forest fires and many \ntragedies, most recently the tragic Thirty-mile fire in 2001. Much of \neastern Washington is under condition class 2 and condition class 3, \nand, therefore, could be subject to this bill. My concern is that if a \ncity wants to propose an alternative, it might be precluded from \noffering an alternative that would address concerns over the impact of \nthe hazardous fuels reduction project on water quality.\n  So I would say to my colleagues, let us fund the hazardous fuels \nreduction account. Let us move forward to promote healthier forests. If \nwe truly see that the National Environmental Policy Act delays project, \neven though only 3 percent of hazardous fuels projects have ever \nreached court, then let us come back and change the law.\n  I am truly concerned with the proposed change to the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act. What will stop other legislative proposals \nfrom coming to the Senate floor to change the National Environmental \nPolicy Act in other areas? Are Members who are going to support this \nunderlying language ready to stop at hazardous fuel reduction, or do \nthey want to change NEPA all across the board?\n  For example, say one's community has to consider a proposal to build \na new gas pipeline. Pipeline safety has been an issue of great \ncontroversy in the State of Washington, which had a pipeline explosion \nseveral years ago that killed several people. What if only one \nalternative was considered for the route of a gas pipeline going \nthrough one's State? I want to make sure the current law says \nreasonable alternatives are considered so that no community, no \ncitizen, no organization with standing is left out in the cold.\n  That is what Henry M. Jackson was thinking about when he wrote the \nNational Environmental Protection Act. He thought about making sure the \npublic had a chance to participate in the process. He wanted to make \nsure they had the ability to have the issues that they wanted to be \naddressed and considered.\n  The Forest Roads Working Group, an organization that has operated \nwith the blessing of the Bush Administration, along with other \norganizations, has raised similar concerns. These organizations have \nexpressed their support for the public to have a say and to retain the \nability to participate in the decision-making process.\n  I know my colleagues want to move forward on a plan that will make \nall communities more secure, that will make our forests more healthy. I \napplaud them for that, but I also hope Members will stop and think \nabout the statistics that GAO has outlined. This dispute is not \nfundamentally about the EIS process and the number of alternatives. The \nForest Service has the ability to proceed via categorical exemptions. \nIt can develop an EIS when it needs to analyze complex proposals. If we \nstart changing NEPA with respect to hazardous fuels projects, where are \nwe going to stop?\n  I urge my colleagues not to change legislation that has been one of \nthe landmark pieces of environmental law that this body saw fit to pass \nin 1969, but rather to keep that legislation intact and fund hazardous \nfuel reductions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington has made a \nnumber of extremely important points, points with which I certainly \nagree. Having served as chair of the forestry subcommittee and now \nranking minority member, I can tell my colleagues the Senator from \nWashington is absolutely right with respect to her concern about \nadequate funding. For example, the bill from the other body provided no \nfunding for the thinning projects. This legislation increases funding \n80 percent. So her point with respect to making sure there is funding \nis dead on correct, and I think not only that point but other points \nshe has made are correct.\n  In spite of that, I do have to oppose the amendment tonight, and I \nwant to take a couple of moments to say why.\n  First, let me stress how important public participation was to me and \nto the other Senators who are involved in putting together this \nbipartisan compromise. If there is one thing, just one, that I want to \nstand for in my career in public service, it is the right of citizens \nto participate. That is why I have open community meetings in all my \ncounties. It is why I have sidewalk office hours. It is why, as so many \nSenators, I try to make myself available as widely and extensively as I \ncan.\n  So I come tonight to say with respect to this key issue, this key \nquestion of public participation, not one current opportunity for \npublic involvement would be lost under this compromise. I say that \nagain. Not one current opportunity for public comment would be lost \nunder this proposal.\n  There are three alternatives that people would be part of examining \nand, in fact, the public would have a right to come forward and offer \ntheir own. It\n\n[[Page S13626]]\n\nseems to me that that gives us a chance to keep the greatness of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, a statute more than 30 years old, \nwhile at the same time allowing us to deal with some of the concerns \nsuch as the unnecessary redtape and paperwork.\n  This proposal in the legislation we are considering cuts the \nalternatives from five, to nine, essentially to three. I am of the view \nthat, while it is appropriate to have a host of these alternatives \nunder the National Environmental Policy Act, when, say, the Federal \nGovernment is building a road, which is a broad purpose concern, I \nthink when you are talking about this area and projects that are \nnarrowly drawn, limited in where they can occur and how, it is \nappropriate to try to boil down the NEPA alternatives to the three that \nwe have offered in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Washington makes the argument that, \nin effect, the Senate will be starting down a slippery slope. I would \njust say to the Senator from Washington, I am convinced that because \nthere are good people in the Senate, such as the Senator from \nWashington, that will not be the case. If someone comes forward and \ntries, for example, to unravel the National Environmental Policy Act, \nor even apply what we are doing in this area to every area, there will \nbe opposition from a whole host of Senators, including this one. Nobody \nis talking about doing this in a host of other areas. We are talking \nabout saying in this one area where we have been told by, for example, \nthe Governors, it is not just a question of spending more money, it is \na question of how you spend the money, I think this compromise strikes \na reasonable balance.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this compromise. The compromise is \ndramatically different than the approach the other body takes with \nrespect to the National Environmental Policy Act. The other body \nbasically kicks the public out by predetermining the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act alternatives. What is offered in the \ncompromise preserves all opportunities for public input and appeal, \nwhile making sure that we deal with the paperwork and some of the \nunnecessary redtape.\n  I urge my colleagues to support what is in the compromise because not \none current opportunity for public comment would be lost, and all of us \nwant to make sure that on an issue that citizens care so strongly about \ntheir right to be heard is preserved. This compromise does that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Oregon in \nopposing this amendment. Let me make a couple of quick points.\n  First of all, if the Senator from Washington is concerned about the \nissue of funding, we increase by 80 percent the funding provided for \nfuel load induction.\n  With regard to process, the process in this bipartisan amendment will \nrequire the agencies work together in collaboration with the public to \ndevelop proposed projects.\n  It will allow the communities to develop community protection fire \nplans to help land management agencies better understand their \nindividual needs.\n  It requires the agency to publish a notice of each proposed hazardous \nfuel reduction project authorized under the act.\n  It requires the agency to hold public meetings to describe the \nproject and take the public comments on the project.\n  It requires a NEPA analysis of two action alternatives and one no-\naction alternative.\n  It requires the agency to facilitate a predecisional protest process \nonce the project analysis has been completed, and then the publication \nof a final decision notice.\n  Finally, it allows the public to pursue a case in the courts if, \nafter all of that, they still do not support the outcome of the \ndecisionmaking process.\n  Because of this, I believe it is very important that we do not \ncontinue to increase the cost and the bureaucracy surrounding the \nmanagement of these decisions. Therefore, I oppose the proposed \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I move to table this amendment. I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table. The yeas and nays \nare ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond) \nand the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Hollings), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Rockefeller), are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Nelson) is absent \nattending a family funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) would each vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 57, nays 34, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 426 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--34\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Graham (FL)\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n\n                             NOT VOTING--9\n\n     Bond\n     Clinton\n     Edwards\n     Hollings\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Rockefeller\n     Warner\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2045\n\n       (Purpose: To provide authority for title I)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa, [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n     Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 2045:\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 109. AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       The authority provided by this title applies during the 5-\n     year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I permitted the reading of the amendment \nto show how simple it is, one sentence. Basically, this amendment \nprovides for a 5-year authorization to title I of the bill. Currently, \nthis bill is drafted as permanent law, which means these provisions \ncontinue in perpetuity. I don't believe that should be the case.\n  This amendment is very reasonable and should not be controversial. It \nis consistent with past policy on authorizations. For example, the \nWyden-Feinstein bill and others introduced in the past several months \nhave always wisely provided for a 5-year timeline. Why this bill does \nnot have a 5-year timeline eludes me.\n\n[[Page S13627]]\n\n  Most of our major authorizing bills include a specified term of \nyears; for example, the 2002 farm bill, the Agriculture Committee child \nnutrition bill, which expires every 5 years, the Transportation bill, \nand on and on with many others. This is particularly true of \nlegislation that attempts to legislate a different approach than what \nis historical practice or that is controversial in some way. Again, \nthose both apply here.\n  We are legislating a different approach than what has been historical \npractice. It is, obviously, somewhat controversial. In doing so, this \n5-year timeframe provides a structured mechanism for Congress to review \nthe effectiveness of this new approach. I believe it is the prudent \nthing to do.\n  The bill we are debating today would significantly change how we \nmanage millions of acres of public land. It alters the National \nEnvironmental Public Act, NEPA, as we have discussed. As we all know, \nthe bill changes the judicial review process in addressing hazardous \nfuel cases. It changes the Forest Service appeals process as well. It \nprovides well-intended protections for old growth. But these may be \nlacking in some key respects. And the bill involves actions that will \naffect public safety and protecting communities throughout the country \nfrom wildfire risk.\n  These are significant changes. It makes perfect sense that Congress \nwill want to review the impact and effectiveness of the legislation \nafter an initial period of 5 years. Indeed, I believe it is our \nresponsibility to do so.\n  Currently, the legislation's authorities can be used on 20 million \nacres. That is a cap, and I assume some may argue that is an effective \nlimitation on the bill. Yet this could take much longer than 5 years at \nthe current rate of hazardous fuels reduction.\n\n  In fiscal year 2002, the Forest Service reduced fuels on 2.2 million \nacres of land. If we just keep that process up, you can see that the 20 \nmillion acres would not be reached for, well, a minimum of 10 years.\n  Now, some would argue that simply because we have a cap, that is why \nwe should not include a 5-year authorization. Yet if all is going well, \nand the agencies have not yet treated the full 20 million acres, \ncertainly the Congress can extend the authorization beyond its initial \n5-year period.\n  We do that all the time. We come here all the time to extend \nauthorizing bills. But it does give the relevant committees a chance to \ntake a look at it and to see whether tweaking needs to be done or \nwhether it needs to be reauthorized for that period of time. It sort of \nforces us to do our responsibility; that is, to review legislation \nperiodically. Moreover, we can make improvements when the time comes.\n  Now, again, some will argue that this acreage cap is an effective \nauthorization or a sunset, but it is not. It is simply a cap on \nacreage, nothing more. So I think adding the 5-year authorization to \nthis bill is a fairly conservative, reasonable, appropriate step to \ntake in line with much of what we do around here in terms of the length \nof time of legislation.\n  I know many of us, even those who will ultimately vote for the bill's \npassage, would be comforted to know in several years' time there will \nbe an opportunity to review its impact, discuss it, and perhaps make \nimprovements.\n  So, again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and kind of \nkeep it in line with most other types of legislation of this nature \nthat we pass around here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, there is no question that what the Senator \nfrom Iowa has talked about, the limitations that are built within the \nlegislative process, are there.\n  He is the reigning member of a full committee that has a forestry \nsubcommittee. I am chairman of another forestry subcommittee. We are \ngoing to monitor very closely this bill, if it becomes law. Probably we \nare 6 to 8 months away from regulation writing alone that will hit the \nground and become active. So already we will probably have an operative \nlife of only 4 years, if the amendment of the Senator from Iowa were to \nbecome law.\n  Our job is oversight. The Senator's job is oversight. Because this is \na controversial issue, it is incumbent upon us to make sure we monitor \nit closely. Many of our forest experts across the country who look at \nthe magnitude of the problem of forest health today are going to \nsuggest that even if we can reach our cap limits within 5 years, the \npublic and the resource will cry out that we continue for years to come \nin a thinning and cleaning process.\n  So I would hope our colleagues would join in sustaining the \nbipartisan compromise that is reflected in the legislation that is \nbefore us this evening.\n  Before I close, and because this appears to be the last amendment, I \nwant to make one more comment in the way of an article that was written \nin the San Jose Mercury News by Paul Rogers and Josh Susong. It \nappeared, apparently, today. Let me read, very briefly, the first page \nof this article. I will ask that the entire article be put in the \nRecord.\n  The dateline is: Lake Arrowhead, CA:\n\n       The oil industry had the Exxon Valdez. Nuclear power had \n     Three Mile Island.\n       Wednesday, with flames menacing one of Southern \n     California's most beloved mountain resorts, Lake Arrowhead in \n     the San Bernardino Mountains risked becoming forestry's \n     equivalent--a disaster so overwhelming it could change U.S. \n     environmental policy for decades to come.\n       The area, filled with overgrown, diseased and dying trees, \n     has gained a reputation in recent years as one of the worst \n     examples of forest mismanagement in the West.\n       If much of Lake Arrowhead or nearby Big Bear Lake ends up \n     burning, fire experts said it could prompt rapid changes, \n     including congressional orders for much more logging to thin \n     the nation's overgrown forests. . . .\n\n  Well, we are already responding. This article is actually behind, and \nwe are responding with the kind of bipartisan compromise that is before \nus tonight. But the article goes on to say:\n\n       Flames destroyed more than 300 homes near Lake Arrowhead \n     Wednesday--\n\n  That is yesterday--\n\n     with no end in sight.\n       Forests there would have burned naturally every 20 years, \n     said [a Forest Service expert]. . . . Areas that historically \n     had 50 trees per acre now have 500 [trees per acre].\n\n  Well, the article goes on and on, but here is something that it \ntalked about. And, of course, we have not seen the evening news tonight \nbecause fires are still burning in the Lake Arrowhead, San Bernardino \nforest areas.\n  It says:\n\n       Fire crews worked desperately to stop the advance as it \n     moved toward 44,000 homes, 2,000 businesses and 80,000 \n     outbuildings--property with an assessed value of $8 billion.\n       ``This may be a landmark event. This fire could take out \n     20,000 homes in the next day or two,'' said . . . a professor \n     of earth sciences at the University of California-Riverside.\n\n  And the article goes on and on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From San Jose Mercury News, Oct. 30, 2003]\n\n              Lake Arrowhead: Fears of a Landmark Disaster\n\n                    (by Paul Rogers and Josh Susong)\n\n       Lake Arrowhead.--The oil industry had the Exxon Valdez. \n     Nuclear power had three Mile Island.\n       Wednesday, with flames menacing one of Southern \n     California's most beloved mountain resorts, Lake Arrowhead in \n     the San Bernardino Mountains risked becoming forestry's \n     equivalent--a disaster so overwhelming it could change U.S. \n     environmental policy for decades to come.\n       The area, filled with overgrown, diseased and dying trees, \n     has gained a reputation in recent years as one of the worst \n     examples of forest mismanagement in the West.\n       If much of Lake Arrowhead or nearby Big Bear Lake ends up \n     burning, fire experts said it could prompt rapid changes, \n     including congressional orders for much more logging to thin \n     out the nation's overgrown forests, a loss of public \n     confidence in environmental groups that have resisted such \n     logging, and billions more taxpayer dollars spent on fire \n     protection.\n       Flames destroyed more than 300 homes near Lake Arrowhead \n     Wednesday, with no end in sight.\n       Forests there would have burned naturally every 20 years, \n     said Tom Bonnicksen, a professor of forest science at Texas \n     A University. But with homes at risk, the blazes were \n     regularly extinguished. Areas that historically had 50 trees \n     per acre now have 500.\n       ``Who's to blame? It depends on which decade you are \n     talking about,'' said Bonnicksen.\n       By the 1970s and 1980s, warnings from fire experts went \n     unheeded by homeowners' associations around Lake Arrowhead. \n     They protected their trees to preserve property values.\n\n[[Page S13628]]\n\n       ``You couldn't even cut the limb off a damn tree without \n     getting a permit,'' said Minnich. ``These people have wanted \n     to save every leaf.''\n       The last sawmill in the area closed in the mid-1980s. More \n     recently, environmentalists have pushed hard to limit logging \n     of large trees there.\n       ``The handwriting was on the wall several decades ago,'' \n     said Bonnicksen. ``Anyone in forestry could forecast that the \n     inevitable outcome would be the forest would burn down or the \n     insects would kill it and then it would burn down.''\n       The U.S. Forest Service said Wednesday its policy on forest \n     thinning has been guided by public opinion.\n       ``People didn't move there to be next to a logging \n     operation,'' said . . .\n       Fire crews worked desperately to stop the advance as it \n     moved toward 44,000 homes, 2,000 businesses and 80,000 \n     outbuildings--property with an assessed value of $8 billion.\n       ``This may be a landmark event. This fire could take out \n     20,000 homes in the next day or two,'' said Richard Minnich, \n     a professor of earth sciences at the University of \n     California-Riverside.\n\n\n                           WARNINGS OF DANGER\n\n       The loss of Lake Arrowhead would be stunning but not \n     entirely surprising. For the past three years, fire experts \n     have described the resort community 100 miles northeast of \n     Los Angeles as a catastrophe waiting to happen.\n       Four years of drought have hammered the region. The area's \n     weakened ponderosa pine and fir trees became infested with \n     bark beetles, and by this summer millions of trees were dead \n     across 350,000 acres.\n       Limbs fell on cars and homes. Local residents, facing \n     county citations, paid up to $1,000 per tree to contractors \n     in a frantic attempt to remove the tinder-like fuels. They \n     barely made a dent.\n       The reason: The forests are unnaturally thick. Fire crews \n     began putting out fires in the area in the early 1900s, when \n     James Gamble of Proctor & Gamble built a dam to create the \n     lake, and vacation cabins from a growing Los Angeles began to \n     spring up in the 1920s and 1930s.\n       Forests there would have burned naturally every 20 years, \n     said Tom Bonnicksen, a professor of forest science at Texas \n     A University. But with homes at risk, the blazes were \n     regularly extinguished. Areas that historically had 50 trees \n     per acre now have 500.\n       ``Who's to blame? It depends on which decade you are \n     talking about,'' said Bonnicksen.\n       By the 1970s and 1980s, warnings from the experts went \n     unheeded by homeowners' associations around Lake Arrowhead. \n     They protected their trees to preserve property values.\n       ``You couldn't even cut the limb off a damn tree without \n     getting a permit,'' said Minnich. ``These people have wanted \n     to save every leaf.''\n       The last sawmill in the area closed in the mid-1980s. More \n     recently, environmentalists have pushed hard to limit logging \n     of large trees there.\n       ``The handwriting was on the wall several decades ago,'' \n     said Bonnicksen. ``Anyone in forestry could forecast that the \n     inevitable outcome would be the forest would burn down or the \n     insects would kill it and then it would burn down.''\n       The U.S. Forest Service said Wednesday its policy on forest \n     thinning has been guided by public opinion.\n       ``People didn't move there to be next to a logging \n     operation,'' said spokesman Matt Mathes.\n       Mathes said when the trees began to die off from bark \n     beetle infestation, the San Bernardino National Forest \n     increased its budget for fire-thinning from $2 million in \n     2002 to $12 million this year.\n       Charles Griego, who's been trimming trees in the area for \n     years, left his home near Lake Arrowhead on Wednesday with \n     his wife and three sons and a pile of family pictures.\n       He shook his head when he talked about the downed trees and \n     the agencies--federal, state, anybody. ``They've known they \n     had a problem for years,'' he said, ``and they didn't do \n     anything.''\n\n\n                             Angry e-mails\n\n       As the fires burned, angry e-mails began pouring in \n     Wednesday to the offices of environmental groups blaming them \n     for the disaster.\n       Monica Bond, a wildlife biologist with the Center for \n     Biological Diversity in Idyllwild, said that although her \n     group has appealed and sued to block a government forest-\n     thinning operation in the Sierra Nevada, it had not done so \n     in the San Bernardino Mountains. The trees need to be logged \n     and removed, but large trees should be left for wildlife \n     habitat, she said.\n       ``Some people are shamelessly exploiting this tragedy as an \n     excuse to log big trees in remote areas,'' she said. ``There \n     is no need to do that.'' Bonnicksen, who has worked with the \n     timber industry, said he supports President Bush's ``Healthy \n     Forests Initiative,'' to thin overgrown national forests and \n     cover the costs by allowing timber companies to take some \n     large, old-growth trees.\n       ``If Lake Arrowhead burns down, there will be a massive \n     reaction,'' he said. ``It will be finger-pointing like you \n     can't believe. I'm more interested in having us understand \n     why it got this way, and preventing it from ever happening \n     again.''\n       On the Senate floor Wednesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-\n     Calf., held up pictures of California forests. She succeeded \n     in convincing the Senate to pass an amendment to Bush's \n     logging plan that would require 50 percent of thinning to be \n     done near homes, and to provide $760 million to offset the \n     costs.\n       ``Look at these homes. Look at the dead and dying trees,'' \n     she said of Lake Arrowhead. ``Does anyone believe they have a \n     chance of surviving if this forest is not cleaned?''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, what we are about to conclude tonight is a \n3- to 4-year effort on the part of many folks of good will on both \nsides of the aisle to bring some modicum of change. This is not a giant \nleap forward. This is a cautious, careful step to assure that we can \nbegin to address our forests that are overgrown, that are diseased, \nthat are now caught up in the scenario of wildfire, as we see it \nplaying itself out in southern California today.\n  Without a doubt this is a national emergency and a national crisis. \nWe are being asked to spend upwards of $1.2 billion a year of \ntaxpayers' money simply to put the fires out, let alone the cleanup and \nthe restoration and the saving of watersheds and wildlife habitat.\n  So I would hope we could continue this process and monitor it \nclosely. My last hope is that the work tonight can go to the \nPresident's desk, can become law, and we can say we, once again, have \nbecome reasonable and responsible stewards of our forested lands.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. The hour is late. I am going to \nbe very brief.\n  I am opposed to this amendment. This is not an unlimited bill. It has \na 20-million-acre cap. Suffice it to say, we are going to have a lot of \noversight in both the Agriculture Committee and the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee.\n  But I also thank the Senator from Iowa with respect to how he has \nhandled this legislation. He has been exceptionally kind and helpful to \nme. He has had differences of opinion with me on this issue. I thank \nhim for all of his cooperation.\n  Suffice it to say, Mr. President and colleagues, the West has been \nwatching the last few days, and in a particularly contentious area, the \nSenate has been able to find an awful lot of common ground. Even on \nsome of the amendments that we have had--the question of the urban \ninterface funding initiative, whether it should be 50 percent or 70 \npercent--these are areas where reasonable people can differ. It is \nawfully easy to polarize on this issue, to drive people into rival \ncamps, and to a great extent the Senate has avoided this.\n  So what is important tonight as we deal with this last substantive \namendment--and then we have a couple of procedural matters, colloquies, \nand that sort of thing to finish--is that we recognize how important it \nis to get this bipartisan compromise to the President's desk.\n  The bill that the Senate will pass tonight is the one that I believe \nought to become law, and it is absolutely critical that it be the one \nto get to the President so it can become law.\n  So I hope Senators will continue to work together on a bipartisan \nbasis and make sure the Senate compromise does not unravel.\n  In addition to the Senator from Iowa, who has been so helpful \nthroughout this process so we could expedite it, Senator Cochran from \nMississippi, since the days that we spent those long hours in his \noffice, Senator Craig, Senator Domenici, Senator Crapo, and others, a \nlot of people thought we would never get to this night.\n  One person who did was the senior Senator from California who I have \nbeen so honored to have had on my subcommittee over the years. We \nwouldn't be on the floor tonight without the senior Senator from \nCalifornia who consistently, when we bumped up against an issue where \nwe couldn't bring people together, it was the Senator from California \nwho broke the gridlock. I want the Senate to know how much this body \nshould appreciate the contribution of Senator Feinstein. This Senator \ndoes in particular.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are wrapping up this bill. I think \neveryone knows that it essentially came from the Agriculture Committee \nof the\n\n[[Page S13629]]\n\nSenate. Many of us thought it was going to the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, but it was ruled that it belonged more in the \njurisdiction of Agriculture. I feel very good about the results. I am \nvery pleased with Chairman Thad Cochran's efforts and those of the \nAgriculture Committee, in a bipartisan manner, producing this bill and \nthen further negotiations to even make it better.\n  I am not so sure had it been sent to the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, where in years past we would have thought it should go, that \nwe would have produced as good a bill. With the amendments that have \ncome forth because of efforts after the bill came out of committee, it \nis truly remarkable that we were able to achieve this. It is almost as \nif the problem couldn't possibly have existed so long because of the \nway it has worked out. It is like an overwhelming number of Senators \nhave come to the realization that it is time to fix a broken set of \nmanagement tools for the forests of our country.\n  I think we have fixed them. I can tie this into the pending amendment \nby saying, it certainly isn't anything you are going to fix in 5 years. \nSo for those who might have in mind that we have this bill for 5 years \nand then we start over, we are probably going to need 15 or 20 years of \neffort under this bill, with plenty of resources, to get the forests of \nAmerica back where they should be. Where they ought to be is they ought \nto be beautiful forests, but they ought not be so susceptible to \nburning down. We all know that.\n  It is just incredible that it has taken so long to get where we are. \nI know what Senator Craig read into the Record a while ago from the \nnewspaper in California because I read it a while ago. Whoever wrote it \nis right on. This horror that we lived through was no accident. It is \nthe result of not doing what we ought to do because certain groups in \nthis country didn't want it to be done--plain and simple.\n\n  They know who they are and the people know who they are. It happens \nthat every time we turn around and talk about them, there is an excuse \nnow that they really didn't do it; They weren't really against this; \nThey were for fixing the forests all along; They have been for \nmodifying our laws for decades; right?\n  Well, that just isn't true. We have finally come around, but it \nsurely has taken a long time.\n  Anybody looking at this Nation on this one would have a real \ncomplaint about the slowness of the democratic process. Because it \nwasn't all of a sudden that this problem came upon us; it has been \naround. It has been up and down, through the hills, burning the \nmountains. It leaves millions of acres dry, pieces of wood standing in \nthe air that have been infested. And then still there are people going \nto court, groups saying, don't cut them down.\n  These fires cut them down. These fires make them disintegrate. They \ndon't even burn down; they just go poof and there goes a tree. That is \nabout how it goes.\n  I have seen it. I had one that was bad. Three hundred fifty homes \nburned down. Probably with the number of homes and the damage, it was \nthe second largest one. But it paled in comparison to this one.\n  Frankly, before these forests that are dead and should have already \nbeen cut down, before it finishes in California, there will be no room \nfor excuses. There is going to be a whole bunch of people who will want \nit all solved next week, in particular those who have been in the way \nof fixing it. They are going to be saying: Why isn't it fixed?\n  We are going to have to pour in three times as much money, in my \nestimation, as we have been putting in. I don't know if we can find the \nmanpower to put in the Bureau of Land Management and the forests to do \nthe kind of work we have to do. I am not sure we can. It is such a huge \njob to clean up these forests that I am not sure, if you put down a \ntimeline and said, here is where we ought to be, we would get there. We \nare going to have to contract it out. We will have to have all kinds of \napproaches to get in there and just take out all that stuff that is all \nover the bottom of the forests, under the trees, just waiting to burn. \nThat is no easy job.\n  For those who are so worried that we were going to log the forests to \ndeath, they have watched them burn to death. We were not going to log \nthem to death so we watched them burn to death. That is what happened.\n  It is high time we fix it. I don't know if I will be a conferee. \nMaybe they will all be off the Agriculture Committee. If I am, I can \npledge that I am in a hurry. I have a lot to do, but I am in a hurry.\n  Everybody who goes to this conference ought to be in a hurry, not \nonly in a hurry to get a bill but in a hurry to get a bill that can \nclear the Senate and get the President to sign in the shortest period \nof time. That is what we ought to be worried about next. It isn't so \ngood to get this done and be at it 6 months and then find that the \nPresident doesn't like what we have done because we have changed things \nso much.\n  I thank not only Chairman Cochran but I thank the staff of the \nAgriculture Committee. They have been tremendous. We have had the \nluxury of working with them from our staff. But I can tell you, had it \nbeen assigned, we couldn't have done it any better with the full staff. \nAnd they have done it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wanted to say a few words. Actually, \nSenator Craig was one of the earliest people with whom we began to work \non these issues, from the California perspective, many years ago on the \nQuincy Library Group. That began to develop kind of an across-the-aisle \nbond.\n  Then when Senator Wyden became ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nPublic Lands and Forests in the Senate Energy Committee, he really took \na great interest in this subject as well. So it has been a terrific \npleasure for me to work with him as well. He has carried this out in an \nabsolutely superlative way.\n  I also want to thank Senator Daschle, Senator Lincoln and Senator \nPryor, who have been a crucial part of this legislation, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Cochran, Senators Crapo and Domenici. I am looking for \npeople in the Chamber who have been part of this effort.\n  I hope the American people are proud of us tonight. I believe we have \nworked as the American people want us to work--not out of mean-spirited \npartisanship but rather, sitting together and working across the aisle \nto work out compromises. That is what this bill is. We had to cement \ncertain compromises in order to see that the bill covered the United \nStates fairly and also met the concerns of both sides of the aisle.\n  This bill is funded. It is about double the amount of money that we \nhave had in the past to treat those lands that are at high risk of \ncatastrophic fire. The House bill is not funded. Additionally, this \nbill leaves intact a collaborative citizen participation process in an \nadministrative review procedure. It leaves intact the ability for \njudicial review, but it truncates it in a way that allows us to move \nmore aggressively on the 20 million acres that are encompassed in this \nbill.\n\n  It is interesting to me to hear people say: Oh, they are just going \nto log all the forests. In fact, that has never been the case. There \nhas always been a set number. In this bill, it is 20 million acres. We \nhave 54 million acres across the United States that is at the highest \nrisk of catastrophic fire. In my State alone, we have 8.5 million \nacres. It is going to take a new mindset for people if we are going to \nbe able to do what we need to do.\n  Since Senator Craig mentioned the Old Fire, which is currently \nburning in California, I just wanted to give you all a brief update. \nCurrently, I have my State director at the command center in San \nBernardino. I just want to report that with respect to the Old Fire, \nwhich is the huge fire they thought would consume all of Lake Arrowhead \nand a number of other threatened mountain towns where there are 50,000 \nto 60,000 residential homes, they have had a good day today. It began \nto rain this morning, the fog is in, and the air remains moist. They \ncouldn't see the smoke for the fog, and for the first time on the fire \nlines, there is a sense of optimism that these heroic crews are going \nto be able to get a hold on this fire. Most importantly, they were able \nto bulldoze a line ahead of that fire. Over five hundred homes have \nbeen lost in that particular fire so far. Hopefully, there will not be \nmany more\n\n[[Page S13630]]\n\nlost, and, hopefully, within a matter of a few days that huge fire can \nbe put under control.\n  As we know, the town of Julian, which is a gold mining town in the \nSan Diego area, has eight firefighters. All eight firefighters fighting \nthese fires have lost their homes. One distinguished firefighter, \nSteven Rucker, who came down on mutual aid from the city of Novato in \nnorthern California lost his life. I think we all salute him.\n  There is an enormous lesson in these devastating fires currently \nburning in my home State, and it is that the land has to be managed. \nThe forests have to be managed. We have to do the right thing for our \nconstituents. We are pushed and we are pulled by conflicting interests. \nI believe the Senate version of this bill is a good bill. It is a good \nbill from the interests of the public, and that is what has to count in \nthis matter.\n  I thank the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Cochran, \nwho has been instrumental in leading this effort; Senator Domenici, my \nfriend and colleague, and Senator Harkin, the ranking member on the \nAgriculture Committee. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthis bill.\n  I thank the chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to close out my amendment. There \nwere a lot of speeches, but not too many on my amendment.\n  I would like to bring it back a little bit, anyway. I again point out \nthat the pending amendment is one that basically says we are going to \nauthorize it, but we are going to authorize it for a period of time.\n  I say to my good friend from Oregon--and he is my good friend--I know \nhe and others worked so hard on this bill and got a good compromise. I \nunderstand that, but I don't think that putting a time on this bill \nviolates any compromise. As I pointed out, earlier bills have had a 5-\nyear time limit.\n  I know my friend from Idaho talked about monitoring, the fact we \nmonitor bills. Of course, we monitor bills. There is that old saying: \nNothing focuses one's attention like the hangman's noose. When you find \nthat something is expiring, that is when a committee starts to act, \nreview, and get into it, perform its responsibilities.\n  It is in that nature I have offered this amendment. I don't think it \ndoes anything to hurt the bill or change it. It doesn't change one \nthing in the bill. All it says is at some point down the track, 5 \nyears--I picked 5 years because that was in earlier bills--the \nappropriate committee--in this case the Agriculture Committee--will \nreauthorize it.\n  Sometimes a reauthorization goes through by unanimous consent. That \nmay be the case with this bill. I don't know. Maybe if this bill works \nas everyone says it will, it might go by unanimous consent or maybe we \nwill want to change something. At least it will force the committee to \ndo something at that time, and that is in the nature of why I offered \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know Members are \nhere waiting for a vote. I also have to rise in opposition to the \namendment. When we first began crafting the legislation in the \nAgriculture Committee, of which I chaired the Forestry Subcommittee, \nour first thought was to have no limit on time and no limit on acreage \nbecause, frankly, this is a good bill and it provides good management \ntechniques we ought to utilize until we can devise better ones for our \nforests.\n  However, in the compromise through the negotiation process, as we \nwere working to make this a strong bipartisan bill and bring it \ntogether, we agreed to a 20 million acre cap. I believe that 20 million \nacre limit is very modest compared to the risk we face. We need to put \na perspective on this. The fact is the estimates are that there are 100 \nmillion acres at risk in America today, and this bill has a 20 million \nacre limit.\n  If anything, we need to be talking about how to consider whether we \nneed to expand the application of this bill rather than to retract it \nor put more limits on it because we have worked in a bipartisan fashion \nto put together a good compromise that is going to be good for our \nforests and good for the people who live near the forests.\n  I conclude by also thanking those who worked with us to make this \ntruly a bipartisan effort: The chairmen of the two committees, the \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Cochran, and the Energy Committee, \nSenator Domenici; my colleague from Idaho, who is the chairman of the \nForestry Subcommittee on the Energy Committee, and Senator Lincoln, who \nis the ranking member on my subcommittee who worked so closely with me \nto draft the first piece that became the underlying language from which \nwe then built this compromise. She has worked very hard and very \neffectively to make this all happen; Senator Feinstein and Senator \nWyden, who came in and worked with us, with a true and sincere interest \nto make this a true and strong bipartisan effort; Senator McCain and \nSenator Kyl from Arizona, who became involved; Senator Baucus and \nSenator Burns from Montana; and Senator Thomas from Wyoming--all of \nwhom were very integral in working to help make this a broad, \nsuccessful, bipartisan effort. I am sure I have left some out.\n  The reason I go through this is to, once again, reiterate how this is \nthe way people in America want the political process to work. They want \nus to find common ground and build good commonsense solutions to issues \nthat cross party lines and get to the issue on principle rather than on \npartisanship or personal attacks. That is what this bill is about.\n  As I move to table this last amendment, I will announce that we will \nthen be going forward after that with a managers' amendment and to \nfinal passage. I think tonight we are going to have a very big victory \nfor America.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Can we voice-vote the managers' package?\n  Mr. CRAPO. I believe we could.\n  I move to table the Harkin amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  I remind Senators, per instructions from both sides of the aisle, \nthis will be a 20-minute vote.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n2045. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Hollings), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), \nthe Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Lieberman), are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Nelson) is absent \nattending a family funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 61, nays 31, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 427 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--61\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--31\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n\n[[Page S13631]]\n\n\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n\n                             NOT VOTING--8\n\n     Clinton\n     Edwards\n     Hollings\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lieberman\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Shelby\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2046\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2046.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment containing technical \nchanges to the bill and amendments in behalf of the following Senators: \nSenator Collins, Senators Corzine and Specter, Senator Cantwell, \nSenator Leahy, Senators Lugar and Harkin, Senator Ensign, and Senator \nAllard, all of which have been approved by the managers on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendments are agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2046) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I want to take just a few moments of the \nSenate's time to discuss a provision included in the manager's \namendment that will authorize acquisition of open space in the \nHighlands Forest that runs through New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut \nand my state of New Jersey.\n  First of all, I express my great appreciation to the managers of this \nbill, Senators Cochran and Harkin, for agreeing to include this \namendment. I also recognize and congratulate Congressman Rodney \nFrelinghuysen for his success in getting an identical version of this \nbill passed unanimously by the House Resources Committee yesterday. \nCongressman Frelinghuysen and I have worked together closely on this \nmatter, and I know he has worked hard for many years on behalf of the \nHighlands and has played a key role in bringing needed conservation \nfunds to the area.\n  The amendment included in the managers' package is a modified version \nof S. 999, the Highlands Stewardship Act, which I introduced earlier \nthis year with Senators Lautenberg, Schumer, Clinton, Dodd, Lieberman \nand Specter. The goal of this bipartisan legislation is to preserve one \nof the last open space treasures in our densely populated region, the \nAppalachian Highlands Forest.\n  The Highlands region stretches from northwestern Connecticut, across \nthe lower Hudson River valley in New York, through my State of New \nJersey and into east-central Pennsylvania. It encompasses more than two \nmillion acres of forest, farms, streams, wetlands, lakes and \nreservoirs. It also includes such historic sites as Morristown National \nHistoric Park, where George Washington had headquarters during the \nAmerican Revolution, and the United States Military Academy at West \nPoint.\n  The value of the natural, recreational and scenic resources of the \nHighlands cannot be overstated. In a study of the New York-New Jersey \nHighlands region alone, the Forest Service found that 170 million \ngallons are drawn from the Highlands aquifers daily, providing quality \ndrinking water for over 11 million people. 247 threatened or endangered \nspecies live in the New Jersey-New York Highlands region, including the \ntimber rattlesnake, wood turtle, red-shouldered hawk, barred owl, and \ngreat blue heron. According to the U.S. Forest Service, over 14 million \npeople visit the NY-NJ Highlands for outdoor recreation, more than \nYellowstone National Park and our most heavily visited natural \ntreasures.\n  But the values and benefits of the Highlands are not limited to the \nfour states that share them. A 1992 study and recent update by the \nUnited States Forest Service describes the Highlands as a region of \n``national significance''--one that is within 2 hours of travel for 1 \nin 9 Americans.\n  Unfortunately, the supply of federal, state, local and private money \nthat has gone to protect the Highlands over the years has not kept pace \nwith development in the area. According to the Forest Service, more \nthan 25,000 acres of forest and farm land in the New York and New \nJersey sections of the Highlands have been lost annually to development \nbetween 1995 and 2000, and nearly 300,000 acres of land critical to \nfuture water supplies remain unprotected.\n  I represent the most densely populated state in the country. The \npressures we face from development are intense. In New Jersey, the \nHighlands region lies in close proximity to New York City and is valued \nfor housing development. New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania face \nsimilar development pressures. We need to do more to protect this \nnational treasure.\n  The amendment that I hope the Senate will approve today is modeled \nafter the successful federal-state partnership used to protect much of \nSterling Forest, a crown jewel of the Highlands. The legislation would \nfacilitate similar conservation partnerships to protect critical \ntreasures threatened by sprawl throughout the region. The amendment \nwould enable us to build upon the legacy of Sterling Forest, but it \nwill take a strong commitment and partnership between the Highlands \nstates and the Federal Government to safeguard this region.\n  The amendment calls on the governors of the four states to recommend \nconservation projects within certain threatened areas identified by the \nForest Service. It also would authorize $100 million over the next 10 \nyears for easements or acquisition of land within those areas. As in \nthe preservation of Sterling Forest, the money would come from the \nFederal side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  I would note that the land and water conservation fund generally is \nnot used for open space acquisitions in my state and the other \nHighlands states. That is because the fund only can support \nacquisitions to expand existing Federal parks, forests and recreation \nareas. While this works well for states with a significant amount of \nfederal parks and forests, it does not help states like New Jersey with \ncomparatively less Federal land. This amendment would help to make sure \nthat New Jersey and the other Highlands states get their fair share of \nopen space funding.\n  The only land to be acquired would be land owned by people who want \nto sell. This amendment would not force anyone to sell, nor interfere \nwith any other property right. Nor would the amendment interfere with \nany local zoning ordinance or local government land use plan. Nor would \nit create any new federal ownership or management responsibilities. \nTitle to the land or easement purchased would belong to the state where \nit is located.\n  Finally, the amendment is designed to conserve land that has been \nidentified as having a high conservation value by the Forest Service \nand which is not currently protected from development under any \nexisting law. This is land that serves as the habitat for animals, or \nprovides a source for water supplies, or that is simply unusual in its \nnatural beauty.\n  In conclusion, the Highlands are a national treasure, and it is \ncritical that they be preserved. I again thank the managers for their \ncooperation, and their support of this legislation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nSenators Cochran and Harkin, for including in the managers' package an \namendment I filed on the issue of wildland firefighter safety. My heart \ngoes out to my colleagues from California and the people they \nrepresent. In Washington, we are well acquainted with catastrophic \nwildfires and the threat they pose to local communities. Our thoughts \nare with the people of California, as well as with the families of the \nfirefighters on the job--including crews from my State who are on their \nway south to join in the effort.\n  The men and women who fight fires on our public lands serve our \nNation bravely. Since 1910, more than 900 wildland firefighters have \nlost their lives in the line of duty. Before the California fires, I \nbelieve the toll was 26 individuals this year alone.\n  And this morning, we were faced with the news of the first \nfirefighter death\n\n[[Page S13632]]\n\nfrom the California blazes--an 11-year veteran named Steven Rucker, who \nperished while trying to save a home. He leaves behind a wife and two \nchildren.\n  As I have read the press accounts and listened to the stories my \ncolleagues have told about the loss of life in California over these \npast few days, I cannot help but recall a recent tragedy in my State of \nWashington. On July 10, 2001, near Winthrop in Okanogan County, in the \nmidst of the second worst drought in the history of our State, the \nThirtymile Fire burned out of control. Four courageous young \nfirefighters were killed. Their names: Tom Craven, 30 years old; Karen \nFitzPatrick, 18; Jessica Johnson, 19; and Devin Weaver, 21.\n  Sadly, as subsequent investigations revealed, these young men and \nwomen did not have to die. In the words of the Forest Service's own \nreport on the Thirtymile Fire, the tragedy ``could have been \nprevented.'' We know that firefighting is a dangerous job. But despite \nits inherent danger, we have a responsibility to ensure that no \npreventable tragedy like Thirtymile Fire ever happens again.\n  I would like to thank my colleague Senator Bingaman, the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Senate Energy Committee, as well as \nSenator Wyden, who was then chair of the Subcommittee on Public Lands \nand Forests. In the wake of the Thirtymile Fire, they agreed to convene \nhearings on precisely what went wrong that tragic day. We heard from \nthe grief-stricken families. In particular, the powerful testimony of \nKen Weaver--the father of one of the lost firefighters-- put into focus \nprecisely what's at stake when we send these men and women into harm's \nway. I can think of no worse tragedy for a parent than confronting the \nloss of a child, especially when that loss could have been prevented by \nbetter practices on the part of Federal agencies.\n  At the Senate Energy Committee hearing, we also discussed with \nexperts and the Forest Service itself ways in which we could improve \nthe agency's safety performance. And almost a year to the day after \nthose young people lost their lives, we passed a bill--ensuring an \nindependent review of tragic incidents such as Thirtymile that lead to \nunnecessary fatalities.\n  Based on subsequent briefings by the Forest Service, revisions to the \nagency's training and safety protocols, and even based on what I have \nheard when I have visited with firefighters over the past two years, I \ndo believe the courage of those families to stand up and demand change \nhas had a positive impact on the safety of the young men and women who \ntoday are battling blazes as wildland firefighters. Yet, I believe \nthere is more that Congress can do to express our commitment. Today I \noffer a modest amendment that will take a few more steps in that \ndirection.\n  My amendment does three simple things.\n  First, it will require the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to \ntrack the funds the agencies expend for firefighter safety and \ntraining.\n  Today, these sums are lumped into the agencies' ``wildfire \npreparedness'' account. But as I have discussed with various officials \nin hearings before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nit is difficult for Congress to play its rightful oversight role--\nensuring that these programs are funded in times of wildfire emergency, \nand measuring the agencies' commitment to these programs over time--\nwithout a separate break-down of these monies.\n  Second, it will require the Secretaries to report to Congress \nannually on the implementation and effectiveness of its safety and \ntraining programs. I assure my colleagues who have not spent time \ndwelling on this issue, that the maze of policy statements, management \ndirectives and curricula changes associated with Federal firefighter \ntraining is dizzying and complicated.\n  The agencies have a responsibility to continually revise their \npolicies in the face of new science and lessons learned on the fire \nline. Meanwhile, this body has the responsibility to ensure needed \nreforms are implemented. As such, I believe that Congress and the \nagencies alike would benefit from an annual check-in on these programs. \nI would also hope that this would serve as a vehicle for an ongoing and \nhealthy dialogue between the Senate and agencies on these issues.\n  Third, it would stipulate that Federal contracts with private \nfirefighting crews require training consistent with the training of \nFederal wildland firefighters. It would also direct those agencies to \nmonitor compliance with this requirement. This is important not just \nfor the private contractor employees' themselves but for the Federal, \nState and tribal employees who stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them on \nthe fire line.\n  This is actually quite a complex issue about which many of us are \njust beginning to learn. With the severity of fire seasons throughout \nthe country over the past 2 years--and notwithstanding the Clinton \nadministration's efforts to hire a significant number of new \nfirefighters as part of the National Fire Plan--the number of private \ncontract crews hired by the agencies to help with fire suppression has \ntripled since 1998. According to Oregon Department of Forestry \nestimates, the number of contract crews at work has grown from 88 to \n1998 to 300 this year, with 95 percent based in the Pacific Northwest. \nIn general, these contract crews have grown up in former timber \ncommunities and provide important jobs, especially given the fact the \nagencies themselves do not at this juncture have the resources to fight \nthe fires entirely on their own. And many of these contractors have \nbeen in operation for a decade or more and boast stellar safety \nrecords.\n  Nevertheless, as the number of--and need for--contractors has grown, \nthere are more and more tales of unscrupulous employers that take \nadvantage of workers and skirt training and safety requirements. This \nis a growing concern for U.S. Forest Service employees and state \nofficials. This summer, the Seattle Times wrote a detailed feature on \nthe issue, quoting internal Forest Service memos as well as evidence \nfrom the field.\n  Among the contractor practices cited in the article: Breaking safety \nrules and failing to warn other crews on the fire line; falsifying or \nforging firefighting credentials and ignoring training requirements; \nhiring illegal immigrants that cannot understand fire line commands--\nand committing various labor abuses; and rotating a single crew from \nfire to fire for 50 straight days--while Federal firefighters are not \nallowed to work more than 14 or 21 days in a row.\n  The article quoted from a November 2002 memo written by Joseph \nFerguson, a deputy incident commander for the Forest Service: ``If we \ndon't improve the quality and accountability of this program, we are \ngoing to kill a bunch of firefighters . . . Although there were two or \nthree good to excellent crews on each fire, that was offset by 20 to 30 \nthat were hardly worth having,'' Ferguson added. ``It was apparent that \ntraining for most of these crews had been done poorly or not at all.''\n\n  Paul Broyles, who heads a safety committee for the National \nInteragency Fire Center added that private crews he has seen have \nvaried from ``fantastic to a he[ck] of a lot less than good and some \nwere real safety concerns.'' He noted that while state government and \nfeds were trying to crack down on violations associated with \ndocumentation, ``the assumption is, where there's one problem, there's \nprobably more.''\n  This provision is a modest beginning in addressing the challenges \nposed by integrating private and Federal contract crews--and doing it \nin a manner that maximizes everyone's safety on the fire line. I \nunderstand that the Federal and State agencies are already attempting \nto push contractors in this direction, and this provision will bolster \nthat momentum.\n  I had also hoped to include in this amendment a provision that would \ndirect the General Accounting Office to conduct a study of the impacts \nof the President's outscourcing initiative on wildland firefighter \nsafety. Unfortunately, that provision was opposed by my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  Now, let me be clear. I oppose the Bush administration's outsourcing \ninitiative. And if I had my way, I would simply declare that this \ninitiative would not apply to the firefighting agencies. However, at \nthe very least, I hope my colleagues will agree that we should take a \nclose look at how outsourcing will affect the ability of\n\n[[Page S13633]]\n\nour Federal agencies to do their job when it comes to fighting \nwildfires and their ability to do it safely.\n  According to the Forest Service Council, which represents 20,000 \nForest Service employees across the Nation, some 40 percent of these \nworkers serve dual functions.\n  Likened to the Reserve or National Guard, they call it the \n``militia'' approach--where qualified employees that perform other jobs \nfor much of the year are dispatched as ``first responders'' on wildland \nfires.\n  From a military perspective in Iraq, we have seen the importance of \nthe National Guard and Reserve in supporting our military efforts. No \none here in Congress would contemplate outsourcing the Guard and \nReserve.\n  I hope my colleagues would recognize that it is completely unclear \nhow the outsourcing initiative, with its emphasis on contracting out \ncertain types of jobs, would impact the need for Forest Service \nemployees to perform these collateral duties. I am concerned that the \noutsourcing initiative will seriously erode the agencies' capacity to \nfight fires--just as the sponsors of this bill argue these fires are \nbecoming most intense.\n  Likewise, I have serious concerns that it will disrupt the chain of \ncommand on the fire line, especially in instances in which the Forest \nService could lose some of its most experienced firefighters as a \nresult of outsourcing. These are my concerns.\n  While I understand that there were objections on the other side of \nthe aisle to including the GAO study provision--and we have thus \nremoved it from this amendment, to move forward on the other important \nprovisions--I guess we are lucky that such a study does not actually \nrequire legislation. I plan to work with a number of my colleagues to \nrequest just such a report form the GAO, because I believe it is \nimportant we thoroughly understand the way outsourcing would impact \nFederal agencies' ability to fight fires and fight them safely.\n  And so I hope my colleagues will support this simple amendment. \nUltimately, the safety of our Federal firefighters is a critical \ncomponent of how well prepared our agencies are to deal with the threat \nof catastrophic wildfire.\n  Congress owes it to the families of those brave firefighters we send \ninto harm's way to provide oversight of these safety and training \nprograms.\n  We owe it to our Federal wildland firefighters, their families and \ntheir State partners, and to future wildland firefighters.\n  My amendment will provide this body with the additional tools it \nneeds to do the job. I thank my colleagues for supporting this \namendment.\n\n\n                     administrative review process\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Could the Senator from Mississippi confirm that with \nrespect to section 105(c)(3), it would be the Agriculture Committee's \nintent that if the agency fails or is unable to make information timely \navailable during the administrative review process, the court should \nevaluate whether the administrative review process was inadequate for \nclaims or issues to which the information is material?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator's understanding is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I intend to support H.R. 1904, as \namended by the Senate. I do so, however, with significant reservations \nabout the bill, and its benefits for Wisconsin, and I want to describe \nmy concerns in detail. Forest fire management is a critical issue for \nmy home State of Wisconsin and for the country. Forest fires burned on \napproximately 7 million acres across 15 States during last year's fire \nseason, the second worst in 50 years. Fighting those fires cost \ntaxpayers about $1.6 billion. It also cost 23 firefighters their lives. \nThis year's fire season is expected to be as bad as last year's. And \nthough Wisconsin has escaped the season unharmed, my State did face a \nhigher than normal risk of fire this summer due to the relatively dry \nweather we had the year before.\n  Moreover, forests are important to Wisconsin economically. Our \nbusinesses depend on them as do our recreation and tourism industries. \nThe primary and secondary wood products industry is the second largest \nemployer in Wisconsin and, according to the Wisconsin Division of \nForestry, my State leads the Nation in 2002 in the production of fine \npapers, sanitary paper products, children's furniture, and millwork. \nForest resources in Wisconsin are a primary tourism attraction for both \nresidents and visitors.\n  Given the role and importance of forests in Wisconsin, I wish that \nthe bill focused more on the forests of the Upper Midwest. I am \nparticularly concerned that the bill passed by the House focuses too \nstrongly on the implementation of recommendations made by the Western \nGovernors regarding forest health.\n  It is worth noting that the Senate has considered these kinds of \nemergency legislative measures to address forest health in the recent \npast. As many will recall, an emergency timber salvage rider was \nattached to and signed into law by President Clinton as part of the \n1995 rescissions bill, legislation supposedly designed to reduce \nFederal expenditures. The salvage rider was extremely controversial, \nand my constituents were very concerned about its implementation in \nterms of its fiscal cost, the loss of critical wildlife habitat and \nendangered species, and the precedent that it set for lawmaking and the \nseparation of powers in this country. The salvage rider suspended the \nEndangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the \nNational Forest Management Act, and ``all other applicable Federal \nenvironmental and natural resource laws,'' such as the Clean Water Act.\n  I opposed the rider because it was too restrictive in scope. The \npublic was blocked from the legal process through which decisions \naffecting their national forests are made. All sales under the salvage \nrider were exempt from the administrative appeal process, and judicial \nreview was severely limited to sales deemed ``arbitrary and \ncapricious.''\n  So I think it is wise to be careful in crafting this legislation, \nlest we risk taking too extreme a step in our efforts to address forest \nhealth. I agree that the Congress should enact legislation to protect \nour Nation's forests from catastrophic wildlife and disease. Overall, I \nthink that the substitute offered for title I of the bill by Senators \nCochran, Feinstein, Wyden, Daschle and others, is an improvement over \nthe underlying bill. I have also supported a number of amendments to \ntry to narrow the bill's scope and improve its provisions. It is my \nhope that the conferees will adhere to the provisions approved by the \nSenate when they develop a final bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering \nlegislation that will go a long way toward reducing the fire risk to \ncommunities throughout the western United States. The Senate is set to \npass bipartisan legislation that authorizes federal land managers to \ntreat up to 20 million acres of at-risk public lands while empowering \ncommunities with the resources and tools to protect lives and property.\n  The catastrophic fires in California are only the most recent \ndemonstration of how the Forest Service, state and local communities, \nand private landowners must actively manage the Nation's forestlands. \nIn South Dakota, fires have endangered the communities of Deadwood and \nKeystone in recent years, burning nearly one out of every 10 acres of \nthe Black Hills National Forest. I am very supportive of the bipartisan \nresponse of the U.S. Senate toward passing aggressive forest \nlegislation.\n  During the last 2 years, the Congress has debated and discussed the \nneed to actively manage our forestlands, with particular emphasis \ntoward protecting the wildland-urban interface, home to millions of \nindividuals and hundreds of communities. The Black Hills is a stark \nexample of interface and intermix communities, with a patchwork of \nprivate landowners scattered through the 1.3 million acre forest. \nPublic land managers and communities need the tools and resources to \nreduce fire risk, restore forest ecosystems to a more natural balance \nand protect a vitally important renewable resource. It is overdue--\noverdue to end the debate and pass legislation.\n  I believe that the agreement crafted today will address many of the \nchallenges facing public forestlands. There has been a great deal of \ndebate from those on both sides of the spectrum as to the shortcomings \nand compromises made to craft the Senate bill. I agree that the bill is \nnot perfect, but in\n\n[[Page S13634]]\n\ncrafting the compromise agreement, the Senate has put forward a \nbipartisan proposal that will enhance the long-term health and \nsustainability of forestlands.\n  The Senate plan authorizes fuel reduction projects on up to twenty \nmillion acres of National Forest System lands and enhances local \nparticipation. In the plan, communities can develop ``community \nwildfire protection plans'' to identify areas for hazardous fuel \nreduction and other treatments necessary to protect the community from \nwildfire. The collaborative process established in the Senate bill will \nidentify and prioritize fuel treatments and recommend the types and \nmethods of projects on federal and non-federal lands. This provision is \na key feature that empowers local communities to craft the proper \nresponse to the threat of wildland fire specific to their local areas.\n  The plan put forward today will allow the Forest Service to focus on \nits core mission of managing our forest for multiple uses and ease the \ncrush of bureaucratic and administrative appeals. This fall during a \ntour of the Black Hills, I witnessed the progress made from recent fuel \nreduction projects thinning insect ravaged trees, and believe more \nshould be done to reduce fire risk throughout the West. I will vote for \nthe Senate compromise because it will finally replace endless talk with \nconstructive action. I encourage the House of Representatives to join \nthe administration in supporting the Senate bill and quickly passing \nthis important and historic plan.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we have all heard the expression many \ntimes--``A picture is worth a thousand words.'' If that is so, I don't \nthink there is any question that the pictures of the wildfires in \nCalifornia are speaking volumes and they have had a dramatic impact on \nall of the us in the Congress and around the country .The fires \ncontinue to burn out West, and the toll continues to mount. The amount \nof forest land up in flames, the homes destroyed, the lives lost and \nthe people forever changed by what they have experienced will never be \nknown. One thing that is very clear, however, is the importance of \ntaking every possible step to ensure that we minimize this kind of \nfrightening destruction in the future.\n  It is bad enough that we have had to witness the devastation in \nCalifornia--and I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to express \nour appreciation and our gratitude to the brave people who are fighting \nthe fires there without regard for their own safety. They are true \nAmerican heroes, and we will be keeping them in our prayers.\n  Take that feeling that comes from seeing all that destruction and \ndespair in California and imagine that you were seeing the reality of a \nthreat that faces you every day of your life. Imagine you wake up every \nday filled with the fear of knowing that your home, your job, your \nfamily, your heritage, and your community could be wiped out in a \nheartbeat. Imagine the commitment you would have to protecting your \nfamily and your cherished possessions, only to be told that you can't \ndo much about it because somebody, far away, whose home is not facing \nthe same kind of threat has decided you aren't worth the effort.\n  You might think I am exaggerating the problem, but the fact is there \nare more than 100 million acres of Federal forests lands that now exist \nunder an unnaturally high risk of catastrophic wildfires and large \nscale insect and disease outbreaks because of unhealthy forest \nconditions.\n  For years now, we have been trying everything we can to reduce the \nrisk and make our forests safer and more fire resilient. Every time we \nhave tried, we have had the same response: more environmental reviews, \nmore litigation, and more trees that increase instead of reduce the \nthreat to the land around them.\n  We now have the images to confirm that our concerns were not fairy \ntales. We were not just speaking as alarmists, but as people faced with \na very real threat.\n  This situation is particularly acute in western forests where more \nthan 60 years of aggressive fire suppression programs have removed fire \nas a mitigating factor in maintaining forest health. As a result of \nthese well-meaning efforts, many of our forests suffer from an \nunnatural accumulation of vegetation on the forest floors. Dense \nundergrowth, combined with increasingly taller layers of intermediate \nvegetation have turned western forests into deadly time bombs.\n  Unlike healthy fires of the past that thinned out the underbrush and \nleft the large trees to grow larger, modern wildfires quickly climb the \ndense vegetation like a ladder until they top out at the uppermost, or \ncrown, level of the forest and race out of control as catastrophic \nfires. Because of their high speed and intense heat, these ``crown \nfires'' leave an almost sterile environment in their wake. After a \ncrown fire, nothing is left behind; no trees, no wildlife, and no \nhabitat to speak of--with few microorganisms left to rebuild the soil.\n  Vegetation manipulation, including timber harvest, is therefore \nnecessary to restore our forests, particularly in the West, to \nconditions that are more resistant to catastrophic disturbances and \nthat are within acceptable ranges of variability. Scientific studies, \nincluding the Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project, SNEP, report, state that \ntimber harvest is a tool that can be used to enhance overall forest \nresilience to disturbance. The SNEP report states, for example, that \n``logging can serve as a tool to help reduce fire hazard when slash is \ntreated and treatments are maintained.'' If conducted on a large enough \nscale and in a controlled manner, timber harvests can restore our \nnational forests to a point where fire can be returned as a healthy \npart of the environment.\n  However, any proposal that prohibits all forms of commercial timber \nharvest, regardless of the objective, indiscriminately removes an \nefficient and valuable tool from land managers for restoring forest \nconditions to a more resilient and sustainable state.\n  I am tired of sawmills and timber harvesting being seen as ogres. I \nhad a brainstorming session with employees of Wyoming Sawmills and \ntalked about healthy forests. I found them all to be concerned people \nwho can increase the amount of expertise that is used in forest \nmanagement and can do it in a way that helps our forest managers save \nmoney. These employees showed me what can be done with scrub trees in \nmaking innovative composite construction housing materials. I am \ntalking about using small trees and stems that were once considered \njunk trees and were stacked in the forests and burned.\n  Using the innovative approach developed by Wyoming Sawmills employees \nis good stewardship. It would be wrong to accuse them of wanting to \nclear cut the forests. They know what healthy thinning is, and they \nknow what a forest should look like. They know that their livelihood \nrelies on good practices.\n  So far we have been lucky in that some of our most dangerous areas in \nWyoming have not yet caught fire. One area I am particularly concerned \nabout is just east of Cody on Wyoming's Shoshone National Forest. It \nlies just next to Yellowstone National Park. It provides crucial \nhabitat to wolves, grizzlies, whooping cranes, elk, bison, mule deer \nand other animals that spend part of their lives in Yellowstone \nNational Park. The area is also home to a very severe pine beetle \ninfestation that threatens to ignite and cause extreme damage to the \npark, the forest and surrounding communities.\n  Other areas in Wyoming have not been as fortunate. I heard a report \njust a few weeks ago that a number of significant Native American \narcheological sites no longer exist in Wyoming's Wind River Mountains. \nWhen a fire swept through them earlier this year, it didn't just \ndestroy habitat, but it also took some of the last remaining examples \nof wikiups and wooden sheep traps that were built by Wyoming's \nSheepeater Indians. Their handiwork that reflected their place in our \nhistory is now gone and only exists in a few pictures that were \nfortunately taken before the fires swept it all away.\n  For me, this is an issue that has its roots back in the days when I \nwas a Boy Scout. At the time, I was working on one of the requirements \nfor the rank of First Class that had to be reached if I were to earn my \nEagle Scout Award. To be successful, I had to start a campfire with no \nmore than two matches. I got to be very good at starting campfires and \nwas well known for winning\n\n[[Page S13635]]\n\nwater boiling contests at scout camporees. There are a number of tricks \npeople develop in starting campfires, and I had my own system that \nhelped me win, but no matter who you are or what your trick might be, \nthere are three basic elements to every fire: oxygen, fuel, and heat.\n  Oxygen comes from the air and is readily available. Fuel is found in \nthe wood, particularly dry wood that burns easily when enough heat is \napplied. Heat comes from a spark, a match, or possibly just friction. \nThe best way to apply enough heat to start a successful campfire is to \nproperly organize the wood in a way that allows the flames to climb up \nfrom the bottom of the firepit where you put the smaller, quick-burning \nsticks and tinder--to the larger, longer burning logs in much the same \nway as someone would climb a ladder, one rung at a time.\n  To start a successful fire, I began by carefully putting my wood \nshavings at the bottom of the fire--this would be my light tinder or \nfirst rung of the fire ladder. I then built a small tee-pee of sticks \nover my tinder as my second rung, and then added larger and larger \nsticks until I had my largest pieces of wood on top where they could \ndraw the heat from the flames of the intermediate sticks below them. If \nI did everything correctly, I could start my fire and get a can of \nwater to boil before anyone else did.\n  You might wonder what this little story of mine has to do with the \ncurrent state of our national forests.\n  If we were to head out into the forest right now, and we took a good \nlook around at the density of the ground all around us, we would see \nthat they are laid out just like the campfires I was trained to build \nand start when I was a Boy Scout. At the bottom of every forest lies a \ncollection of small, dried-out bushes, leaves and fallen bark. Over \nthis pile of tinder is the next rung of the forest fuels ladder which \nis made up of small to intermediate trees. These intermediate trees are \nthen crowded in below the larger and older trees that make up the top \nrung or crown of the forest fuels ladder.\n  This problem wasn't always as bad as it is now. There was a time when \nMother Nature and the Native Americans took care of thinning our \nforests by regularly starting wildfires. Because the fuel loads weren't \nallowed to grow as dense as they are today, the fuel ladder didn't \nreach all the way up to the big trees. Fires would burn up the tinder \nand thin out the intermediate and dead and dying trees. This promoted \nbiodiversity, kept the intensity of the forests down and, in times of \ndrought the competition for limited water resources was dramatically \nless than it is today. We now have forests that historically have had \n40 or 50 tree stems per acre that are now over 200 stems per acre. This \nis a 300-percent increase. We aren't able to use widespread fire \nanymore because of the danger it presents to homes, as you are seeing \nright now in California.\n\n   When a fire starts in forests this dense, it quickly climbs the fuel \nladder and races out of control. These crown fires are all but \nimpossible to stop. The heat generated from all rungs burning at once \nsterilizes the soil and leaves nothing but desolation in its wake. This \nis only made worse with the added factor of drought. By adding to the \nmix stands of dead trees that are as dry and volatile as the tinder on \nthe forest floor you can just imagine the threat this kind of fire \ncould have on the forests and their surrounding communities.\n   It is a much better conservation practice, therefore, to step in and \nduplicate the effect historic, healthy fires had on our forests by \nusing what is called mechanical thinning. This is a practice where our \nland management agencies can hire experienced timber companies to \nremove the dense underbrush and carry out the smaller and intermediate \ntrees, thereby leaving a forest that is healthier, more biodiverse, \nmore fire resilient and with a better mix of older and younger trees.\n   The alternative is to allow Mother Nature to step in and conduct one \nof her catastrophic clear cuts, and when Mother Nature does a clear \ncut, she doesn't respect riparian zones or raptor nesting sites, or \nhomes.\n   Clearly that is a scenario we must make every effort to prevent.\n   As we do, just imagine how you would feel if you were here today \nwhile your family was back home, living in a house that stood in the \nshadow of one of those forests that is ready to explode in a blaze of \nflames.\n   Unfortunately, you don't have to imagine what that would be like \nanymore. We have seen what it would be like in the pictures of the \nfires that continue to threaten southern California.\n   What we have to do now is work toward a goal we should all support--\nensuring no one else has to face another wildfire blazing out of \ncontrol through their homes and neighborhoods because of a policy we \ncould have but did not change.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to speak today about the need to \npass the Senate's bipartisan amendment to H.R. 1904, the Healthy \nForests Restoration Act.\n  Today there are over 190 million acres of forests at risk of \ndevastating wildfire. The situation is the result of the general \ndegradation of the health of our forests. This degradation is the \ndirect result of past poor management practices, which have resulted in \nour forests being more susceptible to disease, insect infestation, and \nhazardous fuels accumulation. These conditions have resulted in at \nleast 10 years of devastating wildfires and the reality that if we \ndon't do something to address these conditions we will see decades of \nthese devastating fires.\n  The decision we must be willing to make is to change the direction of \nmanagement, because from where I am sitting, the current method is just \nnot working, and it has not for the last 30 years.\n  Most people don't realize how much money we spend every year on \nlitigation. Last year alone, taxpayers spent $21 million just on Forest \nService litigation. And that doesn't count all the paperwork and time \nspent on trying to make every project litigation-proof. We know this \nprocess is stuck, and it's inefficient, and we're spending a lot of \nmoney foolishly, when we could instead be spending it on the ground \nimproving the health of our forests.\n  Add to that the dollars we spend on fighting fires every year, which \ncan easily reach into the billions. The costs associated with the \nsuppression of these wildfires reaches into the millions per fire, and \nthe billions annually--the cost is high partly because we have allowed \nthe health of the forests to deteriorate to such poor condition. \nHowever, the cost of fire suppression is not the only cost associated \nwith disease, insects, and wildfires. There are equally high costs \nassociated with the loss and damage of wildlife and fishery habitat, \nclean air, and problems associated with the silting of rivers and \nstreams, loss of critical infrastructure, and the loss of tourism.\n  We must not let the debate over forest health degrade into a \npolitical debate of cutting timber. There are people who simply have an \nobjection to cutting down trees, but I wonder why it's all right to \nburn them down?\n  The Forest Service timber sale program is the smallest it has been \nsince the 1940's. We are losing more trees, wildlife habitat, and \ncritical healthy watersheds to fire, disease, and insects than we \nimpact through timber sales. Yet, we continue to stand by and do \nnothing to stop the destruction.\n  The environmental community can no longer appeal and litigate every \nproject designed to remove hazardous fuels, treat disease, and \neradicate insects under the guise of protecting the habitat of fish and \nwildlife; yet turn a blind eye on the damage that insects, disease, and \nfire are doing to these same habitats.\n  We must provide the Federal land managers with the tools needed to \naddress the extreme conditions of our national forests. We must address \nthe issues associated with delays as a result of appeals and \nlitigation.\n  We have before us a bill that reflects a bipartisan effort to finally \nprovide the land managers with the necessary tools. It reflects a \nbipartisan effort to streamline the NEPA process, expedite judicial \naction, treat the wildland-urban interface along with other high risk \nareas, and address the urgent need to combat the spread of insects and \ndisease in our forests nationwide.\n  It is time for this body to set aside partisan politics and stand up \nto the public's expectation that we act responsibly and quickly pass \nthis legislation. We ought not to disappoint the\n\n[[Page S13636]]\n\npublic and we ought not to be responsible for continuing to put our \nnational forests at increasing risk.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this week, as the California wildfires \ncontinue to rage, scorching more than 720,000 acres of land, destroying \nmore than 2,600 homes, and taking the lives of at least 20 people, we \nhave learned the costs of not taking the proper steps to protect our \nvulnerable communities and forests.\n  Last April, I wrote to the President and asked him to declare three \nof our southern counties disasters areas due to bark beetle \ninfestation. There were 12 of us from both parties who asked for fuels \nreduction to ease our dangerous situation. Unfortunately, that disaster \ndesignation did not happen.\n  In July, I introduced a bill with Senator Leahy, the Forestry and \nCommunity Assistance Act, that would have helped protect our forest and \ncommunities from wildfires. The bill would have authorized funding for \nwildfire prevention projects including thinning, cutting of dense \nunderbrush, and prescribed burning.\n  The Leahy-Boxer bill would have authorized $1.25 billion for wildfire \nprevention projects on National Forest System lands, $1.25 billion for \nprojects on Bureau of Land Management lands, and $2.5 billion for \nprojects on tribal, private and State lands. The bill would have \nrequired that 85 percent of the funds be given to wildfire prevention \nprojects within one-half mile of communities that are at risk for \nwildfire, and projects that are necessary to protect a municipal water \nsupply system.\n  That is the bill I wish we were passing today. We are passing a bill \nthat is far weaker, but it is better than the House bill.\n  It explicitly authorizes projects that protect at-risk communities, \nwatersheds, and lands with insect infestation.\n  The bill also provides that 50 percent of the funds authorized for \nwildfire prevention projects be used toward at-risk communities. \nUnfortunately, my amendment to increase this percentage to 70 percent \nfailed.\n  Of particular significance to California, the bill directs the \nDepartment of Agriculture to conduct a program encouraging systematic \ninformation gathering on insect pests that have caused large-scale \ndamage to forests, including the bark beetle.\n  Also, I am pleased that the Senate passed my amendment requiring the \nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, to \nmonitor the long-term health conditions of firefighters who fought in \nmy area declared a Federal disaster.\n  I am also pleased the Senate passed my amendment requiring that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, monitor the emission of hazardous \npollutants in the air in disaster areas. The provision requires that \nthe EPA accomplish this by providing each of its regional offices with \na mobile air pollution monitoring network, and publish its findings on \nEPA's website daily until the danger has subsided.\n\n  This bill could have been made better if we had passed several \namendments that I supported. These included: a Bingaman amendment to \nallow the Forest Service to borrow funds from the General Treasury for \nfirefighting once its funds have been expended. Currently, once the \nForest service depletes its funds, it must borrow from other accounts \nwithin the Forest Service's budget to pay for firefighting; the Murray \namendment to ensure old growth trees on all lands are protected; the \nCantwell amendment to require that in undertaking efforts to prevent \nwildfires, all possible alternatives be considered; and the Harkin \namendment to sunset the legislation after 5 years, allowing Congress to \nreview how well the program is doing.\n  Despite the fact that I wanted a stronger bill, I have decided to \nsupport the bill before us, because, while not perfect, it will help \nmake our communities safer.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Senator McCain and I intended to offer an \namendment to H.R. 1904 to establish a permanent revolving fund to \naddress the annual problem of funding emergency fire suppression \nneeds--a problem that essentially robs funds from the very fuel \nreduction projects H.R. 1904 is designed to promote.\n  When I was in Montana this summer, I visited with some of the \nfirefighting teams near Glacier National Park. It was absolutely \namazing to see the organization and coordination that goes into \nfighting these fires. We had folks from Federal, State, and local \nagencies and local volunteer fire departments; local loggers; teams \nfrom Australia and New Zealand; and private contractors all working \ntogether to protect lives and property.\n  I can't tell you how impressed and overwhelmed I was by the \ndedication and professionalism of the firefighters on the ground. These \nfirst-rate men and women earned the deep respect and gratitude of the \nresidents of many Montana cities and towns, particularly in West \nGlacier. I know that my colleagues saw much the same thing in their \nstates, and we are all seeing it now in California.\n  But, this extraordinary and superior fire-fighting effort costs \nmoney--$305 million spent in Montana alone this year to fight the fires \nthat blanketed my state. And as is too often the case, the Forest \nService and Bureau of Land Management were once again strapped for fire \nsuppression funds during extreme fire conditions. They had to borrow \nfrom other program funds to get the job done in Montana and other \nstates this summer.\n  The Forest Service and Department of Interior borrowed $860 million \nlast fiscal year to pay fire suppression costs. While recent \nsupplemental funding for the agencies will repay some of these \naccounts, the agencies will still be short $170 million. Some Forest \nService accounts will not be repaid, including accounts to rehabilitate \nburned areas. This is enormously counterproductive. And, it wastes \nscarce federal resources. This state of affairs cannot continue.\n  We have to be smarter about managing this situation in the future. \nSince we can't accurately predict wildfire suppression needs each year \nwhen we provide for appropriations, we need a special funding strategy \nto account for extreme fire years. The alternative is extreme \ndisruption to Forest Service and Interior budgets and day-to-day \nresponsibilities, important work deferred or canceled, and jobs lost.\n  Senator McCain and I believe we have a responsible solution that is a \nfair, reasoned, and balanced approach to the problem. It's time we all \nfaced up to our responsibilities to provide adequate and stable funding \nto the Forest Service and Interior for fire suppression efforts, while \nensuring minimal disruption to their current programs and projects and \nencouraging these agencies to keep their costs under control.\n\n  However, Senator McCain and I will not offer our amendment because \nSenator Craig and others have agreed to work with us, and with Senator \nBingaman, to find a solution to this problem as soon as possible. I \nwould like to see H.R. 1904 pass quickly, and I have no interest in \ndelay. I appreciate Senator Craig's recognition of the problem and \ncommitment to address it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I commend Senator Bingaman for his thorough analysis of \nthe budgetary impediments to effective federal action to protect \ncommunities and our public forest lands from catastrophic wildfire. I \nam in agreement with many of the points that he makes because of what I \nhave learned from numerous people in Arizona who have extensive hands-\non experience with forest management and wildfire issues.\n  With the compromise reached on Title I of 1904, we struggled to find \ncommon ground in our understanding of the nature of the problem in each \nof our states. However, the budget issues and inadequacy of funding \nthat Senator Bingaman has discussed has not been addressed in this \nlegislation. The practice of borrowing program funds to fight wildfires \nwill continue to undermine our efforts to increase protection of \ncommunities in the wildland-urban interface and enhance forest health \non at-risk public lands.\n  Everyone involved in these endeavors at the federal, state, and local \nlevels agrees that bankrupting essential program activities until they \ncan be replenished at a later time with a supplemental is self-\ndefeating. There is no disagreement on this score, it's simply a matter \nof putting the right funding mechanism in place to accomplish the \nobjective of preserving the integrity of the forest land management \nagencies' programs.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Craig and Senator Bingaman have\n\n[[Page S13637]]\n\ncome to an agreement that the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee will carefully consider this issue early next year. I look \nforward to following these proceedings to develop effective measures to \nensure that the federal agencies have adequate resources to maintain \nessential program activities as well as fighting wildfires that occur \nwith increasing frequency. I thank my colleagues for their commitment \nto addressing this widely recognized budgeting problem to allow our \nmutual community protection and forest restoration objectives to be \nachieved.\n  Mr. CRAIG. As I told Senator Bingaman, I agree that this is a serious \nissue and I have been working hard on resolving the problem myself. I \nappreciate the concerns of Senator Baucus and McCain and thank them for \nnot offering their amendment. This issue will be my top priority once \nwe finish the healthy forests bill. I pledge to work with Senator \nBaucus, Senator McCain and the Chairmen and Ranking Members of all the \nrelevant committees to find a workable solution.\n  Mr. BURNS. I join my colleagues in noting the magnitude and urgency \nof this issue. As chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, \nwhich funds wildland firefighting, I know firsthand how disruptive this \nborrowing cycle can be on federal agencies. Public lands states like my \nhome State of Montana are at risk for both ends of the fire disaster \nwhen accounts are not repaid quickly. As we work toward a solution, I \nbelieve it is important that we work with the Administration and the \nrelevant Congressional Committees such as the Budget Committee. We \nshould also address the very real concern that firefighting costs \ncontinue to escalate year after year. Congress needs to better \nunderstand why costs per acre continue to rise and how we can reverse \nthat cycle. Efforts by the Wildland Fire Leadership Council and their \ncurrent review of firefighting costs can help us with this challenge \nand we can use their knowledge as a foundation for our future policy \ndecisions.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I agree with the chairman of the Interior \nappropriations subcommittee, Senator Burns, that this yearly problem of \nborrowing and paying back must be addressed. Those discussions need to \ninclude the relevant authorizing committees, the Budget Committee, and, \nof sources, the Appropriations Committee. As the Ranking Member of the \nInterior subcommittee, I would be pleased to work with my colleagues \nany way that I can.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank all of my colleagues for their commitment to this \nissue.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank all Senators who worked hard to \nput this bill together. They have all been mentioned by each other a \nnumber of times. I am grateful for everybody's contribution to this \neffort. It has truly been a joint effort on both sides of the aisle, \nacross committee lines, across regional lines, and for that I am very \ngrateful. I think we can all be proud of the work the Senate has done \nthis evening.\n  I also have to mention the work of our staff members. Our great staff \nincludes Hunt Shipman, who is staff director in the Agriculture \nCommittee, and the following staff members who worked hard on this \nproject: Lance Kotschwar, West Higginbotham, Doug MacCleery, Graham \nHarper, Dave Johnson, as well as the staff of the Senate Energy \nCommittee under the chairmanship of Senator Domenici.\n  I hope all Senators will support the final passage of the bill.\n  I ask for third reading of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is agreeing to the committee \namendment in the nature of a substitute.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \ncommittee amendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S13638]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1966\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with \nrespect to the DeWine amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order has been called for, and the \nDeWine amendment is once again the pending question.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, Members of the Senate, there are very few \ntimes when we have the opportunity to come to the floor when we know \nthat the vote we will cast will save hundreds of thousands of lives.\n  The amendment we have before us will do that. I am very pleased that \nwe have reached an agreement on the amendment that Senator Durbin and I \nhave offered to provide an additional $289 million for the fight \nagainst global AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.\n  Mr. President, this money will clearly save lives. Adopting this \namendment is the right thing to do, and I want to thank so many of my \ncolleagues for their support and their own efforts to fight the global \nAIDS epidemic.\n  First, I thank my colleague from Illinois, and the cosponsor of this \namendment, Senator Durbin. Senator Durbin and I have traveled to Haiti. \nI have had the opportunity to watch Senator Durbin hold children who \nhave HIV who are very sick. I have seen how compassionate he is, how \nmuch he cares.\n  This is the third time Senator Durbin and I have come to the floor \nand offered amendments to add additional funds to this fight against \nAIDS. I thank my colleague for his great work.\n  I thank my colleague, the majority leader, Senator Bill Frist. No one \nknows more about this problem. No one has done more about this problem. \nMany of us had the opportunity, this past August, to go on a trip with \nSenator Frist to Africa. It was an educational trip for all of us.\n  Bill Frist is a teacher. He is a doctor. He is a leader. He has done \na great deal, and I salute him for his great work.\n  I also thank Senator Rick Santorum, who is a compassionate individual \nand who is passionate about this cause. It was Rick Santorum who first \nbegan working with the leadership and who first suggested, frankly, the \nformula that is in front of us today; he came up with these numbers. I \nsalute him for his work.\n  I thank Senator Mitch McConnell and Senator Leahy for bringing a very \ngood bill to the floor. This bill will do a tremendous amount of good \naround the world.\n  It truly is an instrument of our foreign policy and also provides the \nresources to help save many, many lives around the world.\n  Finally, let me thank Senator Ted Stevens for his leadership in this \narea. We would not be on the floor tonight with this matter worked out \nwithout Ted Stevens' work. Let me say, for the Members of the Senate \nwho do not already know this, this is not the first time that Ted \nStevens has come forward and provided the necessary money to deal with \nthe AIDS problem. This is, to my knowledge at least, the third time \nthat I am personally aware of that Senator Stevens has done so. Ted \nStevens is someone who is compassionate and who cares. I salute him and \nthank him.\n  I thank my colleagues for bringing us to this point. It is \nsignificant that today in Columbus, OH, the President of the United \nStates at noon today spoke very eloquently about this problem. He has \ntaken the lead in our efforts to deal with really one of the greatest \ntragedies of our era. He, once again, spoke about the problem of AIDS. \nMore importantly, he spoke about our obligation and our duty. This is \nwhat he said in Ohio today:\n\n       We have duties in this world. When we see disease and \n     starvation and hopeless poverty, America will not turn away. \n     This great, mighty nation is leading the world in confronting \n     a terrible disease on the continent of Africa. This nation is \n     bringing the healing power of medicine to millions of men and \n     women and children now suffering with AIDS. This great land \n     is leading the world in this incredibly important work of \n     human rescue.\n\n  I salute President George Bush for his vision and his leadership in \nthis area.\n  I conclude by thanking everyone for their good work. This is the \nright thing to do. This will save lives. We will never know the people \nwhose lives this amendment will save. We will not meet them. We will \nnot see them. But we can rest assured, there will be many, many lives \nsaved by what we do tonight.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support the pending \namendment by Senator DeWine to add an additional $289 million to our \nefforts to combat HIV/AIDS. I am pleased to be able to support this \namendment because of the agreement reached to offset this critical \nspending need within the existing budget.\n  This funding could not come at a more crucial time, as the continent \nof Africa faces a most severe crisis. I agree with the President that \n``in the face of preventable death and suffering, we have a moral duty \nto act.'' The United States is beginning to do its part in the battle \nagainst HIV/AIDS. In this bill alone, we are providing nearly $1.4 \nbillion for the President's new HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria \ninitiative, $250 million of which is available for a contribution to \nthe global fund. The bill also provides $150 million for the \nPresident's International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative \nand $700 million for the Global AIDS Initiative. With this amendment, \nwe will be committing over $2.2 billion toward the global fight against \nAIDS.\n  Just 2 short years ago, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \nand Malaria was simply an idea that was endorsed by President Bush and \nU.N. Secretary General Annan. As we stand here today, it has become a \nreality. President Bush pledged the founding $200 million for the \nglobal fund, and our pledge has since risen to $1.6 billion out of the \ntotal of $4.7 billion in pledges made to date worldwide. The United \nStates has already provided $623 million to the global fund, more than \none-third of total contributions to date. While I am proud of our \ncommitment, I am also disturbed by the lack of commitment from other \nnations. This is not just a U.S. issue, it is a global issue, and it \nrequires a global response.\n  U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan told the Security Council that:\n\n     by overwhelming the continent's [Africa's] health and social \n     services, by creating millions of orphans, and by decimating \n     health workers and teachers, AIDS is causing social and \n     economic crises which in turn threaten political stability . \n     . . in already unstable societies, this cocktail of disasters \n     is a sure recipe for more conflict. And conflict, in turn, \n     provides fertile ground for further infections.\n\n  The world recognizes that this has become more than a disease facing \nthe people of Africa, it has become a threat to national security and \nregional stability. This is a serious epidemic in Africa, capable of \ntoppling foreign governments, touching off ethnic wars and undoing \ndecades of work in developing free-market democracies abroad. In \naddition, as the U.S. becomes more and more involved in the fight \nagainst AIDS, it must also recognize that the methods of contraction \nneed to be addressed on a broader level. Our leadership on AIDS needs \nto be matched by our efforts on education, gender discrimination, \neconomic development, and conflict resolution.\n  These are all reasons why I have supported providing the countries of \nsub-Saharan Africa with the means to provide its people with education, \nprevention techniques, and health care. In May, I was proud to support \npassage of H.R. 1298, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.\n  This comprehensive program has the potential over the next decade to \nprovide life-extending drugs to at least 2 million infected people, \ngive human care to 10 million HIV sufferers and AIDS orphans, and \nprevent 7 million new HIV infections. The overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport for that legislation demonstrates the priority of this need, \nand with this amendment we take an important step toward meeting the \nU.S. commitment under that bill. The millions of people in sub-Saharan \nAfrica and around the globe affected by AIDS deserve no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 1966.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n\n[[Page S13639]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2047\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. Stabenow, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2047.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n          (Purpose: To increase assistance to combat HIV/AIDS)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. For an additional amount for the Global AIDS \n     Initiative, $589,700,000, to remain available until September \n     30, 2006, for programs for the prevention, treatment, and \n     control of, and research on, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and \n     malaria, which may include additional contributions to the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, first, I commend Senator DeWine of Ohio. \nHe is an extraordinary person and an extraordinary colleague. It has \nbeen my good fortune to work with him on an amendment relative to this \nissue of global AIDS. Senator DeWine, by my rough calculation between \nus, I think we may have added up to $400 million to the fight on global \nAIDS just with the passage of the last amendment and the two previous \nefforts, and I commend him. He has worked ceaselessly to get this done, \nand he has done so well. I was happy to add my name to his effort. He \ndid all the work. He deserves all the credit.\n  I ask my colleagues now to consider this amendment. For every dollar \nthe last amendment will use to save a life in the war against AIDS, \nmalaria, and tuberculosis, this amendment will provide $2. For every \nlife that can be saved with Senator DeWine's amendment, this amendment, \nif passed, will add two more lives that will be saved.\n  I will tell my colleagues what we do. What we take is the President's \npromise of $15 billion over 5 years, which comes out obviously to $3 \nbillion per year, and make that our goal in terms of this \nappropriations bill.\n  That means adding, to the amount that we just passed, some $589 \nmillion. That will bring us to the $3 billion figure that was promised \nby the President, that was endorsed by the Senate, and, frankly, we \nwill keep our word and our promise to the world. More important, this \nmoney is needed, and it is needed desperately right now.\n  Some have argued that there are a lot of sick people in this world \nbut they can't absorb all this money, these hundreds of millions of \ndollars that have been sent their way. I urge those who make that \nstatement to consider the following.\n  CARE is one of the finest charities in the world. My family supports \nit and many of us do as individuals. Peter Bell, who is the head of \nCARE, sent a letter to President Bush just a few weeks ago. This is \nwhat he said about the need for full funding to $3 billion:\n\n       There are hundreds of organizations, secular and faith-\n     based, ready to expand their response to the HIV/AIDS \n     pandemic. CARE, for example, has spent 15 years fighting HIV/\n     AIDS, working with host governments, international \n     organizations, and local partners. We currently support HIV/\n     AIDS projects in 37 countries around the world with a total \n     annual budget of almost $15 million. If funding were made \n     available, we would double or triple the size of our HIV/AIDS \n     programming. I believe the same is true for many other AIDS \n     organizations.\n\n  That is what Peter Bell wrote to President Bush from the CARE \norganization just a few weeks ago.\n  Some of you are familiar with the organization World Vision. You \ncan't watch one of their programs without having your heart torn to \nshreds. These wonderful people involved in World Vision around the \nworld are working day and night with the most poor people on Earth. \nRichard Sterns sent a letter to President Bush just a few weeks ago. \nThis is what he said:\n\n       Let me assure you, Mr. President, we have the capacity to \n     make a difference now and build for the future. The \n     absorptive capacity is made up of a number of different \n     players, national and local governments, community based \n     organizations, a strong and widespread faith community, and \n     international NGOs.\n\n  He then closed by saying this:\n\n       It is my opinion that within these various delivery \n     systems, $3 billion in aid can be effectively delivered to \n     those who desperately need it now.\n\n  Richard Sterns, president of World Vision.\n  This Senate has considered this issue. In July, 78 Members of this \nbody--78 of us--voted in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution for full \nfunding up to the authorized level of $3 billion for AIDS. We said in \nthat sense-of-the-Senate resolution we would stand by that number, even \nif it meant exceeding the levels authorized in the budget.\n  I can go through my entire statement, but the hour is late. I will \nnot do that to you because I think you all understand it. Let me just \nsay, if there is an argument that the money I am asking for is outside \nof the appropriations bill, let me remind you, the amendment we just \npassed was outside of the appropriations bill as well.\n  If there is an argument that we really don't owe $3 billion, let me \ntell you, the world thought our pledge was $3 billion. These heads of \ncharitable organizations around the world are telling us that is what \nthey understood the American commitment to be, and we are almost $600 \nmillion short this year.\n\n  Let me also add, if the argument is to be made that this money cannot \nbe spent, the experts in the field, the men and women who risk their \nlives every day in the poorest places on Earth, have told us over and \nover again they need the money and they need it now.\n  I close with a reference to something I have been thinking about for \nsome time. There was a movie which most of us have seen called \n``Schindler's List.'' You will never forget that movie as long as you \nlive. And you remember that this man in Nazi Germany did everything he \ncould think of--trickery, smooth talking, and guile--to save the lives \nof Jewish people destined for concentration camps. His success was so\n\n[[Page S13640]]\n\ngreat that at the end of the movie, they showed in that factory the \nhundreds, maybe thousands, of people whose lives had been saved.\n  As he was about to leave them when the war was over, there was that \nfinal scene which none of us can forget. They turned to Schindler to \ngive him a ring, a gold ring made out of the fillings of their teeth, \nin appreciation for what he had done to save so many lives. He broke \ndown in tears, and he said in that movie:\n\n       I should have done more. I should have done more.\n\n  That is where we are tonight. The DeWine amendment has moved us \npositively toward almost $300 million in this fight against global \nAIDS. But we should do more, and we can do more.\n  My colleagues, please, stand together tonight with our promise from \nour President on this global AIDS epidemic, a bipartisan promise that \nbrings out the best in America. Let us leave with this bill saying: We \nkept our word. We stand behind you and we are prepared to lead the \nworld. Let us provide the money and never have to say at some future \ntime: We should have done more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say for the information of all Senators, the \nSenator from Nevada and I have been working on how to finish up \ntonight. I am not going to ask consent yet, but the plan is as follows: \nTo stack three votes, first a vote on or in relation to the Durbin \namendment, then on or in relation to the Bingaman amendment, then on or \nin relation to the Feinstein amendment. After that, we expect to be \nable to handle everything else by voice vote, including final passage.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that that be the case, there be no \nlimitations as to time on that but there be no--no limitations as to \ntime.\n  I would ask if my friend would modify his request. I have spoken to \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Durbin, and Senator Bingaman. If we could \nhave it in inverse order, Senator Feinstein first, then Senator Durbin, \nand then Senator Bingaman?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. REID. Would that be OK with the Senator?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend that seems fine.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object--and I shall not object--\nthere was a discussion you may recall. I also suggested that when we do \nthat, the penultimate vote and the final vote be 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. That is very reasonable. I so modify my request. I hope the \nmanager does on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I also congratulate the Senator from \nOhio as well as the majority leader for the tremendous work they have \ndone on this issue in crafting a compromise that will keep within the \nbudget. This DeWine amendment did keep within the budget and meeting \nthe need that is out there in Africa and the Caribbean to address the \ngreatest health crisis that maybe the world has seen.\n  I respect the Senator from Illinois. I share his passion for trying \nto do more. But I think we need to look at what, No. 1, our commitment \nwas and, No. 2, what is the best and most prudent way of going about \nbuilding the capacity, meeting the needs in a responsible way to all \ninvolved.\n  Let me talk first about what our commitment is. The commitment by the \nPresident, when he announced his plan--this was before the bill passed \nthe House and Senate and was signed by the President--was to spend $15 \nbillion over the next 5 years and ramp up as capacity would ramp up \nwithin those 12 countries in Africa and the 2 in the Caribbean. As \ncapacity would ramp up, we would ramp up funding.\n  That makes sense for those who have traveled to Africa. I had the \nopportunity to meet with Ambassador Tobias today, who is in charge of \nthe AIDS effort in Africa. I also had a chance to meet with Richard \nFeachem, who is in charge of the Global Fund, this afternoon.\n  I can tell you that while, yes, there are lots of organizations out \nthere, to suggest there is the capacity at this point to take on the \namount of money that is being contemplated here I think overstates the \ncase, at least according to the experts, the people who are in charge \nof distributing this money. In fact, the administration makes a very \nstrong argument that the money that was added to the DeWine amendment \nmay not be able to be spent within the fiscal year. But we believe if \nthere is a potential that that could happen, we would rather put a \nlittle bit more money there, just in case they do find that there can \nbe some sort of expansion beyond what they, at this point in time, \nbelieve is possible.\n  We provided that cushion for the administration, and $300 million is \nnot a small cushion. It is a fairly substantial increase in the amount \nof bilateral aid that is going to be provided by the United States--\nabout a 15-percent increase.\n  I suggest that we provide that cushion which allows for the \nexpectations of the administration to be on the low side, and be able \nto grow, if necessary. Obviously, we don't want them to spend money if \nit is not going to be spent efficiently; it will not really help. We \nwant them to be good stewards of the funds and be able to spend that \nmoney to provide treatment, provide prevention, and provide it for \ntaking care of both the old and dying and those who are near death and \nthose who are young.\n  I suggest that the DeWine amendment accomplishes everything the \nSenator from Illinois wants to accomplish. The reason, by the way, it \naccomplishes what the authorization says is because there is now $2 \nbillion for bilateral aid in the appropriations process this year. That \nis what the authorization says--$2 billion in bilateral aid, and up to \n$1 billion in matching from the Global Fund.\n  Let us look at the Global Fund. I just met the Director of the Global \nFund. The contribution pledged for next year, as of this moment, is \n$100 million which was announced yesterday. So it is up to about $770 \nmillion. In the appropriations bill that we are going to pass, it is \n$400 million. Actually, it slightly exceeds the pledge that is in the \nauthorization. For every two dollars of international aid there would \nbe one dollar of U.S. aid. If you take roughly $800 million, it is \nactually less because $400 million meets the pledge that we said we \nwould provide in the authorization.\n  To make the suggestion that we haven't in principle met it is just \nnot right.\n  That is how we came up with the number that was in Senator DeWine's \namendment that was cosponsored by Senator Durbin. We have met our \nobligations to the Global Fund. We have met our obligations in the \nauthorization to provide $2 billion in bilateral aid even though the \nadministration doesn't believe we can spend $2 billion efficiently and \neffectively.\n  I think we have pushed the envelope. The administration only pledged \n$200 million to the Global Fund. We have $400 million. We doubled the \ncommitment that the administration said they would provide. We doubled \nit because we wanted to meet expectations. We have done so.\n  I suggest that we have met our obligation for bilateral aid. We have \nmet our obligation for the Global Fund.\n  If, in fact, later when we get into 2004 and the Global Fund ends up \nraising more money--we have fiscal year 2005, which starts in calendar \nyear 2004--at the end of 2004, and we did provide some more money to \nincrease the match at the end of next year, a lot of money comes in \nfrom the other countries on a calendar basis. So we have an opportunity \nif we need to come up with more money to meet our match in the 2004 \ncalendar year.\n  But there is no need to further bust the budget or try to bust the \nbudget on something where we have made our commitment in the \nauthorization and exceeded the commitment that the President made when \nhe announced the $15 billion over 5 years. The President is wise. We \nwould be wise if we are going to make the $15 billion commitment. I \ndon't think anyone in this Chamber would argue that $1 spent in 2004 \nafter 4 years of building up capacity, efficiency, and effectiveness is \ngoing to be more efficiently and effectively spent than putting more \nmoney in year 1. I don't think one can make that argument. We may be \nable to\n\n[[Page S13641]]\n\nbuild capacity quickly and less efficiently and costly, but that money \nwould be used more wisely and efficiently in later years where we can \nput more money in the hands of people who get those needed drugs and \nneeded care in a much more efficient and broadly based way.\n  I think we have struck the compromise. I hope the Members of this \nChamber will know that in good faith. I appreciate what the Senator \nfrom Illinois is doing. I have great sympathy for his cause, but I \nthink we have struck the balance here and I hope this Chamber will vote \naccordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Durbin \namendment.\n  First, I thank my colleagues and friend from Illinois for his passion \nand his eloquence and his persistence over and over on the floor, \nspeaking up for those around the world who have no voice in this \nChamber and who desperately need our help.\n  I also congratulate Senator DeWine for his leadership in getting us \nup to this point.\n  We are talking about 8,500 people being killed by disease every day--\n8,500 people today, 8,500 people tomorrow, 8,500 people the next day, \nand 6,500 in Africa alone. We are seeing HIV/AIDS produce 14,000 new \ninfections every day, and 9,500 which occur in Africa.\n  If that doesn't tell us there is a sense of urgency to do all that we \ncan do, I don't know what does. When we look at the facts of the more \nthan 30 million people in Africa alone with HIV, only 50,000 have the \nmedicine they need--we hear over and over again from the organizations \nin Africa that they have the capacity; they just need the resources; \nthey just need our help.\n  There is no question when you look at the number. Less than 1 in 20 \npregnant women have access to services to prevent mother-to-child \ntransmission. The numbers are going on and on.\n  I urge colleagues to step up and support the promise that we made a \nfew months ago--the promise that we made of $3 billion a year over 5 \nyears, a total of $15 billion, and join together to send a message that \nwe understand the sense of urgency from the people around the world who \nare so desperate for our help.\n  I remember just a couple of weeks ago on the Senate floor when we \nwere talking about the Iraqi supplemental and reconstruction, I spoke \nabout delaying a portion of the reconstruction dollars because it was \nclear from all of the evidence and studies that only $6 billion to $8 \nbillion could be spent the first year. We wanted to divert some of \nthose dollars in another direction for things here at home. We were \ntold on the Senate floor that we needed to keep our full commitment, \nwhether or not the capacity was there, and that we needed to \nimmediately let them know what they had to work with so they could move \nas quickly as possible. I suggest this is no less; I believe the \ncapacity is there now.\n  The reality is we need to let the people around the world, and the \npeople of Africa and Americans who are working there desperately trying \nto make a difference and save lives, know that we in Congress will keep \nour commitment on behalf of the people of our country.\n  We are talking about a relatively small amount of dollars for saving \nliterally thousands and thousands of lives.\n  As the Senator from Illinois said, we have a responsibility to do \nwhat we can do. We don't want to be in a position of looking back when \nthe picture is clear about what has been going on and say where were we \nwhen we had the chance to save as many lives as possible.\n  The Durbin amendment needs to be passed, and it needs to be passed \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I first want to thank my colleague, the \nSenator from Ohio, for the incredible work he has done. He has been \ntireless and steadfast on this issue. I was proud to be a cosponsor of \nhis amendment.\n  I thank my colleague, the Senator from Illinois, for his passion on \nthis issue. I have the greatest respect for what he is trying to \naccomplish.\n  Today, I had an opportunity to meet with Ambassador Tobias. We talked \nabout this issue of capacity. He said he was in a warehouse--either in \nBotswana or South Africa--but he was in a warehouse. The warehouse was \nfull of antiretroviral drugs. They were close to their expiration date. \nThese drugs had been donated by a company. The drugs were there but \nthey didn't have the capacity to get them all out. Those drugs were in \ndanger of being wasted.\n\n  We were in South Africa this summer. I was with Leader Frist and \nothers and dealing with the issue of AIDS. There are 5 million people \nin South Africa who are HIV positive. There are approximately 20,000 \nreceiving antiretroviral treatment.\n  We visited Anglo Gold, one of the largest gold mines in the world. \nThey made a commitment to each and every employee to cover the full \ncost of treatment. Money is not the issue. They believe they have \nperhaps 30,000 employees HIV positive. They were hoping to get in the \nfirst year 10 percent, 3,000 to come in for treatment. They have a \nthird of that and less to date. They said to us: The money is not the \nissue; we do not have the capacity to do it right. You have to do it \nright.\n  I will fight very hard to keep our commitment of $15 billion over 5 \nyears. As my colleague from Pennsylvania said, we have met our \ncommitment that is in the authorization of $2 billion by the DeWine \namendment. We have met our commitment to the global fund. We are \nmeeting our commitment. We are doing it the right way. We are going to \nhave to ramp up. The needs are great.\n  In my own experience, having visited Africa, the capacity is not \nthere. You simply cannot throw money at a problem. We have to do the \nright thing. We are doing the right thing by the commitments we have \nmade by supporting the DeWine amendment. I oppose the Durbin amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is interesting, before I came to the \nSenate, I recall seeing headlines saying the Congress passed an \nauthorization to do this or an authorization to do that; $100 million \nto improve the environment somewhere, authorized $1 billion to do this. \nIt was not until I got here that I realized that does not do anything. \nWe could authorize $5 trillion for polio vaccine tonight, but if we did \nnot appropriate some money, it is nothing.\n  In ``Henry IV,'' Part I--if the Senator from West Virginia were here, \nhe could set me--Part I, Act 3, Scene 1, we all remember that scene \nvery well.\n  Glyndower says to Hotspur: I can call spirits from the vasty deep.\n  Hotspur answers: Why, so can I, so can any man; But will they come \nwhen you call for them?\n  We have authorized the money and the President and everybody else had \nwonderful speeches. I commended him, praising him. He met with all the \nvarious religious leaders and everyone else and went to Africa and \ntalked about what we have promised. That was the authorization.\n  Now it is time to call for the money from the vasty deep. We can find \n$87 billion we had to send immediately to Iraq with absolutely no \nindication of whether the capacity was there to spend it when questions \nwere asked. They were never answered. Included were items such as \n$6,000 telephones that could be bought for $600 in neighboring \ncountries, and so on. But we just told them, we will build the \ncapacity.\n  What the Durbin amendment, combined with the DeWine amendment--and I \nwas a cosponsor of the DeWine amendment as I am of the Durbin \namendment--if you put them together, then we do fulfill the commitment \nthat the President of the United States very rightly said this country \nwould do.\n\n  I have traveled to Africa. I have traveled to Haiti, Vietnam, China, \nand elsewhere. I have seen how AIDS is spreading. Other Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle have seen the same. When you see that these \nadditional funds can be effectively used, we have to ramp up. In all my \ntravels, all my conversations with foreign leaders and public health \nexperts, I have never met anyone who believes the money provided by \nthis amendment could not be well spent today, not a year from now.\n  I have seen some of the vaccines that some companies donate, just \nabout at their expiration date. Then they take a full tax writeoff even \nthough it will not be used.\n\n[[Page S13642]]\n\n  Everyone who is working in the field to stop AIDS believes we need \nthe additional funds today.\n  That is why I praised the President when he promised them. That is \nwhy I will support the senior Senator from Illinois tonight to help in \ncarrying out the promise that President Bush made.\n  You cannot argue $3 billion is too much to spend effectively in \ncombating AIDS in 14 countries. That is not what the United States \nLeadership Against Aids Act says. Besides, why limit our efforts to 14 \ncountries when five times that many countries are being ravaged by \nAIDS? Why ignore the other two dozen countries in Africa? Why ignore \nRussia or China or India where AIDS is spreading out of control? India \nis going to swamp virtually everywhere else with an AIDS crisis the way \nit is spreading. China, Russia, we have strategic interests there.\n  It is a false argument to say we cannot do this. Frankly, when you \nare the wealthiest nation on Earth, the most powerful nation on Earth, \nI believe it is an immoral argument. It is not just a fact that we in \nthe United States are threatened by the spread of AIDS in other \ncountries. We actually have a chance to do something about it. We have \na chance to do something about it in countries where the yearly income \nis less than some of us have spent on an evening out with dinner, a \nshow with our spouses; actually, where a yearly income is less than we \nspend on the time it takes for us to have this debate in most places.\n  It is in the 14 countries. If we could isolate AIDS to 14 countries, \nwe should sing ``Glory, Hallelujah.'' We cannot. There are dozens of \ncountries that need help, that need to have people trained. We should \nprovide the equipment to support a national prevention and treatment \nprogram. Ask anyone who is working those countries. They will tell you.\n  To argue that we do not have the capacity is not based on fact. It is \nnot based on reality. It is not based on public health. I worry that \nargument is made because they do not want to spend the money. We are \nspending an awful lot more money to fight AIDS today than if we faced \nup to this problem two decades ago, but people did not want to. We \nwasted two decades. Twenty-five million people died in part because we \nand others failed to act. People died during that time. It is a \npopulation equal to 50 times my own State. Actually it is in population \nabout 50 times the State of the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  I commend the Senator from Illinois. I wish the White House would not \noppose this amendment. What the Senator from Illinois is trying to do \nis to call them from the deep, call up the money to back up what the \nPresident has promised. The President has been rightly praised by \nreligious leaders, by heads of state, by well-known entertainers such \nas my good friend Bono, from Ireland, for promising this money. So the \nWhite House should not stop us now that they have had the praise, now \nthat everyone has stood up and said the President was right. Now we \nshould not have the White House coming in through the backdoor and \nsaying, don't vote for the money. We want to make the promise. We do \nnot want to spend the money.\n  I hope everyone will stop and think. We could spend this money. The \nPresident was right to promise it. We are right to back the President's \npromise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I do not know if there are any other \nMembers who wish to seek recognition on this amendment. If they do, I \nwill wait to speak last.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wish to clarify a point the Senator \nfrom Vermont made about the White House.\n  I think if the Senator from Vermont will go back and look at the \nWhite House's proposal, and how much money they said they would spend \nwhen they put the proposal forward--which I think the Senator from \nVermont rightly said was praised by the international community--the \nSenator from Vermont will discover that the President's proposal had \nless than $3 billion in the first year, actually roughly $2 billion in \nthe first year, and then over the course of the following 4 years it \nwas ramped up to in excess of around $4 billion.\n  So I think to suggest that the administration announced a plan with \none hand and then somehow pulled back with the other is not accurately \nreflected by the record in this case.\n  The White House has been clear from the beginning as to what they \nhave believed was the capacity for spending appropriately within the 14 \ncountries they have outlined in the plan. They have stuck to that plan. \nThey have insisted the numbers they put forth in the first place are \naccurate.\n  I share the Senator's concern that number may be low, and that is why \nI worked with Senator DeWine and Senator Frist to come up with some \nadditional funds, some $400 million, to see if we could do more \nbilateral aid as well as provide more money for the global fund. We \nhave accomplished that.\n  But I just want to set the record straight. The administration has \nannounced their policy, which was warmly received by the international \ncommunity, a community that understands that the capacity now is not \nwhat it will be 5 years from now as a result of the efforts of this \nadministration, and that the money then can and should be ramped over a \nperiod of time based on the efficient capacity to be able to \ndistribute, for example, the antiretroviral drugs the Senator from \nMinnesota talked about today that are sitting in a warehouse with an \nexpiration that is nearing, with no ability to get those drugs out.\n  That is the current state in many areas in Africa. And to suggest \nthat because the administration recognizes there is a failure of \ncapacity of any areas in Africa is somehow coldhearted or, more \nimportantly, that it has reneged on its promise does not accurately \nreflect what happened. It does not, in any way, in my opinion, \naccurately reflect the tremendous compassion and leadership which the \nadministration and this President have shown on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to close. Would the Senator \nfrom Vermont like to be recognized?\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I just took this from the quotes of what \nthe President said on July 12 in Nigeria:\n\n       The people of Africa are fighting HIV/AIDS with courage. \n     And I'm here to say, you will not be alone in your fight. In \n     May, I signed a bill that authorizes $15 billion for the \n     global fight on AIDS. This week, a committee of the House of \n     Representatives took an important step to fund the first year \n     of the authorization bill. And the Senate is beginning to \n     take up debate.\n\n  He then stated:\n\n       The House of Representatives and the United States Senate \n     must fully fund this initiative, for the good of the people \n     on this continent of Africa. . . .\n\n  So I went to what it was the President had signed, the authorization \nbill of which he spoke. He called upon us to fully fund it, but what it \nsaid in the authorization was $3 billion for the first year.\n  I spoke with the President about this. I told him I thought we could \nuse the money. It is what he in his speech in Africa called upon the \nCongress to do. He said he would sign this authorization bill, which \nauthorized $3 billion the first year, and he is calling upon us now to \ncarry out our part. He has done his part. He wants us to carry out our \npart to fund it.\n  Well, we are trying to carry out our part. I also worked with the \nSenator from Ohio and the Senator from Illinois, as did Senator \nMcConnell, to find the extra money. It is more money. We have just \nvoted for more money than what the White House said we needed when the \nbill first came up.\n  I am glad they are not resisting that extra money. I commend the \nWhite House for that. I commend Senator McConnell, Senator Durbin, and \nSenator DeWine for working so hard to find it. But the fact is--the \nfact is--we have to build capacity. Capacity does not happen overnight. \nWe can use the $3 billion. There is no question, it can be used. Every \nhealth official in the world would tell you that. We can use the money. \nWe ought to get it into the pipeline. We ought to spend it.\n  The President was right. I took the floor of the Senate and praised \nhim\n\n[[Page S13643]]\n\nwhen he spoke of the need for this. I praised him publicly, and I \npraised him privately when I spoke with him about it.\n  So that is what it is we are trying to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly, and because I know we are \nabout to hear closing comments on this amendment, I have two unanimous \nconsent requests.\n\n\n Unanimous Consent Agreement--Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 2691\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, November 3, at \na time determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2691, the Interior appropriations \nbill, provided that there be 60 minutes of debate equally divided \nbetween the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, and \nfollowing the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on adoption of the conference report on Monday, at a time \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 150\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 150, \nthe Internet Tax Moratorium, but not before November 6.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the majority leader has finished, I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally divided before each \nof the subsequent votes following the vote on the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would further ask, just as a matter of \ninquiry--I know Senator Durbin is about to wrap up the debate on his \namendment. Senator Feinstein told me she would speak no longer than 5 \nminutes. And people are calling.\n  Does the Senator from New Mexico have any idea how long he wishes to \nspeak?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response, I would be glad to speak \nfor no more than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, so everyone should be aware that these votes \nshould start in the next 10 minutes or so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, has the debate now been completed on \nthe Durbin amendment?\n  Mr. REID. No. The Senator from Illinois wants to finish the debate, \nbut he has just a few more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I personally thank my colleagues. It is \nlate. People would like to go home. I understand the weariness we all \nfeel because it has been a long and hard week. But I hope you all \nunderstand this is not just another issue. For many of us--I think for \nall of us, frankly--this is an issue which is the challenge of our \ngeneration. It is the challenge of our time.\n  I was one of those Democrats who stood and applauded the President of \nthe United States at his State of the Union Address. I thought he made \na spectacular, historic commitment that the United States would lead \nthe world in the fight against the global AIDS epidemic. He included \ntuberculosis and malaria.\n\n  Having visited some of the Third World countries that are victimized \nby these diseases, I stood and applauded in heartfelt support of the \nPresident, proud to be an American and proud of what he said: $15 \nbillion over 5 years. We came back in the Senate and we decided to \nauthorize--a Republican majority and the Democratic minority--$3 \nbillion this year.\n  So this figure of $3 billion is not my creation. It is the Senate's \ncreation. And it is a number which we ratified in July when 78 \nRepublican and Democrat Senators said: Yes, that is what we are going \nto spend this year, $3 billion. Regardless of budget consequences, we \nwill keep that commitment.\n  So this $3 billion figure is not one I have come up with. It is one \nthat the President came up with. It is one that the Senate came up \nwith.\n  Now, a lot has been said about capacity. Let me explain what I think \nis a misunderstanding here. One of the Senators said: I saw a warehouse \nfull of vaccine that was about to expire. That is proof positive we \ndon't need to send any more money over there because, frankly, it will \nbe wasted. I guess that is the conclusion.\n\n  Let me read to you what the President of the United States said when \nhe announced the global AIDS coordinator just a few months ago:\n\n       We will set up a broad and efficient network to deliver \n     drugs to the farthest reaches of Africa, even by motorcycle \n     or bicycle. We will train doctors and nurses and other health \n     care professionals so they can treat HIV/AIDS patients. Our \n     efforts will ensure that clinics and laboratories will be \n     built, renovated, and equipped. Child care workers will be \n     hired and trained to care for AIDS orphans. People living \n     with AIDS will get home-based care to ease their suffering.\n\n  This is what the President said. What we are doing with this money is \nnot just sending medicine to warehouses. We are doing these things. The \nPresident has said we are using this money to build the capacity. \nDoesn't it defy logic for us to say if we need more nurses and health \ncare professionals, it would be better to wait several years before we \ntrain them? We need them now so they can deliver the therapies and \nmedicines necessary to save lives during the next 4, 5, and 10 years.\n  Shortchanging that capital investment, shortchanging that capacity \ninvestment on the front end is a guarantee these poor people will \ncontinue to die. Why would we stand by and let that occur?\n  The saddest thing about this amendment, the saddest thing of all is \nit is likely to be a partisan amendment. When you look at the rollcall, \ncount the no votes. You are likely to see one political party, and the \nyes votes another political party. Of every issue in the world today \nwhich we will consider, this is the one that should not be partisan. \nThis is the one where the President really summoned all of us to stand \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I want to say one word in closing. Senator Frist was here a moment \nago. He has left the floor now. He is very busy; I understand. I have \nsuch personal admiration for Senator Frist, though I disagree with him \non a lot of political issues, but such personal admiration because this \nman is not only a political leader in America, he is a moral leader of \nthe Senate. He takes his skills as a doctor to Africa, to the poorest \nplaces on earth to help the poorest people. Of all the things that \ncould be said of Bill Frist, no one can ever question his moral \ncommitment to poor people. That is not only admirable and honorable, \nbut it speaks so well of him and what we can be when all of us \nunderstand that when it comes to issues of life and death for the \npoorest people around the world.\n  Please, step aside from party label. Step aside from the moment and \nsay: We are going to do what is necessary to save these lives so some \nfuture day we don't look back and shake our heads and say: We should \nhave done more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the only \nremaining time to be used on the Feinstein amendment be 5 minutes to be \nused by Senator Brownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Feinstein is entitled to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I understand that. I am locking in the time on this \nside. I ask unanimous consent that the only time to be used on the \nBingaman amendment be 3 minutes to be used by the senior Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is referring to his side?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With regard to the pending Durbin amendment number \n2047, it increases spending by $589,700,000. This additional spending \nwould cause the underlying bill to exceed the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment \npursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S13644]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1977\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe I have 5 minutes on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1977.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add as cosponsors, in addition to Senators \nSnowe and Murray, Senators Clinton, Jeffords, and Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, looking at the scope of the HIV/AIDS \ntragedy, 40 million people are infected with HIV worldwide and 30 \nmillion of these people are from sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 70 \npercent of the world's total. As of 2001, 21.5 million Africans had \ndied of AIDS, and at least 50 million new cases are projected by 2010 \nin five countries alone: China, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, and Russia.\n  It is estimated that two-thirds of the 45 million new HIV infections \nexpected to occur during this period could be averted with effective \nprevention. That is where we must go. This amendment does not aim to \nchange the one-third earmark for abstinence until marriage. This \namendment aims to provide some flexibility so that the people on the \nground have the opportunity of tailoring the most effective prevention \nprogram.\n  The way in which we do it is, first, we reserve at least one-third of \nfunds for the prevention of the sexual transmission of HIV, rather than \none-third of all prevention funds, for abstinence-until-marriage \nprograms.\n  Secondly, our amendment defines an abstinence-until-marriage program \nas any program that places a priority emphasis on the public health \nbenefits of refraining from sexual activity outside of marriage.\n  Our amendment gives the administration, local communities, and HIV/\nAIDS workers on the ground maximum flexibility to design HIV/AIDS \nprevention strategies that are most effective in stopping the spread of \nAIDS.\n  One of the things we know, for example, is that Nevirapine, given to \na pregnant woman, can stop the spread of HIV to her unborn child. In \nremoving the one-third earmark from that program, you are able to use \nprevention dollars in a much wiser way.\n  Let me be clear: Our amendment does not strike the one-third earmark \nfor abstinence until marriage programs. Rather, it ensures the United \nStates can fund programs that are most successful in increasing \nabstinence among young people.\n  We believe this is a pro-abstinence, results-oriented amendment. It \nbalances congressional priorities with public health needs. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to speak in opposition to \nthe Feinstein amendment. I have deep respect for Senator Feinstein. I \nhave worked with her on a number of issues. I respect her thinking \nprocess, her compassion, and her view. However, on this issue, I have \nto differ with her, and I wanted to articulate several reasons why.\n  No. 1, we have voted on this issue already. This issue came up \nearlier when we had the debate on the major initiative put forward by \nthe administration on HIV/AIDS. This was a major issue of debate at \nthat point in time when we were trying to get the authorizing piece of \nthis bill through. This is the appropriations piece. But when we were \ntrying to get the authorizing piece of the bill through, we had a major \ndebate about this.\n  We had a number of people here at that time talking with us about the \nrole of abstinence. The leading country that has been successful in the \nmajor area where we are targeting our efforts in the HIV/AIDS pandemic \nhas been Uganda. The Ugandan model is ABC, and it leads with \nabstinence. The day of the vote on this, we had the First Lady of \nUganda here speaking with a number of us, talking about the central \nrole of abstinence and the historic drop in the level of HIV/AIDS that \nhad taken place in their country.\n  These are very impressive numbers, best of any country around the \nworld that has had the high infection rates. Their infection rate \ndropped from 21 percent to 7 percent in just 9 years. She was saying \nspecifically it was the abstinence portion. It was the abstinence \nfocus.\n  If you want to stop the spread of AIDS, the best way to do it is \nabstinence. She was here and speaking to us with great clarity about \nthat issue.\n  We had the debate, and we voted at that point in time with a majority \nsaying we want a certain amount of money to go for the abstinence \nprogram.\n  I have great respect for the Senator from California. The Feinstein \namendment would take money away from the abstinence focus in this \nprogram. In effect, she would open it up to more areas and dilute the \nabstinence base funding so that it will be reduced. In effect, we will \nbe changing the course we set in the authorizing language: that we want \na certain amount of money, about a third of this pool, to go to \nabstinence, and we would be changing course and reducing that level \nfrom the authorizing language.\n  The administration and the Ambassador for Global AIDS Coordination, \nAmbassador Tobias, has written to the Senate Foreign Operations \nchairman, Senator McConnell, in strong opposition to this amendment. He \nsays in his final paragraph:\n\n       Finally, the effect of this amendment would be to decrease \n     the amount that could be spent on abstinence-until-marriage \n     programs as a prevention model, and I believe that would not \n     be in the interest of best public health practice.\n\n  This is the person implementing this legislation, the amount of \nfunding we are putting forward. He thinks the money targeted by the \nauthorizing committee is appropriate and best suited for us to meet the \nobjectives.\n  Mr. President, my objective is to reduce AIDS infections around the \nworld, and the best model is Uganda. It has gone from 21 percent to 7 \npercent and the lead program they did it with was abstinence. We have a \nproven model. We voted on this previously. I urge my colleagues, with \nall due respect to the Senator from the State of California, not to \nchange minds on this issue but, rather, to stay with what we already \ndiscussed and decided on and stay with the funding levels we currently \nhave.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the remainder of his \ntime.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much of my time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, with respect to Uganda, I would like \nto read testimony from a Ugandan HIV/AIDS director before the House \nregarding the promotion of prevention by the President of Uganda. Let \nme quote this:\n\n       For some, he promoted a message of delaying sexual debut. \n     For others, he urged them to be faithful to one partner and \n     to use a condom. It was his three-part message that was \n     effective in Uganda. In my personal experience, I believe \n     this three-part message is critical.\n\n  Currently, one-third of all prevention funds must be reserved for \nabstinence until marriage programs. This earmark limits the amount of \nfunds available for other prevention programs, including preventing \nmother to child transmission. There are literally 5 million to 10 \nmillion orphans already from AIDS in Africa, and it is going to be much \nmore.\n  All we are saying, is that the one-third earmark should not apply to \nprograms that give a pregnant woman a 90 percent chance of preventing \nthe transmission of AIDS to the unborn child. That is all we are doing \nin this amendment, providing some flexibility.\n  Remember this overwhelming statistic. The estimates are there will be\n\n[[Page S13645]]\n\nin excess of 20 million orphans by 2010 in Africa. There should be \nflexibility. Our amendment allows the people on the ground to design a \nHIV/AIDS prevention program that is most effective at stopping the \nspread of HIV/AIDS.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, responding to the good Senator from \nCalifornia, I note the abstinence funding is only 33 percent of the \nbill. The remaining two-thirds of the money can be used in other models \nother than the abstinence model. There are other funds in the bill that \ncan't be used for other types of treatment, but we set aside a certain \nportion for the abstinence model because it has proven to be so \neffective.\n  The other point the Senator from California mentions is flexibility. \nAmbassador Tobias, who runs the global AIDS program, is opposed to this \namendment because it restricts his flexibility. I quote from the letter \nhe sent to the appropriations chairman:\n\n       Given the various cultures, traditions, and religions that \n     are reflected in the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, it is \n     essential that we be enabled to work with multiple prevention \n     approaches and partners to affect behavior change. \n     Restricting such flexibility, as this Amendment intends, \n     would undermine our ability. . . .\n\n  I urge a vote against the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to take just 30 seconds to speak in \nsupport of Senator Feinstein's amendment.\n  The issue here is not about whether we support abstinence as a method \nof preventing the transmission of HIV. Obviously, it is one approach, \nand an important one especially in countries where young girls are \nextremely vulnerable. Encouraging young people to postpone sexual \nactivity until they are in a monogamous relationship is a key goal of \nany AIDS prevention strategy. So abstinence is one approach that we \nneed to support along with other prevention strategies.\n  But the Leadership Against AIDS Act says that 33 percent of all AIDS \nprevention funds should be spent on abstinence programs. The question, \nwhich is not answered in that act, is how to define abstinence, because \nif it is defined too broadly, it will eat into funds that are crucially \nneeded for other prevention methods, such as HIV testing, and \neducational and information programs about methods to prevent HIV \ntransmission among people who are sexually active.\n  This amendment strikes the right balance, and I commend the Senator \nfrom California for taking on this difficult but very important issue.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have already been ordered on \nthe amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2048\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I call up amendment No. 2048.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered 2048.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To make an additional $200,000,000 available for the Global \n    Aids Initiative and reduce the amount available for Millennium \n                 Challenge Assistance by $200,000,000)\n\n       On page 22, line 7, strike ``$700,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$900,000,000''.\n       On page 45, line 8, strike ``$1,000,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$800,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me start by congratulating Senator \nDeWine, Senator Durbin, and all the others who worked so hard on the \nearlier amendment we adopted to add some funding. The case was \nextremely persuasive. By adding those dollars, we will be saving tens \nor perhaps hundreds of thousand of lives. I agreed with that and was \nvery strongly in support of the amendment.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to make an additional $200 million \navailable for the global AIDS initiative and reduce the amount that is \navailable for the Millennium Challenge Account by $200 million. So this \nis a transfer of funds from one part of the appropriations bill to \nanother.\n  Let me talk first about the Millennium Challenge Account, with which \nwe are all familiar, to help developing countries. The administration, \nin their budget request, asked for $800 million in new obligated funds \nfor this Millennium Challenge Account. That was what the Secretary of \nState testified to in answer to a question from Senator Biden before \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Senator Biden asked:\n\n       What is the estimate of obligations of $800 million in \n     fiscal year 2004 based on?\n\n  Secretary Powell's answer:\n\n       This is an estimate of the proportion of the $1.3 billion \n     budget request which we expect would actually be obligated in \n     2004 based on the careful selection system we have set up. \n     Thus, we do not believe it likely that all MCA money \n     appropriated in 2004 would be obligated in the fiscal year.\n\n  Let me put up one other chart. This chart depicts graphically that \nthe President's budget request was $1.3 billion in budget authority, \nbut only $800 million in funds to be obligated in 2004.\n  The House, in their appropriations process, took the President at his \nword and said: OK, you want $800 million for the Millennium Challenge \nAccount; we will give you $800 million.\n  We have gone an extra $200 million, although the administration \nitself says this extra $200 million they want for 2005 and later. They \ndo not need it for 2004.\n  My amendment simply would use that money in 2004 for this AIDS \nproblem about which we are all so concerned. The amendment is inside \nthe budget. It is inside the appropriations caps that the subcommittee \nhas been given.\n  In my view, this is a much better use of the money than just leaving \n$200 million in an account somewhere for the next 12 months until we \nget to 2005. This would be money that would be made available. I do not \nagree with the notion that we can just postpone and do more good with \nthis money later on. Later on, many of the people we would like to help \nwill be dead. The reality is we need to get this money and assistance \nto them as quickly as possible and follow through on the promise we \nhave made. So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the remainder of his \ntime.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are nearing the end of the debate. \nThere will be three rollcall votes stacked very shortly. Senator Leahy \nand I are unaware of any requests for any more rollcall votes. So I \nthink it is safe to say that these three rollcall votes will be the \nlast remaining rollcall votes for the night.\n  With regard to the Bingaman amendment, this amendment adds $200 \nmillion of an existing budget of over $2 billion to fight global AIDS. \nJust to put that in perspective, this amendment adds more than the \nentire fiscal year 1999 Clinton global AIDS funding level to this \nyear's level on top of what we have already done. It adds $200 million \nfor HIV/AIDS with an offset, taking away from the Millennium Challenge \nAccount, the President's new initiative. We are spending over $2 \nbillion already this year, as has been repeatedly stated tonight, to \ncombat HIV/AIDS, including nearly $200 million for the Global Fund.\n  The Millennium Challenge Account is a new initiative that enjoys \nbroad bipartisan support. The MCA provides foreign assistance to \ndeveloping countries that are doing things the right way, from ruling \njustly to building free market economies.\n  The Senate just approved the DeWine amendment 89 to 1. That increases \nHIV/AIDS spending by $289 million. It is time to wrap it up on this \nbill, to not steal money from the Millennium Challenge Account. I urge \nopposition to the Bingaman amendment.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of the time on this side \nand let the Senator from New Mexico wrap it up.\n\n[[Page S13646]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the remainder of his time.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, just to summarize the point, I am in \nfavor of the Millennium Challenge Account. I am proposing that we go \nahead and provide the full $800 million that the administration asks to \nbe obligated in 2004. That is exactly what the House of Representatives \ndid. That is exactly what we ought to do.\n  My only point is that we should not be giving them $200 million that \nthey themselves--that is, the administration itself--say they cannot \nspend in 2004. They do not plan to spend it in 2004. That money should \nbe made available to fight AIDS. We can do that. It does not bust the \nbudget. It does not bust the limitations that we have on this spending \nbill. It is a better use of that money, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport that amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico yields back the \nremainder of his time.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have great respect for the Senator from Kentucky and the \nbill that he has put together. Whatever the outcome of the vote, I will \nstrongly support this bill. It is a good bill. Senator McConnell has \nworked in a bipartisan manner to accommodate a number of priorities. \nThis is one disagreement. We have hundreds of issues that we have to \nresolve in this bill. I think our average is pretty good.\n  As Senator Bingaman pointed out, this is not a vote for or against \nthe Millennium Challenge Account. The MCA could turn out to be a great \nprogram. This is a vote about priorities. This amendment is fully \noffset. The vote is on the following question: Do you want $200 million \nsitting in the Treasury for a year? Or, do you want to spend if \nfighting HIV/AIDS?\n  The administration's own budget documents say that they will spend \nonly $800 million of this money this year. Anything above this level \nwill not be obligated until Fiscal Year 2005. This is precisely why the \nRepublican-controlled House provided $800 million for the MCA. \nSecretary Powell made this point very clear when he testified before \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee. He was asked: ``Why can you spend \nonly $800 million in Fiscal Year 2004?\n  He replied--and I am quoting--this figure is ``based on the careful \nselection system we will set up.'' Secretary Powell continues: This is \nan innovative approach with no precedent to guide us. We anticipate \nthat it will take some time to develop the first proposals and then \nhone them into acceptably detailed and accountable contracts. We thus \ndid not believe it likely that all MCA money will be obligated in the \nfiscal year. We would anticipate that any remaining funding would be \nobligated in fiscal year 2005 for programs in countries selected in \nfiscal year 2004.\n  I know that the White House will figure out a way to say they need \nthis money. But, let me tell my colleagues a couple of other things I \nknow. I know that this additional money will sit in Treasury--their own \nbudget documents show this. Secretary Powell testified to this. I know \nwe do one year appropriations around here. We will revisit this issue \nnext year. I know there is not enough money in this bill to combat the \nworst public health crisis in 500 years.\n  The Bingaman amendment gets us more money, which is fully offset, to \naccomplish this important goal. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.\n  Also, I thank the staff members who have worked so hard on this bill. \nSenator McConnell and I work in a bipartisan manner and so do the \nrespective staffs. On the Republican side I thank Paul Grove, Brendon \nWheeler, Robert Karem. On the Democratic side, I thank Tim Rieser, Mark \nLippert, and J.P. Dowd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the Bingaman \namendment.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1977\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 1977 offered by the Senator from California on which the yeas and \nnays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) and the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper), the \nSenator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Hollings), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), \nand the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Nelson) is absent \nattending a family funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2047\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to amendment \nNo. 2047 by the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, more than enough has already been said \nabout this budget point of order. We have had this vote at least three \ndifferent times this year. I hope the budget point of order will be \nsustained.\n  Mr. DURBIN. With this amendment, we raise the spending to fight the \nwar on global AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria to the level that the \nSenate promised in its own authorization bill, a level that 78 of us \nvoted for on a bipartisan basis.\n  We know this is the greatest moral challenge of our time. This is our \nchance to keep our promise to the world to make certain that America's \ncompassionate leadership is meaningful to people around the world.\n  I ask my colleagues, please, look beyond the Budget Act. Look to the \nfact that we have a challenge here that is worthy of our vote at this \ntime. I hope you will support this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the DeWine amendment accomplished \neverything that is absolutely necessary to fight global AIDS at this \ntime. It is $2 billion. The authorization stipulated fully funding the \nauthorization of $2 billion and $400 million to match the $800 million \nthat had been pledged by the international community. As meeting with \nthe authorization, $1 of American for $2 of international. The $2.4\n\n[[Page S13647]]\n\nbillion, which is in the bill, fully funds our AIDS commitment on the \nauthorization and overfunds what the President requested by $400 \nmillion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My friends, the authorized level is $3 billion. It is not \n$2 billion. The $2.4 billion we have reached with the Mike DeWine \namendment still leaves us short $589 million. That is the difference \nthis amendment makes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to \namendment No. 2047 of the Senator from Illinois. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. This is a 10-minute vote.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this \nwill be the last rollcall vote tonight. Final passage will be on a \nvoice vote. There will be no votes tomorrow. Earlier tonight, we had \ntwo unanimous consent agreements. We will say more about Monday's \nschedule a little bit later, but the plans are to have at least one \nrollcall vote Monday. It will be around 5:30 or so. That will be on the \ninterior conference report.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2048\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now a period for 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided on amendment No. 2048 offered by the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Very briefly, this amendment would take $200 million \nout of the President's Millennium Challenge Account and add it to AIDS \nfunding. We have already had a significant amount of debate about AIDS \nfunding. I think we have made a decision on that.\n  This amendment, I hope, will be opposed.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the remainder of his \ntime.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in the bill before us, we have $200 \nmillion for the Millennium Challenge Account that the administration \nsays they cannot spend in 2004. They do not plan to spend it. They did \nnot request it.\n  The House gave the administration $800 million for the Millennium \nChallenge Account. We are giving them $1 billion.\n  My amendment would say let's give them the same amount the House is \nproposing to give them, the $800 million, and let's take that extra \n$200 million and use that in the fight against HIV/AIDS. It is a much \nbetter use of the funds than just putting it in an account for possible \nuse in 2005.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Bingaman \namendment, which would transfer $200 million dollars from the \nMillennium Challenge Account into programs designed to help us fight \nour struggle against the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n  I commend my friend and colleague from New Mexico for his leadership \non this critical issue. Along with several of our colleagues, the \nSenator from New Mexico and I traveled to South Africa, Botswana, \nKenya, and Nigeria to look at this heart-wrenching challenge. And I \nbelieve his amendment is an important step toward relieving the intense \nsuffering we saw on that trip.\n  Let me say, too, that I support the Millennium Challenge Account. \nWith the crushing poverty affecting nearly a third of the world's \ncitizens, the MCA is clearly an idea whose time has come. I support it, \nand that is why I worked hard to ensure that this foreign operations \nbill contains the legislation to create that important program.\n  But the bill also includes $200 million more than the President has \nrequested and $200 million more than his Secretary of State has said he \ncan use this year. So rather than have that money sit unused--in the \nface of the gravest public health crisis the world has ever known--we \npropose to put that money to use immediately to confront HIV/AIDs.\n  Less than 4 months ago, the President signed into law a bill \nauthorizing his administration to spend $3 billion a year for the next \n5 years on a comprehensive program to combat AIDS.\n  Congress passed this legislation in response to the President's call \nfor action in his State of the Union Address. Unfortunately, President \nBush's own budget request has fallen fall short of his promises, \nseeking just under $2 billion, more than $1 billion less than what he \nis authorized to spend.\n  Nearly 30 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are currently living \nwith the AIDS virus, and the President's emergency plan for AIDS will \nbegin to help those countries that are worst hit.\n  But the reason we need to invest this additional $200 million--on top \nof the $289 million we just agreed to--is because the President's \nemergency plan focuses only on Africa and the Caribbean.\n  Take one country not addressed in the President's emergency plan. At \nthe end of 2002, over 4.5 million Indians were infected with HIV, \nmaking India the nation with the second-highest population of AIDS \npatients in the world behind South Africa. Experts there warn that the \ndisease has spread from high-risk populations in urban areas into rural \nIndia.\n  As a result, the infection rate will dramatically increase, in much \nthe same pattern it followed in sub-Saharan Africa. A recent United \nStates National Intelligence Council report predicted that India could \nhave 25 million of its citizens infected with HIV/AIDS by the year \n2010--less than 7 years from\n\n[[Page S13648]]\n\nnow. Such an incidence of this disease would mean that India will have \nnearly as many people living with the AIDS virus as the entire sub-\nSaharan African region does today.\n  But our investments to fight HIV in India at the moment are less than \n$40 million per year. By continuing that trend line, we are in effect \nrequiring even more expensive investments within a decade.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Bingaman amendment, which follows \nthe recommendation of President Bush regarding the amount of money \nneeded for the Millennium Challenge Account, and devotes the additional \nresources to a problem that demands our immediate attention.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the remainder of his \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have already been ordered.\n  All time has now expired. The question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 2048 offered by the Senator from New Mexico. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n             the clean energy technology exports initiative\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have long had an interest in helping to \nopen international energy technology markets and in expanding the \nexport of a range of U.S. clean energy technologies. In October 2002, \nthe Bush administration, at my urging, released a nine-agency plan \ncalled the Clean Energy Technology Exports, CETE, Initiative which is \nintended to carry out such an effort. The participating agencies whose \nbudgets are covered in this bill include U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, USAID, the Export-Import Bank, ExIm, Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation, OPIC, and the Trade and Development Agency, \nTDA.\n  To help coordinate and facilitate that work, funds have been included \nin the Fiscal Year 2004 Energy and Water bill to establish an \ninteragency center to be located at the Department of Energy in order \nto increase U.S. efforts abroad and encourage greater public/private \npartnerships for such projects. It is also important that other \nagencies with responsibility for foreign assistance and export \npromotion participate in this initiative.\n  I hope that the managers of this bill will work with me in conference \nto include language in the Statement of Managers to strongly urge \nUSAID, ExIm, OPIC, and TDA to participate actively in the CETE \nInitiative. I want to be sure that these agencies contribute to the \ncenter's work, with funds in their existing budgets, to promote U.S. \nclean energy technologies in developing countries where the demand for \nenergy is increasing dramatically.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am aware of the interest of the ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, the senior Senator from West Virginia, in \npromoting the export of clean energy technologies, and appreciate \nknowing about his efforts to establish a center at the Department of \nEnergy for this purpose.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I also appreciate what my friend Senator Byrd has said, \nand I will gladly work with him in conference in support of the \nlanguage he seeks in the Statement of Managers.\n\n\n                        Global TB Drug Facility\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to thank the Senator from Vermont for his \noutstanding leadership on this bill and especially for his leadership \non infectious disease issues. As my colleague well knows, tuberculosis \nis the greatest curable infectious killer on the planet. TB is also the \nnumber one killer of people with HIV/AIDS and the biggest killer of \nyoung women.\n  We must support the highest possible funding level for global TB \nprograms, especially as we scale up AIDS efforts, and we must ensure \nthat these monies have maximum impact--curing as many people of TB as \npossible. Ensuring access to drugs is a key component in curing TB.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with my colleague. When countries do not have \naccess to TB drugs, people die needlessly and when TB treatment is \ninterrupted, this leads to the development of more deadly multi-drug \nresistant TB--which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to treat \neach infected person in the United States.\n  Mrs. BOXER. To address this issue, the Global TB Drug Facility, which \nis part of the Stop TB Partnership at the World Health Organization, is \na remarkably successful international mechanism that is effectively \nproviding access to high-quality anti-TB drugs in the world's poor \nnations. The Global TB Drug Facility procures drugs at low cost through \na competitive bidding process, distributes drugs to qualified grantees, \nand works with Stop TB partners to ensure monitoring and evaluation.\n  In operation just 2 years, the Global TB Drug Facility has reduced \nthe price of anti-TB drugs to just $10 for a full six to eight month \ncourse of treatment, and has approved grants to over 40 countries.\n  The Global TB Drug Facility, GDF is so successful that the World \nHealth Organization is using it as a model for providing anti-\nretroviral drugs and diagnostics in its campaign to reach 3 million \npeople with anti-retrovirals by 2005.\n  Yet, despite its immense effectiveness, the GDF is facing a severe \nfunding crisis. It does not have funding to meet existing commitments \nnext year or to make any new grants for drug purchases. It needs $50 \nmillion next year and a minimum of $25 million just to meet existing \ncommitments for 2004. If it does not get its minimum funding, at least \n1.8 million TB patients will be put at serious risk and many will die, \nand we will be interrupting supplies of drugs--creating the perfect \nconditions to develop a dangerous drug resistant strain of the disease.\n  H.R. 1298, The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, which was passed by the Senate \nand signed into law by the President, calls for ``substantially \nincreased funding for the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility.''\n  The United States provided only $2 million to the GDF in 2002 and \njust $3 million in 2003. As a crucial part of our global TB effort, the \nUnited States should significantly increase our support for the Global \nTB Drug Facility in 2004. For example, $15 million provided to the TB \nDrug Facility could provide TB drugs to treat over 1 million people.\n\n\n              international narcotics and law enforcement\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I see the Senators from Virginia and \nVermont on the floor, and am wondering if they could provide some \nadditional information on their amendment concerning enforcement of \nintellectual property laws.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. The Allen-Leahy \namendment provides $5 million under the ``International Narcotics and \nLaw Enforcement'' account to improve enforcement of intellectual \nproperty laws to combat piracy in developing countries. This is a very \nimportant issue, as it relates directly to our economic viability as a \nnation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with the Senator from Virginia. The lack of \nenforcement of intellectual property laws is a serious problem. It \nundermines the rule of law in other nations, and it hurts U.S. economic \nand cultural interests. Perhaps most importantly, it reduces incentives \nfor Americans to be creative. And, we know that American ingenuity is a \nmajor reason that the United States is the Nation it is today.\n  This amendment will help address some of these problems. It will also \nhelp developing nations comply with the WTO agreement on Trade-Related \nAspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, and other intellectual \nproperty agreements, which is very important.\n  Some of these nations have problems meeting the most basic needs of \ntheir people, and it is safe to say that this assistance could be the \ndifference between the enforcement of these laws or piracy continuing \nunabated.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my good friend from Vermont. I agree with what \nhas been said on this by the Senators from Virginia and Vermont. I \nthink this is a good idea, and would like to\n\n[[Page S13650]]\n\nask, for clarification purposes, a question of the Senator form \nVirginia. How would this money be spent and what type of assistance \nwould be provided by these funds?\n  Mr. ALLEN. This amendment allows the administration to be extremely \nflexible in finding an approach. It could involve training, equipment, \nor a range of other measures.\n  I do not want to micro-manage this process. I want to leave this in \nthe hands of those in the administration with expertise on this issue. \nI would defer, in large measure, to State Department officials, \nespecially those posted overseas who are dealing with the problem on a \ndaily basis, to come up with a workable strategy.\n  However, I do believe that this is a problem that requires a coherent \nplan and a coordinated approach by the United States Government. And, I \nbelieve that the State Department, in close consultation with the \nUnited States Trade Representative, USTR, and the Department of \nCommerce, should formulate a detailed strategy for the use of these \nfunds before they are obligated.\n  Other agencies, such as the Patent and Trademark Office, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the \nLibrary of Congress, have expertise on this issue. They can be \nextremely helpful in implementing these programs, especially with \nrespect to training individuals from developing nations.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. This sounds like a very reasonable approach.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues, especially \nSenator Leahy, Senator McConnell, and Senator Daschle, for supporting \nan amendment that was cleared. The amendment will help one of our \nclosest neighbors--the country of Mexico.\n  We recently approved billions of dollars to begin rebuilding the \nnation of Iraq and to maintain order in Afghanistan. We approved this \naid not only so the people of Iraq and Afghanistan can enjoy the \nbenefits of a free and democratic society; we also approved it because \nwe know it's in our interest to create a stable situation in those \ncountries.\n  The same thing goes for our southern neighbor, with whom we share a \n2,000 mile border, and where economic conditions are particularly bad \nright now.\n  Desperate people take desperate measures, and many people in Mexico \nare desperate. A few years ago, Mexico seemed on the verge of an \neconomic breakthrough. But today, Mexico's growth rate is half what it \nwas in the 1990s. More than half of all Mexicans--over 50 million \npeople--have an annual income of less than about $1,400. Almost one-\nfourth of all Mexicans have an annual income of about $720--less than \n$2 per day.\n  There is little hope for these people in the Mexican countryside, \nwhere coffee prices have plummeted and where homes and land values are \nfalling because of a badly broken system of private property ownership. \nSo these desperate people take desperate measures. Maybe they flee to \nMexico City--but there isn't much hope there either. Most refugees from \nthe country side wind up in crowded shantytowns, breathing foul air, \nand living in filth. Maybe they remain on the land, but instead of \nraising coffee, many turn to illegal crop production, which facilitates \na dangerous trade in drugs that poisons our own cities. Perhaps they \nwill put their lives in the hands of unscrupulous ``coyotes'' who \npromise to lead them across the desert to the land of plenty. If they \ndon't die trying, they reach the United States, where they place an \nadded burden on our security officials and social services.\n  I do not condone illegal immigration. But I understand that desperate \npeople do desperate things, and that desperate conditions in Mexico \naffect the United States.\n  This amendment extends a helping hand to our neighbor. It provides \n$10 million for micro credit lending, small business and \nentrepreneurial development, aid to small farms and farmers, many who \nhave been affected by the collapse of coffee prices, and it calls for \nprograms to support Mexico's private property ownership system, which \nis in dire need for repair.\n  The money appropriated pursuant to this amendment won't solve these \nproblems overnight, but we have to start somewhere. Our neighbor needs \nhelp, and we can't turn a blind eye.\n  This is not a handout. It is a commitment to free market-based \nprograms that will spur long-term development and growth in the rural \nareas of Mexico. By extending a hand to our neighbor, we are also \nkeeping our own Nation strong and secure. I again want to thank my \ncolleagues for supporting this measure.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we all understand and appreciate the \nimportance of information technology. Many of us now regularly use our \n``blackberries'' to communicate with each other and staff on the \nworkings of this body. I want to take a moment to highlight the efforts \nand vision of Voice for Humanity to utilize information technology--\nspecifically audio digital technology--to maximize the effectiveness of \nHIV/AIDS awareness and other important development issues abroad.\n  Using low-cost digital tools, Voice for Humanity proposes to convey \nHIV/AIDS awareness, prevention, treatment, and medical training among \nnon-literate and oral communicating populations in developing \ncountries. The devices, which fit into the palm of your hand, can \nprovide standardized information to any one group or individual in any \nlanguage. And the best part is, information can be regularly updated \nand changed using regular FM radio technology.\n  The applications of this technology are endless. During elections, \nthis technology can provide critical information to remote parts of a \ndeveloping country on the basic tenants of democracy and election rules \nand regulations. Anyone who has observed elections in a transitioning \ncountry knows that confusion over process on election day--by voters \nand poll workers--is not extraordinary. This technology ensures that \neveryone has the same information, in the same language, at the same \ntime.\n  I will have more to say on Voice for Humanity at a later date. I \nintend to include language in the statement of managers accompanying \nthe fiscal year 2004 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill ensuring \nsupport for pilot projects.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, last night the conferees to the emergency \nsupplemental included $100 million for economic assistance for Jordan. \nThis action was strongly supported by the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, and is intended to be in addition to funds made available \nfor Jordan in the fiscal year 2004 Foreign Operations bill.\n  My friend from Vermont and I wanted to provide Jordan with early \ndisbursal of funds in the pending bill because we have long recognized \nhow good and trusted an ally we have in that country. I was just in \nAmman--a little over 3 weeks ago--and was again impressed by the solid \nrelationship the United States enjoys with the Hashemite Kingdom.\n  The inclusion of an additional $100 million for Jordan sends the \nright message at the right time and provides well earned support for \nongoing reforms in Jordan. The technical amendment the ranking member \nand I offer strikes an earlier one that provided funds for Jordan on an \naccelerated basis--instead, Jordan's total allocation for economic \nassistance in fiscal year 2004 will include the budget request for $250 \nmillion, and an additional $100 million in the supplemental.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in conclusion, I thank Senator Leahy \nand his very capable staff, Tim Rieser and Mark Lippert, and, of \ncourse, Chairman Stevens and his able staff director, Jim Morhard, for \nhis continued support of the subcommittee, and particularly for the \nadditional global HIV/AIDS program allocation.\n  I also thank USAID counsel Bob Lester who puts in long hours working \nalongside the subcommittee putting these bills together. I thank \nBrendon Wheeler and my assistant, Robert Karem, who accompanied me on a \nrecent trip to Iraq and Afghanistan, and Paul Grove, chief counsel of \nthe subcommittee. He has been with me off and on for a number of years. \nHe has done a spectacular job. He had to balance both the emergency \nsupplemental conference downstairs and the foreign operations bill \nupstairs and chronic sleep deprivation at the same time, and he did all \nthat with admirable poise and remarkable intellectual ability. I \nappreciate his very fine work.\n\n[[Page S13651]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further amendment to be \nproposed, the question is on the engrossment of the amendments and \nthird reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is with sincere appreciation that I \nannounce the second recipient of the golden gavel award for the 108th \nCongress, Senator John Sununu.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13651-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO E. LINWOOD ``TIP'' TIPTON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friend E. \nLinwood Tipton. Tip, as he is known by friends, will have devoted 38 \nyears of his life to the dairy industry upon his retirement later this \nyear.\n  Growing up on his family's farm in Missouri, Tip's interest in \nagriculture developed at a young age. He attended the University of \nMissouri where he earned a bachelor's degree in Agriculture and a \nmaster's degree in Economics. After serving his country as an officer \nin the U.S. Army Finance Corp, Tip returned to the dairy industry where \nhis talent and leadership were recognized and he quickly advanced.\n  In 1987, Tip was appointed president and CEO of the Milk Industry \nFoundation and the International Ice Cream Manufacturers Association. \nUnder his direction, the International Dairy Show began in 1988 and \nevolved into the Worldwide Food Expo, an event that currently features \nover 1,000 exhibitors from 150 different countries. He also created \nDairy Forum, a major annual conference for dairy producers and \nprocessors. In 1990, he rallied the milk industry to form the \nInternational Dairy Foods Association, IDFA, an organization that \nencompasses the Milk Industry Foundation, the National Cheese \nInstitute, and the International Ice Cream Association. Tip's \ninnovative ideas and strong leadership have stimulated the growth of \nIDFA. Tip led the way in the creation of the extremely successful `` \nMilk Mustache'' and ``Got Milk?'' marketing campaigns.\n  His knowledge of the dairy industry and the economy has encouraged \nSecretaries of Agriculture and U.S. Trade Representatives of both \npolitical parties to seek his counsel. In 1984, President Reagan \nappointed Tip to the National Commission on Agricultural Trade and \nExport Policy. He has been active on Capitol Hill by testifying \nnumerous times before congressional committees and initiating the \nannual Capitol Hill Ice Cream Party.\n  Nondairy organizations have also benefited from Tip's leadership. He \nfounded the International Sweetener Colloquium so sugar and sweetener-\nusing industries could assemble and discuss sugar policy. Tip is a past \npresident and chairman of the board of the National Economists Club and \nthe National Economic Education Foundation. He also has been active in \nthe D.C. community by serving on the ``Main Street'' restoration \nproject's board of directors.\n  Tip is truly a visionary in the dairy industry. From regulating dairy \nfood retail packaging to implementing marketing campaigns, he has \ndelved into every aspect of the dairy business. Tip's leadership should \nbe commended and, therefore, I ask each of my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring this remarkable man's dedication to the food industry, his \ncommunity, and his Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13651-4", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO BILL AND MEREDITH SCHROEDER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I pay special tribute to two \nindividuals whose foresight inspired a mecca in America's Heartland. \nBill and Meredith Schroeder's interest in quilts has led to an exciting \nand beneficial business venture for the City of Paducah, KY, and the \nsurrounding area. In 1984, the Schroeder's founded the American \nQuilter's Society, AQS, after discovering the need for worldwide \nrecognition of the beauty of quilting as an art form and as a statement \nof our history and society.\n  The Schroeder's created a multi venue environment to promote the art \nand craft of quilting. Through the American Quilter's Society, they \nestablished a membership organization with participants from every U.S. \nState and territory, as well as from 80 countries. They created the AQS \nQuilt Show & Contest, the largest cash-juried contest in the world. \nHeld each April in Paducah, KY, now recognized as ``Quilt City USA '', \nthe annual show brings millions of dollars to the tourism industry of \nwestern Kentucky. In 1991, the Museum of the American Quilter's Society \nopened. The museum has hosted hundreds of thousands of quilters and \nquilt lovers, and has enjoyed a history of growth and development.\n  Bill and Meredith Schroeder are extraordinary individuals who had a \nvision and worked hard to bring it to fruition. In appreciation for the \nSchroeder's commitment to fostering the respect of the general public \nfor quilts and quilt makers, and for their unselfish desire to develop \nthe economy of western Kentucky, I ask my fellow colleagues to join me \nin recognizing the outstanding contributions they have made to their \ncommunity, to Kentucky, and to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13651-5", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. EDWARDS.

Mr. President, I rise today to give the Senate an \nupdate on the wildfires sweeping across Southern California--as the \nSenate continues to debate legislation to change our Nation's forest \npolicy.\n  The situation in my State is at a critical juncture. If the weather \ncontinues to improve--as it is expected--then firefighters may be able \nto get a handle on the fires which continue to burn. This would be good \nnews indeed.\n  I would also like to report that FEMA will shortly be announcing 6\n\n[[Page S13652]]\n\npermanent field sites where victims of the fire can go for assistance \nand 4 additional mobile sites.\n  It is critical that the FEMA centers get opened as soon as possible--\nso that the help gets where it is needed most.\n  There are nine large fires currently raging in the State--all of \nwhich have caused considerable damage.\n  In total, these fires have burned over 650,000 acres--about the size \nof Rhode Island. Twenty people have been killed. This includes a \nfirefighter from Marin County who was killed by a fast moving wall of \nfire associated with the Cedar fire. Twenty-four hundred homes have \nbeen lost in five counties, and thousands more structures have been \nburned.\n  There are some 13,000 firefighters waging a battle against the fires. \nTrue to form, these firefighters have given everything they have to put \nout the fires and are exhausted.\n  Our thoughts and our prayers go out to these men and women--and to \nthe family of the firefighter who died--we know that these firefighters \nare doing everything possible to save lives, homes, and private \nproperty.\n  Let me now go through some of the fires to let you know what is \nhappening.\n  The Cedar Fire in San Diego has become the largest wildfire in \nCalifornia history. It has burned 250,000 acres--and 6 days old, it is \nonly 15 percent contained. Thus far, 22 injuries have been reported as \na result of this fire, and 7 civilian fatalities confirmed by the San \nDiego Sheriff's Department. Additionally, 1,300 Structures have been \ndestroyed.\n  The fire has destroyed 90 percent of the town of Cuyamaca, and today, \nit threatens the communities of Pine Hills, Mt. Laguna, Ramona and \nJulian. Plans to aggressively protect the historic town of Julian are \nin place. Overnight, 300 structures were destroyed in Cuyamaca and \nHarrison.\n  The Old Fire in San Bernardino is also burning out of control and \ncontinues to pose a major threat to Lake Arrowhead, Big Bear, and other \nmountain communities. This fire also began 6 days ago. It has consumed \n60,000 acres thus far and is only 10 percent contained.\n  Massive resources have been expended to fight this fire, including \n2,175 firefighters, 10 helicopters, 40 fire crews, 280 engines, and 7 \nair tankers.\n  There have been three injuries to date and two civilian deaths. \nConservative estimates suggest that 550 residential structures and 10 \ncommercial structures have been destroyed. But this is just the tip of \nthe iceberg.\n  There are 50,000-60,000 homes and 2,000 commercial properties in the \narea threatened by this fire. More than 50,000 people have been \nevacuated from communities like Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear. \nFirefighters are doing what they can to protect these communities from \ngoing up in flames, but this is difficult because of the thousands of \ntrees killed by the Bark Beetle, which have become kindling in this \nfire.\n  The Grand Prix fires also continues to rage in San Bernardino, near \nthe community of Fontana. This fire has consumed 70,000 acres, \ndestroyed 60 residences and 60 other structures, and has resulted in 27 \ninjuries. This fire began 10 days ago, and is 40 percent contained. \nToday, 1,600 firefighters, 12 helicopters, 42 fire crews, 159 engines, \nand 30 bull dozers are committed to this fire.\n  It is hoped that weather conditions will allow firefighters to get \nbetter control of this fire today.\n  Moving North, the Simi fire threatens the community of Stevenson \nRanch. The good news with this fire is that it did not move into the \ncanyons and cut a path toward Malibu. But when the wind shifted, the \nfire turned toward a sub-development on the northern end of Los Angeles \nCounty.\n  This fire has consumed 105,560 acres and destroyed 16 structures and \n64 other buildings. Thus far, there have been 5 injuries as a result of \nthis fire, and the fire is only 35 percent contained.\n  Now, firefighters are trying to keep this fire away from homes and \nhave thus far been successful. Today is a critical day for this fire. \nCooler temperatures may allow a fire line to be completed along Potero \nCanyon, and this would go a long way toward bringing this fire under \ncontrol.\n  Like the other fires, massive resources have been deployed to fight \nthis fire, including: 1,389 firefighters, 9 helicopters, 236 engines, 6 \nair tankers, and 27 bulldozers.\n  The Piru fire continues to burn in Ventura county, near the community \nof Fillmore.\n  Thus far, 62,000 acres have been consumed, and the fire is only 30 \npercent contained.\n  The fire began a week ago, has caused 20 injures and destoyed 8 \nstructures.\n  But this fire remains dangerous. The fire is moving towards fuel-\nladen areas in the Los Padres National Forest, and we have to watch \nthis one closely.\n  The Padua fire--near Claremont, CA--is smaller than the other ones, \nbut it has caused considerable damage nonetheless.\n  Latest reports show that it has burned almost 10,000 acres, and the \ngood news is that it is 50 percent contained.\n  This fire has caused 15 injuries, destroyed 59 structures, and \nthreatens 500 homes in the community of Mt. Baldy.\n  The resources directed at this fire include 691 firefighters, 17 fire \ncrews, 80 engines, and 4 bulldozers.\n  Some good news from the Whitmore fire, near Shasta, CA.\n  This fire which has burned approximately 1,000 acres is 80 percent \ncontained. There have been no injuries as a result of this fire, and it \nis expected to be contained today.\n  It is my great hope that this happens.\n  Good news also with the Tuk Fire, 10 miles east of Orick, CA, south \nof Crescent City.\n  This fire has burned only 315 acres and is 80 percent contained. \nOfficals are hoping that this fire will be fully contained today as \nwell.\n  The mountain fire, which burned just under 10,000 acres in Riverside, \nCA, has been 100 percent contained.\n  Fire officials will continue to complete burnout operation in near \nthe fire edge, and pending favorable weather, should be completed soon.\n  This fire was serious--it caused 6 injuries and 61 structures.\n  Fire crews and equipment are coming in from other States. The \ngovernor of New Mexico has offered equipment, and I understand that \nother States have offered help as well.\n  As crews become weary and fatigued, it will be increasingly important \nto get reinforcements from other States--and I will do what I can to \nmake sure this happens.\n  In terms of victim assistance, help is on its way. As I mentioned, \nFEMA will be establishing four permanent centers in affected \ncommunities, and four mobile centers.\n  Additionally, if any Californian needs help, they can call my San \nDiego or Los Angeles office, and we will do anything we can to ensure \nthat they get the appropriate assistance.\n  This is a terrible time for Californians, but in times of crisis, \npeople pull together and do what they can to help one another.\n  It is my hope that these fires can be quickly contained--with limited \ncasualties and loss of property.\n  This event has truly been a wake up call, and I hope that we learn \nhow critical it is to manage our lands, to ensure that catastrophic \nfires like these can be prevented.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13652-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13652-S13655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, October is National Breast Cancer \nAwareness Month, and, as the month is coming to an end, it is \nappropriate that we take some time to celebrate the progress we have \nmade against this devastating disease and, at the same time, \nacknowledge how much further we have to go.\n  Breast cancer has taken a tremendous toll on far too many Americans \nand their families. There are very few people in this country who \nhaven't lost a family member, friend or coworker to this cancer. More \nthan 200,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year \nalone, and, regrettably, about 40,000 of those diagnosed will die from \nthe disease. Across the country, one woman in eight will develop breast \ncancer at some point during her life. While we have made great \nprogress, we must continue to work to find new and more effective ways \nof preventing, detecting and treating breast cancer.\n  Astoundingly, of the 3 million American women who are living with \nbreast\n\n[[Page S13653]]\n\ncancer, an estimated 1 million don't know it. Regular screenings and \nearly detection remain the most effective ways to combat breast cancer \nand improve a woman's chances for successful treatment and survival. It \nis therefore critical that we take steps to make early detection more \ncommon.\n  For this reason, I am a strong supporter of the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early \nDetection Program, which has provided important cancer screening \nservices at low or no cost to more than three million low-income \nAmerican women who otherwise might not have been able to afford these \ncritically important tests. The Maine Breast and Cervical Health \nprogram is funded through this program and provides screening and \ndiagnostic services at 300 sites across the State. Since its inception, \nmore than 20,500 screenings have been conducted through this program in \nMaine, and 151 cases of breast cancer have been diagnosed. As one Maine \nwoman observed, ``This screening program was an answered prayer. I had \nbeen concerned about having to skip checkups lately, but there was no \nway to come up with the money any time soon. I will gladly tell all of \nmy friends about this and will gladly return for follow-up.''\n  Screening must be coupled with treatment if it is to save lives, and \nthat is why I also cosponsored legislation to provide the treatment \nnecessary to save the lives of the women who are diagnosed with cancer \nthrough this program. Since the screening program is targeted to low-\nincome women, many of those screened do not have health insurance and \nmany more are under-insured. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment \nAct, which has been signed into law, gives states the option of \nproviding treatment through the Medicaid program for woman diagnosed \nwith breast or cervical cancer through this screening program. I am \npleased to say that Maine is one of 45 states that have elected to take \nadvantage of this option.\n  Promising research is leading to major breakthroughs in preventing, \ntreating and curing breast cancer. There simply is no investment that \npromises greater returns for Americans than our investment in research, \nand I have been a strong proponent of congressional efforts to double \nour investment in biomedical research over five years. Last year, the \nNational Institutes of Health spent $640 billion on breast cancer \nresearch. This year that figure grew to nearly $700 million.\n  I was also pleased to join my colleague from California, Senator \nFeinstein, in introducing the National Cancer Act of 2003, which sets \nout a comprehensive national plan to combat cancer, with substantial \nand regular increases in the National Cancer Institute's budget. The \nlegislation also includes important provisions to increase access to \ncancer screening, clinical trials, cancer drugs, and high quality \ncancer care. I am hopeful that continued funding increases will allow \nus to accelerate our efforts to find better treatments, a means of \nprevention, and ultimately a cure for devastating diseases like breast \ncancer.\n  As National Breast Cancer Awareness Month comes to a close, we should \ncelebrate life and the progress we are making in the fight against this \ndisease. With determination and patience, we can limit the terrible \nimpact of the disease and bring hope to millions of women and their \nfamilies.\n  In closing, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the \ntremendous leadership of the senior Senator from Maine on this issue. \nSenator Snowe has been a tireless champion and advocate, and has led \nthe battle against breast cancer, first in the House and now in the \nSenate, on a number of fronts ranging from increased breast cancer \nresearch funding at the National Institutes of Health and Department of \nDefense to landmark legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis \nof genetic information. We should all be grateful for her efforts.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this week marks the close of National \nBreast Cancer Awareness Month, and today is a time for many of us to \nreflect on how cancer has touched virtually every American's life. \nAccording to the American Cancer Society, one in two men and one in \nthree women will be diagnosed with cancer. We have made important \nadvances in treating cancer victims, but we are not yet at our ultimate \ngoal of finding a cure.\n  I am pleased to announce that my alma mater, Michigan State \nUniversity, is one of the leaders in finding a cure for breast cancer. \nMichigan State was one of only four institutions nationwide to receive \na grant from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences \nand the National Cancer Institute to study the prenatal-to-adult \nenvironmental exposures that may predispose a woman to breast cancer.\n  But this is just a down-payment in ending breast cancer. It is \ngenerally believed that the environment plays some role in the \ndevelopment of breast cancer, but the extent of that role is not \nunderstood. If we can identify those risks, we can stop the disease. \nMore research needs to be done to determine the impact of the \nenvironment on breast cancer, which has been understudied in the past.\n  To do so, I urge my colleagues to support S.983, the Breast Cancer \nand Environmental Research Act, to ensure that this research continues. \nThis legislation would create a new mechanism for environmental health \nresearch and provide a unique process by which centers are selected. \nModeled after the Defense Department's Breast Cancer Research Program, \nwhich has been so successful, it would also include consumer advocates \nin the peer review and programmatic review process.\n  It would be amazing if the research about to be conducted at Michigan \nState led to a cure for breast cancer. But that dream can only happen \nif scientists, doctors, and others have the right resources. Let's \ncontinue to fight the war against cancer.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this week marks the close of National \nBreast Cancer Awareness Month. During the month of October, dedicated \nadvocates, breast cancer survivors, and health professionals \ncommemorate the tremendous progress we have made in the fight against \nbreast cancer, as well as raise awareness about the progress we hope to \nmake in the future.\n  In the last 10 years, we have accomplished many things. We have \nincreased funding for breast cancer research by 700 percent, passed the \nBreast Cancer Research Stamp Act, which has raised more than $30 \nmillion, and made sure that Medicare and Medicaid are required to cover \nmammograms. We have accomplished a lot, but we must continue to fight.\n  Breast cancer is second only to lung cancer in cancer deaths among \nwomen. An estimated 211,300 new invasive cases of breast cancer are \nexpected to occur among women in the United States during 2003. An \nestimated 39,800 women will die from breast cancer. While incidence \namong men is rare, we know that 400 men will also lose their lives this \nyear to breast cancer, an area in which we still have much to learn.\n  I wrote the Mammography Quality Standards Act more than 10 years ago \nto save women's lives. Before MQSA became law, there were no national \nquality standards. Image quality varied widely and there were no \ninspections. Now, when women get mammograms, they know the equipment \nmeets Federal safety and quality standards. Currently, I am working to \nreauthorize this important law before Congress adjourns.\n  In 1990, I fought for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening \nProgram to make sure women without health insurance have access to \nlifesaving tests like mammograms. Also, I fought for the Breast and \nCervical Cancer Treatment Act to help these women get the treatment \nthey need if they are diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer. My \ncolleagues and I on both sides of the aisle have worked together, \nespecially the women Senators and the Galahads of the Senate, like \nSenators Kennedy, Harkin, Grassley, and Specter.\n  For all that we have done, there is still more to do. We need to make \nsure women have the information they need about the importance of \nscreenings, make sure we have the best tools and best trained doctors \nfor diagnosis and treatment, and make sure uninsured women have access \nto health care. Also, we must be steadfast on research. I came to the \nU.S. Senate to change lives and save lives. I will continue to fight to \neradicate breast cancer.\n  Today, I commemorate the progress we have made and look towards the \nfuture. I will keep fighting to make sure\n\n[[Page S13654]]\n\nwomen's health is on the agenda, and breast cancer survivors, and the \nhealth professionals can make a difference in the lives of thousands of \nwomen. Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make change.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, every 3 minutes, a woman somewhere in \nthe United States is diagnosed with breast cancer.\n  Every 12 minutes, the same disease steals away another person's \nmother, wife, companion, or friend.\n  According to the National Cancer Institute, breast cancer is the most \ncommon form of cancer among women in the United States, and second only \nto lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths.\n  In my home State of Alaska it was predicted that another 300 women \nthis year would hear their doctor tell them ``you have breast cancer''.\n  I don't personally know the thoughts that run through these women's \nminds at that moment, but I think the best thing that we can do is to \nmake sure that the next thing that doctor can say is ``you caught it \nearly enough--we can cure it.''\n  Medical science says that the key to beating this cancer is early \ndetection and early intervention. That's why it's vitally important for \nwomen to be aware of this disease.\n  Women need to be vigilant, and need to follow medical recommendations \nregarding mammograms and self-exams. We have a number of courageous \nwomen in Alaska who fought breast cancer and are sharing their \nexperiences with other women, increasing awareness of the condition.\n  Alaskan survivors including Carla Williams and world-class dog musher \nDee Dee Jonrowe make time in their schedules to come and advocate on \nbehalf of those whose lives have been touched by breast cancer, and \nthey are doing a great job of raising awareness\n  We must continue this fight to increase awareness not only during \nOctober, National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but year round, and I \nthank my colleagues for the chance to speak about National Breast \nCancer Awareness Month.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I rise today to \nrecognize this month as ``National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.'' \nThis special month is meant to bring awareness to the continued \nprevalence of breast cancer and the importance of using early detection \ntechniques to help reduce the number of women and men who lose their \nbattle against breast cancer each year.\n  This year it is estimated that more than 200,000 new cases of breast \ncancer will be diagnosed. Through the use of early detection, many of \nthese cases will be successfully diagnosed and treated before the \ncancer spreads. However, breast cancer will also claim close to 40,000 \nvictims in this year alone.\n  To promote early detection of breast cancer, National Mammography Day \nis celebrated each October as a part of National Breast Cancer \nAwareness Month. This year, on October 17, many radiologists provided \nfree or discounted mammograms in an effort to encourage more women to \ntake part in this important screening. Mammography is an important tool \nto help detect breast cancer while it is still highly treatable.\n  Unfortunately, not all women have easy access to mammograms either \nbecause they are uninsured or their health insurance does not cover \nthis service. Further aggravating this issue is the low reimbursement \nof mammograms by Medicare, and the fact that not enough assistance is \navailable to train and recruit more radiologists to perform this vital \nscreening. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Assure Access \nto Mammography Act of 2003. This legislation increases the Medicare \nreimbursement for mammograms and helps in the recruitment of \nradiologists to perform mammograms. I am hopeful that it will be \nenacted soon.\n  Hardly a family or group of friends has not been affected by breast \ncancer in some way. Events such as the annual ``Race for the Cure'' in \nsupport of breast cancer prove that there is widespread support for \nfinding further treatment options and cures for this disease. I \nencourage those who are interested to visit the National Breast Cancer \nAwareness Month website to learn more at www.nbcam.org.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about breast cancer \nprevention, detection, and treatment, a cause I have championed \nthroughout my career as a public servant. I am proud to be a sponsor of \nmany bills to assist the breast cancer community in its fight to treat, \nprevent, and eventually eradicate this disease.\n  Like many Americans, my family life has been touched by the tragedy \nof cancer. The impact of this disease on men and women can not be \noverestimated. Breast cancer is the leading cancer among American \nwomen, second only to lung cancer in cancer deaths.\n  Each year, more than 200,000 Americans receive a diagnosis of breast \ncancer and nearly 40,000 die. What we must remember when confronted \nwith these overwhelming numbers, however, is that behind each statistic \nis a personal story of struggle and courage. I have heard many of these \nstories. Today, I would like to share the story of one Oregonian \nfighting to survive her own disease.\n  Life changed for Janet Romine on August 19, 1999. On that day, this \nenthusiastic and energetic teacher, wife and daughter reported to her \ndoctor for a regularly-scheduled mammogram. Unlike her previous \nmammograms, however, a lump was detected that required surgical biopsy. \nJanet wrote the story of her diagnosis for KGW Northwest News online. \nIn recollecting the wait between surgery and receiving the biopsy \nresults, Janet wrote: ``After the surgery, deep in my soul I knew this \nwas not a simple little lump. I felt violated, depressed and dark as I \nwaited for the phone call.''\n  In that call, Janet learned that the lump was malignant and would \nrequire surgery for its removal and 7 weeks of radiation and drug \ntherapy. Yet, just three days after her diagnosis, Janet participated \nin the Komen Foundation Race for the Cure in Portland, OR. Janet's \nfriends and teaching colleagues walked the race by her side, having \nadded Janet's name to their banners.\n  Janet describes her cancer diagnosis as a beginning, and not an \nending. Like the thousands of women who were diagnosed before her and \nthe thousands of women who will follow, Janet's life changed forever.\n  Sadly, stories of coping and courage are no longer rare. However, \nthere is some good news: the mortality rate from breast cancer has \ndeclined 2 percent each year for the last 10 years. It is imperative \nthat we fight to continue this trend by supporting increased funding \nfor breast cancer research, prevention, detection and treatment \nprograms.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about awareness \nand prevention of breast cancer. My wife Janet and I have always made \nthe early prevention and detection of breast cancer a top priority. \nDuring my tenure as Governor of Ohio, the State became one of only four \nStates to create an office within my administration devoted solely to \nwomen's health issues. The Office of Women's Health continues to \naddress women's health needs such as early prevention and detection of \nbreast cancer and recommends actions such as legislation or policy \ndevelopment.\n  I am so proud of Janet who is a champion of detection and prevention \nprocedures to combat breast cancer and that as First Lady she was \nsuccessful in lobbying the Ohio Legislature to designate the third \nThursday in October as Ohio Mammography Day. This year was Janet's \neleventh year traveling throughout the State on this day to stress the \nimportance of early breast cancer detection.\n  For all of Janet's work to promote early prevention and screenings \nfor breast cancer, the Ohio Breast and Cervical Cancer Coalition named \nan annual award after her. Janet continues to present the ``Janet \nVoinovich Service Award'' to recognize an individual's commitment to \nimproving the quality of life for cancer survivors.\n  Yet, there is more that needs to be done to find a cure for breast \ncancer and I have been fighting in the Senate to encourage the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, to take advantage of new technology to \nundertake innovative research in this field.\n  One research initiative that could give women a critical tool in the \nprevention of breast cancer is the study of environmental effects on \nthe occurrence of the disease. Some studies have suggested that \nenvironmental factors\n\n[[Page S13655]]\n\nlike diet, pesticides and electromagnetic fields could play a role in \nthe growth of breast cancer. Yet, to date, there have not been enough \ncomprehensive research initiatives to draw conclusions.\n  For this reason, in the 107th Congress and again this year, I \ncosponsored the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act to create \neight centers throughout the Nation to study the link between \nenvironmental factors and breast cancer. While we continue to work on \nthis bill in the Senate, I am so pleased that the NIH and the National \nInstitute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, have taken the first \nstep in creating four centers for this purpose. I was so proud to be at \nthe University of Cincinnati earlier this month to announce that the \nUniversity along with the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center \nhad been chosen to receive a NIH grant to establish one of the four \ncenters. The University of Cincinnati and Children's Hospital have a \nlong history of contribution to the quality of life and health in the \nGreater Cincinnati region and nationwide, and I am encouraged about the \nwork that is being done to determine the factors that cause breast \ncancer. We must work to make sure that quality research initiatives \nlike this one continue.\n  That is why I recently joined my colleagues in a letter of support \nfor the reauthorization of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp program. \nSince 1998, sales of the stamp have generated more than $34 million for \nbreast cancer research at Federal research facilities. In fact, the \nBreast Cancer Stamp is the most successful semi-postal in history, and \nI am confident that its reauthorization will continue to help fund \nlife-saving breast cancer research over the next several years.\n  Until we find a cure however, Janet and I will continue to do what we \ncan to promote awareness of breast cancer and help ensure that early \ndetection procedures are available to women who need them most.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the American Cancer Society estimates that \nin 2003, there will be 2,600 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed among \nwomen in Oregon and that 500 women will die of breast cancer in Oregon. \nOctober is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, so it is important that we \ntake stock of where we are in preventing, detecting and treating this \ndisease.\n  All women are at risk of breast cancer, but when this cancer is found \nin its early stages, the 5-year survival rate approaches 100 percent. \nScreening exams are especially important because through early \ndetection, women, in partnership with their health care providers, can \nsignificantly reduce deaths due to breast cancer.\n  A recent study published in the Archives of Surgery found that more \ncases of breast cancer were detected in women taking part in an Oregon \nbreast cancer screening program than in women who were not part of the \nprogram. The Oregon Breast Cancer and Cervical Cancer Program began in \n1996 and is a statewide screening program for low-income women with \nlittle access to medical services. In this study, Oregon Health \nSciences University researchers evaluated 15,730 women who had a total \nof 23,149 mammograms and 20,396 breast exams between January 1, 1997 \nand December 31, 2001. The study found the screening program had a \ndetection rate of 12.3 breast cancers per 1,000 women, which is greater \nthan rates of other screening programs. The women in this study \ndiagnosed with breast cancer also had a 97-percent rate of compliance \nwith suggested therapies for their cancer.\n  Working together, many groups have found that they can maximize their \nresources and develop more effective partnerships to reach health care \nconsumers and providers in Oregon. Despite the excellent job that is \nbeing done, we need to continue to foster this activism and continue to \nfind new ways to fund innovations in detection and treatment and to \nmake them accessible to all women.\n  In Oregon, the American Cancer Society, the Susan G. Komen Breast \nCancer Foundation, the Y.W.C.A, and the National Black Leadership \nInitiative on Cancer, are just a few of the leaders in the community \nwho have worked together and with other organizations to reach out to \nwomen in Oregon and their families to improve the health status of \nwomen in my home State. I want to thank them for their efforts in \nhelping Oregon families have better information and awareness about \nthis disease as well as helping women as they go through treatment.\n  I have always been a staunch supporter of Federal funds for breast \ncancer research, and I will continue to do so. It is gratifying to know \nwe have come so far and to see how we can make progress in fighting \nthis form of cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13655-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF MICHAEL GARCIA\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate Senator Collins, Chair of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, entering into a colloquy on a matter that concerns \nthe Judiciary Committee. In particular, our colloquy involves the \nnomination of Michael Garcia to be Assistant Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. Following our statements, I will seek a unanimous consent \nagreement to refer Mr. Garcia's nomination to the Judiciary Committee.\n  All committees derive their ``respective jurisdictions'' from Senate \nRule XXV, among other sources. As such the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, in its responsibility for the ``organization and \nreorganization of the executive branch of the Government,'' played a \ncrucial role in establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. I \nwould like to compliment Senator Collins on her leadership and the \nsignificant improvements that have resulted in our nation's security \nsince September 11th.\n  Also, under Senate Rule XXV, the Committee on the Judiciary has \njurisdiction over ``Immigration and naturalization.'' It is important \nfor the immigration and naturalization functions which have been \ntransferred from the Department of Justice and other law enforcement \nagencies to the Department of Homeland Security to remain under the \njurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee.\n  With the formation of three new bureaus for immigration policy in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, countless situations--from day-to-day \nimmigration services and enforcement to long-term border security \nplanning--will arise in which legislation affecting these bureaus and \noversight of these bureaus is an essential role of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I appreciate my colleague taking the time to clarify the \nconfirmation process of Mr. Garcia and the commitment to Senate Rules \nXXV and XXVI, Section 8 as it affects the Judiciary Committee's \njurisdiction.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I appreciate the Senator's comments and I look forward \nto working with him. I would also like to assure him that I do not \nbelieve the Governmental Affairs Committee's jurisdiction affects in \nany way the Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction over immigration and \nnaturalization matters, as set forth in Senate rule XXV. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee was responsible for the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002 which created the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The committee has conducted wide-ranging and vigorous \noversight of the Department and, this year alone, has reported out six \nbills that address homeland security concerns. In total, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has held over 30 hearing on homeland \nsecurity matters, thus reflecting the paramount role it plays with \nrespect to these matters.\n  The committee also has handled the nominations of almost all of the \nDepartment's nominees. On June 5th of this year, our committee held a \nhearing on Mr. Garcia's nomination. We reported his nomination to the \nfull Senate on June 17th. We then agreed to a referral of Mr. Garcia's \nnomination to the Judiciary Committee. I understand that my colleague, \nthe distinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, now seeks a \nsecond referral of the nomination in order to complete its work \nthereon. I have no objection to my colleagues' request.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair of the Governmental Affairs for her \ncomments and efforts on this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13655-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13655-S13656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN HONOR OF THE MEMORY OF PAUL WELLSTONE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nremember our friend Paul Wellstone, who died a year ago this month. All \nof us\n\n[[Page S13656]]\n\nfeel his loss so acutely here in this body. But his voice still echoes \nin this Chamber, and his spirit and fierce dedication to justice live \non. What so many of us loved about Paul was that unparalleled passion \nhe had for doing what was right. That still inspires me today, as it \ninspires so many others. And it is just one more reason to be thankful \nto Paul, and to honor his memory.\n  I think of Paul often as issues come before the Senate about which he \ncared so deeply. Earlier this month, as we observed Mental Illness \nAwareness Week, I thought of all Paul did to advocate for mental health \nparity throughout his time here, and what a vital contribution he made \nto getting affordable medical treatment to people suffering from mental \nillnesses. I have been proud to support this issue when it has come to \nthe floor, and last week I joined the entire Democratic caucus in \nurging the majority leader to take up and pass the Senator Paul \nWellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 2003. We must ensure \nthat mental illnesses are treated the same way as other physical \nillnesses by insurers.\n  Paul also fought to stop U.S. companies that move their headquarters \nto ``tax haven'' countries to avoid paying U.S. taxes from getting \nFederal procurement contracts. I am proud to be a part of the effort to \nmove that forward. I also am proud to help carry on Paul's work in the \nfight for a good public education for every child. Paul believed, as I \ndo, that every child is entitled to a good education no matter his or \nher circumstances in life. He called this ``equality of opportunity.'' \nI was proud to work with him on the issue of standardized testing. He \nand I agreed that over-testing of our public school students is not the \ncure-all for public education. I hope that my efforts to return \nauthority for decisions about how often to test students to the States \nand local school districts will, in some small way, build upon Paul's \nlegacy of fighting for a level playing field for all students.\n  These are just a few of the causes Paul worked on, and just a few of \nthe ways that he lives on in this body, and in the lives of the \ncountless Americans he touched through his lifetime. We can still hear \nhis voice echo in this chamber, urging all of us on to build a more \njust world. Let us honor Paul's memory by heeding his words, and \ncarrying on the great work of our dear friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13656-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I will describe one such crime that took place in El Paso, TX. In \nApril 2002, police qualified the murder of Hector Arturo Diaz as a hate \ncrime. Mr. Diaz was shot in the back by an acquaintance, Justen Hall. \nAt the time, Mr. Diaz, a transvestite, was dressed in female clothing.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. By \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13656-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           10TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED STATES HOLOCAUST MUSEUM\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, tomorrow, the United States Holocaust \nMemorial Museum will mark its 10th anniversary. More than 6,000 \nHolocaust survivors and family members will visit the museum this \nweekend to help commemorate the museum's important contributions. \nTogether, these men and women comprise a living legacy of the Shoah. By \nsharing their memories, these courageous survivors can help ensure that \nsuch evil is never again perpetrated against any people, anywhere.\n  America is a land of immigrants, and our history demonstrates that we \nare stronger because of our diversity, not in spite of it. But we can \nonly live up to the promise of our diversity if we recognize the \ninherent rights and freedom of all human life. One of the most powerful \nways we can remind each other and our children about the importance of \nthis fundamental principle is to ensure that the Holocaust is never \nforgotten.\n  For that reason it is fitting that the Holocaust Memorial Museum is \nlocated on the National Mall. Visitors to this cherished landmark can \nsee the Declaration of Independence, the Wright brothers' glider, and \nsome of America's most treasured art; all of them vivid reminders about \nthe capacity of the human spirit and the promise of mankind. Yet it is \njust as important to teach young people and remind adults about one of \nthe darkest chapters of human history. Although the Holocaust was a \nterrible tragedy that stained all humanity, it must never be hidden \nfrom view.\n  The Holocaust Memorial Museum plays a special role in teaching our \nchildren and grandchildren about this dark chapter in world history. \nThis haunting permanent memorial will ensure that future generations \nwill learn about this tragedy.\n  Survivors and liberators of the Holocaust have a unique opportunity \nto share the stories of this awful period. I thank them for having the \ncourage and dignity to survive the horrors of the Holocaust, and for \nhaving the bravery to share their experiences with others so that it \nmay never happen again. Their contributions will help all of us build a \nbetter America and a better world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13656-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13656-S13658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        U.S. POLICY TOWARD CUBA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of great \nconcern to me--the ban on travel to Cuba.\n  Last week, the Senate scored an important victory in the fight to \nbring common sense to U.S. policy toward Cuba. We voted by a wide \nmargin--59 to 36--to suspend enforcement of the travel ban. The House \napproved the same amendment in September, also by a wide margin.\n  The wide margin of victory reflects the majority of Americans who \nwant an end to the travel ban.\n  Over the weekend, editorial writers from a diverse range of \nnewspapers noted and applauded our victory: the Wall Street Journal, \nthe New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, and the Orlando Sentinel-\nTribune.\n  Let me offer just a few quotes: the Chicago Tribune says:\n\n       In an age of very real terrorist threats, Cuba hardly makes \n     the list. For the Department of Homeland Security to redouble \n     its efforts and tie up more money and personnel in enforcing \n     the travel ban against Cuba--as the president proposed two \n     weeks ago--is an incredible waste of resources.\n\n  The New York Times points out:\n\n       The proper response to such outrages as the Castro regime's \n     roundup of dissidents and writers earlier this year is to \n     seek to overwhelm the island with American influence.\n\n  And the Orlando Sentinel argues:\n\n       The ban on U.S. travel is futile, self-defeating, a waste \n     of scarce resources and inconsistent with other American \n     policies.\n\n  These papers spoke out in favor of the Senate's actions because they \nrecognize that the current policy has been a failure and because they \nknow that engagement with Cuba is the best and most effective way to \nbring democratic change to Cuba.\n  In my view, the Cuba travel provisions should not even be subject to \nconference. The House and Senate have passed the same amendment; there \nis nothing for conferees to discuss.\n  There are many Members of this body who have worked hard to ease the \nembargo. Any Treasury-Transportation conference report that does not \ninclude the Senate and House-passed language is unacceptable, and we \nwill look at all procedural options to stop this from happening.\n  That said, I fully expect this amendment to become law. Despite \nrecent incorrect reporting, none of the supporters of this legislation \nbelieve that we can't accomplish our goal of lifting the Cuba travel \nban.\n  And I have to say here that I do not believe the President will veto \nthis bill. Of course, the Cuba provisions have overwhelming support, \nbut the appropriations bill itself passed the Senate 90 to 3. The \nadministration knows a veto could be easily overridden.\n  I do believe that pro-embargo forces see the writing on the wall. \nMomentum to end the embargo is clearly building. We have had a year \nfilled with success.\n\n[[Page S13657]]\n\n  Several months ago, Senators Enzi, Dorgan, and I introduced \nlegislation, S. 950, that would permanently lift the travel ban. There \nare 31 cosponsors of that legislation, and we are adding new cosponsors \nthis week.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has committed to vote on that \nlegislation by the end of the year, and I expect the committee to \napprove it by a large majority.\n  Recent polls indicate that most Americans oppose the travel ban. In \nfact, even most Cuban Americans--historically supportive of the \nembargo--favor lifting the ban.\n  So the Senate and the House votes are only the latest rebuke of an \noutdated policy.\n  Thirteen of the 16 Senate appropriators on the Subcommittee were \nsupportive of the Cuba amendment. And I am confident they will work \nhard to keep this provision. But I also know they will be under some \npressure. I urge them to stand up to those who might try to defy the \nwill of the Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the aforementioned \neditorials.\n  There being on objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 27, 2003]\n\n                              Havana Club\n\n       The Bush Administration, more than most, contains people \n     whose families have paid a personal price for the horror that \n     is Cuban communism. Which is why it's a little unfair, after \n     last week's Senate vote to lift the U.S. travel ban to Cuba, \n     to dismiss the White House objections merely as worry that \n     signing such language would hurt the President's re-election \n     chances in Florida.\n       Yes, the Cuban-American vote is a big deal, as Bill Clinton \n     recognized when he courted Miami's anti-Castro community and \n     cash in his election runs. And given that the Senate vote \n     approving the lifting of the travel restrictions was less \n     than the two-thirds required to override any veto, we'd be \n     surprised if the White House doesn't make good on its threat. \n     But the tension here reflects what is a genuine argument \n     among conservatives over what is the best way to bring Fidel \n     Castro down.\n       Otto Reich of the National Security Council staff and \n     Housing Secretary Mel Martinez believe that lifting such \n     restrictions will breathe financial life into a decaying \n     regime. Some of our free market friends in Congress, notably \n     Arizona Republican Jeff Flake, argue that after 40 years of \n     an embargo Fidel is still sitting pretty. So it's time to try \n     something different.\n       We fall into the latter group, not least because one of the \n     problems with the existing travel ban is that it is applied \n     selectively. Privileged groups of people--academics, \n     journalists, Cuban Americans and left-leaning Christian \n     groups--can and already do travel to Cuba. Jimmy Carter \n     travels there and CNN more or less treats it like a state \n     visit.\n       But we're also impressed by Oswaldo Paya, leader of Cuba's \n     homegrown answer to Poland's Solidarity movement, who wants \n     to see the U.S. embargo lifted. Mr. Paya points out that the \n     heart of the Cuban crisis isn't the partial embargo the U.S. \n     has imposed on Cuba but is the total embargo Fidel has \n     imposed on his own people: the limits on their speech, their \n     ability to go to church, to run their own enterprises, and so \n     on.\n       As Mr. Flake has written, Fidel's three most obvious \n     failures are ``breakfast, lunch and dinner.'' The more \n     Americans are able to travel to Cuba, the more will be able \n     to see for themselves the suffering that Fidel and his \n     commissars have wrought.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Orlando Sentinel, Oct. 25, 2003]\n\n                        Lift Ban on Cuba Travel\n\n       Our position: Removing restrictions on U.S. travel would \n     expose Cubans to free ideas.\n       The U.S. Senate took a courageous and correct stand on Cuba \n     policy last week.\n       Fifty-nine senators defied a veto threat from President \n     George W. Bush in voting against the ban on U.S. travel to \n     Cuba. Like a majority of U.S. House members, those senators \n     realize that the ban is--if anything--counterproductive.\n       The ban is political rather than practical. It pleases many \n     Cuban-Americans in Florida, but it and other hard-line \n     measures haven't dislodged dictator Fidel Castro.\n       Restricting the freedom of U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba \n     limits the communist island's exposure to American ideas. It \n     also helps conceal the extent of repression in Cuba from \n     Americans. Those are both big favors for Mr. Castro.\n       The greatest threat to any totalitarian government is the \n     free flow of information. That explains why independent \n     journalists and librarians were targeted in the Castro \n     government's brutal crackdown on dissidents earlier this \n     year.\n       Enforcing the ban on U.S. travel to Cuba also ties up \n     limited resources in both the Homeland Security and Treasury \n     departments. Those resources would be better directed toward \n     fighting terrorism.\n       Predictably, the White House criticized the Senate vote, \n     saying it would ``provide a helping hand to a desperate and \n     repressive regime.'' But Mr. Bush's hard line on Cuba is \n     contradicted by his continuing engagement with China, another \n     repressive communist regime.\n       The ban on U.S. travel to Cuba is futile, self-defeating, a \n     waste of scarce resources and inconsistent with other \n     American policies. It's past time to lift it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 25, 2003]\n\n                     Congressional Resolve on Cuba\n\n       Though normally inclined to follow their president's lead \n     on foreign policy, many Congressional Republicans have now \n     broken ranks on Cuba. By a wide margin, the Senate joined the \n     House on Thursday in voting to ease travel restrictions to \n     Cuba, just two weeks after President Bush vowed to toughen \n     sanctions on the government of Fidel Castro and enforce them \n     more energetically. The renegade Republicans apparently think \n     that Mr. Bush's approach is dictated less by a coherent \n     vision than by electoral concerns involving anti-Castro \n     Republican voters in Florida.\n       This Congressional resolve is commendable. Four decades of \n     sanctions have allowed Mr. Castro to portray himself, both at \n     home and abroad, as a victim of Yankee imperialism. Mr. \n     Castro would probably be as disappointed as his adversaries \n     in Florida to see the sanctions lifted.\n       That is one reason he has a knack for provoking a backlash \n     anytime there is a chance of a change in the status quo, \n     which may be the best of all words for Mr. Castro. The \n     dollars sent home from Florida relatives and the money spent \n     by European tourists have kept the rickety Cuban economy \n     afloat since the Soviet collapse. At the same time, sanctions \n     imposed by the United States have kept democratizing \n     influences at bay and provided the regime with a \n     justification for its authoritarian ways.\n       The proper response to such outrages as the Castro regime's \n     roundup of dissidents and writers earlier this year is to \n     seek to overwhelm the island with American influence--\n     corporate and cultural--and with American tourists and other \n     private visitors. This is the approach we take in trying to \n     democratize other nations.\n       The Senate's measure, an amendment to a $90 billion \n     spending bill to finance the Treasury and Transportation \n     Departments, is identical to a provision approved \n     overwhelmingly by the House. Such agreement means it will be \n     hard for Republican leaders to try to kill the amendment \n     behind closed doors. That leaves the possibility of a \n     presidential veto, though the White House cannot relish the \n     idea of holding up government spending to placate parochial \n     interests in Florida, no matter how powerful. As the main \n     beneficiary of this failed policy, Mr. Castro may want to \n     call Mr. Bush and encourage him to get that veto pen ready.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Oct. 27, 2003]\n\n                       Congress' Message on Cuba\n\n       Cues that it's time for the United States--and particularly \n     the Bush administration--to abandon the 40-year-old embargo \n     on Cuba got considerably louder on Thursday, when the Senate \n     voted 59-36 to life the ban on travel by U.S. citizens. The \n     Senate measure is identical to one passed by the House a \n     month ago.\n       The White House, tuned to an altogether different \n     wavelength, threatens to veto any bill loosening the economic \n     and travel sanctions against Cuba. Two weeks ago, President \n     Bush--surrounded by a supportive group of Cuban exiles from \n     Miami--announced measures to tighten the economic noose \n     around the island.\n       It's no secret that the president wants to nail down the \n     votes of the fervidly anti-Castro Cuban-American community.\n       But at what cost? Congress supports lifting the embargo, \n     and so do many conservative Republican politicians and \n     business interests--particularly in the Midwest. It is time \n     to end the Cold War sideshow of the Cuban embargo.\n       Never has the American obsession with Cuba seemed so out of \n     proportion or self-defeating, particularly for a Republican \n     administration, as it does now. This is a question of \n     national interest, not the political interests of the tiny \n     but vociferous Cuban-American community.\n       Thursday's vote in the senate, on an amendment to the \n     Transportation and Treasury spending bill, was important for \n     several reasons. It showed a significant policy shift in the \n     Senate since 1999, when the upper chamber rejected lifting \n     the travel restrictions on 55-43 vote.\n       Supporters this time included 19 Republicans, including \n     several from farm states such as Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. \n     Sen. Dick Durbin voted for the amendment. Sen. Peter \n     Fitzgerald voted against it.\n       Fitzgerald ought to pay attention. Lifting the travel ban \n     is a critical step toward eventually lifting the U.S. embargo \n     on Cuba and opening the door for more trade. Illinois firms \n     such as Archer Daniels Midland Co. benefit from increased \n     sales of foodstuffs to Cuba, so far conducted on a cash-only \n     basis. Last year total exports to Cuba reached nearly $140 \n     million, but it is estimated if all restrictions were lifted, \n     that figure could increase significantly. Cuba would get \n     better prices--Texas' rice is far closer than China's--and \n     American farmers, strapped for markets, could benefit too.\n       In an age of very real terrorist threats, Cuba hardly makes \n     the list. For the Department of Homeland Security to redouble \n     its\n\n[[Page S13658]]\n\n     efforts and tie up more money and personnel in enforcing the \n     travel ban against Cuba--as the president proposed two weeks \n     ago--is an incredible waste of resources.\n       This legislation is likely headed to conference committee, \n     where GOP leaders must make sure the Cuba language doesn't \n     mysteriously disappear. Congress ought to make clear its \n     resolve to end the pointless flogging of Cuba. The embargo \n     only intensifies the misery of the long-suffering Cubans \n     while shortchanging U.S. economic and political interests. \n     That makes no sense at all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13658-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              CONGRATULATIONS TO MRS.

Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues the \nmemory of a remarkable man, James ``Jack'' Meehan of Santa Cruz, CA, \nwho died on Saturday, October 25, 2003. Throughout his life he compiled \nan extraordinary record of devotion to his family, his community and \nour Nation. Jack was an 84-year-old longtime Santa Cruz resident, \nformer Santa Cruz City Planning Commissioner and Santa Cruz Port \nDistrict Commissioner, pilot, space industry pioneer, community \nvolunteer and beloved husband, father and grandfather.\n  Jack was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. He married Brenda McGourty \nin 1942 and she remained his devoted partner for 57 years until her \ndeath in 1999. Jack and Brenda had three children: daughter Diana and \nsons Terry and Tom.\n  He served as an Army air corps pilot in Europe during World War II. \nAfter his plane was shot down, Jack's bravery helped him successfully \nevade capture. We will always be grateful for Jack's heroic service \ndefending our Nation, our freedoms and our way of life.\n  During the 1950s, Jack put his aviation skills to use as a Viking \nrocket designer and tester in New Mexico. He was a pioneer in this \nfield because the Viking rocket was a precursor to the Vanguard rocket \nwhich launched America's first satellite.\n  In 1959, Jack and his family settled in beautiful Santa Cruz. Jack \ntested satellites at Lockheed Martin in nearby Sunnyvale. He continued \nto pilot small planes until he gave that up in 1977. But of course, \nJack's irrepressible spirit kept him very active, and he began boating \nin the Monterey Bay. Like everything Jack did, he gave boating his all \nand joined the Coast Guard Auxiliary, assisting in sea rescues. He also \ntaught weather forecasting and radio communications.\n  In 1981, he was appointed to the Santa Cruz Port Commission, a \nposition to which he was twice re-elected over the next 17 years. He \nalso served as a Santa Cruz City Planning Commissioner.\n  After Jack retired, he was a devoted volunteer for the Santa Cruz \nCounty Red Cross. He built HAM radio systems, travelled and practiced \nhis French language skills. Recalls his son Tom, ``Sports cars, TV's, \nHAM radios and computers were all puzzles to be unwrapped with his \ntools and insight.''\n  His daughter Diana commented, ``I most admire that he was brave and \nloving. He was romantic, tender and funny with my mother. He was a \ncaring father.'' Throughout his life, Jack was constantly helping \nanyone in need. As one friend and neighbor explained of Jack and \nBrenda, ``they always served the community.''\n  Jack had a wonderful sense of humor. Even when he was sick and in the \nhospital, his caregivers would leave the room smiling because of his \njoking. ``He had a quick wit that was kind, playful and relentless. He \nhad a distinctive Jack Meehan laugh and you could find him in airports \nand crowded restaurants by that laugh,'' remembered son Terry. Added \nson Tom, ``Whenever asked about his favorite time of life, he would \nalways respond `right now, and in the future.' ''\n  James ``Jack'' Meehan is survived by his daughter Diana, sons Terry \nand Tom and six grandchildren. He was an exceptional man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13658-5", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13658-6", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13658-7", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13658-S13659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:29 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1720.

A bill to provide for comprehensive fire safety standards \nfor upholstered furniture, mattresses, bedclothing, and candles; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this Congress has worked towards \nproviding the brave men and women who fight fires the funds and \nmaterial to better perform their crucial tasks. We all saw brave \nmembers of the fire service sacrifice their lives to rescue people from \nthe World Trade Center. But we do not see firefighters in every town in \nAmerica risking their lives every day to save lives and homes from the \nravages of fire. I lost a home to a severe fire, and I saw the \nherculean efforts of my local firefighters to save it. Too many people \ndie or suffer grievous injuries from home fires. During a recent visit \nwith the firefighters from my home State of South Carolina, they told \nme that in spite of their best efforts, nearly 40 people die each year \nfrom home fires.\n  In my conversations with fire services across the country, I hear two \nthings. First, the departments need funds for equipment and training. \nWith the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement grant program, \nwe are on our way to getting these people the resources they need to do \ntheir job. There is more work to do, but this grant program is a start. \nSecond, and most troubling, is that the best-equipped and best-trained \nfire departments cannot out race most home fires.\n  A recent FEMA-commissioned study from the National Fire Protection \nAssociation reported that 65 percent of our fire departments cannot \nrespond within 4 minutes of receiving an alarm. The fire that engulfed \nthe nightclub in Rhode Island is an unfortunate example of what we are \ndealing with in regard to fire fighting and fire safety. The fire \ndepartment arrived within 5 minutes of the fire starting, which is \nexceptionally fast, yet 100 people died that night. Most of them died \nwithin 2 minutes of the fire starting.\n  Addressing the equipment and training of the fire service is one very \nimportant component to fighting fires. We've begun to address this need \nin recent years with the Firefighter Investment and Response \nEnhancement\n\n[[Page S13662]]\n\n(FIRE) Act, which I co-sponsored and helped move through the Commerce \nCommittee in 2000. This established the FIRE grants that have helped \nlocal fire departments across the country acquire the equipment and \ntraining to improve their operations. I've also worked with Senator \nChris Dodd, D-CT, on the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency \nResponse (SAFER) Act, which would provide the funding to hire 75,000 \nnew firefighters. The legislation is modeled on the success of the COPS \nprogram.\n  But the soundproofing materials that fed that fire in Rhode Island \nare identical to ingredients used in furniture in our homes. Indeed, \nthe majority of fire deaths occur in homes. So we must address the \nunderlying causes of home fires, the fuel that feeds them. We need to \nreduce the ignition potential of household items.\n  In 1998, residential fires killed 2,660 Americans, and injured \n15,260. Senior citizens over 70 and children under 5 are at the \ngreatest risk of dying in a fire; children under the age of 10 \naccounted for 17 percent of fire-related deaths in 1996. Fires also \ncause $3.5 billion in residential property loss each year.\n\n  It is in this context that Senators John Breaux, D-LA, Olympia Snowe, \nR-ME, Barbara Boxer, D-CA, Byron Dorgan, D-ND, Lindsey Graham, R-SC and \nI introduce the American Home Fire Safety Act. The Act would establish \nminimum combustibility standards for mattresses, upholstered furniture, \ncandles and bed clothing. American manufacturers already have cost-\neffective technology to improve the safety of these products, and are \nready to make products that meet the higher standards.\n  The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission already has the \nauthority to set fire safety standards for these products. Yet, despite \noverwhelming evidence that new standards would save lives, the \nCommission has been slow to address this issue. There are some who ask \nfor more time for the Commission to work on this issue. More than 20 \nyears have passed since the Commission has addressed product fire \nsafety. There is no more time to waste.\n  We have taken great care to select standards that were developed with \nthe best available science and broad input from scientists at NIST and \nASTM, fire safety officials, industry and consumers. The Act explicitly \nasks the EPA to ensure that nothing done in the pursuit of fire safety \nwould harm Americans in other ways. The standards in the Act will \nimprove safety and over time will save many lives.\n  Companies have the technology right now to address fire safety in an \neconomically responsible way. The number of lives we lose now to home \nfires can be dramatically reduced by the standards in this legislation. \nI ask for your support in making this a reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1798\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Home Fire Safety \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There were 12,800 candle fires in 1998, resulting in \n     170 deaths, 1,200 civilian injuries, and $174,600,000 in \n     property damage.\n       (2) In 1998, mattress and bedding fires caused 410 deaths, \n     2,260 civilian injuries, and $255,400,000 in property damage.\n       (3) The United States mattress industry has a long history \n     of working closely with safety officials to reduce mattress \n     flammability. For the past 25 years, mattresses have been \n     subject to a Federal flammability standard that requires \n     mattresses to resist ignition by smoldering cigarettes.\n       (4) Nevertheless, in 1998, fires involving mattresses and \n     bedding accessories (which include pillows, comforters, and \n     bedspreads) caused 410 deaths, 2,260 civilian injuries, and \n     $255,400,000 in property damage.\n       (5) In many such fires, the bedding accessories are the \n     first products to ignite. Such products have a material \n     impact on the fire's intensity, duration, and the risk that \n     the fire will spread beyond the room of origin.\n       (6) Upholstered furniture fires were responsible for 520 \n     deaths in 1998, with little statistical change in the number \n     of fires and deaths since 1994.\n       (7) While the fire death rates for upholstered furniture \n     fires have dropped during the period 1982 through 1994 for \n     both California and the entire Nation, death rates in \n     California, which has stricter standards, have dropped by a \n     larger percentage than the nation as a whole.\n       (8) Children, the elderly, and lower income families are at \n     higher risk of death and injury from upholstered furniture \n     fires caused primarily by the in creasing incidents of \n     children playing with matches, candles, lighters, or other \n     small open flames.\n       (9) In view of the increased incidents of fire, it is \n     important for Congress to establish fire safety standards for \n     candles, mattresses, bed clothing, and upholstered furniture.\n       (10) The Consumer Product Safety Commission is the \n     appropriate agency to develop and enforce such standards.\n       (11) The Environmental Protection Agency should continue to \n     review and determine the suitability of any materials used to \n     meet any fire safety standard established as a result of this \n     Act.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to protect the public against death and injury from \n     fires associated with candles, mattresses, bed clothing, and \n     upholstered furniture; and\n       (2) to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \n     develop and issue comprehensive uniform safety standards to \n     reduce the flammability of candles, mattresses, bed clothing, \n     and upholstered furniture.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONSUMER PRODUCT FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Within 90 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, the Consumer Product Safety Commission shall \n     promulgate, as final consumer product safety standards under \n     section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2058), the following fire safety standards:\n       (1) Upholstered furniture.--A fire safety standard for \n     upholstered furniture that is substantially the same as the \n     provisions of Technical Bulletin 117, ``Requirements, Test \n     Procedure and Apparatus for testing the Flame and Smolder \n     Resistance of Upholstered Furniture)'' published by the State \n     of California, Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Home \n     Furnishings and Thermal Insulation, February 2002.\n       (2) Mattresses.--A fire safety standard for mattresses that \n     is substantially the same as Technical Bulletin 603, \n     ``Requirements and Test Procedure for Resistance of a \n     Residential Mattress/Box Spring Set to a Large Open Flame'', \n     published by the State of California, Department of Consumer \n     Affairs, Bureau of Home Furnishings and Thermal Insulation, \n     February 2003.\n       (3) Bedclothing.--A fire safety standard for bedclothing \n     that is substantially the same as the October 22, 2003, draft \n     for task force review of Technical Bulletin 604, ``Test \n     Procedure and Apparatus for the Flame Resistance of Filled \n     Bedclothing'', published by the State of California, \n     Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Home Furnishings \n     and Thermal Insulation, October 2003.\n       (4) Candles.--A fire safety standard for candles that is \n     substantially the same as Provisional Standard PS 59-02, \n     ``Provisional Specification for Fire Safety for Candles'', \n     ASTM International, as that provisional standard existed on \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Application of Certain Promulgation Requirements.--The \n     requirements of subsections (a) through (f) of section 9 of \n     the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058), and section \n     36 of that Act (15 U.S.C. 2083), do not apply to the consumer \n     product safety standards required to be promulgated by \n     subsection (a) of this section.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the American \nHome Fire Safety Act authored by my colleague Senator Hollings. I am \npleased to co-sponsor this legislation along with Senators Graham of \nSouth Carolina, Breaux, Boxer and Dorgan. While the purpose of our bill \nis to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to implement \nnational standards for mattresses, upholstered furniture, candles and \nbedding, our ultimate goal is to save lives.\n  According to the Consumer Products Safety Commission and the National \nFire Protection Association, in 1998, the last year for which \nstatistics are available, American homes suffered over 330,000 fires \nserious enough to require a response from firefighters. In those fires, \nmore than 2,600 Americans died and another 15,000 suffered injuries \nrequiring medical treatment. The property loss from those fires totaled \nover $3.5 billion.\n  Of the many items first ignited in residential fires, upholstered \nfurniture is the product most frequently involved in fire deaths (20 \npercent) followed by mattresses and bedding (15 percent). Among the \ndifferent forms of heat involved in the ignition of fires, smoking \nmaterials accounted for 30 percent of fire deaths with candles \naccounting for six percent of the fire deaths, followed by lighters at \nfive percent and matches at three percent.\n  Effective fire protection depends on redundancy. Public education, \nbuilding\n\n[[Page S13663]]\n\ncodes, smoke detectors, and automatic fire sprinklers each are \nimportant but imperfect tools where they exist--and too often they do \nnot. The fact is that even with these tools available, more than 900 \nAmericans--that's five of our fellow citizens every two days--die every \nyear in fires involving cigarettes, small open flames such as candles, \nupholstered furniture, mattresses and bedding.\n  Those are the numbers--but there is a tragedy behind every one of \nthem. Let me speak just for a moment about one such tragedy that \nvisited my state one cold night in January of 2000. That night a young \nboy of six playing with a lighter ignited the sofa bed he was on and in \nthe ensuing fire he and his two brothers--they were triplets--perished. \nBut the tragedy doesn't stop there because one of the volunteer \nfirefighters who responded that night, Waldo County Sheriff Robert \nJones, suffered a fatal heart attack while fighting the blaze. No, Mr. \nPresident, this is not just about the numbers--although they are \nstaggering--it is about the human tragedy.\n  The American Home Fire Safety Act will require the United States \nConsumer Product Safety Commission to enforce specific fire safety \nstandards for each of these products. These are not new, burdensome \nstandards--in fact, they are standards already established by the \nAmerican Society of Testing and Materials or the state of California. \nAmerican manufacturers of mattresses, upholstered furniture, candles \nand bedding have already developed cost-effective technology and \nprocesses to make these household goods less flammable than current \nproducts. Collectively--and in combination with existing fire \nprotection technologies--we hope to save hundreds of lives, avoid \nthousands of serious injuries and billions of dollars in lost property.\n  Finally, I would like to point out that this legislation has been \nendorsed by the National Fire Protection Association, the National \nVolunteer Fire Council, the Western Fire Chiefs Association, the \nNational Association of State Fire Marshals and numerous state Fire \nChief's Associations. I urge my colleagues to support this bill to \nestablish national standards for some of the household products at the \ncore of residential fires. By doing so, perhaps we can spare our fellow \nAmericans needless suffering.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 1800. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to enhance \nliteracy in finance and economics, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the College Literacy \nin Finance and Economics or College LIFE Act. I would like to thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Sarbanes and Corzine, for their cosponsorship of \nthis important legislation.\n  The problem we're working to address with the College LIFE Act is \nsimple. Our college students are many of America's best and the \nbrightest. They hold the promise of our country in their hands and will \ngo on to become leaders--in business, education, politics, the \nmilitary, the community--any field you can name. It is wonderful that \nso many people are pursuing and fulfilling their dreams of higher \neducation in numbers that I did not imagine when I was in college. In \nfact, as reported by the American Council on Education, total college \nenrollment surged by 3 million or nearly 27 percent over the past 20 \nyears. However, I am gravely concerned, both as a member of this body \nand particularly as a grandparent and great-grandparent, that our young \npeople are entering college without proper direction or good skills for \nmoney management or economic decisionmaking.\n  As we work on increasing access to higher education, we must give \nstudents access to the tools that they need to make sound economic and \nfinancial decisions once they are on campus. However, the lack of \npersonal finance and economics State K-12 education standards or \nimplementation of existing standards in K-12 education in a number of \nStates results in many students arriving at college with little \nunderstanding of economic concepts like supply and demand or benefits \nversus costs, or personal finance concepts such as household money \nmanagement or the importance of maintaining good credit history. \nWithout this basic understanding, college students are not effectively \nevaluating credit alternatives, managing their debt, and preparing for \nlong-term financial goals, such as saving for a home or retirement.\n  We can try to imagine what it's like to be a college student's shoes. \nA young adult leaves his home and travels thousands of miles, as do \nmany Hawaii students attending mainland colleges, to the campus that \nholds his hopes and dreams. Perhaps farthest from his mind is how \nlittle spending money he has for textbooks, a new college sweatshirt, \nand school supplies. He gets to the campus bookstore and walks out with \na bag that includes a preapproved credit card application, which he \nimmediately fills out and mails. Months later, he has joined many other \ncredit card-holding college student who, on average, have a credit card \nbill balance above $3,000. His sophomore year rolls around and, instead \nof conferring with his parents about the details of his renewal FAFSA \nfor student financial aid or master promissory note, he is saddled with \nanother $10,000 loan. According to The College Board, average college \ntuition and fees in 2003-04 increased to $19,710 for a four-year \nprivate institution and to $4,694 for a 4-year public institution. The \nsame scenario repeats itself for his junior and senior years. Finally, \nafter successfully completing all of his coursework, he graduates, \nfinds an entry-level job, and realizes that, after servicing his debt, \nhe has little money left for basics such as food, transportation, and \nrent, much less new career clothing or social outings. His lack of \nknowledge about how to properly use credit has led him to anxiety-\ncausing financial missteps. With appropriate financial and economic \nliteracy, he may have known what debt load to anticipate and made wiser \nfinancing and spending decisions while in school.\n\n  Rather, he may be on the road to true financial trouble. Dan \nIannicola, Jr., Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for \nFinancial Education, testified before a House subcommittee on Tuesday, \nthat 40 percent of Americans say they live beyond their means, with the \naverage American household having $8,900 in credit card debt in 2002--\nup from $3,200 just 10 years earlier. In 2001, more people filed for \nbankruptcy than graduated from college. Furthermore, the most recent \nFederal Reserve Bulletin reported that Americans currently pay 13.3 \npercent of after-tax income to service their debts, which increases to \n18.1 percent when we add other recurring liabilities such as rent and \nauto leases. We must ensure that our youth make the right decisions to \nfollow a better financial path, especially considering a report cited \nby Mr. Iannicola noting that youth spent more than $172 billion in a \nrecent year, and figures from MarketResearch.com noting that typical 8- \nto 14-year-olds now spend--from allowances, jobs, and gifts--about \n$1,294 a year or $25 a week.\n  The College LIFE (Literacy in Finance and Economics) Act represents a \ncomprehensive approach to assist upcoming generations of Americans. It \nproposes four new grant programs that provide resources to encourage \nexperimentation with delivery systems--innovation methods used in or \nout of the classroom to increase college students' financial literacy. \nAnother grant would allow higher education institutions to share best \npractices about or create personal finance courses where none exist. A \nthird grant would assist efforts that are looking at the best ways to \nintegrate personal finance and economic education into basic \neducational subjects, which is especially important as schools are \nfacing challenges under the No Child Left Behind Act and are tempted to \nfocus on subjects being tested for Annual Yearly Progress. The final \ngrant would train teachers and high school counselors toward increasing \nfinancial and economic literacy in grades K-12 so that our college \nstudents are prepared when they arrive at college campuses.\n  The bill also proposes a pilot program for five higher education \ninstitutions to encourage students to take a personal finance course \nand participate in preventive annual credit counseling, working in \nconjunction with state or local public, private, and nonprofit entities \nselected by the local education\n\n[[Page S13664]]\n\nagency or the school, and measuring the effectiveness of efforts in any \nbehavioral changes that may result. It promotes greater collaboration \nwith and support from Federal agencies in the higher education arena \nwith respect to economic and financial literacy. Finally, it emphasizes \nthe importance of personal finance and economic education and \ncounseling by authorizing these activities as allowable uses in \nexisting Higher Education Act programs, such as TRIO, GEAR UP, and \nTitle III and Title V Serving Institutions.\n  Furthermore, I intend the reach of this bill to be beyond the \ntraditional college student. Our returning college students are a vital \npart of society--many who are already community leaders and \nbreadwinners for their families who have already gained valuable work \nexperience that they may use as they learn a new field or continue \ntheir undergraduate study in the pursuit of a graduate or doctoral \ndegree. In addition, older adults who are entering higher education for \nthe first time can also be lauded for their enterprising spirit in \nwanting to better their lives by earning an associates or bachelors \ndegree. I anticipate that the assistance provided through the College \nLIFE Act will work to provided needed help to many of these students as \nwell.\n\n  I have been working on this bill over the better part of this year \nwith several organizations in the higher education and economic and \nfinancial literacy community. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record after my statement letters of support for the legislation \nfrom the National Council on Economic Education, Jump$tart Coalition \nfor Personal Financial Literacy, and Family, Career and Community \nLeaders of America. I thank these and other organizations for their \nconstant efforts in this area. For example, the National Council for \nCommunity and Education Partnerships (NCCEP) supports a provision \nincluding economic and financial literacy and counseling as allowable \nactivities for the GEAR-UP program, which provides comprehensive \nmentoring, counseling, outreach, and supportive services to cohorts of \ndisadvantaged students. Emphasis on economic and financial literacy as \nincluded in the bill would complement NCCEP'S current GEAR-UP \nactivities that underscore the importance of the college-going \nexperience and pursuit of postsecondary education--including \ndiscussions about financial aid, debt, grants vs. loans, savings, and \ntax credits--and involving parents or guardians to inform them on the \ncosts of college and how to prepare for their child's entry into \ncollege. I will continue to work with these and other organizations \ntoward increasing literacy in finance and economics for our students \nbefore they enter higher education and once they arrive on college \ncampuses.\n  I am looking forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to have \nthe College LIFE Act passed or included in the upcoming Higher \nEducation Act reauthorization. I encourage my colleagues' support for \nthis bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the Material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                  National Council\n\n\n                                        on Economic Education,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2003.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: For over 50 years, the National Council \n     on Economic Education (NCEE), through its nationwide network \n     of State Councils and University Centers for Economic \n     Education, has been the nation's premier organization for \n     promoting effective economic education, by training teachers \n     to get basic economic knowledge and decision-making skills \n     into the heads and hands of our young people, K-12.\n       NCEE's mission is to ensure the effective teaching of the \n     real-life skills people need to succeed in an increasingly \n     complex world: to be able to think and choose knowledgeably \n     as consumers, savers, and investors, responsible citizens, \n     members of the workforce, and effective participants in the \n     global economy.\n       Because of our nationwide university and college base, we \n     at the National Council on Economic Education (NCEE) strongly \n     endorse the College LIFE (Literacy in Finance and Economics) \n     Act.\n       The College LIFE (Literacy in Finance and Economics) Act, \n     which seeks to provide university students with personal \n     finance counseling, and to prepare teachers and high school \n     counselors to equip our young people with personal finance \n     knowledge and skills, could not come at a better time.\n       This is a time of growing public interest in personal \n     finance education. Parents everywhere want their children to \n     know how the world works before they go to work in it, and to \n     possess the basic knowledge and decision-making skills that \n     will help them to become productive and responsible citizens, \n     employees, consumers, savers and investors. Any legislation \n     that advances that effort in a sustained, systematic way has \n     our support.\n       The NCEE is pleased to support the College LIFE (Literacy \n     in Finance and Economics) Act. Please keep us informed of its \n     progress.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                 Robert F. Duvall,\n     President & Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Jump$tart Coalition,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2003.\n     Senator Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of the Jump$tart Coalition \n     for Personal Financial Literacy (a coalition of 150 \n     organizations promoting personal finance education for \n     youth), we thank you for sponsoring the College Literacy in \n     Finance and Economics (College LIFE) Act.\n       The passage of this Act would signify an elevation in \n     importance of the issue of youth financial literacy by Higher \n     Education. The problems related to financially illiterate \n     young adults need to be addressed. We cannot continue the \n     ten-fold increase in young adults filing bankruptcy that we \n     have seen in the past five years. Nor can we afford to have \n     young adults dropping out of college due to heavy credit card \n     debt or not understanding the importance of investing for \n     their retirement.\n       In light of these distressing problems, it is imperative \n     that we start to embed personal finance and economic \n     education more widely into our college and university \n     curricula. Currently the percentage of college students \n     having the opportunity to enroll in such classes is small \n     considering their lack of promotion and availability.\n       The good news is that education is the answer and the \n     solution is found through existing resources. A wide \n     selection of curricula (many free or low cost) in addition to \n     teacher training networks and guest speaker supplements are \n     available. The remaining obstacle lies in opening the doors \n     of Higher Education to this invaluable instruction.\n       Therefore, Jump$tart wholeheartedly supports Senator \n     Akaka's College LIFE Act for its emphasis on a subject and \n     skill that is invaluable to surviving in today's complex \n     financial marketplace.\n       The Jump$tart Coalition thanks you for your continuing \n     support of financial and economic education.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dara Duguay,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Family, Career and\n\n\n                                 Community Leaders of America,\n\n                                     Reston, VA, October 29, 2003.\n     Senator Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka, Family, Career and Community Leaders of \n     America is a dynamic and effective national student \n     organization with a membership of over 227,000 that helps \n     young men and women become leaders and address important \n     personal, family, work, and societal issues through Family \n     and Consumer Sciences Education (FACS). One of those \n     important issues is financial responsibility, which is a part \n     of the FACS discipline.\n       FCCLA Advisers are FACS teachers who use the FCCLA \n     Financial Fitness national peer education program to promote \n     youth teaching other young people how to make, save, and \n     spend money wisely. Its goals are to sharpen young people's \n     skills in money management, consumerism, and financial \n     planning; as well as provide youth an opportunity to teach \n     others and develop financial literacy, communication, and \n     leadership skills. This program includes educational tools \n     and recognition for chapter projects.\n       We strongly support the College LIFE (Literacy in Finance \n     and Economics) Act, as it shares the goals of the FCCLA \n     Financial Fitness program. The importance of consumer \n     education that FCCLA introduces to its youth will be able to \n     be carried on to higher education with the passage of this \n     Act. Skills learned through personal finance and economic \n     education courses will better prepare students for success in \n     their careers and their lives.\n       FCCLA is grateful to you for your enduring advocacy of \n     financial and economic education through the College LIFE \n     Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Alan T. Rains, Jr.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1800\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EVALUATION.\n\n       Not later than 6 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall \n     submit to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions of the Senate, the Committee on Banking, Housing, \n     and Urban Affairs of the Senate, the Committee on Education \n     and the Workforce of the House of Representatives, and the \n     Committee on Financial Services of the House of \n     Representatives, an evaluation of the range and effectiveness \n     of financial and economic education and financial aid \n     counseling activities of institutions of higher education, \n     lenders, servicers, and guaranty agencies as emphasized by \n     the Secretary of Education pursuant to section 123 of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Akaka as a co-\nsponsor of the College LIFE (Literacy in Finance and Economics) Act.\n  Unfortunately, when it comes to personal finances, most American \ncollege students do not have the skills they need to spend and save \nwisely. Most do not understand the details of managing a checking \naccount, paying their taxes, or even using a credit card sensibly. \nCollege students must be given the tools they need to maintain good \ncredit and make informed decisions about investments and savings so \nthat they can ensure themselves a successful future.\n  The importance of financial education cannot be understated, and this \nbill effectively addresses this critical issue by establishing grants \nthat would allow institutions of higher education to provide their \nstudents with personal finance counseling and planning services. The \nbill also contains provisions that would encourage colleges to develop \npersonal finance courses, giving students greater access to financial \neducation. Finally, the bill would create a three-year pilot program in \nfive institutions of higher education across the Nation to provide \nannual counseling for financial aid recipients.\n\n[[Page S13668]]\n\n  Financial literacy has been a priority of mine since the start of my \ntenure in the U.S. Senate. Indeed, I believe that financial literacy \nshould be a lifelong goal. Last Congress, I successfully added a \nprovision to the No Child Left Behind Act to give elementary and \nsecondary schools access to funds that will allow them to include \nfinancial education as part of their basic educational curriculum. This \nCongress, I have introduced the Education for Retirement Security Act \nof 2003, which would provide grants to non-profit organizations and \nState and local agencies for programs that would enhance financial and \nretirement knowledge for America's seniors. The bill also aims to \nreduce financial abuse and fraud, including telemarketing, mortgage, \nand pension fraud. Finally, I am the sponsor of a bill that would \nprovide welfare recipients with greater access to financial literacy \nskills in order to help them achieve self-sufficiency.\n  I know that Senator Akaka has a deep interest in this issue as well, \nand I am honored to join him in introducing the College LIFE Act, to \nensure that college students have access to the financial knowledge \nthat they need to make the right decisions about their futures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Dayton):\n  S. 1801. A bill to promote the economic security and safety of \nvictims of domestic and sexual violence, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1801\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Domestic violence crimes account for approximately 15 \n     percent of total crime costs in the United States each year.\n       (2) Violence against women has been reported to be the \n     leading cause of physical injury to women. Such violence has \n     a devastating impact on women's physical and emotional health \n     and financial security.\n       (3) According to a recent National Institutes of Health-\n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, each year \n     there are 5,300,000 non-fatal violent victimizations \n     committed by intimate partners against women. Female murder \n     victims were substantially more likely than male murder \n     victims to have been killed by an intimate partner. About \\1/\n     3\\ of female murder victims, and about 4 percent of male \n     murder victims, were killed by an intimate partner.\n       (4) According to recent government estimates, approximately \n     987,400 rapes occur annually in the United States, 89 percent \n     of the rapes perpetrated against female victims. Since 2001, \n     rapes have actually increased by 4 percent.\n       (5) Approximately 10,200,000 people have been stalked at \n     some time in their lives. Four out of every 5 stalking \n     victims are women. Stalkers harass and terrorize their \n     victims by spying on the victims, standing outside their \n     places of work or homes, making unwanted phone calls, sending \n     or leaving unwanted letters or items, or vandalizing \n     property.\n       (6) Employees in the United States who have been victims of \n     domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \n     stalking too often suffer adverse consequences in the \n     workplace as a result of their victimization.\n       (7) Victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \n     assault, and stalking are particularly vulnerable to changes \n     in employment, pay, and benefits as a result of their \n     victimizations, and are, therefore, in need of legal \n     protection.\n       (8) The prevalence of domestic violence, dating violence, \n     sexual assault, stalking, and other violence against women at \n     work is dramatic. About 36,500 individuals, 80 percent of \n     whom are women, were raped or sexually assaulted in the \n     workplace each year from 1993 through 1999. Half of all \n     female victims of violent workplace crimes know their \n     attackers. Nearly 1 out of 10 violent workplace incidents are \n     committed by partners or spouses. Women who work for State \n     and local governments suffer a higher incidence of workplace \n     assaults, including rapes, than women who work in the private \n     sector.\n       (9) Homicide is the leading cause of death for women on the \n     job. Husbands, boyfriends, and ex-partners commit 15 percent \n     of workplace homicides against women.\n       (10) Studies indicate that between 35 and 56 percent of \n     employed battered women surveyed were harassed at work by \n     their abusive partners.\n       (11) According to a 1998 report of the General Accounting \n     Office, between \\1/4\\ and \\1/2\\ of domestic violence victims \n     surveyed in 3 studies reported that the victims lost a job \n     due, at least in part, to domestic violence.\n       (12) Women who have experienced domestic violence or dating \n     violence are more likely than other women to be unemployed, \n     to suffer from health problems that can affect employability \n     and job performance, to report lower personal income, and to \n     rely on welfare.\n       (13) Abusers frequently seek to control their partners by \n     actively interfering with their ability to work, including \n     preventing their partners from going to work, harassing their \n     partners at work, limiting the access of their partners to \n     cash or transportation, and sabotaging the child care \n     arrangements of their partners.\n       (14) More than \\1/2\\ of women receiving welfare have been \n     victims of domestic violence as adults and between \\1/4\\ and \n     \\1/3\\ reported being abused in the last year.\n       (15) Victims of intimate partner violence lose 8,000,000 \n     days of paid work each year--the equivalent of over 32,000 \n     full-time jobs and 5,600,000 days of household productivity.\n       (16) Sexual assault, whether occurring in or out of the \n     workplace, can impair an employee's work performance, require \n     time away from work, and undermine the employee's ability to \n     maintain a job. Almost 50 percent of sexual assault survivors \n     lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of the \n     assaults.\n       (17) More than 35 percent of stalking victims report losing \n     time from work due to the stalking and 7 percent never return \n     to work.\n       (18)(A) According to the National Institute of Justice, \n     crime costs an estimated $450,000,000,000 annually in medical \n     expenses, lost earnings, social service costs, pain, \n     suffering, and reduced quality of life for victims, which \n     harms the Nation's productivity and drains the Nation's \n     resources.\n       (B) Violent crime accounts for $426,000,000,000 per year of \n     this amount.\n       (C) Rape exacts the highest costs per victim of any \n     criminal offense, and accounts for $127,000,000,000 per year \n     of the amount described in subparagraph (A).\n       (19) Violent crime results in wage losses equivalent to 1 \n     percent of all United States earnings, and causes 3 percent \n     of the Nation's medical spending and 14 percent of the \n     Nation's injury-related medical spending.\n       (20) The Bureau of National Affairs has estimated that \n     domestic violence costs United States employers between \n     $3,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,000 annually in lost time and \n     productivity, while other reports have estimated the cost at \n     between $5,800,000,000 and $13,000,000,000 annually.\n       (21) United States medical costs for domestic violence have \n     been estimated to be $31,000,000,000 per year.\n       (22) Surveys of business executives and corporate security \n     directors also underscore the\n\n[[Page S13669]]\n\n     heavy toll that workplace violence takes on women, \n     businesses, and interstate commerce in the United States.\n       (23) Ninety-four percent of corporate security and safety \n     directors at companies nationwide rank domestic violence as a \n     high security concern.\n       (24) Forty-nine percent of senior executives recently \n     surveyed said domestic violence has a harmful effect on their \n     company's productivity, 47 percent said domestic violence \n     negatively affects attendance, and 44 percent said domestic \n     violence increases health care costs.\n       (25) Only 25 States have laws that explicitly provide \n     unemployment insurance to domestic violence victims in \n     certain circumstances, and none of the laws explicitly cover \n     victims of sexual assault or stalking.\n       (26) Only 6 States provide domestic violence victims with \n     leave from work to go to court, to the doctor, or to take \n     other steps to address the domestic violence in their lives, \n     and only Maine provides such leave to victims of sexual \n     assault and stalking.\n       (27) No States prohibit employment discrimination against \n     victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. \n     Five States provide limited protection to some victims under \n     certain circumstances.\n       (28) Employees, including individuals participating in \n     welfare to work programs, may need to take time during \n     business hours to--\n       (A) obtain orders of protection;\n       (B) seek medical or legal assistance, counseling, or other \n     services; or\n       (C) look for housing in order to escape from domestic \n     violence.\n       (29) Domestic and sexual violence victims have been \n     subjected to discrimination by private and State employers, \n     including discrimination motivated by sex and stereotypic \n     notions about women.\n       (30) Domestic violence victims and third parties who help \n     them have been subjected to discriminatory practices by \n     health, life, disability, and property and casualty insurers \n     and employers who self-insure employee benefits who have \n     denied or canceled coverage, rejected claims, and raised \n     rates based on domestic violence. Although some State \n     legislatures have tried to address these problems, the scope \n     of protection afforded by the laws adopted varies from State \n     to State, with many failing to address the problem \n     comprehensively. Moreover, Federal law prevents States from \n     protecting the almost 40 percent of employees whose employers \n     self-insure employee benefits.\n       (31) Existing Federal law does not explicitly--\n       (A) authorize victims of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault, or stalking to take leave from work \n     to seek legal assistance and redress, counseling, or \n     assistance with safety planning activities;\n       (B) address the eligibility of victims of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking for \n     unemployment compensation;\n       (C) prohibit employment discrimination against actual or \n     perceived victims of domestic violence, dating violence, \n     sexual assault, or stalking; or\n       (D) prohibit insurers and employers who self-insure \n     employee benefits from discriminating against domestic \n     violence victims and those who help them in determining \n     eligibility, rates charged, and standards for payment of \n     claims; nor does it prohibit insurers from disclosure of \n     information about abuse and the victim's location through \n     insurance databases and other means.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to expand the applicability of daylight saving time; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this Friday, October 31, families all over \nAmerica will be celebrating a special holiday that has become a family \ntradition. On that day, our children will be dressing up as their \nfavorite characters and clowns and heading down the street to scour the \nneighborhood in search of their favorite candies and sweets. As each \ngroup of witches, goblins and ghouls patrols the neighborhood, the \ncries of ``Trick or Treat'' will be heard everywhere along with the \nshouts of joy and excitement from each participant as they bring home a \nbag full of all sorts of candy to share with the whole family.\n  Although it is a great holiday, there has always been one great \nconcern about it--the safety of our children. It is a concern that \nstems from the time change that occurs the weekend before Halloween. \nUnfortunately, when Congress passed legislation authorizing the use of \ndaylight saving time, we drew the lines one week short of Halloween. \nInstead of including it in the time change boundaries, Congress drew \nthe finish line for daylight saving time one week short, so that it \nended the weekend before, instead of after the night so many of our \nchildren will be out walking the streets of their neighborhood in \npursuit of their favorite holiday treats.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce the Halloween Safety Act of \n2003. Its purpose is to extend the end date of daylight saving time \nfrom the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November. This \nsimple, but important, change will ensure that the protections of \ndaylight saving time extend through Halloween.\n  The idea of extending daylight saving time was introduced to me by \nSharon Rasmussen, a second grade teacher from Sheridan, WY and her \nstudents. Twelve years ago Mrs. Rasmussen's class began writing to \nWyoming's representatives expressing their wish to have an extra hour \nof daylight on Halloween to ensure the safety of small children. Each \nyear since then I have received a packet of letters from Mrs. \nRasmussen's class encouraging my support for this reasonable proposal.\n  Legislation has been introduced in the past to extend daylight saving \ntime. Although many of the bills sought to change both the starting \ndate and the ending date, the legislation I introduced today would \nsimply extend it for one week.\n  The reason why such a change needs to be made is readily apparent. \nAccording to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, over four \nthousand eight hundred people died in 2001, that is an average of 13 \ndeaths per day. Fatal pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions occur most \noften between 6 and 9 p.m. Unfortunately, these general trends are \nhighly magnified on Halloween given the considerable increase in \npedestrians, most of whom are children. A study by the National Center \nfor Injury Prevention and Control concluded that the occurrence of \npedestrian deaths for children ages 5 to 14 is four times higher on \nHalloween than any other night of the year. School and communities \nencourage children and parents to use safety measures when children \nventure out on Halloween and the Halloween Safety Act can further help \nprotect our nation's youth.\n  When students take an interest in improving our Nation's laws, \nespecially when it would serve to protect other children, I believe it \nis our duty to pay close attention to their needs and respond if \npossible. If children concerned about their own safety suggest a \nreasonable approach to making their world a little bit safer, I believe \nthat accommodating their request is not too much to ask. The fact that \nsecond and third grade students in Sheridan, WY have been working on \nthis legislation for years shows that protecting the children of our \ncountry is a primary concern of theirs, and it should be for all of us \nas lawmakers. If one life can be saved or one accident avoided by \nextending Daylight Saving Time, it would be worthwhile.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support this act for the important \nbenefits the Halloween Safety Act of 2003 would have for children and \ntheir parents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 1804. A bill to reauthorize programs relating to sport fishing and \nrecreational boating safety, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sport \nFishing Restoration and Boating Safety Act of 2003. The legislation, \ncosponsored by Senator Lott and Senator Hollings is funded through the \nAquatic Resources Trust fund, which I am honored to know is commonly \nreferred to as the Wallop-Breaux Trust Fund (Wallop-Breaux). This bill \nreauthorizes activities funded by two of the Nation's most effective \n``user-pay, user-benefit'' programs--the Sport Fish Restoration Fund \nand the Recreational Boating Safety Fund--which constitute the \n``Wallop-Breaux'' program.\n  In 1984, when I was a member of the House of Representatives, I had \nthe privilege of sponsoring, along with then Senator Malcolm Wallop, \nwhat I consider to be the most significant legislation for anglers and \nboaters to have passed the Congress. We guided through the House and \nSenate legislation that greatly increased funds for fishery and boating \nand related programs in virtually every State of our Nation. In 1985, \nthe first year that the Wallop-Breaux amendments were effective, their \nimpact caused the funding for fishing and boating programs to increase \nfrom approximately $35 million to $100 million. Funded by a Federal \nmanufacturers' excise taxes on fishing equipment and a percentage of \nthe Federal fuel tax attributed to use in motor boats and small \nengines, Wallop-Breaux will this year alone provide to the States \napproximately $450 million to the greatest of outdoor recreations--\nfishing and boating. It is sometimes difficult to fathom, but over the \npast nineteen years, Wallop-Breaux has disbursed upwards of $5 billion \nto the States to improve recreational boating and fishing, promote \nconservation, protect the environment and to conserve wetlands.\n  As my colleagues know, Wallop-Breaux and other important programs \nfunded through the Highway Trust Fund received a five-month extension, \nawaiting consideration of full term reauthorization. Over the last two \nyears, I have met with the American League of Anglers and Boaters \n(ALAB), the constituent group comprised of 34 organizations \nrepresenting the spectrum of fishing and boating interests. The purpose \nof these meetings has been to prepare for introduction of this \nreauthorization legislation. I am pleased to report that ALAB support \nthe legislation I bring before you today.\n  Foremost on everyone's agenda was the need to secure a stable and \npredictable funding base for boating safety grants to the states. The \nchallenge was to increase the funding and dependability of delivery of \nboating safety grants to the States.\n  I pledged my support to these Wallop-Breaux constituent groups to \nenact improvements to the overall program. After countless meetings and \nconsiderable deliberation, I am pleased to report that the legislation \nI am introducing today reflects a general consensus on improving \nWallop-Breaux to the benefit of all stakeholders. I want to stress that \nthis would not have been possible without the leadership of Senator \nLott, Senator Hollings and other key members of the committees having \njoint-jurisdiction over Wallop-Breaux programs. Under the legislation, \nBoating Safety Grants will now have guaranteed and increased funding. \nThis program will now receive 18 percent of the total Wallop-Breaux, \nincreasing present funding from $64 million to $95 million in the first \nyear of enactment.\n  The legislation also dissolves the Boat Safety account. The balance \ncurrently in the account plus the interest,\n\n[[Page S13678]]\n\napproximately $87 million, will be distributed over the next five years \nto accounts in the fund.\n  State boat safety grants will now have a 3 to 1 match, the same as \nthe Sport Fish Restoration grants, enabling state funds to go farther \nby reimbursing them 75 cents for every Federal dollar.\n  And lastly, all programs funded through Wallop-Breaux will be \nassigned a percentage of the total fund to allow a simpler and fairer \nprocess. When the amount of funds increase or decrease so will all of \nthe programs based upon their percentage.\n  The growing popularity of recreational boating and fishing has \ncreated safety, environmental, and access needs that have been \nsuccessfully addressed by the two Wallop-Breaux programs--Recreational \nBoating Safety and Sport Fish Restoration. The reauthorization is \nimportant for the safety of boaters, the continued enjoyment of \nfishermen, and improvement of our wetlands and waterways.\n  This reauthorization will allow continued funding of programs that \nbenefit boating safety, coastal wetland protection and restoration and \nsportfish restoration, as well as Clean Vessel Act grants that help to \nkeep our waterways clean.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the positive impact of \nWallop-Breaux programs in years past, as well as presenting significant \nimprovements contained in the legislation that I am introducing today. \nI ask that my colleagues join Senator Lott, Senator Hollings and me in \ncosponsoring this landmark legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered printed in the Record \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 1804\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, and \n     2000, Congress, by concurrent resolution, declared that it \n     holds the Government of Iran responsible for upholding the \n     rights of all Iranian nationals, including members of the \n     Baha'i Faith;\n       Whereas in those resolutions and in numerous other appeals, \n     Congress has deplored the religious persecution by the \n     Government of Iran of the Baha'i community and has condemned \n     the execution by Iran of more than 200 Baha'is and the \n     disruptive imprisonment of thousands of others solely on \n     account of their religious beliefs;\n       Whereas Iranian Baha'is are not permitted to elect their \n     leaders, assemble or organize as a community, operate \n     religious schools, or conduct other religious community \n     activities that are guaranteed by the Universal Declaration \n     of Human Rights, adopted and proclaimed by the United Nations \n     General Assembly Resolution 217(A)(III) of December 10, 1984;\n       Whereas the continued denial of Baha'i property rights by \n     the Iranian Government is demonstrated by the confiscation by \n     the Iranian Government of a multitude of Baha'i community and \n     private properties;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran continues to deny individual \n     Baha'is access to higher education and government employment, \n     in addition to denying recognition and religious rights to \n     the Baha'i community;\n       Whereas because Baha'is have been banned from teaching and \n     studying at Iranian universities since the Islamic \n     Revolution, Baha'is established the Baha'i Institute of \n     Higher Education, or Baha'i Open University, to provide \n     educational opportunities to Baha'i youth using volunteer \n     faculty and a network of classrooms, libraries, and \n     laboratories in private homes and buildings throughout Iran;\n       Whereas in September and October of 1998, officers of the \n     Ministry of Information, the intelligence agency of the \n     Iranian Government, arrested 36 faculty members of the Open \n     University;\n       Whereas on July 19, 2002, Iranian Revolutionary Guards \n     systematically disrupted student qualifying examinations for \n     the Open University in 9 different districts by videotaping \n     the proceedings, questioning the students, and confiscating \n     examination papers and Baha'i books;\n       Whereas the use of arbitrary arrests, suspended sentences, \n     and short-term detentions against the Iranian Baha'is have \n     become widespread;\n       Whereas as of June 2003, 4 Baha'is remain in Iranian \n     prisons solely because of their religious beliefs: 1 serving \n     a life sentence on charges of apostasy, 1 serving 4 years on \n     charges of participation in Baha'i activities, and 2 \n     sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on charges of association \n     with Baha'i institutions;\n       Whereas on October 10, 2003, the Norwegian Nobel Committee \n     awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2003 to Shirin Ebadi for \n     her efforts involving democracy and human rights, including \n     advocating equal rights for the Baha'i community in Iran;\n       Whereas the conclusions contained in the report of October \n     13, 2003 by the General Affairs and External Relations \n     Council of the European Union, conveyed the continuing \n     concern of the European Union about the violations of the \n     Baha'is' right to freedom of religion, and urged the Iranian \n     Government to comply with both the recommendations made in \n     June 2003 by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary \n     Detention and with the recommendations made in August 2003 by \n     the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination \n     concerning injustice, particularly in relation to education, \n     property rights, and employment; and\n       Whereas in the 2003 General Affairs and External Relations \n     Council report, the European Union urged the Government of \n     Iran to expedite reform on many fronts, while recognizing the \n     meetings held in 2003 and the planned meetings that have been \n     welcomed by the Government of Iran, to be an important step \n     toward progress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), that Congress--\n       (1) continues to hold the Government of Iran responsible \n     for upholding all the rights of its nationals, including \n     members of the Baha'i community, in a manner consistent with \n     Iran's obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights, adopted and proclaimed by the United Nations General \n     Assembly Resolution 217(A)(III) of December 10, 1984, and \n     other international agreements guaranteeing the civil and \n     political rights of Iranian citizens;\n       (2) condemns the repressive anti-Baha'i policies and \n     actions of the Government of Iran, including the denial of \n     legal recognition to the Baha'i community and the basic \n     rights to organize, elect leaders, educate youth, and conduct \n     the normal activities of a law-abiding religious community;\n       (3) expresses concern that individual Baha'is continue to \n     suffer from severely repressive and discriminatory government \n     actions, solely on account of their religion;\n       (4) urges the Government of Iran to permit Baha'i students \n     to attend Iranian universities and Baha'i faculty to teach at \n     Iranian universities, to return the property confiscated from \n     the Baha'i Open University, and to permit the Open University \n     to continue to function;\n       (5) urges the Government of Iran to implement fully the \n     conclusions and recommendations on the emancipation of the \n     Iranian Baha'i community made by the United Nations Working \n     Group on Arbitrary Detention and also to comply with the \n     recommendations made in August 2003 by the Committee on the \n     Elimination of Racial Discrimination;\n       (6) urges the Government of Iran to extend to the Baha'i \n     community the rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration \n     of Human Rights, adopted and proclaimed by the United Nations \n     General Assembly Resolution 217(A)(III) of December 10, 1984, \n     and other international covenants of human rights, including \n     the freedoms of thought, conscience, and religion, and equal \n     protection of the law;\n       (7) calls upon the President to continue to--\n       (A) assert the concerns of the United States Government \n     regarding--\n       (i) the violations by the Iranian Government of the rights \n     of Iranian citizens, including members of the Baha'i \n     community;\n       (ii) the support by the Iranian Government of international \n     terrorism; and\n       (iii) the efforts of the Iranian Government to develop \n     nuclear weapons and acquire weapons of mass destruction;\n       (B) emphasize that the United States regards the human \n     rights practices of the Government of Iran, including its \n     treatment of the Baha'i community and other religious \n     minorities, as a significant factor in the development of \n     relations between the United States and Iran;\n       (C) urge the Government of Iran to emancipate the Baha'i \n     community by granting those rights guaranteed by the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted and proclaimed \n     by the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 217(A)(III) \n     of December 10, 1984, and other international covenants on \n     human rights; and\n       (D) cooperate with international organizations, including \n     the United Nations and its agencies, in efforts to protect \n     the religious rights of the Baha'is and other minorities \n     through joint appeals to the Government of Iran; and\n       (8) calls upon the President to--\n       (A) initiate an active and consistent dialogue with other \n     governments who are influential with Iran in order to \n     persuade the Government of Iran to rectify its human rights \n     practices; and\n       (B) urge the European Union to use its relationship with \n     Iran to address and advance these fundamental human rights \n     issues.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is with continued concern that my \nrespected colleagues and I bring to the Senate's attention for the \nninth time in 21 years the continuing persecution of a minority \nreligious group in Iran, the Baha'i, by submitting today the Baha'i \nEmancipation Act of 2003.\n  I fervently believe that the persistent maltreatment of the Baha'i as \nwell as other minority religious groups in Iran epitomizes the perilous \nstate of affairs in the country of Iran. Thus, it is with a genuine \ncompassion for all of the people of Iran but particularly for the \nfollowers of the Baha'i faith that my colleagues and I are submitting \nthis resolution highlighting the continuing abuse of this segment of \nthe Iranian population. We are urging that the Baha'i not only remain \nat the center of our attention, but that we join forces with other \nlike-minded nations to put pressure on the Government of Iran to make \npermanent and lasting changes that will allow not only the followers of \nthe Baha'i faith but all people to live in peace and prosperity in \nIran. Consistent attention of the nature represented by this resolution \nand its predecessors is necessary in order to achieve full emancipation \nfor this peaceful, law-abiding community.\n  Although it appears that the overt measures used by the Government of \nIran to harass and oppress the members of the Baha'i faith since 1979 \nhave\n\n[[Page S13681]]\n\ndiminished, research by my staff indicates that a multitude of covert \npractices have been sustained and in many cases heightened over the \npast few years. Members of the Baha'i community continue to be subject \nto various forms of harassment including arbitrary arrest and short-\nterm detainment, confiscation of their public and private property, and \ndisruption of their educational and religious gatherings. Moreover, the \nBaha'i community continues to be deprived of many rights such as the \nright to elect their leaders, assemble as a community, access higher \neducation, acquire government employment, receive due legal process, \nand practice the faith of their preference. As of June of this year, \nfour Baha'i practitioners were in Iranian prisons solely because of \ntheir religious beliefs: one on charges of apostasy who is serving a \nlife sentence, one on charges of participation in Baha'i activities who \nis serving four years, and two on charges of associations with Baha'i \ninstitutions who have been sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. This \nwas unacceptable in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries and it certainly \nis unacceptable in the 21st century.\n  I would like to emphasize the idea of religious freedom because I \nstrongly feel that each human being should have the right to choose and \npractice the faith of his or her choice. Iran has traditionally been \ndesignated a Country of Particular Concern in the Congressionally-\nmandated annual report as required by the International Religious \nFreedom Act. But, rather than being satisfied that the Government of \nIran is reprimanded in this report, we need to take proactive steps to \npublicize the continued mistreatment of the Baha'i faithful in Iran and \nto urge the Government of Iran to make the necessary changes. \nLegislation such as this is an important first step, but we must also \nwork with others, including the European Union, to push for this \nobjective. This legislation urges that the Administration do just that.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to bring to the Senate's \nattention two related pieces of legislation, both of which I have \njoined as a co-sponsor. The first is S. Res. 244 submitted by Senator \nBoxer that congratulates Shirin Ebadi for winning the 2003 Nobel Peace \nPrize and commending her for a lifetime of work promoting democracy and \nhuman rights. Shirin Ebadi is a very courageous woman who has risked \nher life to advocate for universal human rights and on many occasions \nspecifically advocated equal rights for the Baha'i community in Iran. I \ncommend her global efforts and encourage the spreading of her \nconvictions in order to attain a world of equal rights for all.\n\n  The second related piece of legislation that I am co-sponsoring is S. \nCon. Res. 73 submitted by Senator Feinstein that expresses Congress's \ndeep concerns over Iran's apparent efforts to develop nuclear weapons \nin contravention of its Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty obligations \nand urging international pressure on Iran to abandon its nuclear \nweapons program. I am aware of the progress that has been made in \nrecent days with the Iranian government's statements of intended \ncooperation with both the International Atomic Energy Agency's request \nthat Iran sign an additional protocol to the Non-Proliferation Treaty \nand the recent negotiations involving the European Union but I remain \nwary of their actual intentions and I believe that we should not rest \nuntil the words that have been spoken have been followed up with \nconcrete action.\n  Iran needs to be aware that it must make significant changes in the \nway it treats its own population and in the manner in which it conducts \nitself internationally if it wants to become a respected member on the \nworld stage. These requests include but are not limited to cooperating \nwith the European Union and potentially the United Nations, dealing \nappropriately with the infiltration of suspected terrorists and \ncriminals along their border, halting all forms of terrorist support, \ncooperating with the U.S. and others on suspected terrorists and \nintelligence in conjunction with the global war on terror, and \nespecially to provide human rights for each man, woman, and child in \nIran regardless of creed or color. Iran must alter their enduring ways \nin order to earn international respect and to create better lives for \nall Iranians. A world where Iran is a respected and integral \nparticipant, where its inhabitants can co-exist and pursue happiness \nwithout constraint is not beyond our grasp but it will take continued \nfocus and determination. I urge passage of the Baha'i Emancipation Act \nof 2003 and recommend this administration to use all of the tools in \nits diplomatic toolbox to work through the United Nations, the IAEA, \nand with our friends and allies to strongly advise the government of \nIran to exploit its full potential as a member of the international \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13681-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2030.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Highlands Conservation \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Highlands region is a physiographic province that \n     encompasses more than 2,000,000 acres extending from eastern \n     Pennsylvania through the States of New Jersey and New York to \n     northwestern Connecticut.\n       (2) The Highlands region is an environmentally unique area \n     that--\n       (A) provides clean drinking water to over 15,000,000 people \n     in metropolitan areas in the States of Connecticut, New \n     Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania;\n       (B) provides critical wildlife habitat, including habitat \n     for 247 threatened and endangered species;\n       (C) maintains an important historic connection to early \n     Native American culture, colonial settlement, the American \n     Revolution, and the Civil War;\n       (D) contains recreational resources for 14 million visitors \n     annually;\n       (E) provides other significant ecological, natural, \n     tourism, recreational, educational, and economic benefits; \n     and\n       (F) provides homeownership opportunities and access to \n     affordable housing that is safe, clean, and healthy;\n       (3) An estimated 1 in 12 citizens of the United States live \n     within a 2-hour drive of the Highlands region.\n       (4) More than 1,400,000 residents live in the Highlands \n     region.\n       (5) The Highlands region forms a greenbelt adjacent to the \n     Philadelphia-New York City-Hartford urban corridor that \n     offers the opportunity to preserve water, forest and \n     agricultural resources, wildlife habitat, recreational areas, \n     and historic sites, while encouraging sustainable economic \n     growth and development in a fiscally and environmentally \n     sound manner.\n       (6) Continued population growth and land use patterns in \n     the Highlands region--\n       (A) reduce the availability and quality of water;\n       (B) reduce air quality;\n       (C) fragment the forests;\n       (D) destroy critical migration corridors and forest \n     habitat; and\n       (E) result in the loss of recreational opportunities and \n     scenic, historic, and cultural resources;\n       (7) The water, forest, wildlife, recreational, \n     agricultural, and cultural resources of the Highlands region, \n     in combination with the proximity of the Highlands region to \n     the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, make the \n     Highlands region nationally significant.\n       (8) The national significance of the Highlands region has \n     been documented in--\n       (A) the New York-New Jersey Highlands Regional Study \n     conducted by the Forest Service in 1990;\n       (B) the New York-New Jersey Highlands Regional Study: 2002 \n     Update conducted by the Forest Service;\n       (C) the bi-State Skylands Greenway Task Force Report;\n       (D) the New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment \n     Plan;\n       (E) the New York State Open Space Conservation Plan;\n       (F) the Connecticut Green Plan: Open Space Acquisition FY \n     2001-2006;\n       (G) the open space plans of the State of Pennsylvania; and\n       (H) other open space conservation plans for States in the \n     Highlands region;\n       (9) The Highlands region includes or is adjacent to \n     numerous parcels of land owned by the Federal Government or \n     federally designated areas that protect, conserve, or restore \n     resources of the Highlands region, including--\n       (A) the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge;\n       (B) the Shawanagunk Grasslands Wildlife Refuge;\n       (C) the Morristown National Historical Park;\n       (D) the Delaware and Lehigh Canal Corridors;\n       (E) the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area;\n       (F) the Delaware River Basin;\n       (G) the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area;\n       (H) the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River;\n       (I) the Appalachian National Scenic Trail;\n       (J) the United States Military Academy at West Point, New \n     York;\n       (K) the Highlands National Millenium Trail;\n       (L) the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge;\n       (M) the proposed Crossroads of the Revolution National \n     Heritage Area;\n       (N) the proposed Musconetcong National Scenic and \n     Recreational River in New Jersey; and\n       (O) the Farmington River Wild and Scenic Area in \n     Connecticut;\n\n[[Page S13692]]\n\n       (10) It is in the interest of the United States to protect, \n     conserve, and restore the resources of the Highlands region \n     for the residents of, and visitors to, the Highlands region.\n       (11) The States of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and \n     Pennsylvania, and units of local government in the Highlands \n     region have the primary responsibility for protecting, \n     conserving, preserving, restoring and promoting the resources \n     of the Highlands region.\n       (12) Because of the longstanding Federal practice of \n     assisting States in creating, protecting, conserving, and \n     restoring areas of significant natural and cultural \n     importance, and the national significance of the Highlands \n     region, the Federal Government should, in partnership with \n     the Highlands States and units of local government in the \n     Highlands region, protect, restore, and preserve the water, \n     forest, agricultural, wildlife, recreational and cultural \n     resources of the Highlands region.\n\n     SEC. __03.

Res. 76\n\n       Whereas, in 1945, American soldiers and other Allied \n     forces, defeated Nazi Germany, ending World War II in Europe \n     and the systematic murder of Europe's Jews and other targeted \n     groups;\n       Whereas 6,000,000 Jews were killed during the Holocaust, \n     and after World War II hundreds of thousands of survivors \n     immigrated to the United States, where in spite of their \n     enormous suffering, they rebuilt their lives, and embraced \n     and enriched their adopted homeland;\n       Whereas, in 1978, President Jimmy Carter created the \n     President's Commission on the Holocaust to make a \n     recommendation regarding ``the establishment . . . of an \n     appropriate memorial to those who perished in the \n     Holocaust'';\n       Whereas President Carter said: ``Out of our memory . . . of \n     the Holocaust we must forge an unshakable oath with all \n     civilized people that never again will the world stand \n     silent, never again will the world . . . fail to act in time \n     to prevent this terrible crime of genocide. . . . [W]e must \n     harness the outrage of our own memories to stamp out \n     oppression wherever it exists. We must understand that human \n     rights and human dignity are indivisible.'';\n       Whereas, in 1979, the Commission recommended ``a living \n     memorial that will speak not only of the victims' deaths but \n     of their lives, a memorial that can transform\n\n[[Page S13697]]\n\n     the living by transmitting the legacy of the Holocaust'';\n       Whereas, in 1980, the United States Congress unanimously \n     passed legislation authorizing the creation of the United \n     States Holocaust Memorial Museum as a ``permanent living \n     memorial'' on Federal land in the Nation's Capital;\n       Whereas, in 1983, Vice President George Bush designated the \n     Federal land on which the United States Holocaust Memorial \n     Museum would be built;\n       Whereas Vice President Bush said: ``Here we will learn that \n     each of us bears responsibility for our actions and our \n     failure to act. Here we will learn that we must intervene \n     when we see evil arise. Here we will learn more about the \n     moral compass by which we navigate our lives and by which \n     countries navigate the future.'';\n       Whereas, in 1985, Holocaust survivors participated in the \n     groundbreaking ceremony at the site of the future United \n     States Holocaust Memorial Museum;\n       Whereas, in 1988, President Ronald Reagan dedicated the \n     cornerstone of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum;\n       Whereas President Reagan said: ``We who did not go their \n     way owe them this: We must make sure that their deaths have \n     posthumous meaning. We must make sure that from now until the \n     end of days all humankind stares this evil in the face . . . \n     and only then can we be sure it will never arise again.'';\n       Whereas, in 1992, replicas of 2 of the milk cans that hid \n     the Oneg Shabbat archive under the Warsaw Ghetto were buried \n     beneath the Museum's Hall of Remembrance, with a Scroll of \n     Remembrance signed by Holocaust survivors;\n       Whereas, in 1993, President Bill Clinton opened the United \n     States Holocaust Memorial Museum;\n       Whereas President Clinton said: ``[T]his museum will touch \n     the life of everyone who enters and leave everyone forever \n     changed; a place of deep sadness and a sanctuary of bright \n     hope; an ally of education against ignorance, of humility \n     against arrogance, an investment in a secure future against \n     whatever insanity lurks ahead. If this museum can mobilize \n     morality, then those who have perished will thereby gain a \n     measure of immortality.'';\n       Whereas, in 2001, President George W. Bush delivered the \n     keynote address at the first Days of Remembrance ceremony \n     after he assumed office.\n       Whereas President Bush said: ``When we remember the \n     Holocaust and to whom it happened, we must also remember \n     where it happened . . . The orders came from men who . . . \n     had all the outward traits of cultured men, except for \n     conscience. Their crimes showed the world that evil can slip \n     in, and blend in, even amid the most civilized surroundings. \n     In the end, only conscience can stop it. And moral \n     discernment, decency, tolerance--these can never be assumed \n     in any time, or any society. They must always be taught.'';\n       Whereas the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has had \n     more than 19,000,000 visitors in the first 10 years of its \n     existence;\n       Whereas, in 2003, the United States Holocaust Memorial \n     Museum, on the occasion of its 10th Anniversary, wishes to \n     pay tribute to America's Holocaust survivors, who worked \n     tirelessly to help build the Museum and whose committed \n     support and involvement continue to make the institution such \n     as extraordinary memorial and a vital part of life in the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas the United States Holocaust Museum has a sacred \n     obligation to preserve and transmit the history and lessons \n     of the Holocaust and, together with the Holocaust survivors, \n     must ensure that the legacy of the survivors is passed on to \n     each new generation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes that November 2, 2003, shall be dedicated to \n     ``A Tribute to Survivors'' at the United States Holocaust \n     Memorial Museum and shall be devoted to honoring our Nation's \n     Holocaust survivors, as well as their liberators and \n     rescuers, and their families;\n       (2) recognizes that on that day, the United States \n     Holocaust Memorial Museum shall be devoted in its entirety to \n     special programs about and for the survivors of the \n     Holocaust;\n       (3) commends the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum \n     for its first decade of education dedicated to the memory of \n     the victims of the Holocaust;\n       (4) endeavors to continue to support the vital work of the \n     United States Holocaust Memorial Museum; and\n       (5) requests that this resolution shall be duly recorded in \n     the official records of the United States Holocaust Memorial \n     Museum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/30/senate-section/article/S13697-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 3289\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
