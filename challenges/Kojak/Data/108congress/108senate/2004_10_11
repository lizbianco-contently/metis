Therefore, the next vote will be at noon today. \nThat should be the only vote of the day.\n  We will also continue to work through other legislative items that \ncan be cleared by unanimous consent.\n  Again, I thank all Members who were here yesterday as well as \nSaturday allowing us to invoke cloture on the conference report so that \nwe are now on a glide path to finishing our work today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11191-7", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 4520, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report accompanying the bill (H.R. 4520) to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad that Senator Frist and other \nSenators were able to work out the parliamentary maneuvering that it \ntakes to get us to finality on this JOBS bill.\n  We obviously want to encourage the creation of jobs and manufacturing \nin America. We want to reduce reasons for outsourcing. This bill deals \nwith all of those and some others as well.\n  Throughout this debate, I feel as though I was whipsawed in arguments \ntrotted out by opponents of this bill. They complain about \naccommodations we have made to Members. Some of these accomplishments \nand accommodations have even helped folks in States of the critics. \nThen they complain about what is not in this bill that should have been \nincluded in this bill.\n  First of all, I don't know how many times I have to say this, but I \nthink it\n\n[[Page S11192]]\n\nneeds to be continually said. This bill is revenue neutral. Yes, we \ndecrease taxes for partnerships, family-owned businesses, and \ncorporations that are involved in manufacturing, reducing that from 35 \nto 32 percent. Obviously, that brings in less revenue, but that does \nnot mean the deficit of the United States is going to be increased. We \npay for it by raising revenue from businesses, by closing corporate tax \nloopholes, and we collect that new revenue coming in to small \nbusinesses, especially to any size business that manufactures--large or \nsmall.\n  This bill is basically about manufacturing jobs. That is where the \nrevenue in this bill goes.\n  There are those who talk about this bill as somewhat of a giveaway to \nbusiness. You have some businesses not paying taxes because they are \nabusing the Tax Code through corporate loophole abuse, and they pay \nmore money. Then you have the socially good provisions such as \nencouraging manufacturing in the United States to create jobs in the \nUnited States. I don't think people are correct in saying this is a \ngiveaway to business because it balances out within the business sector \nof our country--some paying more and some not paying more. Because we \nare taxing them more, they are paying more because they can't cheat \nanymore. We are giving some benefits from that same revenue to create \njobs in the United States.\n  Those who call this a giveaway for business need to put on their \nreading glasses and take a look at revenue tables produced by the \nnonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. These people aren't Republican \nor Democrat. They are professionals who decide how many changes are in \nthe Tax Code, where revenue comes from. These tables show that this \nbill is revenue neutral; that financial reductions are paid for in new \nrevenue coming in from the closing of corporate loophole abuse.\n  For those who are talking about this bill being a giveaway for \nbusiness, I want them to stop using that argument. One statement was \nmade last night that was egregiously in error. One of the hard-line \nopponents of this bill claimed that the tobacco buyout was paid for by \nthe taxpayers.\n  I don't support the tobacco buyout but realize it was necessary to \nget this bill through the other body. I insisted on one of the Senate's \npositions in the tobacco buyout, and that position is that tobacco \ncompanies pay for this buyout. Opponents need to read this bill and the \nrevenue tables. If they bother to do so they will see the buyout is \npaid for not by the taxpayers of America but by the companies that \nproduce tobacco.\n  Now, let's put in context the mischaracterization of this bill as \nsomewhat of a special interest bill. In part, the bill receives such \nwidespread support because many Member items were accommodated. \nLiterally dozens of tax benefits were adopted in committee and on the \nfloor.\n  Let me define ``Member items.'' Constituents of one State came to \ntheir Senator and said: This part of the Tax Code is wrong, it is \nhurtful; or they said: We think the Tax Code ought to be changed this \nway. Maybe they do not come to me. Maybe they do not go to the other 99 \nSenators; they go to 1 Senator. That Senator is a representative of his \npeople. It is his responsibility to bring that issue to the Senate. He \ndoes not have to. He can say: I don't agree with you, I will not do \nthat. If he feels his constituents are justified in what they are \nrequesting, then the matter is brought to the committee that has \njurisdiction. That is the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair. \nSomehow there is something negative or derogatory about a Member \nbringing forth an item for all to consider. If we think that Member is \ncrazy, we do not have to do it. If we think there is some justification \nto what that Member brings before the Senate, we ought to consider \nthat. That is how our representative system of government works.\n  Literally dozens of tax changes were adopted in committee or in the \nChamber. Before the conference, Senator Baucus and I received letters \nfrom virtually every Member of the Senate. In some cases those letters \nasked for items from the Senate to be retained. In other cases those \nletters asked for the Senate to accept items from the House bill, and \nin still other cases Members wrote asking for items that were not in \neither bill. Finally, some Members asked us to not accept certain \nprovisions not in either bill.\n  I have a stack of letters with me. These letters are not all the \nletters, of course. There is no sense carrying a pile of letters out \nhere. But Members representing the interests of their State bring these \nissues for our consideration.\n  I will go to the first category and follow up items from the Senate \nbill.\n  National care scholarships for nurses--Senator Murray and Cantwell \nasked for that. It is in the bill.\n  Sickle cell disease and Medicaid, consideration of sickle cell \ndisease, which is not covered by Medicaid--Senators Talent, Schumer, \nCampbell, Dayton, Cochran, Bond, Specter, Mikulski, Cantwell, Landrieu, \nStabenow, Kennedy, Sarbanes, Voinovich, Lautenberg, Murkowski. It is in \nthe bill.\n  Some are going to say that Members' provision brought to us under the \nleadership of Senator Talent should not be considered by this body, and \nI will explain why this is all in one bill. People watching might think \nif you have a sickle cell disease issue come before the Senate, maybe \nit ought to come up as a separate issue. On the next item up is a life \ninsurance taxation issue; maybe it ought to come as a separate bill. \nWhy doesn't it? Because under the rules of the Senate every little bill \nthat comes out here could be amended by anything that is in the Tax \nCode. Eventually you have a little life insurance bill that becomes a \nvehicle for every member to bring up any bill they want to bring up.\n\n  So we saved the Senate from going through that exercise. That is what \ncommittees are about. We consider these issues--not always in \ncommittee; sometimes they are discussed when the bill comes to the \nSenate floor. Most of the time we give them a thorough study in the \nSenate Finance Committee. Sometimes we reject them and sometimes we \ninclude them. If we do not include them, maybe when they come to the \nSenate Chamber, that Senator is irritated with the chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee and they add it on the Senate floor. They \nalways end up in one bill.\n  Somehow that makes all of our journalists concerned, those who seem \nto not have an understanding of how the Senate works, pointing out that \nthis bill is full of a lot of little things in it that are unrelated to \nthe underlying bill. That is true, but that is how the Senate works.\n  The House of Representatives does not work that way. They put a bill \ntogether, they adopt a rule, and there is never an amendment. I \nshouldn't say never, but very seldom is a Member allowed to offer an \namendment to a Ways and Means bill on the floor of the House. That is \nwhy the House of Representatives is like the House of Lords. That is \nwhy the Senate is like a House of Representatives. We allow the people \nof this country to bring anything they want to the floor of the Senate.\n  Another item is suspension of section 815, a life insurance company \ntaxation issue. That was brought to us by Senator Specter. It is in the \nbill.\n  New York City revitalization tax benefits directly related to the \nattack of September 11, 2001, and the rebuilding of New York was \nbrought to us by Senators Schumer and Clinton--most of that, but not \nall of it, is in the bill.\n  Brownfields, unrelated business income tax relief--Senators \nLautenberg, Reed, Jeffords, Stabenow, Specter, Sarbanes Dole, Akaka, \nChafee, Inhofe--is in the bill. The use of green bonds for economic \ndevelopment in certain areas is something I was not for, but it is in \nthe bill to satisfy Senators Allard, Schumer, Miller, Clinton, and \nChambliss.\n  We have IRS private debt collection. Senator Allen was pushing this. \nThat is something I very definitely favor because this is one way of \ngetting the private sector bringing in money from people who are tax \ncheats and are not paying their taxes.\n  Tribal government bonds--Senator Campbell, very active in the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs--was also a matter of importance to Senator \nBaucus and others, but it is not in the bill despite being raised in \nconference.\n  Comprehensive energy tax relief package--Senator Hutchison--is not in \nthe bill despite being raised in conference because the House of \nRepresentatives took the position that\n\n[[Page S11193]]\n\nthere shouldn't be anything on energy in this bill because they think \nenergy items need to be put together in a bill that ought to be dealt \nwith separately, next session. Quite frankly, the House of \nRepresentatives passed a comprehensive energy bill last fall, and we \nwere two votes short in the Senate because of a Democrat filibuster \nagainst the bill. They say that instead of doing the energy provisions \nin this bill before us now, the Senate ought to take up the bill that \nwe obviously have a majority for--but because of a Democrat filibuster \nwe are two votes short--and do the energy stuff there, not in bill \nbefore the Senate.\n\n  So I cannot blame the House of Representatives because they worked \nhard to get an energy bill passed, and it comes over here and you get a \nDemocrat filibuster.\n  By the way, those two votes could be supplied by Senator Kerry and \nSenator Edwards because now they think we ought to have a national \nenergy policy, and they did not vote last November. If they come in \nhere before we go home and cast the 59th and 60th vote, we would have \nthe comprehensive energy policy, not just little slivers of it that we \nget in a bill here and a bill there, but we would have a very \ncomprehensive energy policy. They would be fulfilling what they are \nsaying out there on the campaign trail we need to get done: have a \nnational energy policy. We have 58 votes for it. We need a 59th and \n60th vote, and they could be that. But at least I am telling you why we \ndo not have the energy provisions in here that a Republican Senator, \nSenator Hutchison, wanted.\n  We have a request from Senators Crapo, Bingaman, Voinovich, Biden, \nPryor, Talent, Enzi, Chafee, Carper, Clinton, Allard, Bond, Coleman, \nSununu, Bennett, Chambliss, Hutchison, Hagel, Nelson of Florida, \nDayton, Dole, Reed of Rhode Island, Dodd, Kennedy, and Levin for \nmortgage revenue bonds liberalization. It is not in the bill, but it \nwas raised in conference.\n  We have heard a lot about Senator Landrieu's Guard and Ready Reserve \namendment. That was raised by Senators Landrieu, Bond, Pryor, Murray, \nDodd, Akaka, Cantwell, Dorgan, Schumer, Mikulski, Nelson of Florida, \nLautenberg, Johnson, Feingold, Leahy, Dayton, Levin, Sarbanes, Wyden, \nand Durbin. We discussed that provision a lot, and like the three items \nabove, this item was raised at conference and rejected by the other \nbody.\n  Mr. President, the letters I have cited reflect items Members raised. \nOn some items we were able to reach agreement with the House, other \nitems the House of Representatives rejected.\n  Let me point out that I offered three amendments that I filed. I won \none and lost two. The House accepted an amendment I put in for rural \nletter carriers. The House rejected an amendment I had dealing with \nenergy-efficient home appliances. The House rejected another amendment \ndealing with elderly housing connected to the Warrior Hotel in Sioux \nCity, IA.\n  As the list above shows, a lot of Members of this body are satisfied \nbecause their items are in here; other Members are not satisfied. But \nthat is not an unusual situation when you reach compromise. It also \nshows that for all of the unfair carping about this bill being a \nspecial interest bill, nearly every Member raised narrow-interest \nprovisions. So if there is some fault about different provisions coming \nup, we all share that. We all do it. There is an old saying. It is: \nPeople who live in glass houses should not throw stones. We have a \ngroup of Members throwing stones at this JOBS bill. A lot of them are \nliving in glass houses.\n  I will continue the discussion of Member items. We had the State \nsales tax deduction. Senators Cantwell and Hutchison wrote Senator \nBaucus and me asking us to include the House sales tax deduction \nprovision in the conference agreement. We also received letters from \ndelegations of other States where the State tax base is a sales tax \nbase. The House sales tax deduction is in this bill because we decided \nfor our Senators from several States that it ought to be included.\n\n  We had timber tax relief provisions: Senators Chambliss, Pryor, \nCantwell, Sessions, Shelby, Cochran, Collins, Crapo, Craig, Coleman, \nGraham of South Carolina, Wyden, Cornyn, Lugar, and Murray.\n  As many of these Senators know, the timber industry has been hard hit \nby the tax on our exports going to Europe. By the way, when this bill \npasses, those taxes go away. The industry is finally recovering from a \nlong recession. Timber mills are reopening. Mill workers are returning \nto the mills. The House timber provisions are in this bill.\n  Charitable whaling activities. Senator Murkowski wrote, asking us to \naccept the House provision that allows a deduction for charitable \nwhaling activities. Now, some will criticize this provision, but it is \nimportant to the Natives of Alaska. Senator Murkowski is looking out \nfor the Natives of Alaska. She ought to be applauded for bringing that \nto our attention. This is in the bill. But it has also passed the \nSenate several times.\n  Senator Baucus and I received letters from Members asking us to take \nSenate provisions out of the conference agreement. One example is \nSenator Stabenow's letter regarding a revenue raiser involving \ndonations of cars. As you heard yesterday, Senator Hatch shares Senator \nStabenow's concerns. The conferees retained the Senate revenue raiser.\n  There is another category of letters that we received. An example is \na letter from Senator McCain and Senator Reed of Rhode Island. In that \nletter they asked me to keep out a provision dealing with the church \ntax exemption and political activities. The provision was not in either \nbill. Chairman Thomas and I kept provisions that were outside the scope \nof the bill out of the conference entirely. No matter what the merits \nof that proposal were, we played fair by Senator McCain and Senator \nReed of Rhode Island.\n  The final category of requests dealt with the opposite of the McCain \nand Reed of Rhode Island request; that is, we had requests for items to \nbe included that were not in either bill. I will give you a couple of \nsympathetic examples: a liberalization of tax-exempt rules as applied \nto charitable hospitals. Senator Akaka raised this issue. \nUnfortunately, this provision was outside of scope.\n  Another example is penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs for hurricane \nvictims. Right now, if you are hit by four hurricanes in Florida, who \nis going to argue with Senator Nelson of Florida bringing that to our \nconference? He asked us to raise this item. It was not in either the \nHouse or Senate bill. It would have been an entirely new item that we \ncould have put in in conference. However, there was no way to address \nthe proposal without then opening the door for a lot of other items \nthat were not in either bill that somebody would want included at the \nlast minute.\n  So at this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               September 21, 2004.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Finance Committee, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Ranking Member, Finance Committee, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Finance Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus: \n     We write to respectfully request that you include as part of \n     the FSC/ETI (S. 1637) conference report the sickle cell \n     amendment that would help treat and expand services for \n     patients with the sickle cell blood disorder. Sickle cell \n     disease affects approximately 70,000 Americans and more than \n     2,500,000 Americans, mostly African-Americans, have the \n     sickle cell trait. There is still no comprehensive cure.\n       We are among the 49 Senate cosponsors of the bipartisan, \n     bicameral legislation that is the basis for this amendment \n     (S. 874/H.R. 1736) and strongly support its enactment into \n     law. Passage of this amendment in the Senate was great news \n     for the tens of thousands of Americans who suffer from this \n     disease, which affects 1 in 300 African-American newborns. \n     The disease causes normally round blood cells to take on a \n     sickle shape that clog the bloodstream. These obstructions \n     result in severe medical complications including strokes in \n     infants and limit the average lifespan to 45 years of age.\n       In summary, this legislation is a disease management bill \n     that allows states to combine Medicaid-reimbursed services to \n     target sickle cell disease, and authorizes a small\n\n[[Page S11194]]\n\n     Health Resources and Services Administration grant for \n     research, treatment and community outreach through qualifying \n     community health centers. This bill does not expand Medicaid \n     eligibility or change the federal Medicaid matching formula \n     and has a very small cost to the federal government.\n       This legislation has received exceptional support from \n     nationally prominent children's, health, African-American, \n     church and union groups including the National Association of \n     Children's Hospitals, the American Medical Association, the \n     NAACP, and the Catholic Health Association of America.\n       We are hopeful that you will include the sickle cell \n     amendment as part of the FSC/ETI (S. 1637) conference report \n     to help tens of thousands of Americans lead longer, healthier \n     and more productive lives.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jim Talent, Chuck Schumer, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Thad \n           Cochran, Arlen Specter, Maria Cantwell, Debbie \n           Stabenow, Ted Kennedy, George V.

This \n     legislation may be brought up as an amendment by Chairman \n     Thomas in conference.\n       For your interest, I have enclosed a letter from the \n     Inupiat community in Barrow, Alaska. I believe they give a \n     good summary on the merits of this legislation. Thank you for \n     your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Lisa Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2004.\n     Hon.

Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Chuck: As we move closer to consideration of the \n     conference report on the JOBS bill, I write to reiterate my \n     request that you retain the Senate two-year suspension of \n     Internal Revenue Code Section 815.\n       I wrote to you on July 19, 2004, concerning this matter and \n     its importance to several of my Pennsylvania constituents. It \n     would allow stockholder-owned life insurance companies to \n     eliminate the surtax based on earned income between 21 and 46 \n     years ago that otherwise would be triggered upon reasonable \n     corporate restructuring. As I had stated, three of my \n     constituent companies would have large potential liability \n     under Section 815.\n       Thank you very much for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2004.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Bill Thomas,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,\n     House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Charles Rangel,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means,\n     House of Representatives.\n       Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: The Senate-passed \n     version of JOBS bill, S. 1637, contains an important \n     provision that will give a well-deserved tax cut to employers \n     who continue to pay the salaries of their employees who have \n     been called to active duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. As you \n     convene the conference committee on this important \n     legislation, we want to encourage you to retain this \n     provision in the final conference bill.\n       Over 410,000 members of the National Guard and Reserve have \n     been activated to defend our Nation since September 11, 2001. \n     They have done so with valor and honor, but the frequent and \n     lengthy activations have exposed problems on the home front. \n     The Government Accountability Office reports that forty-one \n     percent of our Guard and Reserve personnel take pay cuts from \n     their civilian jobs when they put on their uniforms. While a \n     husband or wife is deployed overseas, spouses back home face \n     difficulties in making ends meet because active duty pay-\n     checks are often far less than those received in the civilian \n     world. This causes our troops to divert their attention from \n     the mission to worrying whether or not their spouses can \n     afford the mortgage, auto repairs, or child care.\n       Many employers have helped to ease this burden by making up \n     the ``pay-gap'' between the civilian and military pay of \n     their active duty employees, something that they are not \n     required to do. However, the economic downturn has made it \n     difficult for most employers to make up the pay-gap. \n     Additionally, as we continue to rely on the Guard and Reserve \n     for future deployments, those employers who currently make up \n     the pay-gap may no longer be able to provide payments to \n     employees frequently missing from work for months and years.\n       The provision in S. 1637 gives employers a 50 percent tax \n     credit on the salaries they pay to employees during \n     activations up to $30,000 of salary. This tax credit will \n     encourage those employers already providing for their \n     employees to continue this patriotic response. In addition, \n     the provision also gives small businesses a $6,000 tax credit \n     for hiring a worker to replace an active duty employee. Small \n     manufacturers would receive a credit of up to $10,000 to help \n     find a replacement.\n       We urge the Conference to retain the Reserve and Guard \n     employer tax credits in the final JOBS Act. Our troops are \n     putting everything on the line overseas. Their employers are \n     helping them at home. These patriotic employers deserve this \n     tax relief. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mary L. Landrieu, Mark Pryor, Chris Dodd, Daniel K. \n           Akaka, Byron L. Dorgan, Barbara A. Mikulski, Frank R. \n           Lautenberg, Kit Bond, Patty Murray, Jon Corzine, Maria \n           Cantwell, Charles Schumer, Bill Nelson, Tim Johnson, \n           Russ Feingold, Mark Dayton, Paul Sarbanes, Dick Durbin, \n           Patrick Leahy, Carl Levin, Ron Wyden.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2004.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Bill Thomas,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,\n     House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Charles E. Rangel,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means,\n     House of Representatives.\n       Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: I have been made aware \n     that my colleague, Sen. Graham, submitted an amendment \n     dealing with hurricane relief to the corporate tax bill \n     currently before your conference committee.\n       Specifically, this amendment, which mirrors legislation \n     Sen. Graham and I introduced in response to the recent wave \n     of hurricanes that have ravaged Florida, would allow victims \n     of disasters to withdraw funds from retirement accounts \n     without incurring proscribed penalties.\n       I respectfully request you support Sen. Graham's provision. \n     I understand that this amendment may go beyond the scope of \n     the conference, however I would argue that had the spate of \n     hurricanes happened prior to Senate-consideration of the tax \n     bill, a similar provision would have been included in the tax \n     bill.\n       As you know, along with much of the Southeast, Florida has \n     withstood a barrage of hurricanes resulting in billions of \n     dollars in damage. Providing citizens of disaster areas with \n     the means to access funds that otherwise would carry a \n     substantial penalty can play an important role in alleviating \n     their financial hardships.\n       With the conference working through various amendments to \n     the corporate tax bill, I would implore you to give serious \n     consideration to this provision, and to providing Americans \n     who have seen so much devastation access to the funds they \n     need to repair damage to their property and their lives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Bill Nelson.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have spent a little time going through \na sample of the many items that Members weighed in with at the \nconference. This is a small sample of those items raised. Many others \nwere brought to the attention of Senator Baucus and this Senator \nthrough letters or oral communications. It is safe to say, Senator \nBaucus and I can relate to what Senator Byrd and Chairman Stevens go \nthrough on the appropriations bills.\n  My point is, those who want to distort this bill by describing it as \na special interest bill are ignoring a couple things. One, they are \nignoring--perhaps conveniently, perhaps deliberately--their own efforts \nto advance their interests. Secondly, as I have said before, this bill \nis paid for by raising revenue, largely by closing abusive corporate \ntax loopholes.\n  Let the record be clear that this bill is fair, this bill is \nbalanced. It is a balanced effort at resolving four objectives. One \nobjective is ending the European tax on our exports going to Europe \nthat are legal and legitimate, even though I disagree that it should \nhave been done. I disagree with that decision. The United States lost a\n\n[[Page S11195]]\n\nWorld Trade Organization decision that our previous tax laws were \nviolating the agreements that Congress had made with Europe, Congress \nmade, because we passed these trade agreements as law.\n\n  If anybody thinks, well, it is wrong for Europe to levy a tax against \nus, we won a case against Europe on beef because they don't let our \nbeef into Europe because we use hormones in the development of our \nbeef, in the feed the cattle eat or that they are injected with, and \nEurope does not like that. But they are violating our right to send \nbeef to Europe because they don't have a scientific basis for doing it. \nThat is what the World Trade Organization said. But they still don't \ntake our beef. So we put a tax on products coming from Europe to the \nUnited States to retaliate the same way they are retaliating for the \nreasons behind this bill.\n  This bill ends that European tax because we are conforming our tax \nlaws to the international trading agreements Congress passed 10 years \nago. We are also going beyond doing away with an impediment to our \nexports so that we lose jobs here in America because of that tax. We \nare putting a replacement benefit to manufacturers in the United States \nso jobs will be created here by lowering the corporate rate from 35 to \n32.\n  No. 3, we are providing international tax reforms that will aid \ndomestic manufacturers so we can compete in the global marketplace.\n  And lastly, we achieve these policy ends in a revenue-neutral way \nthrough the curtailment of abusive corporate tax shelters and abusive \ncorporate loopholes by closing them.\n  I hope everybody agrees this bill is a well-balanced bill, \naccomplishing a goal we should have accomplished a year and a half ago, \nat least no later than March when these European taxes started on our \nproducts. I apologize to any Americans who have been laid off because \nour products are not competitive in Europe because of that tax and why \nit takes Congress so long to wake up, particularly when there are \nMembers of Congress always complaining about outsourcing.\n  We started on this bill in March. It took us 15 days, over a period \nof 3 months, to get this bill through the Senate. And then we were a \nlong period of time before the minority party agreed we could go to \nconference. But once we got to conference, thanks to the good \ncooperative working relationship between Senator Baucus and me for the \nSenate and between Mr. Baucus and me and Congressman Thomas, chairman \nof the House Ways and Means Committee, we have this bill.\n  But for those laid-off workers, I am embarrassed this bill couldn't \nhave been passed a long time ago and that we ran up against all of the \nimpediments. Why? Because certain Members of this body don't want a \nRepublican President signing a jobs bill a few days before the \nelection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           CHRISTOPHER REEVE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I send my deepest condolences to the \nfamily of Christopher Reeve, one of the bravest Americans, who fought \nso hard to prove that even with the most horrific injuries, one could \nstill be involved in community life, and who dedicated himself to \nraising awareness for stem-cell research, for the hope and the dream of \nso many of our people who suffer every day, that they may have a cure \nin their lifetime.\n  Christopher Reeve was Superman in the movies, but that was make-\nbelieve. He was Superman in real life.\n  My heart goes out to everyone who knew him and to the disabled \ncommunity who counted on him. It is such a tragedy to lose him.\n\n\n                         Expressions of Thanks\n\n  Madam President, I have a number of people to thank.\n  On Friday night, the Senate passed the Veterans' Benefits \nImprovements Act and included my bill to designate the memorial being \nbuilt at Riverside Veterans Cemetery as the National POW-MIA Memorial. \nCongressman Calvert authored the House bill.\n  I am so proud the Senate acted first on this bill. I have been to the \ncemetery. I have seen a model of the memorial. This is going to be the \nveterans cemetery, national POW memorial. It is going to draw people \nfrom all across the country. So many of our people were at one time \nPOWs. The numbers are staggering. And, of course, there are some who we \ndon't know what happened to. They deserve this kind of memorial.\n  I thank Senators Specter and Graham for helping me with this bill.\n  Second, last night the Senate passed a House bill by Representative \nGeorge Miller--I introduced the Senate companion piece--to adjust the \nboundaries of the John Muir National Historic Site in Martinez, CA. We \nare glad about this because it is going to bring some improvements to \nthis area. I thank Senators Domenici and Bingaman for that.\n  Also last night something very special occurred here for the people \nof California and the people of this Nation. The Senate passed the \nCalifornia missions bill to help preserve the historic missions in the \nState of California. It has been a long, hard road. These missions are \nso important to the history of the West. These missions were built in \nthe 1700s, and they are crumbling. We had to struggle to get the Senate \ninto committee to pass the bill, and they did it.\n  I thank Senators Domenici, Bingaman, Feinstein, and Smith. I thank \nJudge William Clark, Stephen Hearst, Rick Ameil, Dr. Knox Mellon for \neverything they did. It is a very important day for us in California \nfor these missions and for California history and American history.\n\n\n                       FSC/ETI Conference Report\n\n  That gets me to the business at hand. I want to start off by thanking \nSenator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana for her impassioned defense of our \nNational Guard and Reserve. Like her, I am shocked and dismayed that \nthe House conferees on the FSC bill before us stripped out an important \nprovision to give tax relief for those employers who continue to pay \ntheir reservist employees after they are called up for Active Duty and \ndeployed.\n  Four in 10 members of the Guard and Reserves suffer a pay cut when \nthey are called up for Active Duty. In other words, the pay they \nreceive when activated is not as much as the salary they receive in the \nprivate sector. As a result of this pay gap, their families suffer. Car \npayments are missed, medical insurance lapses, childcare is \nunaffordable. Our Guard and reservists are sent to the front lines with \nthe burden of knowing their families back home will struggle to make \nends meet.\n  I could not say anything that could match the eloquence of Senator \nLandrieu and, of course, her chart that she gave me to hold up again. \nThis says, ``What should $434 million pay for? One year of the Landrieu \namendment on Guard and Reserve tax credit, or $44 million for ceiling \nfans?''\n  I think the answer is clear to most Americans. As a result of Senator \nLandrieu's eloquence, now America knows what happened in the back \nrooms, when the only thing missing was the cigar smoke--but maybe that \nwas there as well when these bills were written.\n  Why is this so critical? Senator Landrieu explained it. Part of \nSenator Landrieu's amendment involves a bill that I wrote where we \nreimburse State and local governments who do the same thing. In other \nwords, if a city in New York State suffers the loss of a policeman \nbecause he is called up and reactivated because he is in the Reserves, \nmany cities across our great land are paying that differential to the \nReservists or the National Guardsmen. I will tell you, it is hurting \nthose entities very much to do this. I am very sad that part of the \nbill was dropped. And what we were able to get, with the help of \nSenator Landrieu, was a sense of the Senate that the conferees should, \nin fact, take a look at this, and the President ought to consider \ntaking care of these governments and the cost of this payment to the \nReservists and the Guard in his next budget.\n  I am very glad we were able to do that. I thank Senator Daschle, who \nphoned me late last night; Senator Grassley, who was very helpful in \nwriting that; of course, my staff, who worked hard with Senator \nLandrieu's staff to come to a solution; Senator Harry Reid, who is such \na workhorse around here, who helped make it happen.\n  I have to hope that this President, who is sending our Guard there \nevery day, sending our Reserves, and extending their time there, would \nfeel a little\n\n[[Page S11196]]\n\ncompassion--compassionate conservative--for these reservists and these \nguardsmen who are suffering a cut in pay to put themselves in harm's \nway. As we all know, well over a thousand are dead--not just guardsmen \nand reservists, but other military personnel as well.\n  I am confident that if we have a President Kerry, he will be eager to \nwork with us to solve this problem because he knows war firsthand. He \nknows the worst thing you can do to someone who has a family back home \nis to put on top of their worry about whether they are going to make it \nthrough the war without a serious injury, or perhaps not make it \nthrough at all--put on top of that the fear that their families are \ngoing to be driven into poverty. Forty percent of the troops now in \nIraq are members of the Guard and Reserve.\n  Last year when I visited Walter Reed Army Medical Center to visit our \nwounded troops, I came across one young soldier who was severely \nwounded. During the course of the conversation, he told me that from \nthe time he was wounded, every aspect of his care, treatment, and \ntransportation was carried out by members of the Reserves. This soldier \ntold me he had the highest respect for the capabilities of our Guard \nand Reserve, and he was eternally grateful for their professionalism.\n  It is important to speak out and say we are in support of our troops. \nBut in those closed-door meetings they are handing out tax breaks to \npeople who import ceiling fans. It seems to me the first thing the \nconferees should have done is ensure that the Landrieu provision and \nBoxer provision were kept in. Senator Landrieu is on the floor of the \nSenate and, again, I thank her for her leadership. We all look forward \nto the day when our guards and reservists can return home, be reunited \nwith their families, and have their jobs back and make sure their \nfamilies are whole.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the \nStates that are paying this money to these reservists and are getting \nnothing from us, when the Federal Government is taking these people \nout--this President--and activating the Guard and Reserves, putting \nthem in harm's way and not reimbursing State and local government.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nExamples of State, County and Local Governments Covering the Pay Gap of \n                               Reservists\n\n\n                                Alabama\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                                Arizona\n\n       City of Phoenix Police Department, Arizona.\n\n\n                                Arkansas\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                               California\n\n       State Government, City of Chula Vista, CA, Dos Palos Oro \n     Loma School District, CA, City of Fremont, CA, City of \n     Fresno, CA, City of Glendale, CA, City of Hercules, CA, City \n     of Los Angeles, CA, Los Angeles County, City of Longbeach, \n     CA, City of Sacramento, CA, City of San Diego, CA, City of \n     San Diego Police Department, CA, City of San Francisco, CA, \n     San Francisco County, CA, City of Santa Barbara, CA, City of \n     Roseville, CA.\n\n\n                              Connecticut\n\n       State Government, City of Glastonbury, CT, City of New \n     Britain, CT.\n\n\n                                Delaware\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                                Florida\n\n       State Government, Broward County School Board, FLA, City of \n     Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, FLA, Miami-Dade County, FLA.\n\n\n                                Georgia\n\n       DeKalb County School System, GA.\n\n\n                                Illinois\n\n       State Government, City of Chicago, Illinois, Cook County, \n     Illinois.\n\n\n                                  Iowa\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                                Kentucky\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                               Louisiana\n\n       Caddo Parish Schools, LA.\n\n\n                                 Maine\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                                Maryland\n\n       State Government, Howard County, MD.\n\n\n                             Massachusetts\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                                Michigan\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                               Minnesota\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                                 Nevada\n\n       State Government, City of Las Vegas, NV.\n\n\n                             New Hampshire\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                               New Jersey\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                                New York\n\n       State Government, New York City Police Department, Nassau \n     County Police Department, City of Wallkill, NY, County of \n     Westchester, NY.\n\n\n                             North Carolina\n\n       State Government, City of Charlotte, NC.\n\n\n                                  Ohio\n\n       State Government, City of Dayton, OH, City of Toledo, OH, \n     Franklin County Police Department, OH, City of Kettering, OH.\n\n\n                                Oklahoma\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                              Pennsylvania\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                              Rhode Island\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                             south carolina\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                               tennessee\n\n       State Government, Davidson County, Tenn., City of \n     Nashville, Tenn.\n\n\n                                 texas\n\n       State Government, City of Austin, TX, City of Grapevine, \n     TX.\n\n\n                                virginia\n\n       State Government, City of Bedford, VA, County of Henrico, \n     VA, County of Prince William, VA.\n\n\n                               washington\n\n       City of Redmond, Washington.\n\n\n                             west virginia\n\n       State Government.\n\n\n                                wyoming\n\n       State Government.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I see the Senator from Oklahoma here. His State pays for \nGuard and Reserve when they are called up, as do the others included in \nthe list.\n  I say thank you to all of these States and cities for stepping up to \nthe plate. You deserve the support of the Senate. You deserve to have \nlegislation passed and not just a sense of the Senate, which I am happy \nwe did, but I am not naive about these things; I have been here too \nlong to know it is kiss-off to get a sense of the Senate. But at least \nwe got there. What happened was this provision that passed the Senate \nwas knocked out in conference while goodies were given all around.\n  I want to make a point about this bill. There are some good things in \nthis bill. I wrote one of the main provisions, along with Senator \nEnsign, called the Invest In the USA Act. Some people don't understand \nit. It says we give a break to countries who have their funds abroad, \nand if they bring them home and put people to work with them, they get \na tax break in the next 12 months. This is a stimulus and job creation. \nEconomists, Democrats and Republicans, say it is going to be very \neffective.\n  Senator Lincoln and I worked on runaway production. That is \nimportant. Of course, the underlying premise of a tax cut to encourage \nmanufacturing is very important. We eliminate the preferential tax \ntreatment of ethanol. That is important. We partially close the SUV \nloophole. I compliment Senator Nickles for that. I think we can do \nmore, but he stepped up to the plate on that. The thing with the \n$100,000 loophole was ridiculous. I am happy we have gone back to the \noriginal loophole of $25,000, which is still too much, but it is a big \nimprovement.\n  I also thank Senator Snowe for her tax fairness for naval \nshipbuilders, which is important. What is bad in the bill is the \ntobacco cave-in, where the FDA doesn't get the authority to regulate \nthis tobacco, and there is a bailout. I don't have a problem with the \nbailout with farmers, but this was an opportunity to save our children.\n  The overtime regulation from Senator Harkin is stripped from the \nbill. It is going to hurt our people badly when they no longer get \novertime. Outsourcing--the provision by Senator Dodd--passed 70-26. You \nwould think we could have fought for that, but it is out. And, of \ncourse, the reservists tax credit that we talked about. There also was \na tax credit for farmers for water conservation that I strongly \nsupported. It was stripped from the bill.\n  The film industry was treated very badly in this bill.\n  We are killing the goose that lays the golden egg because the film \nbusiness is a terrific export business and they get treated very badly.\n\n[[Page S11197]]\n\n  So we had a chance to have a great bill. Instead, we have a bill that \nhas some good provisions but also has some horrific provisions in it. \nIt is a terrible way to legislate, but the Landrieu-Boxer provision \nthat was stripped out which dealt with our reservists and our National \nGuard, all I can say to Senator Landrieu is that a picture speaks a \nthousand words. Her poster showing the choices that this Republican \nCongress made is something that I hope the American people are watching \nbecause this is unforgivable. I am going to fight with my friend from \nLouisiana until we fix this problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, under the agreement last night I have \nup to 30 minutes to speak, and I will be happy to yield additional time \nto Senator Boxer at a later time because I most certainly want to \nsupport her comments and to thank her for her great support of this \namendment. Without Senator Boxer and many other Senators, the victory \nthat we have achieved this morning would not have been possible.\n  Senator Boxer knows, because she represents the largest State in our \nUnion, that 90,000 guardsmen and reservists reside in California. \nToday, as she and I are on this floor speaking on their behalf, 7,900 \nare currently on duty from California, having left their homes from \nBakersfield--the home of Chairman Thomas, or the center of his \ndistrict--to San Francisco to Los Angeles, from Louisiana, from \nOklahoma, and from Texas. Thousands of Guard and Reserve men and women \nhave left their families, left their children, left their place of \nemployment and gone to the front lines.\n  We decide where the front line is and we send them. Wherever we say \nto go, they go, and they have gone in large numbers.\n  I have spent the last few days speaking about this because it is of \nsuch critical importance for us in the Senate and for the Congress to \nunderstand that we are asking more and more of our Guard and Reserve. \nThis was not always the case. It was not that way in World War I and \nWorld War II. It was not that way in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s, \nbut it is this way today.\n  From 1990 to 2004, we have called up 690,500 Guard and Reserve \nmembers. The Guard and Reserve now make up 40 percent of our whole \nforce. We have 1.6 million active members of all of our services, and \nwe have 1.2 million men and women in the Guard and Reserve.\n\n  Many of these men and women, as my colleagues know because I have \nsaid it--and I am sure my colleagues are now aware of this, that when \nmany of our reservists signed up, they expected to make a sacrifice. \nThey knew that one weekend a month they would go on duty, and they knew \nthat in times of crisis they would be sent. What we did not tell them \n10 years ago is that there would have been a terrorist attack on 9/11. \nWhat we were not able to tell them 10 years ago was that we would make \na decision to reduce our Active Forces, thereby putting a greater \nburden on them.\n  They signed up under a different paradigm. Yet year after year some \nof us have come to this floor--not just this week, not just last year, \nbut year after year. I have been here 8 years. There is not a year that \nI can think of that I have not mentioned this--maybe the first year I \nwas here, but most certainly once I got on the Armed Services Committee \nand it became apparent to me and many others of the major shifts that \nwe were making, and have argued, sometimes successfully and sometimes \nnot successfully, not because I do not think our arguments are clear \nand compelling but because they seem to fall on deaf ears, that the \nGuard and Reserve need help.\n  I wish I could spend the time reading some of the hundreds, thousands \nof e-mails that I have received since this filibuster started. The \nfilibuster is no longer in place because basically the amendment we \nasked for has been agreed to. It is going to be put in another bill. \nThat is how this whole thing started, was to say that I know that it \nwas impossible for us to amend $137 billion. We could not procedurally \namend this bill. The only thing we could have done would have been to \nvote against it or send it to the President and ask him to veto it \nbecause the Guard and Reserve were left out. Both of those strategies \nwere probably not going to happen. So I said that I would accept that, \nand I would stay here until Thursday or Friday, until I had to, with \nothers helping me, to make sure we could find another vehicle that \nwould be appropriate to put this amendment on as much intact as we \ncould, and that is what happened.\n  There are a lot of Senators to thank, and I think I will spend a \nmoment thanking the Senators before I go into more detail. First, I \nwill just finish this one thought and then I will thank the Senators.\n  I was explaining how the paradigms changed and we are relying more \nand more on our Guard and Reserve. So when this bill began to be put \ntogether 2 years ago, some of us knew that this bill was going to start \nout at about $50 billion. But we also knew that it would grow because \nany time there is a tax bill before this Congress, lots of things get \nattached. NASCAR racing got attached; ceiling fans are in here; \nrailroad reimbursements for maintenance of tracks is in here. I do not \nhave a complaint about one of those items. That is not why we \nfilibustered the bill.\n  What we complained about is the only item that was put in the Finance \nCommittee and sent out of the Senate with 100 percent of us supporting \nit--all of the Republicans and all of the Democrats supported it--was \nstripped out by the House Republican leadership.\n  If we cannot find $2 billion of $137 billion in tax cuts to give to \nthe men and women who are taking 100 percent of the risk, 100 percent \nof the bullets, what are we doing here? That was the point we made. The \npoint was heard loudly and clearly.\n\n  So with the help of many colleagues, we have corrected the error. We \nhave sent an amendment, in large measure whole. Senator Boxer is \ncorrect that a portion that she and I thought was very important, which \nwas to help public entities that keep those paychecks whole as the \nGuard and Reserve go to the front line and lose 41 percent of their \nincome, according to the GAO study--that was given to us not last week, \nnot a month ago, this study was given to us 3 years ago. We knew 3 \nyears ago that our Guard and Reserve take a 41-percent pay cut. The \nsoldiers do not mind the pay cut. They are eating rations. They are \nliving in tents. They are sleeping on the ground. This is not--well, it \nis about the soldiers, but it is more about the families they leave \nbehind, about the children without health care, about the wives who \nhave to take two jobs, about the gasoline that has to be put in the \ncar, the car notes that have to be paid.\n  If we can find a tax bill and work on it for 2 years, which we did--2 \nyears of work went into this bill. I am not on the Finance Committee, \nbut I have a great member in Senator Breaux. I know how hard he works, \nand I know how he supported this amendment as well. I have Congressman \nJim McCrery and Congressman Jefferson who worked very hard. The \nLouisiana interests are well represented in this as well as in many \nother important bills. But what I objected to was that the Guard and \nReserve amendment that would have given a tax credit to the thousands \nof businesses in this country that are doing the patriotic thing, the \nright thing, the good thing, and they are getting commended by our \nPresident and us, we could not provide them a 50-percent tax cut to \nkeep this paycheck whole for those on the front line.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a very brief moment and I will \nbe finished.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder if my friend would place in the Record a number \nof letters--I didn't have a chance to do it before--from various cities \nin California, also from the International Association of Firefighters. \nWill my friend do that?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder if my friend would mind if I could read one \nletter, which will take about 60 seconds.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is one of the typical letters from the City of \nSacramento:\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On behalf of the City of Sacramento, I \n     am pleased to offer our support for S. 1845, which would \n     assist local governments that continue to pay employees who \n     are deployed to active duty.\n       Last year, eight of our permanent employees were activated \n     to service in Iraq. We are\n\n[[Page S11198]]\n\n     proud of these employees and support them by making up the \n     difference between military and civilian pay. We also pay the \n     City contribution for their families to continue their health \n     benefits.\n       The cost to the City of Sacramento was approximately \n     $73,000 last year. With the current budget crisis affecting \n     California cities, S. 1845 is needed to ensure that cities \n     like ours do not shoulder this financial burden alone.\n       If we can provide any further information or support as \n     your office moves this legislation, please contact Aaron \n     Chong, Law and Legislation Coordination, at (916) 808-6762. \n     Thank you for your support of our brave men and women and \n     their families.\n\n  This is a specific letter that wraps it up just the way the Senator \nhas, in a very simple, straightforward way. But I do appreciate the \nSenator putting these letters in the Record and being able to stand \nshoulder to shoulder with the Senator until we fix this problem.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have those \nletters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              City of Chula Vista,\n\n\n                                   Office of the City Council,\n\n                                   Chula Vista, CA, March 3, 2004.\n     Re notice to support S. 1845 (Boxer): Service to Country \n         Reimbursement Act.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The Chula Vista City Council, in \n     keeping with the guidelines established in the City's \n     Legislative Program, has taken unanimous action to support S. \n     1845 (Boxer), as introduced November 11, 2003. This proposal \n     would require the Federal government to reimburse state and \n     local governments for the salary costs of our employees who \n     serve in the military reserves and have been called to active \n     duty.\n       Under existing law, the City of Chula Vista pays the \n     salaries of our reservist employees for the first 30 days of \n     their active duty assignment. Beyond those first 30 days, the \n     City pays the employees the difference between their military \n     pay and their normal civilian salary. In addition, we incur \n     the cost of hiring supplementary personnel to carry out the \n     responsibilities of the reservists who have been called away.\n       Chula Vista has already incurred costs in excess of \n     $500,000 during the current military actions in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. Passage of S. 1845 would be a tremendous benefit \n     to local government agencies throughout the Nation. On behalf \n     of our city, I am pleased to offer Chula Vista's strong \n     support for your bill, and look forward to its successful \n     passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Stephen C. Padilla,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 City of Roseville\n\n\n                                                 City Council,\n\n                                  Roseville, CA, January 15, 2004.\n     Subject support for S. 1845--service to Country Reimbursement \n         Act.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer, On behalf of the citizens of the City \n     of Roseville, California, I offer my support for S. 1845, \n     which would assist local governments that continue to pay \n     employees who are deployed to active duty.\n       Last year, five of our 946 permanent employees were \n     activated to service in Iraq. We are proud of these employees \n     and support them by making up the difference between military \n     and civilian pay. We also pay the City contribution for their \n     families to continue their health benefits.\n       The cost to our City was approximately $105,000 last year. \n     With the current budget crisis hitting California cites, S. \n     1845 is needed to ensure that cities like ours do not \n     shoulder this financial burden alone.\n       If we can provide any further information or support as you \n     move this legislation, please contact Ellen Powell, \n     Legislative Analyst, at (916) 774-5219. Thank you for your \n     support for our brave men and women and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    F.C. Rockholm,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            City of Santa Barbara,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                              Santa Barbara, CA, January 27, 2004.\n     Re Service to Country Reimbursement Act--S. 1845.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer. On behalf of the Council of the City of \n     Santa Barbara, we unanimously support the Service to Country \n     Reimbursement Act. We also want to express our sincere \n     appreciation for your leadership in sponsoring this bill.\n       Since October 2001 the City has voluntarily provided \n     approximately $250,000 in salaries, benefits and retirement \n     fund contributions for City employees who have been called to \n     active military duty. While we remain committed to this \n     policy, we do not have unlimited resources. The City has not \n     yet recovered from the revenue losses due to the economic \n     recession and September 2001 terrorist attack. In addition we \n     have incurred significant increased costs to provide higher \n     levels of police security and emergency preparedness.\n       This situation in combination with the loss of revenue \n     (incurred and projected) due to the California state budget \n     crisis places us in a very untenable position. Although S. \n     1845, if enacted, will not resolve all of these issues, it \n     will provide resources to fund a major portion of our \n     potential future costs for continuing support for our \n     employees, and their families, who are activated for military \n     service.\n       We encourage you to make enactment of this bill a high \n     priority and ask that you call on us for support and advocacy \n     with others as the bill progresses through hearings. Thank \n     you again for taking the initiative to sponsor this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Marty Blum,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  City of Fremont,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                   Fremont, CA, November 24, 2003.\n     Re Support for S. 1845, the Service to the Country \n         Reimbursement Act\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing on behalf of the Fremont \n     City Council to let you know of our strong support for your \n     S. 1845, the Service to the Country Reimbursement Act.\n       This needed legislation will reimburse state and local \n     governments for the costs of paying the difference between \n     the civilian salary of government employees and the military \n     pay of a National Guard or reserve member who is activated \n     for more than 30 days.\n       We have several employees who have been called to active \n     duty since September 11, 2001. We are supplementing their \n     military pay with City funds during their deployment because \n     we strongly believe that serving your country should not \n     become a financial hardship. We have already spent more than \n     $120,000 to supplement the salaries of our active duty \n     employees and more than $30,000 on their health benefits. \n     With the significant budget problems we are facing this year, \n     we greatly appreciate any assistance the federal government \n     can provide us.\n       Thank you for introducing this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Gus Morrison,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                             of Fire Fighters,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Tom Lantos,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Lantos: On behalf of the 260,000 \n     professional firefighters and emergency medical services \n     personnel who are members of the International Association of \n     Fire Fighters (IAFF), I am pleased to offer our enthusiastic \n     support for H.R. 1345, a bill to support our citizen \n     soldiers.\n       As you are aware, many fire fighters serve in either the \n     National Guard or Reserves. As a result of our nation's \n     multi-front war against terrorism, many of these brave men \n     and women of the IAFF have been called up to active duty.\n       While some conscientious jurisdictions have voluntarily \n     agreed to make up the difference between military pay and \n     fire fighter pay, too many have not. H.R. 1345 would address \n     this issue by helping local governments with the burden of \n     making up the difference in the lost wage. We applaud your \n     efforts to ensure that those serving abroad will have the \n     comfort of knowing that their families will not face \n     financial hardships.\n       Please contact me if the IAFF can be of additional service.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Barry Kasinitz,\n     Governmental Affairs Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           State of New Hampshire,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Concord, NH, June 19, 2003.\n     Senator John Sununu,\n     Manchester, NH.\n       Dear Senator Sununu: I am writing to express my support for \n     House Resolution 1345 which provides incentives to State and \n     Local governments, as well as private employers, who \n     reimburse their employees who are called to active military \n     duty for the difference between their civilian pay and their \n     military pay. I feel strongly that the men and women who are \n     called to active military duty should not be penalized \n     financially for serving our country. When I was chief \n     executive officer of Cabletron, I was proud to support my \n     employees who were called to active duty during the Gulf War \n     by making up the difference in pay between what they were \n     paid by Cabletron and what they received from the military. \n     As Governor, I again had the opportunity to support our \n     military by issuing an executive order that ensures that \n     state employees who were called to serve in Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom will not lose any benefits or receive a reduced \n     salary as a result of their service.\n       House Resolution 1345 provides reimbursements to states \n     like New Hampshire who support our military. I urge you to \n     support this bill on behalf of our State and on behalf\n\n[[Page S11199]]\n\n     of the men and women who serve our country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Craig R. Benson,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I would like to continue by thanking all of the \nMembers of this body, particularly the members of the Finance \nCommittee, particularly the Senator from Oklahoma, who stepped forward \nand helped us to negotiate a very good end to this situation. But the \noriginal cosponsors of this amendment were Senator Murray, Senator Tim \nJohnson, Senator Maria Cantwell, Senator Jon Corzine, Senator Kerry, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Dodd, and Senator Pryor. There were 21 Senators \nwho signed the letter to the conferees and I am going to submit their \nnames to the Record, but among them was Senator Bond, who has been a \nstrong advocate for the Guard and Reserve; Senator Akaka, who came to \nthe floor over the weekend to lend his support and his help; Senator \nBill Nelson, who came to the floor as well and gave his help and his \nsupport. I also wish to thank the leadership, Senator Daschle and \nSenator Reid in particular, as well as the Republican leadership, who \nworked hard through these couple of days to make this good end come to \nbe today; particularly Senator Harkin, who was in the Chamber \nadvocating for a different issue that was his primary focus, but \nwithout his help in being able to hold the floor and being able to keep \nthe procedure moving in the direction that helped us to make our point, \nit would not have happened. I also wish to thank the Senator from \nAlabama, Mr. Sessions, for spending many hours in the Chamber. He and \nthe Senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, have spoken hour after \nhour after hour on this floor about the needs of the Guard and Reserve.\n  Perhaps we are not making our arguments clear enough; I do not know. \nBut they seem to sometimes leave our mouths and fall on deaf ears. I do \nnot think it is complicated; 690,000 Americans have been called up by \nour Commander in Chief to go to the front line. As we put bills \ntogether here, tax bills, health care bills, education bills, \ntransportation bills, could we please not keep them in mind but put \nthem in the bill and not leave them out. They are not asking for much. \nThey are not asking for 100 percent of any tax credit. But surely $2 \nbillion out of 137 is something we could have done. I know there were \narguments, and I think somewhat legitimate--perhaps the amendment was \nnot written in the correct way. Perhaps it was a little more \ncomplicated. We have successfully cleared up those complications. I \nhave said there were other amendments in here that to me seemed quite \ncomplicated.\n  One in particular was a reimbursement for railroad track maintenance. \nI guess we trust the railroads to tell us how many miles. I don't think \nwe send out people to walk the tracks and measure the railroad tracks. \nSo I think we trust employers when they say they are paying their Guard \nand national Reserve and they put that on their tax return. I think \nmost certainly we can trust them and trust the members of our Guard and \nReserve. We are trusting them to fight for us and we stand with them. \nWe are honoring the employers, small and large companies that are \nkeeping those paychecks whole, and the least we can do is to provide a \n50-percent tax credit.\n  I also wish to thank the floor staff: Lula Davis and Mary Paone, as \nwell as the Republican staff who helped this weekend, and the Senate \nFinance Committee staff which helped us to work out the final details. \nOn my own staff: Jason Matthews, Jeffrey Wiener, Kevin Avery, Kathleen \nStrottman, Brian Geiger, Amy Cenicola, and Linda Cox, and particularly \nmy husband and my children, who were supportive of this effort because \nit could have gone on for many more days.\n\n  I want to, in the few minutes I have remaining, submit a few more \nthings to the Record.\n  One of them is a letter that came to this Congress, not from the \ncurrent Secretary of Defense, but from the former Secretary of Defense, \nBill Cohen, in 1998, saying basically, while we support the concept of \nproviding incentives to employees of Reserve component members, the \nFederal Government, we at this time cannot afford such a program, but \nwith the increased use of the Guard and Reserve, particularly for \nunplanned contingency operations, employers of our Guard and Reserve \nmembers are often faced with the unplanned absences of their reservist \nemployees. They may incur additional business expenses associated with \nthe unplanned absences. The report suggests that a financial incentive \nmight be helpful to ameliorate some of the employer problems, \nparticularly for small business owners.\n  There you have the Secretary of Defense, the former Secretary of \nDefense, outlining that while they couldn't afford to do it in a \nDefense bill, we most certainly could afford to do it in a tax bill. \nThat is why we started working with the tax bill and with the Finance \nCommittee. I am pleased to say we have come to a good end. So in a few \nminutes, by a voice vote, this amendment will be adopted. It will go \nover to the House and to the House leadership on both the Republican \nand the Democratic side. I urge them to look carefully at what we have \nsent over there, to pass it the way it is. If they do, it will become \nlaw right away. Perhaps when we come back after this election or \nperhaps before the election, that could be done. But clearly the Senate \nhas acted with respect, with care, with cooperation, and again I thank \nthe Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership for working so \nwell over the weekend to send this amendment, basically intact as we \nput it together, over to the House. It is now in their court.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). There is 11 minutes remaining.\n  Does the Senator ask unanimous consent to have the documents printed \nin the Record?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 1998.\n     Hon. Floyd D. Spence,\n     Chairman, Committee on National Security, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Department of Defense report, \n     enclosed, has been prepared in response to the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. Section 1232 \n     of that Act directed submission of a report and draft \n     legislation to provide tax incentives to employers of members \n     of Reserve components.\n       The Department of Defense does not support submission of \n     legislation at this time but is submitting draft legislation \n     as a drafting service.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n       Enclosure: As stated.\n\n A Report to Congress Concerning Incentives to Employers of Members of \n                         the Reserve Components\n\n       This report responds to the requirements of section 1232 of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 \n     (P.L. 104-201, September 23, 1996), which requires a report \n     to the Committee on the Armed Services of the Senate and the \n     Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives regarding tax incentives to employers of \n     members of Reserve components to compensate for absences of \n     Reserve employees due to required training and performance of \n     active duty.\n\n\n                                overview\n\n       Increasingly, members of the National Guard and Reserve are \n     being called upon to augment the active duty forces in the \n     post-Cold War world. This is a sound use of resources and an \n     integral part of our national military strategy. More \n     recently, Reserve component members have responded to the \n     call in Operation RESTORE HOPE in Somalia, Operation UPHOLD \n     DEMOCRACY in Haiti, and Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR/JOINT GUARD \n     in Bosnia.\n       Previous Congresses have viewed legislation that would \n     provide incentives such as tax expenditures as having a fixed \n     and recurring budgetary effect. A number of methods could \n     resolve such a problem.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Generally, members of the Reserve components (both National \n     Guard and Reserve members) are required to attend one weekend \n     of inactive duty training per month and 14 days of active \n     duty training annually. Over and above this training, members \n     are often required to participate in mobilization training, \n     formal schools, and special training. Additionally, \n     many Reservists are called upon to provide PERSTEMPO \n     relief (reducing the active duty Service members time away \n     from home station). For some individuals, this may exceed \n     the normal Reserve participation requirements. Some \n     Reserve members, who support specific weapons platforms, \n     are actually spending up to 180 days a year on military \n     duty. This is compounded by involuntary call-ups to \n     support missions such as Operation DESERT STORM and JOINT \n     ENDEAVOR, which required the use of the Reserve \n     components.\n       In addition to this busy Reserve schedule, the vast \n     majority of Reserve component (RC)\n\n[[Page S11200]]\n\n     members are employed full-time in civilian occupations. So, \n     not only are RC members working full-time in the civilian \n     community, they are meeting their Reserve obligation, which \n     has substantially increased beyond the minimum 38 days a year \n     prescribed by law.\n       This ``part-time'' Reserve obligation is substantially \n     different from any other part-time activity in which most \n     employees participate. They may be involuntarily called to \n     active duty in times of national emergencies. Although \n     efforts are made to reduce any conflict these absences may \n     cause, some conflict is unavoidable. Title 37 U.S.C. section \n     1008(b) mandates that each Quadrennial Review of Military \n     Compensation (QRMC) conduct ``a complete review of the \n     principles and concepts of the compensation system for \n     members of the uniformed services.'' The Sixth QRMC stated \n     that conflicts between RC members and their full-time \n     civilian employers account for nearly one-third of all \n     personnel losses incurred by the Reserve components.\n\n\n                           demonstrated need\n\n                           Employer concerns\n\n       From an employer's viewpoint, unscheduled absences create a \n     variety of problems.\n       While Reservists repeatedly demonstrate that their military \n     training and experience benefit their civilian employers, \n     budget-minded employers must also consider the impact of \n     unexpected long-term absences on their businesses. positive \n     approach to the pressures caused by unplanned employee \n     absences than simply enforcing Reservists rights.\n\n                     Department of Defense concerns\n\n       Trained and equipped members of the National Guard and \n     Reserve are an integral part of the national military \n     strategy. With a smaller active duty force, the Department is \n     maximizing all available resources to meet mission \n     requirements. This has increased the day to day use of the \n     Reserve components. There are substantial economic benefits \n     to the government to use the Reserve components as they cost \n     the government less to maintain--anywhere from 25% to 75% of \n     the cost of their active duty counterparts. This is part of \n     the rationale for the dramatic shift of missions and force \n     structure from the active to the reserve forces. It is the \n     nation's advantage, therefore, to use its Reserve components.\n       Retention of RC members becomes critical. It is in the \n     government's best interest to keep well-trained individuals \n     in the military, rather than incurring the additional \n     training costs (roughly $26,000 per new recruit). The train-\n     up time associated with recruiting new individuals into the \n     force is also considerable. In spite of our efforts to \n     provide a benefits package that makes continued Reserve \n     service an attractive proposition, employer conflict is often \n     cited as the number one reason why individuals decide to \n     leave Reserve component military service.\n\n\n                     department of defense efforts\n\n       The DoD has undertaken several initiatives to reduce \n     conflicts between Reservists and their employees. Since 1970, \n     the DoD has developed an aggressive program to encourage \n     employer support. The National Committee for Employer Support \n     of the Guard and Reserve (NCESGR) is an agency within the \n     Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve \n     Affairs that promotes cooperation and understanding between \n     RC members and their civilian employers. This program has \n     grown from several hundred employers and professional and \n     labor organizations to more than 3000 community leaders \n     nationwide. Despite these efforts, the Sixth QRMC stated that \n     10 to 20 percent of RC members continue to experience \n     significant employment-related conflicts.\n       In an effort to protect Reserve employees, the 103rd \n     Congress passed the Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). This legislation protects \n     ``non-career service members'' from job discrimination based \n     on Uniformed Service. USERRA has simplified statutory \n     employment protections and provided a system of local \n     arbitration for individual cases. While protecting the \n     employee, USERRA does not, however, address any adverse \n     effects Reserve service may impose upon employers. Employers \n     are required to provide seven basic entitlements by statute: \n     prompt reinstatement, status, accrued seniority, health \n     insurance coverage, training/retraining, special protections, \n     and other non-seniority benefits.\n       Despite these efforts, the major employer disincentive to \n     encouraging employee participation in the Reserve components \n     is the additional costs and reduced profits stemming from \n     Reserve participation.\n\n\n                     previous legislative proposals\n\n       Recognizing the substantial role that employee attitudes \n     and practices have on Reserve readiness, legislative \n     proposals granting a monetary incentive (in the form of a tax \n     credit) to employers of National Guard and Reserve members \n     have been introduced several times, the most recently in the \n     103rd Congress. The Department understands that there may be \n     other methods to soften the employer's burden. The main \n     points of the most recent legislative proposals are outlined \n     below.\n\n                       Summary of past proposals\n\n       DoD 100-49 (100th Congress): Credit and deduction; 20 \n     percent of amount paid and 10 percent of amount unpaid; any \n     training; nonrefundable; and annual maximum of $2000 per \n     member.\n       H.R. 71 (103rd Congress): 50 percent of amount paid and 10 \n     percent of amount unpaid of actual compensation paid when \n     employee was performing qualified active duty; annual maximum \n     of $2000 per member; and no credit for employee not scheduled \n     to work.\n       Additionally, the Sixth QRMC made the following \n     recommendations:\n       Nonrefundable credit of 50% paid to Reservist on military \n     leave and 10% credit for amount unpaid;\n       Include credit for self-employed individuals; and\n       Certification of Veterans' Reemployment Rights compliance.\n\n\n                           draft legislation\n\n       The Department has developed draft legislation, as a \n     drafting service, for a tax credit program for employers of \n     Ready Reservists and self-employed Reservists as required by \n     section 1232 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1997. Because of associated costs in the form of \n     federal tax receipt losses for such a program, neither the \n     Department of Defense nor the Administration support \n     submission of the legislation at this time. Because section \n     1232 requests the draft legislation, however, the attached \n     draft is submitted as a drafting service pursuant to \n     paragraph 7i, Office of Management and Budget Circular A-19, \n     dated September 20, 1979.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Assistance to employers who support National Guard and \n     Reserve participation by their employees could reduce an \n     employer's costs associated with employee absence due to \n     their participation in the National Guard and Reserve on \n     contingency operations. The Department understands the \n     loyalty of the employers burdened with the costly and \n     unanticipated absences of their Reserve employees. We salute \n     such employers and seek their continued support. Tax or other \n     incentives for employers might help to ameliorate some of \n     their problems. Any such plan, of course, must compete for \n     resources in the ever shrinking availability of Federal \n     programs.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, the \ntime not used will be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments on \nthe bill and a couple of comments on the amendment which has been \ndiscussed by Senator Landrieu and Senator Boxer.\n  On the bill itself, let me just say, again, I want to compliment \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus, and, frankly, all the conferees, \nfor their work on this bill. There was a lot of work that went in on \nthis bill. This bill has a lot of good provisions, and in this \nSenator's opinion it has a lot of bad provisions. It has a lot of tax \ncuts, and it has a lot of tax increases. So you have to kind of weigh \nthe pluses and the minuses. The plus is we are going to be WTO \ncompliant and get away from these enormous fees that are on our \nexports, taxes that are on our exports that make our exports less \ncompetitive. It is a 12-percent tax right now, that goes to 17 percent \nby next March. We don't need a trade war with Europe.\n  I remember talking to Chancellor Helmut Kohl when they were pushing \nthe European Union. I said: I am a little concerned about the European \nUnion becoming more protectionist. He assured me that is not the case. \nBut, frankly, the European Union is becoming more protectionist. We \ndon't need a trade war. They don't need a trade war, and we don't need \na trade war. So it is necessary for us to pass a bill to be compliant. \nI don't want to give the World Trade Organization too much of a blank \ncheck, but it is important that export subsidies not be egregious. They \nhave determined in the past FSC/ETI was; the foreign sales corporation \nwas. So we repealed that in this bill.\n  We are replacing it with a tax cut for manufacturers. We defined \n``manufacturers'' very broadly. We didn't give a corporate tax cut for \ncorporations that are in the services, financial services or other \nservices. I object to that. I think that is a mistake. I used to be a \nmanufacturer, so if I went back into manufacturing I guess I should say \nthis is great because you are going to reduce my income tax by 10 \npercent in about 7 years, 6 or 7 years. So maybe I should be happy. But \nI just look at the complexity of it, trying to determine what portion \nof income is manufacturing and what portion is financial or other \nservices, and I can see it is going to be very confusing.\n\n[[Page S11201]]\n\n  For example, in the bill we defined construction as manufacturing. So \nif you had a contractor who was working in construction, their tax rate \nwould be 32 percent in a few years. If they also do service work, that \nwork will be taxed at 35 percent, i.e., a plumbing contractor who is \nbuilding new units is going to be taxed at 32 percent. If he is doing a \nservice, replacing your plumbing, that would be taxed at 35 percent. \nThat doesn't make sense. That is what is in this bill.\n  Take a big corporation--and they have a lot of accountants and \nlawyers--they will work it out. But General Electric, they have big \nmanufacturing. Those units will be taxed at 32 percent, but they are \nprobably bigger in financial services and other services. That will be \ntaxed at 35 percent. So they are going to have to allocate resources \nand expenses to whichever category they belong. I find that to be far \ntoo confusing and will cause a lot of compliance problems. It is \nprobably more trouble than it is worth.\n  Canada had a differential rate for manufacturing for about 20 years, \nand they repealed it. My guess and prediction is that Congress will \ncome back and have to fix this as well because the differential rate is \nnot worth it, and we should have a uniform corporate rate.\n\n  I tried that. Senator Kyl tried that. I compliment my colleague, \nSenator Kyl. We were not successful in convincing our colleagues, House \nor Senate, in doing it. That being said, we tried our best. But it is \nstill important for us to pass this bill, and we and others will be \ntrying in the future, I am sure. I hope in the administration, when \nthey do a comprehensive tax reform proposal, they will come up with a \nuniform corporate rate. I bet they will, and I bet any commission or \ngroup that says we need tax overhaul, simplification, they will come up \nwith a uniform corporate rate. It only makes sense. This proposal does \nnot, this differential rate.\n  But we are not going to be able to fix that now, and we can't fix it \nin the next 3 months, not with the current makeup. So I urge our \ncolleagues to vote for it.\n  I heard a couple of our colleagues say this provision Senator \nLandrieu was talking about was stripped in the conference. That is not \ncorrect. Not one member of the conference--we have 23 Senate conferees, \nand not one person raised this in an individual amendment. I will say \nall conferees had amendments that we wanted. Some were accepted and \nsome were not accepted. But to be accepted, you had to raise the \namendment. You had to fight for the amendment. You had to have it \noffered. I think this particular amendment was offered in a large group \nof 10 or 12 amendments. The House did not concur. That didn't mean it \nwas stripped out in conference. There were hundreds of amendments that \nwere proposed by the Senate, not agreed to by the House, or vice versa. \nThat is the makeup of a conference. So I want to make sure people \nunderstand that.\n  On the substance of the bill, I heard it was supported by 100 percent \nof the Congress. It passed by a voice vote. It was not supported by \nthis Senator. On the substance of it, I am not sure that we should give \nreservists and guardsmen serving in the trenches with Active-Duty--give \nthem $20,000 more or $15,000 more in pay from the Government. That is \nwhat the essence of the proposal was.\n  It says we will give a credit to employers for keeping them whole. \nBut think about it. If you have a guardsman driving a truck doing the \nsame thing an Active-Duty person is doing, should they be paid $20,000 \nmore for doing the exact same job? I am not sure that makes sense. I do \nknow, if you are going to do it--Mr. President, I yield myself an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If we are going to do it, we should not do it through \nthe Tax Code. I believe it should be done through the Armed Services \nCommittee. I have great respect for Chairman Warner and Senator Levin. \nLet them have hearings on it. Let them decide if there should be \ngreater incentives for Guard and Reserve. If they believe it is \nnecessary, that is the way it should be done. The money should be \nappropriated in the Appropriations Committee. Chairman Stevens, head of \nthe DOD subcommittee--they should be making these decisions to keep a \nproper balance between Reserve and Active-Duty.\n  I happen to be a former guardsman. I support the Guard. But I don't \nthink they should be paid through a tax credit that may funnel to them \nor may not funnel to them. I don't think that is good policy. If they \nare to be paid, they should be paid by the Government and they should \nbe paid on a monthly basis by the Government and their benefits should \nbe given by the Government, not through a refundable tax credit that \nthey may or may not receive down the road.\n\n  We sometimes pass amendments by voice vote to expedite passage. We \npassed the sense-of-the-Senate amendment by voice vote, and I \ncompliment the authors. But I would have voted no. Just because \nsomething passes by voice doesn't mean every Senator concurs. I did not \nand still do not agree with this amendment.\n  I do agree with one portion of it, and I compliment my colleague from \nLouisiana. We worked to make something acceptable. Legislation is the \nart of compromise. We compromised on one thing. One section is let's \nhave GAO do a study about what kind of compensation we need for Guard \nand Reserve: How does it balance with the Regular Army? A tax credit, \nwould this be the proper mix? So I think we need some additional study \non it, and we will do that. I think we improved her amendment \nsubstantially, we changed it substantially, and I compliment her as \nwell.\n  Again, on final passage, I think the underlying product leaves a lot \nto be desired, but I still think it is an improvement. We need to fix \nthe WTO problem, and I urge our colleagues to vote in favor of the \nconference report. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Under the previous order, I think I still have----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has just under 11 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to take the time to thank the \nSenator from Oklahoma. I know he has some concerns about some of the \ndetails of this amendment. But because of his work and because of other \nSenators who worked through the weekend on this, we have put a very \nsolid, substantial, largely intact amendment in place that is going to \nbe passed to the House. Now it will be in the hands of the House \nleadership to decide if they want to pass this amendment, which is a \ntax bill specifically for the Guard and Reserve. The underlying bill \nactually will allow the Guard and Reserve a tax benefit to remove the \n10-percent penalty if they would want to take money out of their IRA to \nhelp them through tough financial times.\n  According to the hundreds and thousands of e-mails that we have \nreceived, myself and many others, we know that our Guard and Reserve \nare having a tough time.\n  I would just like to read this for the Record. I know the Senator \nhimself has received notices like this.\n  This is from--Janice is her name. I will find out where she is from \nin a moment. She writes,\n\n       Senator Landrieu, I have 3 nephews and 2 nieces that are in \n     our National Guard and they are being sent over to Iraq. I am \n     so angry right now that I hope that I don't have to see \n     others go to this war. But let me just say that my nephews \n     and nieces have left behind 11 children without health \n     coverage. I am their aunt and my husband is their uncle. \n     We are taking care of these three children. It is hard for \n     us. We are tired living on a fixed income.\n\n  This is what this amendment is all about--taking on the burden of \nhaving the Guard and Reserve on the front line, and paying those \npaychecks. Yes, it helps the soldier on the front line, but mostly it \nhelps the families back home. That is what the Senator was able to help \nus come to terms with. That is what the Senate is sending over to the \nHouse--supporting this effort on the House side.\n  I look forward to working with them when we come back in, perhaps \nafter the election--working with the Senators who have spoken up over \nthe weekend and others who were not able to speak up and sent letters \nin support and cosponsored this effort, Republicans and Democrats, to \nsay let us craft a tax provision, or several tax provisions, that will \nhelp our Guard\n\n[[Page S11202]]\n\nand Reserve, or let us dig a little deeper in the Defense bill to give \nthem the support they need, whether it is health care, whether it is \npaycheck protection, whether it is other support services, so they can \ndo the job better we are asking them to do.\n  Frankly, I don't think they could do it any better, but they could do \nit with more peace of mind knowing their families are able to pay the \nbills, are able to keep the roofs over their heads, are able to put \ngasoline in their automobiles, and pay the extra childcare expenses.\n  I know other Senators feel as strongly as I do--everyone in this \nChamber. But let us not only feel strongly but remember them when we \npass these bills. Again, we don't have to remember them only on the \nDefense bill. Then we end up having to make tough choices and ask the \nmilitary, Do you want a rifle, or a helmet, or health coverage, or to \nsend a whole paycheck to your family? I don't think our men and women \nin uniform should be asked to make those decisions, not when we are \ngiving $137 billion in tax cuts to everybody else. That is my point.\n  I know people may disagree. Maybe this vehicle was the right one. But \nbecause we were told 3 years ago there was no money in the Defense bill \nto do this, what option were we left with? We asked it be included. It \nwas included when it left the Senate.\n  I am proud of that. Now we have a chance again sometime in the near \nfuture to get this fixed. I am proud of the effort.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nIowa, the distinguished chairman of the committee. I also thank the \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee for working with \nthe House to produce an excellent bill which will reduce taxes on more \npeople in our country and, therefore, help this economy to continue the \nrecovery.\n  I am very pleased. I have heard the debate on the tax credit for \nemployers for Guard and Reserve units. I know all of us will be working \nto try to assure that this is done. Our Guard and Reserve units have \nstepped up to the plate.\n  I have been to Iraq. I have been to Afghanistan. I have visited with \nGuard troops who are on their second and third call who didn't expect \nthis kind of activity when they signed up. But they are there doing \ntheir job, and doing a great job.\n  On the other hand, the people at home are, too. The employers are, \ntoo. The families are, too. They are sacrificing as well. I think help \nfor families, help for the men and women on the ground in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and other places, and help for the employers is certainly \nsomething we should do in the right way.\n  I am very pleased we are going to continue to work on this issue. We \nneed to do everything we can to support our young men and women in the \nfield and the people who are supporting them at home.\n  I will never forget when I was visiting a base in Saudi Arabia and \nasked one of the young guardsmen what was their biggest problem, \nthinking he was going to say something about his tour of duty, or \nsomething on the ground there. He said, My biggest problem is my wife \ncan't get a pediatrician for our child at home who is having heart \nproblems. I said we can't let this happen. We have to make sure we are \ngiving them all the support they need.\n  This is a good bill. It is a bill that is going to help our \nmanufacturers in this country compete on a level playing field.\n  A ruling by the World Trade Organization found our existing extra-\nterritorial income tax regime was prohibited under an international \ntreaty. Therefore, the European Union imposed retaliatory sanctions on \na variety of United States products in March of this year. These \ntariffs have increased every month we have not acted. They are now at \n12 percent. A tariff like that can be the difference between whether an \nAmerican product can be purchased overseas, whether it gets in and can \ncompete on a level playing field.\n  We will restructure our Tax Code for businesses in order to replace \nthe ETI and end the confiscatory tariffs that are hurting manufacturers \nin this country.\n  At a time when our country is losing manufacturing jobs, we talk \nabout outsourcing every day. We have to act to give our manufacturers \nevery possible advantage we can to be competitive with Europe. That is \nwhat the heart of this bill is. It is very important for jobs in our \ncountry. It is very important for the manufacturers who are trying to \nkeep jobs in our country to be able to have that level playing field. I \nam very pleased about that.\n  In addition, there is a broad range of manufacturers who are helped, \nincluding certain oil and gas producers. We know with the prices of oil \nand gas so high right now that we need to encourage our producers to be \nout there cutting costs wherever possible, and hopefully this will \nallow them to be able to produce more in our country and create those \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Lastly, there is a sales tax deduction that is very important to my \nState and six other States in our country. Some States in America do \nnot have a State income tax. That doesn't mean our State taxpayers \naren't paying taxes. We pay very high, substantial sales taxes and we \npay high property taxes. Some of those are going up. For us not to have \na deduction for our State sales taxes on our Federal income taxes like \nthose who pay an income tax do is unfair.\n  That inequity is eliminated in this bill for the next 2 years. We \nwill be able now to have equity in our Tax Code. We will now be able to \ngive those in a non-income tax State the ability to deduct sales taxes \njust as those who pay income taxes are able to do. In fact, it allows \npeople in an income-tax State to choose to deduct sales taxes instead \nof income taxes if they want to. It is for everyone.\n  But in reality, the States that have been shortchanged are the ones \nthat choose to tax with sales tax and rather than income tax. That \ninequity is going to go away in this bill. It will mean $300 on average \nfor every family in Texas. That is going to be welcome news for people \nwho have had to live with this inequity since 1986.\n  Thank you. I urge adoption of this very important bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee for yielding me this time.\n  When we look back on the results of this year, the legislation that \nhad the greatest impact, this will be the bill we will refer to and \nremember. This is the most important achievement of this session of \nCongress.\n  I give credit to the chairman of the Finance Committee, and the \nranking Member, Senator Baucus of Montana. They were diligent and hung \nin there. They were determined we would get this result. Yes, we had to \ngo a little overtime, but here we are. We will get it done today. They \ndeserve an awful lot of credit.\n  Also we should give credit to Congressman Thomas, the chairman of the \nWays and Means Committee in the House. This is very complicated \nlegislation, but he worked with these two Senators and they produced a \nvery important product.\n  I could not fathom the idea that we might leave here and not complete \nlegislation that will stop the fees that were being put on American \nproducts as a result of the WTO ruling on our domestic tax provisions. \nThat import fee was going up 1 percent a month. It was up to 12 percent \nand going to 13 percent. How in the world could we not complete \nlegislation that would deal with this alleged subsidy and take that \nmoney that was saved by eliminating some provisions and move it into \nother areas in manufacturing and small business in a way to create \njobs? It was important we complete this legislation. We got it done. We \nwill comply with the WTO ruling, but we will take that money that was \ngoing into the questionable provisions and move it into areas that will \ncreate jobs for the American people. We will keep more jobs here. This \nis a very significant achievement.\n  At long last we repeal the 4.3-cent-per-gallon diesel fuel tax that \nrailroads and barges have had to pay. This is not\n\n[[Page S11203]]\n\nabout one railroad or just a barge company; all the other parts of the \neconomy that have been paying that 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax had been \nreleased from having to pay it or send it to an infrastructure trust \nfund. This was a question of fairness. Once again, it is in an area \nwhere we can create more jobs. The railroad industry is saying in the \nnext few months they will create thousands of new jobs. This is a \ncritical provision.\n  I thank Senator Grassley particularly for working with me to make \nsure this provision to repeal that tax over a period of 3 years would \nbe included in this bill. The bill also improves the tax treatment for \nshipbuilding. Unfortunately, shipbuilding companies have to pay the tax \non the entire amount of a ship even though they do not get the money \nsometimes for 3 or 4 years down the road. Incremental funding is how \nyou should pay your taxes.\n  There are important timber provisions in the legislation. We should \nencourage the planting of more trees as well as responsible harvesting \nof trees. There are three different provisions that will help the \ntimber industry in this country.\n  It also includes income averaging for farmers and fishermen. Others \nhave that opportunity; why shouldn't farmers and fishermen? This will \nbe very helpful.\n  The tobacco buyout provision is included. This is a provision I \nopposed, and I do oppose it now, but the conferees, working with the \nSenators from the States that were affected, came up with the best \npossible of the solutions they could have reached; therefore, I was \nwilling to support what they came up with because I thought it was as \nfair as you could get for all involved.\n  We have tax incentives for United States-flag shipping companies, \nshort-line railroads, energy provisions that will produce more energy, \ncritical improvements for small businesses, small subchapter S reform \nand expensing.\n  This is a big achievement. I commend those involved and tell the \nAmerican people this will help the economy of our country.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I voted for the Senate version of this FSC/\nETI legislation. While I had a number of misgivings about that bill, \nthose were outweighed by my concerns over the crisis in our Nation's \nmanufacturing sector and the sanctions being imposed as a result of the \nFSC/ETI regime. However, I will oppose this conference report. It fails \nto include too many of the important provisions from the Senate bill \nand has a number of added bad provisions.\n  The Senate bill we passed in May did a lot to crack down on tax \ndodgers, but the House Republican leadership, with pressure from the \nadministration, has refused to include most of these provisions in this \nlegislation. While men and women in our military are putting their \nlives on the line every day for America, too many corporations are \nstiffing our country by dodging their taxes. They are depriving our \ncountry of funds needed to strengthen homeland security, support our \ntroops, care for the sick, educate kids, and more. To make things fair \nfor our U.S. manufacturers that play by the rules, we need to close \nloopholes that allow the tax dodging corporations to avoid paying their \nfair share.\n  One of the most glaring of these omissions from this legislation is \nthe provision passed by the Senate numerous times that would have \nrequired business transactions to have actual ``Economic Substance'' in \norder to receive tax benefits. Refusing to include this anti-abuse tool \nmeans that tax dodgers will still be able to escape paying their fair \nshare by using phony transactions that have no business purpose other \nthan tax avoidance. It also means we miss the opportunity to collect \nfrom these tax dodgers a much needed $15 billion over 10 years.\n  Another distressing decision by the House Republicans is the slashing \nof the penalty imposed on those who design and peddle abusive tax \nshelters. These abusive shelters are undermining the integrity of our \ntax system, robbing the Treasury of tens of billions of dollars a year, \nand shifting the tax burden from high-income corporations and \nindividuals onto the backs of the middle class. The amendment Senator \nColeman and I offered, which became part of the Senate bill, set the \npenalty on an abusive tax shelter promoter at 100 percent of the fees \nearned from the abusive shelter. This penalty would have ensured that \nthe abusive tax shelter hucksters would not get to keep a single penny \nof their ill-gotten gains. But that provision was cut in half in this \nconference report, setting the penalty at 50 percent of the fees \nearned, meaning the promoters of abusive shelters get to keep half of \ntheir gain.\n  Why should anyone who pushes an illegal tax shelter that robs our \nTreasury of much needed revenues get to keep half of his ill-gotten \ngains? And what deterrent effect is created by a penalty that allows \npromoters to keep half of their fees if caught, and all of them if they \nare not? This half-hearted penalty is not tough enough to do the job \nthat needs to be done.\n  And this conference report completely leaves out yet another Senate \nprovision that is critical in the fight against abusive tax shelters. \nIn addition to those who are considered ``promoters'' of these abusive \nshelters, there are the professional firms--the law firms, banks, and \ninvestment advisors--that aid and abet the use of abusive tax shelters \nand enable taxpayers to carry out these abusive tax schemes. For \nexample, a law firm is often asked to write an ``opinion letter'' to \nhelp taxpayers head off IRS questioning and fines that they might \notherwise confront for using an abusive shelter. Under current law, \nthese aiders and abetters face a penalty of only $1,000, or $10,000 if \nthe offender is a corporation. This penalty is a joke. It provides no \ndeterrent at all, when law firms are getting $50,000 for each of these \ncookie-cutter opinion letters. A $1,000 fine is like a parking ticket \nfor raking in millions illegally. With the Levin-Coleman amendment, our \nSenate bill upped this fine to 100 percent of the gross income derived \nfrom the prohibited activity. Unfortunately, it appears the House \nconferees thought it was ok to let these aiders and abetters continue \nto profit handsomely from their wrongdoing instead attempting to deter \nthis behavior that robs tens of billions of dollars from the U.S. \nTreasury.\n  Another gaping tax loophole that this conference report weakened is \nthe unfairness to the taxpayers that arises when companies renounce \ntheir citizenship, going through phony reincorporations by establishing \na shell headquarters on paper in Bermuda or other tax-haven countries \nwhen, in reality, their primary offices and production or service \nfacilities remain right here in the U.S. These corporate expatriates \nget all the benefits of being U.S. companies without contributing their \nfair share of the bill.\n  The Senate FSC/ETI bill had a provision that would have shut down a \nsignificant portion of this loophole. I have long preferred an even \nstronger fix, such as the one Senator Reid of Nevada and I put forward \nin S. 384, the Corporate Patriot Enforcement Act of 2003. But at least \nthe provision passed by the Senate went much further than the one \nbefore us. The provision included in the conference report lets all the \ncompanies that used this gimmick prior to March of 2003 continue to \navoid the taxes that their American-based competitors face. The Senate \nversion would have cracked down on these tax dodgers to the tune of \nmore than $3.1 billion over 10 years while this weak provision raises \nonly $830 million. It is shocking that the House Republican conferees \nwere willing to leave $2.3 billion in dodged taxes on the table when \nthat money could have gone to implement Senator Landrieu's amendment \nthat would offer real help to our activated guardsmen and reservists.\n  I understand that during the conference negotiations, the Senate \nconferees offered an amendment that would have reinstated many of these \nimportant curbs on tax dodges. The amendment would have raised an \nadditional $40 billion over 10 years. But, once again the House GOP \nrefused to accept these anti-abuse measures, and the amendment was \ndefeated on a party line vote.\n  The problems with this legislation are not limited to the fact that \nwe are letting tax dodgers off way too easy. At a time when many \ncorporations pay no tax at all and corporate tax revenues are at \nhistoric lows, this bill is full of special interest tax breaks. It \nalso includes new tax benefits for the offshore operations of U.S. \nmultinational companies, such as allowing companies\n\n[[Page S11204]]\n\nwith earnings held overseas to bring them back at a tax rate lower than \nthe rate paid on domestic profits. The cost of these international \nprovisions is estimated at $43 billion over 10 years, but this estimate \nis misleadingly low because some of these provisions are ``temporary'' \nor do not kick in until later years. While I support incentives to \ncreate and support U.S.-based manufacturing jobs, I am concerned that \nsome of these international provisions will provide an incentive for \ncompanies to keep resources, facilities, and employees abroad, and \nsubsidize the movement of jobs and resources overseas.\n  Furthermore, while the official cost estimate of this bill says that \nit is essentially budget neutral over the next 10 years, this paints a \ndeceptively optimistic picture. Throughout the measure there are many \ngimmicks to keep the numbers even, like phasing in some of the tax cuts \nand setting up others as ``temporary.'' According to the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities, just extending the ``temporary'' \nprovisions would reduce revenues by nearly $80 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  I am also troubled by the elimination of provisions pertaining to \nregulation of tobacco by the Food and Drug Administration, FDA. \nAccording to a recent report by the Surgeon General, tobacco \nconsumption by America's youth is one of our country's leading health \nrisks. The Senate passed strong bipartisan provisions that would deal \nwith both the FDA and tobacco regulation: provisions that would give \nthe FDA sweeping authority to prevent overt marketing of tobacco \nproducts to children under the age of 18; provisions that would allow \nthe FDA to regulate prior approval of statements on tobacco products; \nand provisions that allow the FDA to restrict the sale, distribution \nand promotion of tobacco if they are deemed to be a danger to public \nhealth. These provisions are essential to protecting our children from \nthe dangers of smoking, but the House conferees have killed any chance \nin the near future to give the FDA the tools it needs in this critical \narea.\n  I am also troubled by the exclusion of Senator Harkin's overtime \namendment that would keep essential overtime protections for middle \nclass working Americans. And finally, it seems unfathomable that in \nthis $137 billion bill the conference committee would leave out the \nSenate provision sponsored by Senator Landrieu that would have helped \nthe large number of our activated Guardsmen and Reservists who face a \nreduction in their salaries during activation by assisting those \ncivilian employers who continue to pay these employees after they have \nbeen called up.\n  While this legislation includes some provisions which I support, \noverall it falls far short of the bill which the Senate sent to \nconference, and I cannot support it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will support this conference report, \nbut I do so with a great deal of reluctance.\n  One of the more frequently used phrases voiced on the Senate floor is \nthat we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. That \nhackneyed expression is flung about when the body is asked to support a \nmeasure that may not be everything that it should be. It would be an \noverstatement to suggest that this measure even rises to that level. \nThis bill falls far short of being good, but it is necessary. At its \nmost fundamental, it meets two essential tests. First, it repeals the \nForeign Sales Corporation/Extra Territorial Income, USC/ELI, tax \nprovisions that have resulted in the imposition of increasingly \npunitive tariffs on American-made products, including products made in \nWisconsin.\n  Second, it provides a needed tax break for domestic manufacturers, a \ngroup that has been especially hard hit in recent years. If this \nabsolutely vital sector is to have a chance to get back on its feet, \nproviding this tax incentive is essential.\n  I regret that much of the rest of this bill is wholly unmerited. \nThere are some exceptions, of course, but if Congress had focused its \nefforts on just those two essential tasks--repealing USC/ETI, and \nproviding some tax incentives for domestic manufacturers--the bill \nwould have been much better.\n  I was pleased to cosponsor S. 970, introduced by Senator Hollings, \nwhich was just such a bill. And I was encouraged when the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Grassley, and the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, offered a \nproposal based on S. 970, along with some sensible improvements.\n  But as this measure has worked its way through the legislative \nprocess, it has only degenerated. Dozens of special interests have \nnosed their way into this bill, and have taken advantage of what is \nessentially a ``must-pass'' measure. I can only say that I am glad we \nare passing this measure now, before it gets any worse.\n  There are many candidates for worst tax policy in this measure, but \nat the very top of that list must be those provisions that actually \nprovide a tax incentive for those corporations that move their \noperations overseas. Such a policy is never justified, but in the \ncurrent economic climate it is particularly hurtful and \ncounterproductive. During the debate on this measure in the Senate, I \nwas pleased to support the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, in \nhis effort to eliminate one of these perverse incentives and I was \npleased to support an amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana, \nMr. Breaux, and the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, which was \nsimilarly targeted. I regret the body rejected those sensible \nproposals.\n\n  I will vote for this bill with the hope that its net effect will be \nto improve the climate for domestic manufacturers. But we should remove \nall doubt by acting at the next opportunity to close down the tax \nprovisions in this bill that provide incentives for corporations to \nmove facilities overseas.\n  On this same subject I was disappointed that conferees stripped \nSenate provisions relating to the disturbing trend of the outsourcing \nof American jobs. These provisions would have prohibited federal \nfunding from being used to support the outsourcing of goods and \nservices contracts that are entered into by the Federal government, or \nby the States if those contracts are being supported by Federal \ndollars.\n  With this bill, Congress had an opportunity to support American \nworkers by ensuring that taxpayer money is not used to encourage \ncompanies to relocate American jobs. With the deletion of this \noutsourcing provision, we missed an opportunity for the Federal \nGovernment to set a strong example of buying its goods and services \nfrom American companies that use American workers.\n  I also regret that the administration was again successful in \nblocking language included in the Senate-passed bill that would have \nreversed the harmful provisions of the Department of Labor's new \novertime rule. Despite repeated bipartisan opposition to this rule in \nboth Houses of Congress, members of the conference committee stripped \nthis provision, which would have prevented millions of workers from \nlosing their overtime benefits under the Bush administration's rule.\n  Finally, let me briefly mention the energy tax provisions. I remain \ncommitted to supporting legislation to encourage alternative energy \nresearch and production. With respect to overall energy policy, we must \ndevelop cleaner, more efficient energy sources and promote \nconservation.\n  During Senate debate on this bill, I voted for the amendment offered \nby the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, to strike the energy \ntax title to the Senate version because the bill did not extend the \nenergy tax credits in a more fiscally responsible way. I support many \nof the tax credits in the conference report, such as the volumetric \nethanol excise tax credit fix and provisions that would specifically \nbenefit rural cooperatives and small renewable fuel producers. I also \nsupport provisions that would result in the increased supply of \nrenewable fuels like biodiesel and ethanol.\n  I remain concerned, however, about the fiscal and environmental costs \nof this section of the bill. The oil and gas incentives in the bill, \nfor example, would cost taxpayers billions and allow companies to \ndeduct the costs of mineral exploration and marginal oil wells. The \nconference report still includes a ``nonconventional fuel credit'' to \nthe synfuels industry and coalbed methane industry, which could cost \nthe taxpayers over $2.5 billion. The bill also opens a loophole for \nenergy companies to take advantage of a manufacturing\n\n[[Page S11205]]\n\ntax credit. The revenues dedicated to these tax expenditures would have \nbeen better used to relieve the burden of debt we are heaping onto our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  It is the very need for the central provisions of this bill that has \ninvited the kind of abusive provisions we have seen included in it. \nWere this bill something less than absolutely necessary, we could just \ndefeat it, and hope for something better down the road.\n  But we do need to pass it. We have to stop these trade sanctions, and \nwe need to help our manufacturers. For that reason, I will vote for \nthis flawed legislation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will vote against this FSC/ETI \nconference report and I want to explain why.\n  The original purpose of this legislation was simple and clear--to \nbring the United States into compliance with a World Trade \nOrganization, WTO, ruling which said that portions of our Federal Tax \nCode run counter to international trade regulations.\n  It is critical that we fix this problem, or U.S. companies will face \nincreased European tariffs, costing U.S. jobs.\n  This conference report, however, goes far beyond the simple \nlegislative fix needed to bring the U.S. into compliance with the WTO \nruling.\n  In fact, the cost of bringing the U.S. into compliance with the WTO \nis $49 billion, while the cost of the final bill is $145 billion. The \ndifference is $96 billion in benefits to special interests paid for \nwith certain revenue fixes that should be used to balance the budget.\n  In fact, this bill provides billions of dollars in benefits to \nspecial interests at a time of unprecedented budget deficits. Let me \ngive you a few examples cited in Thursday's Washington Post, \n``Conferees Agree on Corporate Tax Bill'':\n\n       NASCAR racetrack owners get a provision to write off $101 \n     million worth of improvements over ten years.\n       Foreign gamblers at U.S. horse and dog racing tracks would \n     no longer have to pay taxes on their winnings upfront. This \n     is estimated to be worth $27 million.\n       Home Depot would secure a temporary suspension of tariffs \n     it owes for imported Chinese ceiling fans. This is estimated \n     to be worth $44 million.\n\n  At a time when we are facing unprecedented Federal deficits and a \nmounting debt, it is simply unconscionable to approve this giveaway to \nspecial interests. Although the 10-year cost is offset, these offsets \ncould well be used to bring down the deficit.\n  Policymakers should be taking steps to reduce the deficit and improve \nthe economy, not eroding it further by doling out tax breaks to special \ninterests. But one industry was singled out for penalty in this bill. I \ncannot accept that--and that industry happens to be the film industry.\n  In fact, this final conference report will cost the motion picture \nindustry $5 billion over the next 10 years--because they will have to \nmake changes in the way they account for revenues.\n  The film industry employs 750,000 people nationwide, and the major \nmotion picture studios are publicly owned and pay annual dividends to \nshareholders.\n  Rather than allowing the industry to account for its activities on a \nproduct line-by-product line basis as was done in the Senate bill, this \nconference report means that the industry will have to adopt unified \naccounting.\n  For example, the Disney film called The Alamo was produced in the \nUnited States and did not perform as well as expected.\n  Under the final conference report, the losses from The Alamo are \nlumped with all other company revenues--TV, DVD sales, theme parks, \nmerchandise, and music. This is known as unified accounting.\n  In the Senate version of the bill, Disney would have been able to \naccount for this loss within its film division, separate from its other \ndivisions. This is known as product line-by-product line accounting.\n  If you assume a $50 million loss, requiring unified accounting will \ncost the studio an additional $2.6 million in additional taxes.\n  If you assume a $75 million loss, requiring unified accounting will \ncost the studio an additional $3.9 million in additional taxes.\n  So the bottom line is that unified accounting will mean that Disney, \nand other entertainment companies, will have to pay significantly more \nin taxes as much as $5 billion over the next 10 years.\n  I cannot believe that we would in effect raise taxes on an industry \nthat does so much to help our economy.\n  This simple accounting change would have significantly helped reduce \nthe impact from this legislation.\n  But in the end, this provision was stripped from the final conference \nreport.\n  What is worse are reports that this was not due to the merits of the \nprovision, but out of base, political concerns.\n  A story in yesterday's edition of Roll Call, ``Studios Take Hit in \nTax Bill'', asserts that lawmakers stripped the Senate film amendment \nin retribution for the film industry's decision to hire a Democrat--a \nformer Cabinet Secretary in fact--to head its trade association.\n  Let me quote from the article:\n  One GOP Lobbyist for the industry said:\n\n       The Glickman thing is going to cost them. No Republican \n     will fight for the movie industry.\n\n  Another Republican Lobbyist added:\n\n       They were not overly helpful to Republicans, so Republicans \n     don't want to be overly helpful to them.\n\n  Ordinarily, I do not believe much of what I read on many days and so \nthere would be reason perhaps to dismiss this.\n  But I also know that the word has been put out on K Street that only \nRepublicans are welcome as lobbyists so this article takes on new \ncredibility.\n  This is especially egregious given the fact that the film industry \nwas not even involved in the unfair trade practices that led the WTO to \ndeclare that U.S. international tax rules were unfair.\n  I have the opinions of two former U.S. Trade Representatives--one \nRepublican and one Democrat--Carla Hills and Mickey Kantor--which make \nthe case.\n  Carla Hills wrote:\n\n       Having previously served as [U.S. Trade Representative], I \n     would like to share with you my views regarding the \n     consistency of your amendment with applicable trade law The \n     [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] does not apply to \n     `audiovisual services' and does not include any general \n     prohibition against export contingent subsides.\n\n  Mickey Kantor wrote:\n\n       Audiovisual services are . . . not within the purview of \n     the WTO FSC/TTI decisions In my view the adoption of [your \n     amendment] . . . would not violate or contravene the WTO \n     rulings in the FSC/ETI case.\n\n  As one can see, two former U.S. Trade Representatives agree that the \nentertainment industry was not involved in the unfair trade practices.\n  However, the entertainment industry is being singled out for a tax \nincrease in this bill in order to pay for tax cuts going to \nmultinational firms that hold their profits overseas in order to avoid \npaying taxes.\n  The bill allows many of these companies having profits overseas to \nrepatriate these billion at a 5.25 percent tax rate.\n\n  These are the multinational firms which now will be allowed to bring \nthose foreign-earned profits back to the United States at one half the \nrate that the poorest American's are required to pay on their income \nunder this bill. This is not fair and equal treatment.\n  I cannot believe that the other House would utilize political \nvengeance to disadvantage a sector of American business, while so \nadvantaging other sectors.\n  Another major flaw with this bill is that it removes the Senate \nlanguage permitting long-sought FDA regulation of tobacco. The Senate \nvoted overwhelmingly--78 to 15--in favor of a carefully crafted \namendment to allow FDA regulation of tobacco.\n  This amendment linked FDA regulation with a 5-year, $12 billion \nbuyout of tobacco growers. Regulatory authority over tobacco would have \nallowed the FDA to begin to reduce the addictive and carcinogenic \nelements of these products. It would have made a difference and, over \nthe long run, it, alone, could have saved millions of lives.\n  Despite the broad, bipartisan support for this provision, the House \nrejected a proposal by Senator Kennedy to provide an additional $2 \nbillion for tobacco growers as long as it was linked with FDA \nregulation of tobacco. Even Philip Morris supports FDA regulation of \ntobacco. Let me quote from two letters\n\n[[Page S11206]]\n\nfrom senior executives from Altria, the parent company of Philip \nMorris.\n  Steven Parrish, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs, Altria \nGroup wrote that the provision on FDA regulation of tobacco ``is the \nresult of many difficult choices and compromises by all those involved, \nand it reflects a balance of the perspectives of many stakeholders. We \nbelieve the bill embraces the core principles that are necessary to \nprovide the Food and Drug Administration with comprehensive, meaningful \nand effective regulatory authority over tobacco products.\n  Together with our domestic tobacco operating company, Philip Morris \nUSA, we enthusiastically support passage of your bill in its \nentirety.''\n  John Scruggs, vice president, Government Affairs, Altria Group wrote \nseparately that the provision on FDA regulation of tobacco \n``address[es] nearly all'' of the ``issues relating to retailers'' and \nwe should ``disregard the strident and unfounded arguments of those who \nrefuse to look to the future and the need for change in the tobacco \nindustry.''\n  Congress had the opportunity to finally allow the FDA to regulate \ntobacco--but it failed to do so. This is deeply disappointing and shows \nthe true colors of the House Republicans.\n  You may ask, what would FDA regulation of tobacco do to help stop \nsmoking and prevent these premature deaths? FDA regulation of tobacco \nwould do two important things.\n  First, it would control the deceptive and manipulative advertising \nused by cigarette companies. Young people across the country are \nbombarded every day with deceptive advertising and misleading claims \nmade by cigarette manufacturers.\n  The tobacco industry spends $11 billion on marketing their products. \nTheir latest campaign involves cigarettes that come in fruit flavors \nand bright colors to target adolescents and women. The cigarettes are \ngiven names such as California Dreams, Midnight Madness and Kauai \nKolada. The cartons are a different shape and size so as to be hidden \nfrom unsuspecting parents and teachers.\n\n  And the manufacturer describes them by saying: `Each is as enchanting \nand mysterious as the darkest night. And, live in color with California \nDreams `cigarettes in color' for your individual taste and attitude.' \nThis is truly a new low. These slogans, these flavors, and these \ncolored wrappers cannot hide the fact that cigarettes kill more than \n400,000 American each year--and that's the second reason that FDA \nregulation is so important.\n  FDA regulation, over time, would ratchet down the carcinogenic and \naddicting ingredients of tobacco products. Just think how many fewer \nAmericans--young people, old people would avoid the addiction.\n  Today, 42 million Americans today are addicted to cigarettes and \nother tobacco products. A number of these will end up with lung disease \nand many of them will die.\n  Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer--and the number one cause \nof lung cancer is smoking. Today and every day, 4,000 children under \nthe age of 18 will try smoking for the first time, 2,000 of these \nchildren will become regular smokers, and 1,300 will die prematurely \nbecause of smoking.\n  The bottom line is this: Congress had the opportunity to take a major \nstep forward in improving the health of America's children. But the \nRepublican members of the House chose the tobacco industry over our \nchildren--and they should be held accountable for that choice.\n  There is one more item that did not make it into this bill, which I \nfind deeply troubling. The Senate language to protect overtime rights \nwas removed from the bill. This means that millions of American workers \nmay very well lose long-guaranteed job overtime protection. This is a \nsetback for the American worker.\n  There are a number of items contained within this conference report \nthat I do support. This bill will provide an expansion of the \nproduction tax credit for renewable energy including open-loop biomass, \ngeothermal energy, and solar energy; a provision to eliminate the \npreferential treatment for ethanol-blended gasoline. Without this \nprovision, California would lose $2.7 billion in highway funds over the \nnext 5 years; and a provision that removes a business tax deduction for \nthe purchase of gas-guzzling SUVs.\n  These provisions do not make up for the rest of the bill. I think we \nall would have supported a straight fix to the WTO ruling, but this \nbill goes too far. It fixes the WTO problem, but then it contains all \nthese other giveaways.\n  So what was a $49 billion problem to solve becomes a $145 billion \nbill. This is just plain wrong. I hope in the future that we can remedy \nsome of the shortcomings of this bill, but on balance, this is a deeply \nflawed billed which I simply cannot support.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \n``Roll Call'' article, to which I referred, and three letters dealing \nwith different provisions of the FSC/EIT bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Roll Call, Oct. 7, 2004]\n\n                      Studios Take Hit in Tax Bill\n\n                           (By Brody Mullins)\n\n       Three months after Hollywood slapped the Republican Party \n     by hiring Democrat Dan Glickman to head its Washington trade \n     association, Congressional Republicans sliced more than $1 \n     billion in tax credits for movie studios from a far-reaching \n     international tax bill that the House and Senate plan to take \n     up today.\n       Though the tax credits for Hollywood were included in a \n     version of the bill approved by the Senate this summer, a \n     Republican-dominated conference committee voted Tuesday \n     evening to leave the provisions on the cutting-room floor.\n       Led by Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas (Calif.) and \n     Majority Leader Tom DeLay (Texas), House GOPers on the \n     conference committee voted as a bloc to oppose the tax \n     breaks, calling them bad policy and too expensive to be \n     included in the $140 billion bill.\n       But other lawmakers, Congressional aides and movie industry \n     lobbyists said Republicans refused to fight for the Senate \n     tax credits in order to punish Hollywood for hiring Glickman, \n     a former House Member from Kansas and secretary of \n     Agriculture under then-President Bill Clinton, to head the \n     Motion Picture Association of America.\n       ``The Glickman thing is going to cost them. No Republican \n     will fight for the movie industry,'' said one GOP lobbyist \n     for the industry.\n       Another Republican lobbyist added: ``They were not overly \n     helpful to Republicans, so Republicans don't want to be \n     overly helpful to them.''\n       Thomas, the chairman of the conference deliberations, \n     declined to comment on the motivation for removing the tax \n     credits for the movie industry.\n       ``I don't deal with rumors and unconfirmed reports,'' he \n     said.\n       DeLay said he voted against the provision because ``it just \n     cost too much.''\n       When asked whether the MPAA's move influenced his vote, \n     DeLay said that employment decisions in the private sector \n     ``don't enter into our consideration. That's the first time I \n     ever thought of Glickman.''\n       A spokeswoman for the MPAA declined to comment on the vote.\n       Despite DeLay's comments, Glickman was on the minds of \n     other Republican lawmakers in the past few weeks as votes on \n     the tax bill neared, according to Republicans on the Ways and \n     Means Committee.\n       Before the vote, Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.), a key Hollywood \n     advocate, said he worried that GOP resentment about \n     Glickman's hire could scuttle the tax credits for the \n     studios.\n       ``Thomas has said some things. I've heard a lot of \n     grumblings. They have said that they thought that a \n     Republican should have gotten'' the job, Foley said. ``Mr. \n     Thomas has to acquiesce to the Senate language and right now \n     that doesn't look good with the lingering resentment. That's \n     probably a tough sell right now.''\n       Foley added that the movie studios ``may get dealt a bad \n     hand, but I'm not sure it's based entirely on Mr. Glickman.''\n       Rep. Jim McCrery (La.), a top Republican on the Ways and \n     Means Committee and a member of the conference deliberations \n     on the tax bill, said he did not think Glickman's hire was \n     ``a deciding factor'' in the decision by Republicans to \n     exclude the movie studio tax credits.\n       Still, he acknowledged that Republicans on Capitol Hill \n     were upset the MPAA tapped a Democrat for the position.\n       ``It's a fact that the Republicans control the Congress and \n     the Ways and Means Committee so it's a good idea to have \n     someone who can communicate with those who are in power,'' \n     McCrery said. ``It's a consideration that any organization \n     hiring a lobbyist should take into account.''\n       At issue is an international tax bill being put together on \n     Capitol Hill to replace $50 billion in U.S. export subsidies \n     that have been struck down by the World Trade Organization.\n       Current law provides movie studios such as MGM, Universal \n     Studios and 20th Century Fox with about $600 million a year \n     in tax credits to export movies to other countries.\n       The tax incentive helped transform the U.S. movie industry \n     into one of the nation's leading exporters, surpassing \n     exports of Boeing's jets and Detroit's autos, according to \n     figures provided to Congress by the movie industry.\n\n[[Page S11207]]\n\n       When the export subsidy was found to be illegal by the WTO, \n     Hollywood figured to be one of the biggest losers. At issue \n     was just how much they would lose.\n       The Senate version of the corporate tax bill would retain \n     $350 million annually in export subsidies for the studios. \n     The House bill, authored by Thomas, provided less than $100 \n     million per year for the industry.\n       In a partisan vote Tuesday evening, Republicans on the \n     conference committee rejected an effort by Sen. Max Baucus \n     (D-Mont.) to include the Senate's credits for the industry.\n       Senators on the conference committee voted 14-8 to add the \n     credits, but House Members voted along party lines against \n     the industry.\n       A majority vote of both chambers is needed to add \n     amendments to legislation in conference committee.\n       Some were quick to point out that Republicans had \n     legitimate policy reasons to vote against the credits.\n       Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, \n     said there were three reasons Republicans voted against the \n     movie industry provisions: ``One, it's bad tax policy because \n     it's industry specific. Two, it's bad tax policy because it \n     subsidizes an industry for signing bad labor contracts and, \n     three, Hollywood has recently expressed contempt for the \n     Republican leadership in the House, Senate and White House.''\n       Well before the Glickman hire, Republicans on Capitol Hill \n     have been unhappy with Hollywood and its Washington trade \n     association.\n       Since 1990, U.S. movie studios and Hollywood executives \n     have contributed $42 million in political donations to \n     Democrats, while giving just $6 million to the GOP, according \n     to figures from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive \n     Politics.\n       After controversial documentary filmmaker Michael Moore \n     began promoting ``Fahrenheit 9/11'' this spring, GOP \n     bitterness against Hollywood spilled over in a closed-door \n     Republican meeting.\n       During the meeting, Manzullo complained that the \n     international tax bill being crafted by Thomas and the Ways \n     and Means Committee included expensive tax breaks for the \n     movie studios while small businesses and manufacturers were \n     losing thousands of jobs.\n       ``Why should we vote on an international tax reform bill \n     that rewards Hollywood while disadvantaging our nation's \n     manufacturers,'' Rep. Don Manzullo (R-III.) asked in a letter \n     he sent to his colleagues.\n       Other Members agreed. Thomas quickly watered down the \n     industry's tax credits and the situation seemed to go away.\n       But Hollywood infuriated Congressional Republicans again in \n     early July when the MPAA announced its hire of Glickman.\n       Two weeks after Glickman was hired, Sen. Rick Santorum (R-\n     Pa.) convened a meeting of top Republicans to discuss the \n     move.\n       In the weeks leading up to the tax vote, Republicans \n     continued to whisper about punishing the MPAA. As a result, \n     Glickman has let it be known that he is looking to hire a \n     big-name Republican lobbyist to join him at the MPAA after \n     the November elections.\n       In the meantime, supporters of the industry on Capitol \n     Hill, like Foley, hope the whole thing will blow away. \n     ``There may be a few people's noses out of joint, but people \n     get over these things pretty quickly,'' Foley said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Hills & Company,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2004.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write with respect to the \n     amendment (S. AMDT. 2690) that you have offered to the FSC-\n     ETI legislation (S. 1637) pending in the Senate.\n       S. AMDT. 2690 provides, in part, that the present-law ETI \n     rules would remain in place with respect to income from \n     activities treated as ``audiovisual services'' under the \n     General Agreement on Trade in Services (``GATS'').\n       Having previously served as USTR, I would like to share \n     with you my views regarding the consistency of your amendment \n     with applicable trade law. The underlying legislation (S. \n     1637) is intended to bring the United States into compliance \n     with the World Trade Organization rulings that the ETI regime \n     violates the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n     (``GATT'') prohibition on export-contingent subsidies. The \n     GATT does not apply to ``audiovisual services'' governed by \n     the General Agreement on Trade in Services (``GATS''). \n     Further, the GATS does not include any general prohibition \n     against export-contingent subsidies.\n       Thus, the adoption of S. AMDT. 2690, which would preserve \n     ETI benefits for audiovisual services covered by the GATS, \n     would not violate GATT or contravene the WTO rulings.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carla A. Hills.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2004.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dianne: I am writing with respect to your amendment \n     (S. AMDT. 2690) to S. 1637, the JOBS Act, that would repeal \n     the current FSC/ETI tax regime in order to bring the U.S. \n     into compliance with the WTO rulings in this case.\n       As a former U.S. Trade Representative, I would like to \n     share my views regarding the consistency of your amendment \n     with applicable trade law. Specifically, your amendment would \n     allow the ETI rules to remain in place for income from \n     activities defined as ``audiovisual services'' under the \n     General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The WTO \n     decisions in the FSC/ETI cases found that the U.S. FSC/ETI \n     regimes violated provisions in the Agreement on Subsidies and \n     Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), which is a part of \n     the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). The GATT \n     governs trade in goods, while the GATS covers trade in \n     services. Audiovisual services are covered by the GATS and \n     are not subject to the SCM agreement, and thus are not within \n     the purview of the WTO FSC/ETI decisions. Further the GATS \n     does not include any general prohibition against export-\n     contingent subsidies.\n       It is my view that adoption of the S. AMDT. 2690, which \n     preserves benefits for audiovisual services covered by the \n     GATS, would not violate or contravene the WTO rulings in the \n     FSC/ETI case.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mickey Kantor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Altria Group, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 2004.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: After many years of debate, the Senate today \n     is considering comprehensive tobacco legislation that will \n     address a range of issues important to all Americans, from \n     the diseases caused by smoking to the plight of our nation's \n     tobacco farmers. There were some legitimate issues connected \n     to FDA regulation of concern to retailers; the good news is \n     that the DeWine/Kennedy bill has already addressed nearly all \n     of these. The continued opposition of one national retailer \n     group to this important legislation, notwithstanding all that \n     has been done to address their concerns, is unfair and \n     unfounded. This is the same organization that expressly \n     promised to remain neutral in 1998 when FDA legislation--with \n     far fewer protections for retailers--was debated in the \n     Senate.\n       Below are just a few of the inaccuracies contained in the \n     attacks on this legislation that would finally empower FDA to \n     work on reducing the harm caused by smoking:\n       All Retailers Treated Equally. The bill expressly provides \n     that any access and advertising restrictions cannot \n     discriminate against any category of retail outlet, and \n     cannot favor ``adult-only'' stores over other kinds of \n     outlets.\n       Enforcement Will be Fair, and Apply to All. The bill \n     requies FDA to contract with State officials for enforcement \n     to the extent feasible.\n       Responsible Retailers Benefit. In total contrast to some \n     claims, the legislation explicitly provides a ``good faith'' \n     defense against enforcement actions for any retailer that \n     takes the necessary steps to train its employees. The great \n     majority of outlets that take pride in working hard to keep \n     tobacco products away from kids should have nothing to fear \n     from enforcement of FDA rules.\n       New Tools for Retailers. Under the authority granted to FDA \n     under the legislation, the agency will be authorized to \n     implement all manner of innovative new tools to assist \n     retailers with their compliance efforts, including electronic \n     age verification. Moreover the legislation is adequately \n     funded, to better ensure that new approaches can be pursued.\n       Advertising Restrictions Are Subject to Review. Some of the \n     advertising restrictions FDA issued in 1996 may well be \n     unconstitutional; that is exactly why the DeWine/Kennedy bill \n     empowers FDA to re-examine those rules to ensure that they \n     comport with the First Amendment. And, even if the agency \n     decides not to change them, interested parties would still be \n     able to test them in court, where any remaining \n     Constitutional objections can and will be resolved.\n       Beyond these specific points, the arguments advanced by one \n     national retailer association conveniently make no mention of \n     some key benefits the legislation provides for retailers--\n     enlisting FDA in the fight against counterfeit tobacco \n     products, and authorizing the agency to regulate Internet \n     sales to ensure that kids can't buy tobacco online. Both of \n     these provisions could result in substantial long-term \n     benefit for brick-and-mortar retailers for years to come.\n       I respectfully request that you disregard the strident and \n     unfounded arguments of those who refuse to look to the future \n     and the need for change in the tobacco industry, from growers \n     to manufacturers to retailers. Thank you for your \n     consideration of the DeWine/Kennedy/McConnell amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John F. Scruggs,\n     Vice President, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Altria Group, Inc.,\n\n                                       New York, NY, May 20, 2004.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators DeWine and Kennedy: It has been a pleasure to \n     work with you on the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \n     Control Act. This legislation has the potential to reduce the \n     harm caused by smoking, and to establish clear rules \n     applicable to all manufacturers of tobacco products sold in \n     this country.\n       The DeWine/Kennedy bill is the result of many difficult \n     choices and compromises by all those involved, and it \n     reflects a balance of the perspectives of many stakeholders. \n     We\n\n[[Page S11208]]\n\n     believe the bill embraces the core principles that are \n     necessary to provide the Food and Drug Administration with \n     comprehensive, meaningful and effective regulatory authority \n     over tobacco products.\n       Together with our domestic tobacco operating company, \n     Philip Morris USA, we enthusiastically support passage of \n     your bill in its entirety. We hope the Senate will give your \n     legislation favorable consideration at the earliest \n     opportunity. We stand ready to work with you and others in \n     support of your bill.\n       Among the bill's many important features are:\n       FDA would be given the authority to impose performance \n     standards for the design and manufacture of cigarettes in \n     order to reduce the harm caused by smoking. Under the bill, \n     FDA would, as part of its effort to reduce or eliminate \n     harmful ingredients and smoke constituents, consider whether \n     a new performance standard would significantly increase the \n     demand for contraband cigarettes. We believe this is an \n     important consideration in order to prevent the unintended \n     consequences of black market cigarettes. It is also important \n     that the bill provides the FDA cannot ban the sale of \n     cigarettes to adults.\n       The bill would change the language of the current cigarette \n     health warnings, substantially enlarge the size and authorize \n     FDA to require new warnings in the future. The bill would \n     not, however, change the Supreme Courts rulings regarding the \n     product liability implications of compliance with warning \n     requirements.\n       The bill would authorize FDA, as well as states and \n     localities, to replace the time, place and manner of \n     cigarette advertising and promotion, consistent with the \n     First Amendment's protection of commercial free speech to \n     adults.\n       The bill provides that FDA's product standards would be \n     consistent on a nationwide basis.\n       FGA would be authority to combat the existence of \n     counterfeit, contraband and other illicit tobacco products.\n       The bill contains a number of other provisions that would \n     benefit the public health and provide important oversight for \n     all tobacco manufacturers. For example, FDA would be \n     authorized to: conduct educational efforts regarding the \n     dangers of tobacco use; take new steps to curb underage \n     tobacco use; strictly regulate new tobacco products that may \n     reduce the risk of disease or exposure to harmful compounds \n     in cigarette smoke; and ensure that tobacco products are not \n     adulterated.\n       As noted above, you have attempted to address the views of \n     a wide range of stakeholders in your FDA bill. We look \n     forward working with all stakeholders in order to make \n     progress on the many issues surrounding tobacco use in this \n     country. In particular, we believe it is imperative that the \n     plight of the American tobacco grower be addressed. We \n     believe it is time for a tobacco quota buyout and we hope to \n     be able to work with you and other stop make that a reality.\n       Your bill is a truly historic opportunity to establish, for \n     the first time, a comprehensive and coherent national tobacco \n     policy. Thank you for your leadership and for the hard work \n     of your staffs on this extremely important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Steven C. Parrish.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. A September 22, 2004 report by the Citizens of Tax \nJustice and the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that \n82 of the 275 (30 percent) large and profitable, Fortune 500 companies \nstudied paid no tax on federal income or received rebates from the \nTreasury in at least one year from 2001 to 2003.\n  In the years they paid no income tax, these 82 companies reported \n$102 billion in pretax U.S. profits. Moreover, instead of paying $35.6 \nbillion in income taxes as the statutory 35 percent corporate tax rate \nrequired, these companies received tax rebate checks from the U.S. \nTreasury totaling $12.6 billion. These rebates meant that the companies \nmade more after taxes than before taxes in those no-tax years.\n  Twenty-eight corporations enjoyed negative federal income tax rates \nover the entire 2001-2003 period. These companies, whose pretax U.S. \nprofits totaled $44.9 billion over the 3 years, included: Pepco \nHoldings (-59.6 percent tax rate), Prudential Financial (-46.2 \npercent), ITT Industries (-22.3 percent), Boeing (-18.8 percent), \nUnisys (-16.0 percent), and CSX (-7.5 percent), the company previously \nheaded by Secretary of the Treasury Snow. General Electric topped the \ncorporate tax breaks recipients with $9.5 billion in tax breaks over 3 \nyears.\n  The average effective rate for the 275 Fortune 500 companies was only \n17.2 percent in 2002-2003, though the corporate tax rate is 35 percent.\n  How is this happening? Accelerated depreciation. Legislation adopted \nin 2002 and 2003 vastly increased corporate write-offs for \n``accelerated depreciation'' and made it easier for corporations to use \ntheir excess tax subsidies to generate tax-rebate checks from the U.S. \nTreasury, at a 3-year cost of $175 billion.\n  Offshore tax sheltering. Over the past decade, corporations and their \naccounting firms have become increasingly aggressive in seeking ways to \nshift their profits, on paper, into offshore tax havens, in order to \navoid their tax obligations. Corporate offshore tax sheltering is \nestimated to cost the U.S. Treasury anywhere from $30 to $70 billion a \nyear.\n  Senator Levin has been aggressive in trying to close these loopholes \nand some of his ideas were adopted in the Senate version of the \nJumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) bill.\n  Stock options. Of the 275 corporations studied, 269 received stock-\noption tax benefits during the 2001-2003 periods, which lowered their \ntaxes by a total of $32 billion over three years. Microsoft had the \nlargest tax savings with $5 billion.\n  Tax credits. The federal tax code provides tax credits for companies \nthat engage in research, exporting, hiring low-wage workers, affordable \nhousing, and enhanced coals usage. For example, Bank of America cut its \ntaxes by $590 million over 2001-2003 by purchasing affordable-housing \ntax credits.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express support for this \nconference report on the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. At the \noutset, I commend Finance Committee Chairman Grassley and Ways and \nMeans Committee Chairman Bill Thomas for their leadership during the \nconference negotiations and bringing this bill to completion.\n  We're here, after nearly 2 years of discussion and work on \nlegislation that, once enacted, will jumpstart the manufacturing sector \nof our economy and create jobs. Indeed, although this legislation is to \nrepeal the FSC/ETI rules and stop the imposition of WTO sanctioned \ntrade tariffs, the real reason we must pass this legislation is to \nassist our struggling manufacturers throughout the country.\n  According to the National Association of Manufacturers, between \nJanuary 2001 through January 2004, manufacturing employment in our \nNation declined by 16 percent. In New England, there was a 20 percent \ndecrease in manufacturing employment during that same time period. This \nmeans that between January 2001 and January 2004, New England's \nmanufacturing sector employment declined by an alarming 28 percent \nfaster rate than it did nationally.\n  My home State of Maine has shed manufacturing jobs at an alarming \nrate over the past decade and all the more so in the past two years. \nFrom January 1993 through June 2003, a 10\\1/2\\ year period, Maine lost \n18,900 manufacturing jobs. More specifically, from July 2000 to June \n2003, Maine has lost 17,300 manufacturing jobs, the highest loss of any \nstate during that time period.\n  Our objective was clear: not only must we adopt a conference report \nthat complies with international trade law, but more importantly, we \nneed to offer our country's manufacturers a solution that will \njumpstart their production and create jobs, and we must do so now. As a \nresult of our loss at the WTO, certain U.S. goods exported to Europe \nare being hit with a 12 percent tariff. Critically, this bill will \nremove that tax on our exports.\n  Were we to neglect this duty to ensure that our nation's \nmanufacturers are simply given the chance to compete on a level playing \nfield with foreign competitors, we would only be compounding the \ncurrent situation.\n  Instead, this conference report will ``reallocate'' the nearly $50 \nbillion in revenues that replacing the FSC/ETI rules will generate and \nprovides an additional $25 billion towards a tax deduction for our \nmanufacturers. I am pleased that the conference report follows the \nSenate manufacturing deduction that is available to all domestic \nmanufacturers and does not discriminate based on the manufacturers \nentity classification.\n  Indeed, the original legislation in the House would have extended the \ntax relief benefits solely to regular corporate entities, or C-\ncorporations. In the Senate, I fought to secure the benefits for S-\ncorporations and partners in partnerships as well.\n  This decision to provide a manufacturing deduction that is not entity \nspecific, rather than a corporate income\n\n[[Page S11209]]\n\ntax cut, is cruial because the ETI rules applied not only to \ncorporations but also to S-corporations. As small business \nmanufacturers constitute over 98 percent of our nation's manufacturing \nenterprises, employ 12 million people, and supply more than 50 percent \nof the value-added during U.S. manufacturing, it is imperative that we \ndo not increase taxes on our country's job creators--small businesses.\n  In the face of record deficits, this bill also maintains our fiscal \nresponsibility by including offsets that will crack down on abusive tax \ncheats. Both the Senate and House bills contain a variety of provisions \nthat stop the proliferation of abusive tax shelters. Enacting these \nrules and other revenue offsets will ensure that we will be able to pay \nfor this bill without adding to the deficit. This was a key priority \nfor me during this conference and I am pleased that the conference \nsupported a revenue neutral final bill.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report includes a provision \nthat will restore equity and fairness into the tax code for our \ncountry's naval shipbuilders.\n  Quite simply, this provision would put navy shipbuilders on par with \ncommercial shipbuilders in that they would be able to pay a portion of \ntheir income taxes upon delivery of the ship rather than during \nconstruction. Currently, navy shipbuilders must estimate profits during \nthe construction phases of the shipbuilding process, and they must pay \ntax on those estimated profits--a process known as the ``percentage of \ncompletion method'' of accounting.\n  The major shortcoming of this method is that shipbuilders must report \nprogress payments as ``revenue'' rather than as a source of financing, \nwhch had been recognized and permitted for the 64 years between 1918 \nand 1982. Additionally, this accounting method creates a ``legal \nfiction'' of an ``interim profit,'' when in reality a profit or loss is \nnot reasonably known until after a ship is completed. This places a \nfinancial burden on shipbuilders during the critical construction \nphase, reduces the resources available to invest in facilities and \nprocess to reduce construction costs, places a burden on the cash flow \nmanagement of the shipbuilder, and weakens the financial health of the \ndefense shipbuilding industrial base.\n  The provision in the conference eport will permit navy shipbuilders \nto pay 40 percent of their estimated income tax during the contract and \npay the remaining 60 percent in the year in which construction is \ncompleted. In addition, shipbuilders will be able to report their taxes \non a ship-by-ship basis rather than on a contract-by-contract basis, \nwhich therefore reduces the potential for abuse.\n  Now, naval shipbuilders will be able to pay their income taxes in a \nmanner similar to how commercial shipbuilders pay their taxes. The main \ndifference, though, is that commercial shipbuilders are permitted to \nutilize this 40/60 treatment for only 5 years rather than the 8-year \nperiod under my amendment. This 5-year period for commercial \nshipbuilders is appropriate for them because most commercial ships take \nno more than three years to build. However, as many navy shipbuilders \nspend at least 8 years when building submarines, aircraft carriers, and \ndestroyers, a 5-year window for them is simply inadequate. \nConsequently, this amendment provides for an 8-year window because that \nis the necessary time to assist the majority of our navy shipbuilders.\n  Let me stress that this provision in no way reduces the amount of \ntaxes that these shipbuilders ultimately pay. Rather, it merely allows \nthem to defer paying their taxes until their profit is actually known, \njust as commercial shipbuilders are already permitted to do.\n  Not only does this change embody sound tax policy, but so too does it \nimprove our National Security. Indeed, this provision is limited \nexclusively to naval shipbuilders, that are charged with building our \nNavy's fleet of ships that protect our homeland. During this time of \nwar, the last thing we should do is allow an inequity in the tax code \nto cause these companies financial hardship that might affect their \nproduction and output. I am certainly not saying these companies should \nget a free pass, and this provision in no way provides them with one, \nbut what I am saying is that they deserve to be treated fairly given \nthe instrumental role they play for our Nation, and this amendment will \ndo just that.\n\n  This conference report contains a great many benefits for small \nbusinesses that will play a vital role in improving our economy. For \nexample, the report includes an amendment I offered that will extend \nthe current $100,000 small business expensing limitation and $400,000 \nphase-out through the end of 2007. Although the Jobs and Growth Tax Act \nincreased these levels from their previous $25,000 limitation and \n$200,000 phase-out, these limits will sunset at the end of 2005 and \nreturn to those lower levels. I believe it is imperative to inject \ncertainty into the tax code so our small business owners can plan \naccordingly in purchasing the capital and equipment they need to run \ntheir operations, and this amendment will go a long way toward doing \nso.\n  It was imperative that Congress take action to extend these benefits \nfor our Nation's small businesses. By doing so, qualifying businesses \nwill be able to deduct more of their equipment purchases in the current \ntax year rather than waiting 5, 7, or more years to recover such costs \nthrough depreciation. This change represents substantial savings both \nin tax dollars and also in the time small businesses would otherwise \nhave to spend complying with the complex depreciation rules.\n  For example, the IRS estimates that a taxpayer should expect to \ninvest nearly 50 hours in order to learn the law, perform the necessary \nbookkeeping, and complete the forms in order to claim a depreciation \ndeduction for an average amount of depreciable property. That is \nvaluable time that the owner must take away from running the business. \nAnd in too many cases, it translates into additional fees for \naccountants to figure out these indecipherable depreciation rules.\n  By maintaining the $100,000 limitation, small businesses will save \ntime and accounting costs, freeing them to spend their scarce time and \nresources on what they do best--running successful businesses and \ncreating jobs in America.\n  I am also pleased that the report includes my amendment to modify the \nunrelated business taxable income rules to allow small business \ninvestment companies to receive investments from tax-exempt entities. \nBy enacting this provision into law, small businesses will have better \naccess to capital through the Small Business Investment Company \nProgram.\n  Small Business Investment Companies are government licensed, \ngovernment regulated, privately managed venture capital firms created \nto invest only in original issue debt or equity securities of U.S. \nsmall businesses that meet size standards set by law. In the current \neconomic environment, the SBIC program represents an increasingly \nimportant source of capital for small enterprises.\n  While Debenture SBICs qualify for SBA-guaranteed borrowed capital, \nthe government guarantee forces a number of potential investors, namely \npension funds and university endowment funds, to avoid investing in \nSBICs because the woul be subject to tax liability for unrelated \nbusiness taxable income UBTI. More often than not, tax-exempt investors \nopt to invest in venture capital funds that do not create UBTI. As \nsuch, an estimated 60 percent of the private-capital potentially \navailable to these SBICs is effectively ``off limits.''\n  The amendment I offered corrects this problem by excluding \ngovernment-guaranteed capital of Debenture SBICs from debt for purposes \nof the UBTI rules. This change would permit tax-exempt organizations to \ninvest in SBICs without the burdens of UBTI record keeping or tax \nliability.\n  As a result, small businesses will have greater access to capital, \nenabling them to grow and hire new employees. According to the National \nAssociation of Small Business Investment Companies, a conservative \nestimate of the effect of this amendment would be to increase \ninvestments in Debenture SBICs by $200 million per year from tax-exempt \ninvestors. Together with SBA-guaranteed leverage, that will mean as \nmuch as $500 million per year in new capital assets for Debenture SBICs \nto invest in U.S. small businesses.\n  Moreover, as people know, Maine is a rural State. In that light, I am \npleased that this bill contains important to the\n\n[[Page S11210]]\n\ntimber industry patterned after S. 1381, the Reforestation Tax Act, a \nbill I introduced last year.\n  Under the conference report, owners of timber lands would be able to \nelect to immediately deduct their reforestation expenditures on their \ntimber property--up to $10,000 per year. This change would allow \ntaxpayers to recoup more of their investments in qualifying timber \nproperty at a more rapid pace, thereby encouraging investments in \nreforestation and strengthening the future growth of our forests. The \nbill provides other relief important to the timber industry, such as \nthe ability to treat outright sales of timber as a capital gain and be \ntaxed at a lower rate. Likewise, it contains a provision to allow real \nestate investment trusts that own timberland to avoid a 100 percent \npenalty tax when they sell timber land in the ordinary course of their \nbusiness. With foreign competition in the timber industry fierce, these \nprovisions will enhance the ability of U.S. timber companies to \ncompete.\n  Furthermore, I am pleased that tax credits for biomass facilities are \nincluded, which are similar to the ones I introduced. For the first \ntime, the current production tax credit will be available to biomass \nfacilities that use waste products to produce energy. This will put the \nindustry, currently at a competitive disadvantage, on a more equal \nfooting with other renewable power, such as wind. The biomass \nfacilities in my state of Maine are not only an alternate electricity-\nproducing source, but they supply good paying jobs in rural areas of \nthe state and are a large source of tax revenues.\n  The Maine biomass industry uses forest waste, such as those unused \nportions of trees--tops and limbs--that are not put into making paper \nproducts, to produce electricity at their biomass plants. This helps to \nlessen the use of fossil fuel to make electricity. Since a barrel of \ncrude oil has gone over $50 a barrel for the first time in history in \nrecent days, these savings help what is becoming a critical--and \nexpensive--situation. Using the forest waste also helps avoid an \nenvironmental and safety problem the mills would have if they had to \nstore the wood waste on site.\n  Additionally, the report contains a provision that co-sponsored that \nwill greatly benefit our domestic film industry, which is an industry \nthat plays a vital role in the economy of our country and also in my \nhome state of Maine.\n  Film makers will now be able to deduct up to $15 million of qualified \ncosts during the first year of production. The remaining costs incurred \nwill then be amortized over a 7-year period. Similar to the small \nbusiness expensing provision, it is critical that we provide taxpayers \nwith opportunities to recover their costs in a more expeditious manner \nrather than under the time-consuming and cumbersome depreciation rules. \nThis film provision provides just that, and will in turn provide a key \nincentive for film makers to make their products in the United States.\n\n  Another ``job-creating'' provision contained in the bill is a \nprovision that I was pleased to cosponsor that will potentially \nincrease the number of taxpayers that are eligible to claim new markets \ntax credits. Without question, the new markets tax credit program has \nhad a profound impact on my home state. This conference report will \nfurther improve that program by extending the geographic area to low-\nincome communities regardless of whether they fell under the \npreviously-designated census tracts. Indeed, this provision will \nbenefit rural communities throughout America, particularly those in \nMaine, because now areas will qualify for this critical investment \nopportunity based on their income and not on an arbitrary ``census \ntract'' determination.\n  This report contains even more tax incentives to encourage job \ncreation throughout America. For example, rail operators will not be \nable to claim a tax credit based on the amount of expenses incurred to \nmaintain and upgrade short-line railroad tracks. Insurance companies \nwill now not incur a penalty tax on old policy holder income when they \nrestructure their operations, which in turn will permit them to save \nthis money and reinvest it in their operations.\n  Clearly, the provisions in this bill to assist our manufacturing base \nare numerous, deserved, and long overdo. Fortunately, however, we were \nalso able to provide other sectors of our economy with much needed tax \nrelief. For example, the bill contains a provision to permit rural \nletter carriers to deduct more of their carrier expenses. In addition, \nthe report contains a provision that will allow fishermen to \n``average'' their income over a period of several years to account for \nthe cyclical nature of their industry and to ensure they will be able \nto fully take advantage of the losses that unfortunately often arise in \ntheir business.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report includes measures I \ncosponsored to assist our Nation's shipping industry. For example, the \nReport includes a provision to permit shippers that adhere to the ``two \nship'' rule to avoid falling under the complex, cumbersome subpart F \nrules. While the subpart F rules have an important role under the tax \ncode in preventing the deferral of passive investment income, shippers \nshould not be subject to them regarding their profits earned from their \nactive shipping business.\n  An additional provision that will benefit our shippers is one that \nwill permit them to satisfy their tax liability in a manner similar to \nhow shippers in other countries pay their taxes. Specifically, the \nreport contains a provision to permit shippers to elect to pay tax on \nthe ``tonnage'' of weight of their freight, rather than a tax based on \ntheir income. Providing for this election will increase the \ncompetitiveness of domestic shippers because it allows them to pay \ntheir taxes in a more efficient, less complicated manner, which in turn \nwill allow them to spend less time and money in trying to navigate the \ncomplicated Tax Code.\n  Notwithstanding all of the considerable benefits contained in this \nconference report, I want to take a moment to lament the report's \ncoverage of tobacco legislation.\n  As you all know, the Senate reached an important compromise on the \nissue of tobacco in order to get this bill to conference by adopting \nboth an industry-funded buyout of tobacco growers' quotas and a grant \nof authority to the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco. \nThe agreement crafted by my colleagues, Senators DeWine, Kennedy, and \nMcConnell, would have given the FDA the authority to require tobacco \nmanufacturers to list the ingredients on all of their packaging; to \nsubmit specified health information to the FDA for analysis; to \nregulate sale, distribution, and advertising related to tobacco; and to \nforce the cigarette makers to substantiate, through scientific testing, \nany labels they might use to indicate that their product posed a lower \nhealth risk, such as ``light,'' ``mild,'' or ``low.''\n  I believe FDA regulation of tobacco is imperative because we simply \ncannot afford to ignore the toll that smoking has taken on our society. \nEvery year 400,000 Americans die as a result of cigarette smoking, and \napproximately 8.6 million people suffer from smoking-related illnesses \nor conditions. In addition to the human cost, these staggering numbers \nhave taken a financial toll on our country's health care system as \nwell: annual public and private health care expenditures caused by \nsmoking amount to over $75 billion, $23.5 billion of which is \nshouldered by federal and state governments.\n  Even more disturbing is the fact that the next generation is being \ntargeted by ``Big Tobacco'' while they are still in middle and high \nschool. Virtually all of my colleagues have been visited in the past \nseveral weeks by members of the Coalition for Tobacco Free Kids, who \nbrought in samples of new candy-flavored cigarette packs such as \n``Caribbean Chill,'' ``Midnight Berry,'' and ``Mocha Taboo.'' Everyone \nknows that lifelong adult smokers have no interest in buying these \nflavored cigarettes. That kids are the targets of this marketing is \nconsistent with a Brown & Williamson memorandum uncovered 6 years ago \nwhich stated, ``It's a well known fact that teenagers like sweet \nproducts. Honey might be considered.''\n  In the final analysis, I wanted to vote for a conference report that \ncontained the Senate's tobacco provisions. As we know, the Senate \nconferees agreed and voted 15-8 to include FDA regulation in the \nconference report--but the House rejected its adoption. Failing that, I \nwould have wanted the buyout provision stricken as well, and I voted \nfor an\n\n[[Page S11211]]\n\namendment in conference to do just that, but that was also rejected. In \nshort, at every opportunity I supported FDA regulation. At the end of \nthe day, the conference report--designed to create jobs, bolster our \nexports overseas, and end the penalties against Maine's and America's \nmanufacturers--was simply too critical to the economic future of our \nnation, and therefore I voted for this vital jobs bill.\n  Likewise, I am disappointed that this conference report failed to \ninclude an important provision in the Senate bill that would have \nbenefitted our military reservists. Under the Senate bill, businesses \nwould have received a tax credit for payments made to an employee who \nwas called to active military reservist duty. Proudly, I supported this \nprovision when it was offered to the Senate bill, and I supported it \nduring the Senate and House conference. Nevertheless, the final report, \nregrettably, failed to include this sensible, deserved tax relief. \nWhile we must pass this conference report to stop the imposition of \nWorld Trade Organization tariffs, I am deeply disappointed we did not \ntake this opportunity to compensate our military reservists and their \nemployers for their sacrifices. Unquestionably, I hope and expect that \naddressing this issue will be one of the first items we consider when \nCongress reconvenes next year.\n  Finally, the bill before us today is silent on an issue of great \nimportance to working Americans--the administration's new regulations \nupdating overtime eligibility requirements that could deny millions of \nworkers the overtime pay protections guaranteed by the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, FLSA. In May, I was one of 52 Senators who voted in \nsupport of the Harkin amendment to the Senate FSC/ETI bill which would \nclarify that the administration's regulations can result in no worker \nlosing their overtime eligibility. In September, both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate Appropriations Committee voted \ndecisively to overturn the new overtime regulations.\n  At issue is a Department of Labor regulation, which went into effect \nin August, updating the so-called ``white collar exemptions'' to the \nFLSA overtime protection. While DOL asserts that 107,000 middle- and \nupper-income workers will lose their overtime eligibility under the \nproposal, other sources put the number of affected workers as high as \nsix million. Whatever the final impact of the DOL's changes on American \nworkers, I have serious concerns as to whether this is the right time \nto take steps to jeopardize the right to overtime pay, which provides \neconomic security for so many American families. As such, I was \ndisappointed that the Harkin amendment was not included in the FSC/ETI \nconference report.\n  This bill is a historic achievement and will benefit our economy. \nMany of these changes to the tax code are long overdue. In the end, the \nprovisions of this bill will bolster our manufacturing base, increase \nthe attractiveness of doing business in the United States and give a \njumpstart to business, particularly small businesses, to create jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference report.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this legislation began as a modest effort \nto repeal an illegal export subsidy. It has grown to 633 pages with \nnearly $140 billion in corporate tax breaks over the next decade. The \nconference report replaces the $50 billion export subsidy with a $77 \nbillion manufacturing tax cut--a net tax cut for domestic manufacturing \nof $27 billion after the loss of the subsidy, $43 billion in tax breaks \non overseas income, and $17 billion in tax breaks for special \ninterests.\n  The bill does not include FDA regulation of tobacco, a Senate-passed \nprovision to block new overtime rules that hurt workers, and a Senate-\npassed provision giving a tax break to companies that make up the pay \ngap for activated Reservists and Guardsmen.\n  It does include a tobacco buyout that gives most of the benefits not \nto small farmers but to anyone who owns tobacco quotas and will do \nnothing to help farm communities, a huge amount of corporate pork, and \nalmost twice as much in new international tax breaks as in domestic \nmanufacturing tax breaks, which will encourage companies to move \noperations and assets abroad. It also uses the same accounting tricks \nas the previous Bush tax cuts to make the bill appear revenue neutral \nwhen it will actually cost billions.\n  The Senate approved a tobacco buyout with $2 billion in transition \nassistance to communities that depend on tobacco production. The \nconference report drops this assistance entirely.\n  The Senate approved a buyout with limitations on who would be \neligible. This was an attempt to make sure small farmers got most of \nthe benefit. Farmers had to be actively engaged in production in the \nlast few years and quota holders had to be in the system since 2002. \nThose restraints were completely dropped in conference. Under this \nbill, 80 to 85 percent of the people who benefit are quota owners who \ndon't qualify as growers, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n  In Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, beneficiaries \ninclude country clubs, churches, colleges, universities and high \nschools that own land in tobacco-growing counties.\n  Larry Flynt and his brother Jimmy own land that had a quota to grow \n600 pounds of tobacco in 2003, according to the Environmental Working \nGroup. They will benefit from the buyout. The Wall Street Journal \nquoted Jimmy Flynt, president of Hustler Entertainment, on the buyout. \nHe said:\n\n       We got out of the tobacco business and into the porn \n     business. We walked away from that blood, sweat and tears.\n\n  The Senate approved a tobacco buyout combined with FDA oversight of \ntobacco by a vote of 78 to 15. The legislation was a hard fought and \npainstakingly crafted balance between public health and struggling farm \neconomies. Now it is gone from the bill, but the tobacco buyout \nremains. The conferees dropped FDA regulation even as the tobacco \nindustry inflicts terrible damage on people's health. It kills more \nAmericans than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides and \nfires combined 400,000 people a year. Every day, 4,000 children will \ntry a cigarette for the first time and 2,000 will become regular \nsmokers. Of those 2,000, one third will die prematurely of smoking \nrelated illnesses.\n  We have missed an opportunity to protect children from tobacco \naddiction and save them from premature death. If you think I am \noverstating the case, look at the tobacco industry's latest advertising \ncampaigns to attract our children to candy-flavored cigarettes: R.J. \nReynolds has recently marketed Kauai Kolada cigarettes, with ``Hawaiian \nhints of pineapple and coconut,'' and Twista Lime cigarettes, described \nas ``a citrus tiki taste sensation.''\n  Without FDA authority, the tobacco companies will continue to target \nour children with their products. We talk about Leaving No Child Behind \nwhen it comes to education. We should not leave them behind when it \ncomes to tobacco either.\n  The Senate version of the bill blocked the Bush administration's new \nrules that stripped the right to overtime pay from six million \nAmericans. For workers who receive overtime pay, that overtime \ncompensation accounts for 25 percent of their paychecks. So the Bush \nadministration's regulations slash the paychecks of hundreds of \nthousands of Americans by 25 percent.\n  Both the Senate and House have voted to block the overtime rules. \nThis clearly has the support of a majority of both the House and the \nSenate, yet it was stripped in conference. Corporations are getting \nhuge tax breaks from this bill, but not one worker will have his or her \nwell-earned overtime pay restored.\n  This bill is loaded with $17 billion in special interest tax breaks. \nDoes anyone outside the Finance Committee really know everything that \nis in this bill? Does anyone inside the room even know? Some of the tax \nbreaks it includes are:\n  $500 million for railroad companies;\n  $494 million for restaurant owners;\n  $234 million for beer, wine, and hard liquor producers;\n  $101 million for NASCAR track owners;\n  $44 million for ceiling fan importers, inserted at the request of \nHome Depot;\n  $42 million for Hollywood producers;\n  $28 million for cruise ship operators, which greatly benefits \nCarnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean;\n  $11 million for makers of tackle boxes, which will benefit Plano \nMolding Corporation, a company\n\n[[Page S11212]]\n\nheadquartered in the district of the Speaker of the House, Dennis \nHastert;\n  $9 million for makers of bows and arrows;\n  A $9 million break on customs duties for the importation of steam \ngenerators and nuclear reactor vessel heads, inserted at the request of \nGeneral Electric;\n  $4 million for makers of sonar fish finders;\n  $4 million for native Alaskan whalers;\n  $27 million for foreign gamblers who win at U.S. horse and dog \ntracks.\n  Is the intention of this bill to give tax breaks for foreign gamblers \nwho win at U.S. horse and dog tracks? I thought the point of this bill \nwas to solve the FSC/ETI problem so that U.S. goods would no longer \nface tariffs abroad, and perhaps to promote domestic manufacturing. \nAfter all, it is called a ``JOBS'' bill by its authors. So now we have \nto entice foreigners to visit the United States and plunk down their \nmoney at the track, by giving them tax breaks on their winnings, in \norder to create jobs in the United States?\n  The conference report does not just include a huge amount of pork. It \nalso fails to effectively close corporate tax loopholes. The Senate \nversion banned accounting techniques that have no economic purpose \nexcept to shield corporate income from taxes. This would have saved $15 \nbillion in lost tax revenue over the next 10 years. The conferees \nrefused to include this measure.\n  The bill also fails to take a strong stand against companies that \nhave moved overseas for tax purposes. The Senate version ended tax \nadvantages for companies that relocate to Bermuda or other tax havens \nand would have eliminated $3 billion in lost tax revenues. The \nconferees severely weakened this provision by not making it \nretroactive. They replaced it with a House version that will eliminate \nonly $800 million in lost tax revenue.\n  The $3 billion saved by the stronger Senate measure would have been \nenough to pay for the tax break for companies that make up the pay gap \nfor Reservists and Guardsmen. But this break for our men and women in \nthe military was dropped.\n  Instead, other companies will benefit. As the Wall Street Journal \nreported on Wednesday, the bill grandfathered in four Houston-based \ncompanies--Cooper Industries, Weatherford International Limited, Noble \nCorporation, Nabors Industry--that recently relocated to the Cayman \nIslands and Bermuda.\n  The bill includes $43 billion international tax breaks that will \nencourage companies to relocate to tax havens like Bermuda and to move \njobs out of the country. According to an analysis published last month \nby the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Brookings Institution \nand the Urban Institute, these tax breaks increase the already strong \nincentives of U.S. multinational firms to operate abroad and to shift \nprofits to low-tax locations. Even corporate executives admit they are \nmoving assets and operations overseas. In February of this year, the \nFinancial Times quoted one corporate tax official as saying:\n\n       You only have to look at the way we tighten our belts in \n     the United States through layoffs to understand what is \n     happening.\n\n  More than a dozen companies such as Tyco, Foster Wheeler, and \nIngersoll Rand have relocated their headquarters to foreign tax havens \nin the past decade alone. And jobs are moving abroad as well. Since \nPresident Bush took office, 2.7 million manufacturing jobs have been \nlost. It is no mystery where these jobs have gone: out of the country \nin search of cheap labor and low tax rates. We should not encourage \nthis kind of behavior with new tax breaks on overseas operations.\n  Some of the $43 billion in international tax breaks include:\n  An $8 billion tax break that makes it easier for companies to use \ntaxes on one kind of foreign income to reduce what they owe on foreign \nincome of a different type--General Electric pushed hard for this \nprovision and got it;\n  A $7 billion tax break that allows companies to carry their foreign \ntax credits forward for 10 years, compared to the current law that \nallows only 5 years;\n  A $5.6 billion tax break that allows companies to reclassify domestic \nincome as foreign income to take advantage of unused foreign tax \ncredits;\n  A $3.3 billion tax holiday to encourage companies to bring foreign \nprofits back to the United States, supposedly for investment here.\n  This tax holiday provision is worth looking at more closely. The \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities calls it the ``Oracle'' tax \nbreak because the software company Oracle will reap huge benefits. \nCompanies leave profits abroad to take advantage of lower tax rates and \nto defer payment of their American taxes. This bill gives them a \ntemporary reduction in the tax rate to repatriate these funds. The \nsupporters of this tax holiday say the bill requires companies to \nreinvest these repatriated funds to create jobs in the U.S. But \naccording to the Tax Policy Center, the conditions on the use of these \nrepatriated funds are difficult to enforce and are unlikely to create \nnew investment in our country.\n  I am not the only one who thinks the tax holiday is a bad idea. Even \nthe Bush administration opposes it. Treasury Secretary John Snow sent a \nletter to the conferees that said:\n\n       U.S. companies that do not have foreign operations and have \n     already paid their full and fair share of tax will not be \n     able to benefit from this provision. Moreover, the Council of \n     Economic Advisers' analysis indicates that the repatriation \n     provision would not produce any substantial economic \n     benefits. The Administration believes the $3 billion revenue \n     cost. . . could be better used to reduce the tax burden of \n     job creators in the United States.\n\n  Even the centerpiece domestic manufacturing tax cut has serious \nproblems:\n  The oil and gas industries were never eligible for the FSC/ETI export \nsubsidy, but they will get the manufacturing benefit, even though oil \nprices are at historic highs.\n  Corporate farms, but not family farms, will be eligible.\n  Engineering firms like Bechtel and Halliburton will be eligible.\n  Starbucks secured a provision declaring that coffee roasting is a \nform of manufacturing, so the company will benefit from the tax cut.\n  Deceptive figures to make the bill appear revenue neutral.\n  The bill's supporters say it is revenue neutral. But since 2001, the \nRepublican leadership has repeatedly relied on budgetary gimmicks to \nhide the true cost of their tax cuts. This bill is no different. It \nwill increase the deficit at a time when it is at record levels.\n  The Congressional Budget office reported last week that we had a $415 \nbillion deficit in 2004. This is $41 billion higher than last year. It \nis the fourth straight year of increasing deficits. This is the first \ntime since World War II that we have had 4 consecutive years of \nincreasing deficits.\n  Because of the huge deficit, the Washington Post reported on Friday \nthat the White House has ordered a draft budget for 2006 that cuts \nHomeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Education.\n  The bill slowly phases in the manufacturing tax cut over 5 years. \nBecause of the phase-in, about one-third of the total cost is \nconcentrated in the last 2 years. According to the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities, the long-run cost of the measure would likely be \nsignificantly higher than the $77 billion estimated for the first 10 \nyears.\n  The bill also has tax breaks that expire before the end of the 10-\nyear period. There are nearly a dozen provisions in the bill that \nsunset between 2005 and 2008. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, \nthe cost of the legislation could balloon to $230 billion over 10 years \nif those tax breaks are extended. This far exceeds the $140 billion in \nrevenue offsets.\n  The expiring provisions and their supposed cost and true cost if \nextended are:\n  Small Business Expensing $1 billion True cost: $33 billion';\n  State and Local Tax Deduction $5 billion True cost: $30 billion;\n  15-year Straight Line Cost Recovery $2 billion True cost: $11 \nbillion;\n  Other Expiring Cuts $1 billion True cost: $4 billion.\n  These cuts supposedly cost only $7 billion over 10 years, but in \nreality they will cost $80 billion if extended. And as we have \nrepeatedly seen, the Republican leadership is more than willing to \nextend ``temporary'' tax cuts again and again without any concern about \nthe effect on the budget, despite the record deficits we face. I have \nno doubt this will happen again with these cuts.\n\n[[Page S11213]]\n\n  The conference report has many flaws, but it also includes an \nhistoric ethanol program that I have worked for many years to pass. The \nethanol tax credits in the bill are important to Illinois and the \nNation's energy policy, and I would like nothing better than to vote to \npass these measures.\n  The bill enacts the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, which \nchanges the administration of tax incentives for renewable fuels to \navoid a reduction in highway funding. It extends the ethanol tax \nincentive through 2010. It also allows small ethanol producer \ncooperatives to pass credits through to cooperative members.\n  Ethanol has been an important issue for me throughout my 20 plus \nyears in Congress. In 1987 I was the first member of Congress to \npropose that Congress require the gasoline supply to include 5 billion \ngallons of ethanol.\n  I am greatly disappointed to have to vote against this bill, despite \nthe ethanol provisions, because of the outrageous and unacceptable way \nthat it deals with the central issue of replacing the export subsidy.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the tax bill conference report that \nwill overwhelmingly pass the Senate today is an opportunity lost. This \nbill is a fiscally irresponsible giveaway full of hundreds of special \ninterest provisions that will ultimately cost the taxpayers billions of \ndollars.\n  I voted in favor of the Senate version of this important legislation \nwhen it passed by an overwhelming vote of 92-5 back in May. What began \nas a legislative fix to bring our Tax Code into compliance with \ninternational trade laws has turned into a deficit busting give away to \nspecial interests. This conference report lacks the balance and \nrestraint that was critical to passage of the Senate bill.\n  The math on how this bill adds to the deficit is simple. Repeal of \nthe so-called FSC ETI tax breaks for U.S. multinational companies will \nincrease revenue by $50 billion. Incredibly, the conferees could not \nhelp themselves but take the opportunity to not only spend that $50 \nbillion but also spend another $100 billion with almost no comparable \nspending offsets--adding straight to the ballooning Federal budget \ndeficit.\n  The conference report is being sold as a godsend for American \nmanufacturing workers, yet Senate provisions to tie corporate tax \nbreaks to actual job creation have been stripped. I have to chuckle \nwhen I hear the White House referring to this as the ``JOBS'' \nconference report.\n  I am also disappointed that the conferees chose to drop the Senate \nprovision sponsored by Senator Landrieu to provide tax credits to \nemployers who make up the pay that employees lose when they are called \nup for National Guard or Reserve duty. Senator Landrieu has eloquently \nand forcefully highlighted to the Senate over the past couple of days \nwhy this provision should not have been dropped from the final \nconference report. I agree with her outrage that the conferees included \nmany special interest tax provisions--one even for ceiling fan \nmanufacturers--but could not include a provision that helps the men and \nwomen who are serving their country.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to \nsection 852 of the conference report of H.R. 4520 before us today. \nFirst, I thank the managers of the conference report for accepting my \namendment which added this provision to the conference report. The \namendment codifies current Treasury proposed regulations defining off-\nhighway vehicle. My intention in proposing this amendment was to \nconfirm that Congress feels it is proper that vehicles which do not \nmake use of, or make only very limited use of, the public highways \nshould not be considered a ``highway vehicle'' for purposes of various \nexcise tax sections, including, but not limited to, sections 4053, \n4072, 4082, 4483, 6421, and 7701, of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  When used on public highways, heavy trucks put a greater stress on \nour roadways than average vehicles. In the past, Congress has passed \nlaws to impose various excise taxes for large vehicles to use our \nnational highway system. For example, there is a 12-percent retail \nsales tax for large on-highway vehicles, special taxes on tires \nweighing more than 40 pounds, additional large vehicle gasoline taxes, \nand there is even an annual use tax imposed on these heavier vehicles. \nThe overwhelming majority of the revenue generated from these \nprovisions is placed in the highway trust fund to rebuild our Nation's \ninfrastructure.\n  This issue of off-highway vehicles and their tax status is of grave \nimportance to my state of Kentucky. Many companies use heavy machinery \nand oversize vehicles. In Kentucky, they are used most often at coal \nmines. Some of these large vehicles are used only internally on the \nmine lands while others are used to haul materials over our Nation's \npublic roads.\n  However, the Internal Revenue Code itself has not defined what \nconstitutes a ``highway vehicle.'' The legislative intent of past \nCongresses seems clear--to impose excise taxes on vehicles that \ndisproportionately stress our highways. It is important that we clarify \nwho should pay these taxes through the legislative process. Current \nTreasury regulations contain a number of exclusions from the definition \nof highway vehicle and therefore provide exclusions from the imposition \nof a number of excise taxes which are dependent upon this definition. \nOne of these exclusions exempts certain vehicles specially designed for \noff-highway transportation for which the special design substantially \nlimits or impairs the use of such vehicle to transport loads over the \nhighway.\n  I proposed the amendment to codify this off-highway vehicle \nexception--an amendment which became section 852 of this conference \nreport--because I believe that these excise taxes should not be imposed \non vehicles which make little or no use of the public highways. Under \nthe definition of off-highway vehicle which is provided in this \nconference report, a vehicle is not treated as a highway vehicle if it \nis specially designed for the primary function of transporting a \nparticular type of load other than over the public highway and because \nof this special design its capability to transport a load over the \npublic highway is substantially limited or impaired. In determining \nwhether substantial limitation or impairment exists, account may be \ntaken of factors such as the size of the vehicle, whether it is subject \nto the licensing, safety, and other requirements applicable to highway \nvehicles, and whether it can transport a load at a sustained speed.\n  The Statement of Managers accompanying this conference report states \nthat, when determining whether a vehicle qualifies for the off-highway \nexception, the fact that its considerable physical characteristics for \ntransporting its load other than over the public highway, when compared \nwith its physical characteristics for transporting the load over the \npublic highway, establish that it is specially designed for the primary \nfunction of transporting its load other than over the public highway. \nThese types of vehicles should not be defined as a highway vehicle and \nshould not be subject to the excise taxes at issue.\n  We often have situation in the mining area of my state where large \ntrucks are used to haul coal in off-highway operations. When these \ntrucks are designed and built, many thousands of dollars are spent to \nmodify standard truck chassises before bed installation. Generally, \nheavier axles, transmissions and other drive train components, as well \nas other modifications needed to allow the vehicles to operate at lower \noperating speeds carrying loads significantly heavier than those \nlegally allowed on the highways, must be added to the trucks. The \ntrucks generally have beds which, along with the truck itself, cause \nthe vehicle's width to exceed that which is allowed to be operated on \nthe public highways of any state. Often these trucks do not need to be \nlicensed like on-highway vehicles in Kentucky and neighboring coal \nstates because the trucks are an off-highway vehicles by state \nstandards. These trucks are actually so large that it is not even legal \nto drive them on highways, except in very limited circumstance usually \ninvolving special trip permits. In fact, very substantial modifications \nwould need to be made to the vehicles to cause them to be legal for \nhighway use. Insurance agents, State licensing agents, State sales tax \nofficials, and even our own transportation laws all recognize these \nvehicle as ``off-highway.'' It is clear\n\n[[Page S11214]]\n\nthat, by reason of special design, the use of such vehicles to \ntransport loads over the public highways is substantially limited or \nsubstantially impaired.\n  I am concerned about the interpretation of these rules by the \nadministration. Make no mistake about it, as a member of the Senate \nFinance Committee, I will be watching this issue closely to ensure that \nthe intent of Congress is being followed with regard to the imposition \nof taxes on highway vehicles and the exception of nonhighway vehicles \nfrom these taxes. I will not hesitate to urge the Congress to address \nthis issue again if necessary to ensure that congressional intent is \nbeing properly implemented.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on behalf of all hard working West \nVirginians who are worried about keeping their jobs, I must oppose the \ncorporate tax bill the Senate is considering today. For more than a \nyear, I have been working with my colleagues to craft legislation that \nwould address the needs of our manufacturing industry, and I was proud \nto vote for a Senate bill earlier this year that promised real relief \nfor our economy. However, the legislation before us bears only a faint \nresemblance to the bipartisan Senate bill, and I believe it would do \nmore harm than good. I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation. \nWe can do better than this, and we owe it to American workers.\n  Last September, I introduced legislation that would offer help to our \nstruggling manufacturing sector. My bill would repeal the Foreign Sales \nCorporation/Extraterritorial Income tax provisions to ensure that \nEuropean tariffs against American exports are lifted. It would create a \nnew tax deduction for domestic manufacturers to essentially lower their \ncorporate income taxes by 3 percent. In addition, my legislation calls \nfor a tax credit to make health care for older workers more affordable. \nFinally, my legislation would strengthen our trade protections.\n  On May 11, 2004, the Senate voted 92 to 5 to support the Jumpstart \nOur Business Strengths, JOBS, Act, which contained the core \nmanufacturing deduction I support. This Senate bill was the product of \nconstructive, bipartisan negotiations. While I did not like every last \nprovision in the bill, it represented a balanced set of tax incentives \nthat would help our factories compete globally.\n  Having worked so hard to craft the good legislation produced by the \nSenate, I am extremely disappointed to be faced with such a bad \nconference report. This conference report is riddled with problematic \nprovisions. But the most fundamental flaw is that this bill actually \ndoes more to reward companies for moving jobs overseas than it does to \nhelp companies who are struggling to keep their American factories \nopen.\n  Right now workers in my state are worried about being laid off. \nNationwide, we have lost almost 3 million manufacturing jobs in four \nyears. American companies are struggling to succeed in a tough global \nmarketplace. Yet, this Congress is considering legislation that \nprovides tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks for American \ncompanies with factories abroad, but includes very little for American \nfactories that are struggling to stay open at home. Many factories are \nsimply not profitable enough to benefit from the deduction provided in \nthis bill.\n  I supported two key provisions in the Senate-passed version of this \nbill that would provide relief to struggling companies. The net \noperating loss carry-back provision would allow unprofitable companies \nto reclaim some of the taxes they had paid on previous earnings. And a \nprovision to allow companies to use alternative minimum tax credits in \nlieu of favorable depreciation rules would have provided a real \nincentive for factories to invest in America. But both of these \nprovisions have been excluded from the final bill. By contrast, this \nbill does include a new 30 percent tax break for companies that moved \nfactories overseas and then kept the profits offshore to avoid paying \ntheir fair share of taxes.\n  Rewarding companies for offshoring is just one of the ways that this \nbill makes American workers less secure. In spite of Senate support for \na provision to prevent the federal government from outsourcing its \ncontracts to foreign workers, this legislation includes no such \nrestriction. The conference committee also dropped a provision to \nprotect the overtime pay of millions of workers across the country.\n  Instead of protecting workers, this legislation is rife with \ngiveaways to corporate interests. For just one example, the legislation \nrepeals a 4.3-cent excise tax on railroads diesel fuel. By providing no \ncorresponding relief to captive shippers, the bill ensures that \nconsumers will have to pay more for many goods shipped on the Nation's \nrailways.\n  In another effort to appease corporate interests, the conference \ncommittee actually protected many abusive tax shelters. To ensure that \nevery company and individual pays a fair share of taxes, and to \nmitigate this bill's effect on our spiraling national debt, the Senate \nsupported a number of strict provisions to close tax loopholes. \nUnfortunately, $40 billion worth of tax shelters will remain available \neven if this legislation passes. I will put my colleagues on notice \nright now that I intend to continue the fight to shut down those \nabusive tax schemes.\n  Among the corporate interests that are best protected by this bill \nare tobacco companies that peddle their deadly products to our Nation's \nchildren. The House of Representatives ignored a bipartisan Senate \ncompromise to link a buyout for tobacco farmers with regulation of \ntobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration. As a result, more \nchildren will take up the awful habit of smoking.\n  And while I am on the subject of America's young people, let me \nmention the bill they can expect from the legislation we are \nconsidering today. The Senate insisted that the legislation be revenue \nneutral, that is, it must not add to the debt. However, as we have seen \ntime and time again from this Congress, this goal was met using \ngimmicks. Many of the tax breaks in this bill are either phased in \nslowly or sunset after a few years. If expiring provisions are \nextended, as there will certainly be great pressure to do, the net cost \nof the bill over the next 10 years would be almost $100 billion.\n  Regrettably, as we are accumulating more debt for our children to pay \noff, we are not building the technological infrastructure that will be \nnecessary to make America's economy competitive in years to come. The \nUnited States has now slipped to 11th in the world for broadband \npenetration, with rural areas lagging behind considerably. The Senate \nJOBS Act included a provision I have championed to provide tax \nincentives for the deployment of broadband. I am extremely disappointed \nthat this provision, like so many others, was dropped from the final \nbill.\n  I have just gone through a laundry list of important reasons to \noppose this bill, but in the end, my judgment about this legislation \ncame down to a very simple test: Is this in the best interest of \nworking West Virginians? I cannot support this bill because the fact \nis, it is not in the best interest of working West Virginians. I urge \nmy colleagues to reject this bill and work with me to pass legislation \nthat will truly benefit American workers.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this week, a conference committee filed its \nreport on legislation that was originally designed to repeal provisions \nin the tax code that have been found by the World Trade Organization to \nbe illegal export subsidies. Months ago the European Union began \nimposing retaliatory tariffs on select American exports, including such \nimportant Rhode Island exports as machinery and jewelry. The targeting \nof the jewelry industry is especially troubling because Rhode Island is \namong the three biggest jewelry-producing States, and this sector \naccounts for 36 percent of the total trade targeted by the retaliatory \nduties. Without congressional action to repeal these export tax \nprovisions, these tariffs would grow progressively until reacing 17 \npercent by March of 2005.\n  Unfortunately, I have serious concerns that the conference agreement \nbefore us today would not even provide immediate relief to our jewelers \nand other businesses targeted by these tariffs. The Senate-passed JOBS \nAct included a carefully crafted transitional benefit for those firms \ncurrently receiving FSC/ETI assistance. However, the bill before us \nincludes transitional relief that is still export-contingent and could \nbe challenged by the EU as still not being WTO-compliant. In fact,\n\n[[Page S11215]]\n\naccording to an article yesterday in the Washington Post, EU spokesman \nAnthony Gooch suggested that this legislation would not accomplish its \ncentral goal of lifting European sanctions due to the transitional \nassistance. This is the reason we have this legislation in the first \nplace, and I am disappointed that the House conferees have potentially \nset up a repeat of tariffs on our Nation's domestic manufacturers and \nexporters.\n  That brings me to the other compelling reasons for the original JOBS \nAct: the bill, as passed by the Senate, replaced the Foreign Sales \nCorporation and Extraterritorial Income regimes with a more robust set \nof incentives for domestic manufacturing. At a time when domestic \nmanufacturing, long the backbone of the American economy, is bleeding \nprized jobs to foreign countries, it is incumbent on Congress to put \nforward a responsible economic plan and provide important assistance to \nmanufacturers that keep their operations here in the United States.\n  While the conference agreement does include a tax deduction to \nprovide assistance to a broad-based group of manufacturers, unlike the \nSenate-passed legislation, it does not make a distinction between \nmanufacturing domestically or abroad. It removed the so-called \n``haircut'' that would have provided an incentive for companies to do \ntheir manufacturing here at home instead of shipping it abroad. Yet \nagain, we see that House Republicans are unwilling to stand up for \nthose manufacturers, small and large, that have kept their operations \nhere in the United States.\n  In fact, if we look at the bill as a whole, we see that of the broad-\nbased tax incentives, a larger net amount of money would be dedicated \nto international provisions than those targeted at production here at \nhome. It is difficult to reconcile the very real challenges facing \ndomestic manufacturers with the inclusion of huge tax breaks for \nmultinational corporations. Ultimately, providing tax breaks to \nmultinationals means that manufacturing jobs are going overseas.\n  The corporate repatriation provisions in H.R. 4520 are responsible \nfor a significant amount of these costs, but there is little evidence \nthat they will ultimately help to create jobs. Even Secretary Snow, \nspeaking for the Administration, seemed to understand this inequity. He \nwrote in a letter to Chairman Grassley, and I quote:\n\n       [T]he Administration also has concerns regarding the \n     fairness of the repatriation provision included in both \n     bills. This provision would offer international \n     corporations a partial ``tax holiday'' for repatriating \n     foreign income that is currently held overseas. U.S. \n     companies that do not have foreign operations and have \n     already paid their full and fair share of tax will not be \n     able to benefit from this provision. Moreover, the Council \n     of Economic Advisers' analysis indicates that the \n     repatriation provision would not produce any substantial \n     economic benefits. The Administration believes the $3 \n     billion revenue cost of this provision could be better \n     used to reduce the tax burden of job creators in the \n     United States.\n\n  This is not the only place where this bill failed to live up to its \nfull potential to help domestic manufacturers. I am deeply disappointed \nseveral months ago that last-minute lobbying by multinational \ncorporations were effective in removing from the Senate bill a \ncommonsense provision to help reduce offshore outsourcing termed \ncontract manufacturing.\n  Similarly, House Republicans voted to leave out the Dodd offshoring \namendment, which would have prevented Federal taxpayers' dollars from \nbeing used to support outsourcing in future government contracts. This \nis a commonsense measure to make sure that the Government does not \nactively contribute to outsourcing, and its rejection by the conferees \nis a sign of their strong disregard of the practice of ``buying \nAmerican.''\n  This brings me to the subject of corporate tax shelters. We have been \nfighting to close these loopholes benefiting large companies for a \ndecade. A recent study commissioned by the IRS estimated that abusive \ncorporate tax shelters cost honest Americans as much as $18 billion \nannually, or $180 billion over 10 years. Put another way, every month \nthat the majority and the administration obstruct efforts to shut down \ncorporate shelters, it costs honest taxpayers over $1.5 billion. It has \nbeen several years now since the Enron debacle, and yet the majority \nhas still not sent to the President a tax bill to shut down these \nshelters. While the Senate has taken actions over and over again to \ntarget shelters, they have been blocked by the majority party.\n  For example, in June 2002, the Senate passed tax shelter legislation \nas a stand alone bill and as part of the CARE Act. The other chamber \ndid not. The Senate passed it again in April 2003 as part of the CARE \nAct; and the other body rejected it. The Senate passed shelter \nlegislation as part of the energy bill in July 2003, and the other \nchamber rejected it. The Senate passed shelter legislation as part of \nthe Jobs and Growth stimulus bill in May 2003, and it was stripped out \nin conference.\n  So I was pleasantly surprised to hear that tax shelter provisions \nwere included in the conference agreement. Then I had a chance to look \na little more closely. The conference bill is a shadow of the Senate-\npassed version, raising $40 billion less by closing corporate tax \nloopholes than the Senate-passed version. $15 billion of this lost \nopportunity to make the Tax Code fairer for all Americans would have \neliminated phony transactions that have no economic substance and have \nbeen used by companies like Enron to avoid taxes. Another measure \nmodified by the majority conferees would continue to allow those \nindividuals who promote tax shelters to make profits while doing so. In \ncontrast, the Senate would have levied a 100 percent penalty to prevent \nthem from making any such profit at the expense of taxpaying Americans.\n  Sadly, while the underlying core components of the bill are flawed at \nbest, much of the rest of the bill is deeply defective. I am perhaps \nmost disheartened over the section on tobacco--and the notable absence \nof language authorizing the FDA to regulate it. This might just be the \nlargest children's health issue facing Congress. The tobacco industry \nspent more last year than ever before on advertising--over $11.5 \nbillion--and children continue to become hooked on smoking while they \nare young and unable to understand the health ramifications of smoking. \nIt is now believed that smokers could lose on average 10 years off \ntheir lifespan--an entire decade. At a time when we are talking about \nsoaring health care costs, it is vital that we regulate a substance \nthat causes 440,000 deaths each year and results in more than $75 \nbillion in direct medical costs annually--much of which is paid for by \ntaxpayer-financed health care programs.\n\n  The Supreme Court has acknowledged that tobacco is ``perhaps the \nsingle most significant threat to public health in the United States'' \nand has effectively reaffirmed that the FDA is the most appropriate \nagency to regulate tobacco products, given the general scope of its \nauthority and its emphasis on protecting the public health. It is now \nthat Congress must act to clearly give the FDA the long overdue \nauthority it requires to protect Americans, and particularly our \nchildren.\n  I was willing to accept the inclusion of a tobacco buyout under the \nclear understanding that it would remain linked to giving the FDA \nregulatory authority over tobacco. Americans want us to take this \nimportant step, and but this report falls short. We all know that \ntobacco is a substance that reduces the quality of life and results in \nuntimely death with lifelong use. We had a unique opportunity with this \nbill to make a real difference in helping to protect our nation's \nchildren and the majority conferees killed this bipartisan effort that \nSenators Kennedy and DeWine spearheaded.\n  The conference agreement left out other very important and widely \nsupported worker protections that would have prevented President Bush's \nregulations that will deny overtime protections to 6 million hard-\nworking men and women, including registered nurses, cooks, clerical \nworkers, nursery school teachers, and many others from taking effect.\n  The Senate has voted against the Bush overtime rule three times, and \nthe other Chamber twice. The Senate FSC bill included two amendments \nthat preserve workers' overtime--the Harkin amendment that would block \nonly the parts of the overtime rule that strip workers of overtime \nrights, and the Gregg amendment that passed 99 to 0, which would \npreserve overtime\n\n[[Page S11216]]\n\nfor 55 job categories. Majority conferees, at the behest of the White \nHouse, stripped the overtime protections from the report. Even after \nthe Senate conferees voted yet again to retain the Harkin amendment, it \nwas stripped out.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in the 1930's to create a \n40-hour workweek, and it requires workers to be paid fairly for any \nextra hours. American workers work more hours than any others in the \nworld--1,900 hours per year. Yet, still, they need more to get by and \nmake ends meet. With 8 million Americans out of work, and with so many \nother families struggling to make ends meet, cutbacks on overtime are \nan unfair burden that America's workers should not have to bear. \nEspecially in times like these, it's an incentive for job creation, \nbecause it encourages employers to hire more workers, instead of \nforcing current employees to work longer hours.\n  I am amazed that the majority has again stripped this provision which \nhas overwhelmingly passed both the House and the Senate on 5 separate \noccasions. This is a clear example of how the majority and this \nadministration continue to turn their backs on working families.\n  Now, in addition to leaving out a number of the important provisions \nthat I've just enumerated, it also contains many costly and extraneous \nones; $101 million for NASCAR by changing the tax treatment of \ngrandstand facilities; $44 million for importers of Chinese made \nceiling fans; $28 million for cruise ship operators; $231 million in \ntaxpayer funds to finance bonds for four so-called ``Green Bond'' mall \ndevelopments; $247 million in bonus depreciation of some jets and \nplanes; $5 billion over only two years for a new deduction for state \nand local sales taxes in a select few states; and $27 million for horse \nand dog gamblers. This one is especially interesting because it exempts \nforeign gamblers from paying taxes up front on their winnings at horse \nand dog tracks.\n\n  My question is: Where's the special tax break that will help \nstruggling working families in my state? How does it help American \nworkers by giving tax breaks for Chinese fans to be imported tax free \nto the United States? The Administration seems to agree, and Secretary \nSnow also wrote in his letter to Chairman Grassley that:\n\n       Both the House and Senate-passed bills include a myriad of \n     special interest tax provisions that benefit few taxpayers \n     and increase the complexity of the tax code. Legislation \n     taking up more than 1000 pages of statutory language (or even \n     400 pages) goes far beyond the bill's core objective of \n     replacing the FSC/ETI tax provisions with broad-based tax \n     relief that is WTO-compliant.\n\n  At the same time, the majority party voted to strip the legislation \nof an amendment offered by Senator Landrieu that would provide a tax \nbreak to companies for paying the salaries of activated National \nGuardsmen and Reservists.\n  Lastly, it continues to employ the same budget gimmickry as previous \ntax bills put forward by the majority party and the administration over \nthe past 3 years. For example, a dozen of the tax cuts in this report \nwill expire between 2005 and 2008. Assuming that these provisions are \nextended, the cost to the Treasury will increase by an estimated $80 \nbillion!\n  This bill could have been an ideal vehicle for bipartisan efforts to \nshape a comprehensive economic policy for our nation's manufacturing \nsector. Unfortunately, it proved to be too alluring for the special \ninterests who just could not restrain themselves. At a time of a record \nFederal budget deficits--most recently pegged at $422 billion for \nFiscal Year 2004--this bill contains too many giveaways to corporations \nand not enough to help domestic manufacturers and working families. \nMost regrettably, its passage does not seem to guarantee that the EU \nwill lift its harmful sanctions against numerous United States \nproducts. Companies in our home states are hurting from EU retaliatory \ntariffs, like jewelry manufacturers in Rhode Island, and the conferees \nshould have taken the responsible path in assisting those who are \nstruggling. But they did not.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I voted against cloture on this \nmeasure yesterday because it is loaded with corporate pork and special \ninterest tax provisions. This conference report, at 633 pages and $148 \nbillion, serves as a sad example of the way business is done around \nhere. The special interests continue to rule at the expense of the \nhardworking American taxpayer.\n  The original intent of this legislation was laudable. Earlier this \nyear, we missed a golden opportunity to pass a good, clean bill that \nwould have brought us back into compliance with World Trade \nOrganization, WTO, agreements and stop the burdensome tariffs now \nimposed on our manufacturers. Simply repealing the extraterritorial \nincome, ETI, exemption tax benefit for exports would have saved $50 \nbillion. Instead, because this was known to be a ``must pass'' piece of \nlegislation, it was loaded up with billions and billions of dollars in \ntax breaks for big corporations and special interests of all types. I \nrecognize the need to pass legislation to bring the United States back \ninto compliance with the WTO, and I am more than willing to support a \nbill that accomplishes that goal. Unfortunately this legislation's \nworthy purpose has taken a back seat to a host of special interest tax \nprovision add-ons and a big buyout for tobacco farmers.\n  In an editorial on the issue, The Washington Times, noted that ``the \nideal solution would have been a quick, simple repeal of FSC-ETI, which \nis bad economic policy in any case. The $50 billion in savings could \nthen have been used to streamline and simplify the corporate tax \ncode.'' I couldn't agree more. The Tax Code is far too complex and is \nin dire need of reform. While campaigning in recent months, the \nPresident has stated, with tremendous approval from every audience, \nthat reforming and simplifying the Tax Code would be one of the main \nobjectives of his second term. I will support him in that effort, and I \nencourage him to take the first step in that reform by vetoing this \nbill.\n   We have a deficit that is quickly approaching $500 billion--that is \nhalf of a trillion dollars. The proponents of this bill say that it's \n``revenue neutral.'' Well, I doubt that, and I am not alone in my \nskepticism. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities has figured \nthat the bill would actually cost $80 billion if the temporary tax cuts \nare extended for the full 10 years. Sadly, I have no doubt that those \nextensions will happen--because we simply don't say no to anyone \nanymore. We are told that this bill is offset by closing tax loopholes, \nand I will be the first person to say that I support closing those \nloopholes, but can anyone explain to me the rationale behind closing \nloopholes in order to raise revenues to open more loopholes? It is \nremarkable. It makes no sense.\n  As I have said many times in the past, we need to start making some \nvery tough decisions around here about our fiscal future. We need to be \nthinking about the future of America and the future generations who are \ngoing to be paying the tab for our continued spending. It is simply not \nfiscally responsible for us to continue to load up bills with good \ndeals for special interests and their lobbyists. We have had ample \nopportunities to tighten our belts in this town in recent years, and we \nhave taken a pass each and every time. We can't put off the inevitable \nany longer.\n  Here is the stark reality of our fiscal situation. According to the \nGeneral Accounting Office, the unfunded Federal financial burden, such \nas public debt, future Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid \npayments, totals more than $40 trillion or $140,000 per man, woman and \nchild. To put this in perspective, the average mortgage, which is often \na family's largest liability, is only $124,000--and that is often borne \nby the family breadwinners, not the children too. Instead of fixing the \nproblem, and fixing it will not be easy, we only succeeded in making it \nbigger, more unstable, more complicated, and much, much more expensive.\n  The Committee for Economic Development, the Concord Coalition, and \nthe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities jointly stated that, \n``without a change in current (fiscal) policies, the federal government \ncan expect to run a cumulative deficit of $5 trillion over the next 10 \nyears.'' They also stated that, ``after the baby boom generation starts \nto retire in 2008, the combination of demographic pressures and rising \nhealth care costs will result in the costs of Medicare, Medicaid and \nSocial Security growing faster than the economy. We project that by the \ntime today's\n\n[[Page S11217]]\n\nnewborns reach 40 years of age, the cost of these three programs as a \npercentage of the economy will more than double--from 8.5 percent of \nthe GDP to over 17 percent.''\n  Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has issued warnings \nabout the dangers that lie ahead if we continue to spend in this \nmanner. In a report issued at the beginning of the year, CBO stated \nthat, because of rising health care costs and an aging population, \n``spending on entitlement programs--especially Medicare, Medicaid and \nSocial Security--will claim a sharply increasing share of the nation's \neconomic output over the coming decades.'' The report went on to say \nthat, ``unless taxation reaches levels that are unprecedented in the \nUnited States, current spending policies will probably be financially \nunsustainable over the next 50 years. An ever-growing burden of federal \ndebt held by the public would have a corrosive . . . effect on the \neconomy.''\n  So what do we do when we are faced with these problems? We pass a tax \nbill that is loaded with corporate pork.\n  This conference report is called the JOBS Act, but I think we should \ncall it what it truly is: ``the corporate tax haven act.'' I doubt it \nwill create any new jobs but it will certainly allow a few lucky folks, \nwho have extremely well paying jobs, to make even more at the expense \nof the taxpayers. I'm sure the energy corporations are pleased that \nthey won't have to wait for the energy bill to add to their over-\nflowing coffers.\n  Yesterday we passed a bill to address the issue of FDA regulation of \ntobacco products. Essentially, the consideration of a free standing \nbill to address this issue at this stage means nothing. We're supposed \nto be appreciative that the FDA bill was taken up and passed quickly--\nwe all know that passing a controversial Senate bill on a Sunday at the \nend of the session is meaningless. The House will not move the bill, \nand, even if by some miracle they did, there certainly would be no \nconference held. This is a sham--plain and simple. The Senate \nhad already addressed the issue of FDA regulation of tobacco. Sadly, \nthe conferees on the FSC/ETI bill stripped that provision from this \nconference report.\n\n  What the conferees did was unconscionable. They turned their backs on \nthe health of our nation's youth and opted to strike the DeWine-Kennedy \namendment that would have granted authority to the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, to regulate tobacco products. It is a very sad day \nfor public health. They have used the FDA tobacco authority language as \na linchpin to effectuate the passage of the underlying tax bill. It was \nnothing more than a sweetener to them and now that it is no longer of \nuse, the conferees have discarded the language, and with it, who knows \nhow many lives.\n  In striking this historically important provision, the conferees \nignored the public and medical health community, child health \nadvocates, and registered voters who in a recent poll overwhelmingly, \n69 percent favor FDA authority over tobacco. Even in the six leading \ntobacco growing states, support for FDA authority is above 65 percent.\n  Without FDA authority over tobacco, there will be no regulation of \ntobacco marketing, no information disclosure such as nicotine and \ncarcinogenic content, no requirement that can force the tobacco \nindustry to remove harmful components from their products, and no pre-\nmarket approval of ``new products'' marketed as ``safer cigarettes.''\n  Tobacco-related illnesses and deaths in this country have reached \nepidemic proportions, but according to the Surgeon General, tobacco use \nis ``the single most preventable cause of death and disease in our \nsociety.'' The Surgeon General estimated 400,000 U.S. citizens lose \ntheir lives each year as a result of a smoking-related illness. This \nfigure translates into approximately 1,200 smoking-related deaths per \nday. This loss of life has a significant economic impact accounting for \nan estimated $75 billion per year in health care expenses. Most \ntragically, however, the Surgeon General estimates that approximately \n2,000 kids start smoking every single day, and that one third of them \nwill die from a smoking-related illness.\n  I thank Senators DeWine and Kennedy for their commitment to our \nNation's youth, and I am certain that they will continue to fight for \nFDA authority over tobacco because it is simply too important not to \ncontinue to fight. We must protect the public health and hold the \ntobacco industry accountable for the production and marketing of its \nproducts, particularly as their business practices affect children, but \nI fear we have lost yet another opportunity.\n  Not only have the conferees jeopardized the health of our Nation's \nyouth by striking the FDA authority provisions of this bill, they left \nprovisions that would eliminate the quota system and channel $10 \nbillion--into the pockets of tobacco farmers--many of whom no longer \neven farm tobacco--and disguised the money as a buyout to encourage \nsuch ``farmers'' to shift their crops to something other than tobacco. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, among these ``tobacco farmers'' \nwho would benefit from a tobacco buyout are Larry Flynt and his \nbrother, who admittedly abandoned the ``blood, sweat, and tears'' of \nthe tobacco business to pursue pornography.\n  I fear that the conferees have failed to realize that, by not setting \ndomestic production restrictions, and not restricting new market \nentrants from farming tobacco, they may be creating new opportunities \nfor more tobacco farming. In doing so, they create the possibility that \na greater supply of tobacco will result in reduced prices thereby \nmaking tobacco products more accessible to kids. Studies have shown \nthat increases in the cost of cigarettes directly correlate to reduced \nyouth smoking rates. Greater youth accessibility to tobacco products \ncoupled with a lack of FDA authority over the marketing and information \ndisclosure of these cheaper products is the most invidious combination \npossible. By turning their backs on FDA tobacco authority while \nsimultaneously making it easier to grow and sell tobacco, the conferees \nmay be exposing kids--not to mention adults--to an even greater health \nrisk than they are today.\n  As if the lack of FDA language wasn't bad enough, let me go through \nsome of the other ridiculous items contained in this conference report.\n  Many provisions in this bill remind me of the golden oldies we saw in \nthe energy bill. One of the more generous tax breaks in this bill is a \ncreative provision that allows energy companies to reclassify energy \nproduction as a manufactured good in order to qualify for potentially \ntens of billions of dollars in new tax deductions. The manufacturing \ntax deduction is currently available only to traditional manufacturing \nindustries as an incentive for job creation. While this change in the \ntax code may not create manufacturing jobs, it does create a tax \nballoon, which increases to a maximum of 9 percent of a company's \nproduction income after 2009. The total estimated cost of this golden \nparachute is $76.5 billion. Other industries that will now be \nconsidered to be ``manufacturers'' are movie studios, real estate \ndevelopment, and construction companies. But the greatest share of this \ntax break will go to the oil and gas industry and electric utility \ncompanies.\n  Fear not, not all of the largess goes to oil and gas companies. There \nare equal opportunities for other corporate and special interests to \nmake profits at the expense of the taxpayers. An article in the Wall \nStreet Journal on October 6, refers to the legislation as ``a trove of \nobscure breaks and perks'' and identifies four companies in Houston \nthat were singled out for special treatment. These companies recently \nchanged their addresses to the Cayman Islands and Bermuda when the \nSenate proposed a retroactive crackdown on businesses that incorporate \noffshore to shave their U.S. tax bills. Fortunately for them, the \nprovision in this bill is no longer retroactive. Not only does the bill \nallow these companies to slip comfortably away, but others \ncontemplating such actions will be heartened by the fact that the bill \ndoesn't include a provision that would have supported Federal judges \nand the IRS in bringing companies that indulge in these improper tax \nshelters to justice.\n  This bill also contains a tax credit totaling more than $2 billion \nover 9 years for industries generating electricity from alternative \nfuel sources. Let me be clear that I support clean renewable energy \ntechnologies as a\n\n[[Page S11218]]\n\nmeans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy \nindependence, but most of these subsidized technologies aren't clean. \nNo matter how you look at it, chicken droppings simply are not a clean \nalternative fuel. Just how, exactly, does the public benefit from the \nsubsidies provided for the burning of municipal trash and poultry \nwaste, both which create significant air pollution?\n  The most outrageous provision in this section could be easily missed. \nIt defines ``refined'' coal as a qualifying renewable resource. \nAccording to the Tax Code, refined coal is just another name for \nsynthetic fuel. I would be greatly relieved if my colleagues could \ndocument that this is not the case, but it appears to me that the \nsynthetic fuel credit has been snuck in here along with so-called \nrenewable sources of electricity.\n  I have spoken before about the synthetic fuel tax credit scam that \nwas revealed by Time reporters in October 2003. It is shameful for \nCongress to perpetuate this expensive hoax, which has cost taxpayers $4 \nbillion since 1999. The IRS followed up the Time report with a November \n2003 bulletin stating, ``The Service believes that the processes \napproved under its long standing ruling (that a synthetic fuel must \ndiffer significantly in chemical composition from the substance used to \nproduce it) do not produce the level of chemical change required.'' \nIncredibly, it goes on to say, ``Nevertheless, the Service continues to \nrecognize that many taxpayers and their investors have relied on its \nlong-standing ruling to make investments.'' So, basically, we should \njust ignore the fact that chemical change isn't occurring. They should \nhave just said that if Congress wants to continue this shameful scam, \nthen the IRS will let it pass.\n  The original intent of the synthetic fuels tax credit was not sheer \nfolly. It is just that, for a variety of reasons, a synthetic fuel \nindustry never materialized in the United States. Canada invested \nheavily in synthetic fuel production over the past decades and sells \nmillions of barrels of synthetic crude oil to the United States \nannually. The only evidence of a U.S. synthetic fuel industry is this \ngigantic tax shelter. One doesn't need to be in the oil or gas business \nto strike it rich with synthetic fuels either--one of the greatest \nbeneficiaries of this tax shelter--and that is all that it is--a tax \nshelter, is a very profitable hotel chain, Marriott. This is an equal \nopportunity bill for wealthy corporate interests.\n  Wait, we can't forget ethanol! $77 million from this bill will go to \nethanol manufacturers. No tax break bill would be complete without \nsubsidies for this synthetic fuel, ethanol gasohol, created and \nperpetuated by Congress. And it all starts with corn. Ten percent of \nthe corn grown in this country is used to produce ethanol. Of course, \ncorn producers, like producers of other major crops, receive farm \nincome and price supports. In the 107th Congress, this body passed the \nFarm bill which appropriated more than $26 billion in direct assistance \nto corn-growers over 6 years. That is an average of $4.3 billion in \ndirect subsidies each year just to corn-growers!\n  In addition to the subsidies going primarily to agribusiness \ncorporations, the public pays for ethanol in other ways as well. More \nenergy is used in the production of ethanol than it provides to \nconsumers, it increases the per gallon cost of gasoline, and it results \nin environmental degradation. Finally, to add to all these insults, \nethanol subsidies increase the public's grocery costs. Subsidized corn \nresults in higher prices for meat, milk, and eggs. This happens because \nabout 70 percent of corn grain is fed to livestock and poultry in the \nU.S. Increasing ethanol production further inflates corn prices and \nsubsequently food prices.\n  So the American public provides billions to create this artificial \nmarket for ethanol, and then pays more for their groceries and what do \nthey get in return? I will tell you what they get in return--absolutely \nnothing. No reduction in petroleum fuel use. No reduction in air \npollution. There is one reduction, however, consumers are rewarded \nwith--reduced fuel economy. More gasohol must be used to go the same \ndistance as conventional fuel. So no one can honestly claim that \nsubsidizing ethanol is in the public interest or an element of sound \nnational energy policy.\n\n  Another objectionable provision is the ``green'' bond program. The \noriginal form of this provision prompted the ``hooters'' part of my \n``hooters and polluters'' reference to the energy bill. Well, the \nhooters is gone, but this program is still top-heavy with tax breaks--\n$231 million for the real estate corporations that are going to develop \nthese projects. With or without a hooters, I don't see how it's in the \npublic's interest to pay for enormous commercial facilities in three or \nfour States. These projects all sound like enterprises that can stand \nor fall on their own--they don't need the taxpayers throughout the \ncountry giving them a big boost.\n  Let me give you a sense of the ``public works'' that benefit from \nthis provision:\n\n       Destiny USA in Syracuse, NY is an entertainment and retail \n     development touted as an economic stimulus for upstate New \n     York. The primary developer has committed to 3.2 million \n     square feet of space with a price of close to $700 per square \n     foot. They estimated these green bonds would save them close \n     to $100 million.\n       Belmar in Lakewood, CO is a $500 million redevelopment of a \n     mall, which will include many restaurants, clothing stores, \n     shops, and office space.\n       Atlantic Station in Atlanta GA is a 138-acre redevelopment \n     of a former steel mill which will include 12 million square \n     feet of retail, office, hotel space, and parks.\n       Riverwalk Development in Shreveport, LA, minus the Hooters, \n     this $150 million project will feature stores, restaurants, \n     movie theaters, hotels, and entertainment spots.\n\n  These all sound like grand, money-making ventures to me--they don't \nneed taxpayer support. Pork called ``green bonds'' is still pork.\n  Some of the other notable giveaways in this grab bag of corporate tax \ndelights are:\n\n       The ``hummer in every home'' provision is still intact. It \n     is just not quite as expensive as it has been the past. This \n     provision extends the existing $100,000 tax deduction for the \n     purchase of vehicles weighing over 6,000 pounds. The original \n     intent of this deduction was to benefit farmers and other \n     business owners in need of heavy-duty vehicles. \n     Unfortunately, some individuals unscrupulously seized on this \n     loophole in order to purchase Hummers, Escalades and other \n     expensive, gas guzzling SUVs. Thankfully, due to the \n     insistence of Senator Nickles, those purchasing luxury sport \n     utility vehicles can no longer take advantage of the $100,000 \n     deduction. However, they can still take a deduction of up to \n     $25,000. This could cost our Treasury $350 million for every \n     100,000 taxpayers who take advantage of this loophole. Again, \n     it is not as bad as it used to be, but it is still too \n     expensive and should be eliminated. The cost of foreign \n     oil is about $53 a barrel. Shouldn't we, as a practical \n     matter, be encouraging the use of smaller, more fuel \n     efficient vehicles?\n       There is a tax break for ``small refiners'' of oil to \n     improve clean air standards. Unfortunately, ``small'' is \n     defined as those with refining capacity below 205,000 barrels \n     per day, so some of the large oil companies can get in on \n     this one too.\n       Three of the world's richest energy companies--BP, Exxon \n     Mobil, and Conoco Phillips--stand to be the primary \n     recipients of two tax breaks, totaling $445 million, for \n     building an Alaskan natural gas pipeline and for processing \n     natural gas for the project. Considering that these three \n     companies have enjoyed after-tax profits of $95 billion since \n     2001, the wealthy shareholders of these companies--not \n     taxpayers--should foot this bill. In addition, these three \n     companies are allowed to depreciate their natural gas \n     pipeline over seven years, costing taxpayers another $150 \n     million.\n       There is $27 million for dog and horse race tracks to help \n     lure more foreigners to gamble at U.S. horse and dog racing \n     facilities; $995 million for the treatment of aircraft \n     leasing and shipping income. This provision would provide a \n     tax exemption on income derived from an aircraft or vessel \n     leasing business.\n       There is $28 million for a cruise ship tax break. This \n     provision would allow the cruise industry to delay paying \n     taxes on airplane tickets, hotels, and other excursions it \n     sells in the United States. The delay would save the Carnival \n     Corp. $15 million, and Royal Carribean would save anywhere \n     from $8 million to $10 million.\n       There is $9 million for a tax break on archery products; \n     $11 million for a provision that would reduce the excise tax \n     on fishing tackle boxes; $44 million for the importers of \n     Chinese ceiling fans; $4 million to repeal the excise tax on \n     sonar devices that are used for finding fish; $247 million \n     for a provision that is designed to help the producers of \n     small jets and planes, 60% of which are built in Kansas. Lear \n     Jet and Cessna benefit greatly from this provision; $27 \n     million for providing tax-free treatment if farmers replace \n     livestock because of weather related conditions; $101 million \n     for NASCAR track owners; $57 million for a tax break for \n     shipping companies; $501 million for a tax credit for the \n     maintenance of railway tracks; $336 million for a tax break \n     for Hollywood studios; $234 million for a tax break for the \n     producers and\n\n[[Page S11219]]\n\n     marketers of alcoholic beverages; and $495 million for Naval \n     shipbuilders.\n\n  Where is it going to end? We have to face the facts, and one fact is \nthat we can't continue to cater to wealthy corporate special interests \nany longer. The American people won't stand for it, and they \nshouldn't--they deserve better treatment from us. I strongly encourage \nmy colleagues to vote against this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana now has 6 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I intend to use 2 minutes and yield back the remainder \nof my time to the leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, while the leaders are in the Senate with \ntheir final remarks, I take the opportunity again to thank them for \ntheir work--Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley as the leaders of the \nFinance Committee--as we work toward a very significant victory and a \nconclusion on the issue of a tax credit for the Guard and Reserve. The \nSenate is going on record again this morning, as we did several weeks \nago when this bill left the Senate, to include them in a tax provision. \nThey will not technically be included in this bill, but there will be a \nbill sent back over to the House, as we said. That would not have \nhappened without the help of Senator Baucus from Montana and Senator \nGrassley from Iowa. I personally thank them along with thanking Senator \nDurbin and Senator Boxer for their help on this original amendment.\n  We have explained it as well as we can, the arguments as to why our \nGuard and Reserve deserve our focus and attention to provide help to \ntheir families while they are serving for all Americans on the front \nline. I am so pleased we could come together as Members of the Senate \nto provide that help for them.\n  Now it is in the hands of the House of Representatives. As we return \nfrom this break, however long or short it is, we will then take up this \nissue as they decide over in the House how they would like to handle \nit. I hope they will take the bill as we have sent it, pass it, and \nthen it will go to the President's desk for immediate signature because \nwe all want to give them the help and support they most certainly are \ngiving us at this special time.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I first thank the chairman of our \ncommittee, Chuck Grassley, for the tremendous job he has done. I am \nblessed. We are all blessed to have him as chairman of our committee. \nHe is very smart. He is very perceptive. He has terrific common sense \nand is wonderful to work with. He is as straight as they come. His word \nis his bond. If he tells you something, that is it. At the same time, \nwhen we work with him, it is very cooperative. In fact, he goes \noverboard. It reminds me of ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' when the \nprotagonist, the lawyer, says: You walk around in his shoes to see that \nperson's point of view. Chuck Grassley has the uncanny trait that he \ndoes not have to take the effort to walk around in another person's \nshoes because he already knows. He has walked around in so many shoes \naround Iowa. He has common sense that is rooted in the ground. He is a \nwonderful person. We are all very grateful to have him as chairman. I \ncan say this having worked with him as the senior Democrat on the \nFinance Committee.\n  Second, I deeply thank all of our staff who helped with this \nlegislation. They have been wonderful. I ask unanimous consent to have \ntheir names printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       This legislation would not have been possible without the \n     help of many.\n       I appreciate the cooperation we received from the \n     Republican staff, especially Kolan Davis, Mark Prater, Ed \n     McClellan, Elizabeth Paris, Dean Zerbe, Christy Mistr, John \n     O'Neill, Everett Eissenstat and Stephen Schaefer, and Adam \n     Freed.\n       I thank the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and \n     Senate Legislative Counsel for their service.\n       I also thank my staff for their tireless effort and \n     dedication, including Russ Sullivan, Patrick Heck, Bill \n     Dauster, Matt Genasci, Matt Jones, Matt Stokes, Jon Selib, \n     Anita Horn Rizek, Judy Miller, Melissa Mueller, Liz \n     Liebschutz, Lara Birkes, Ryan Abraham, Wendy Carey, Tim Punke \n     and Brian Pomper. I also thank our dedicated fellows, Rhonda \n     Sinkfield, Scott Landes, Justin Bonzey, Jodi George, and \n     Cuong Huynh--and our dedicated law clerk Jeremy Sylestine.\n       Finally, I thank our hardworking interns: Mary Tuckerman, \n     Kelsie Eggensperger, Paige Lester, Priya Mahanti, Brittney \n     McClary, and Audrey Schultz.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Finally, my greatest thanks are to the people of the \nState of Montana. I express my gratitude and thanks to the people of \nMontana for sending me here as their representative. I will never \nforget the people I work for. They are my bosses. They are my employers \nand the best anyone could ever have. I know each Member feels that way \nabout his or her State. I am blessed to be able to represent Montana.\n  Frankly, it is for that reason that, preparing for this bill last \nyear, my staff and I spent a lot of time in Montana meeting with \nworkers and owners of businesses all across our State. We visited over \n140 companies, 8 accounting firms and law firms, 11 economic \ndevelopment organizations in Montana. We spoke with about 60 companies \nover the phone, asking them what they thought about this legislation. \nHow are Montana companies and interests affected by this bill? I simply \nwanted to know the biggest problems facing Montana businesses, I wanted \nto know what is working for them and what is not working for them, and \nI wanted to make sure that the manufacturing deduction in this bill \nwill work for Montanans. Obviously, they had a lot of concerns.\n  People in my State, as in many States, are worried about job \nsecurity, health security, and economic security. Will they have jobs \ntomorrow? Will their jobs be cut because business is slow? What about \nhealth insurance coverage with health care costs going up? Will their \nbusinesses be able to grow and compete with foreign competition?\n  We learned that any bill targeted to just corporations--that is, the \nstandard corporation called C corporations--leave out most Montana \nbusinesses. That is because in Montana most businesses do not operate \nas conventional corporations. They work as partnerships or other \nenterprises that report their income not on a corporate basis but an \nindividual income tax basis.\n  We needed a broader definition of manufacturing to ensure that \nMontana farmers and ranchers got some tax relief. That is what we are \nenacting in the bill.\n  I thank the hard-working men and women of Montana. Carlyle once said: \nAll work is noble.\n  I thank the hard-working men and women of Montana for their help in \nformulating this legislation. I thank them for supporting me as we \nadvanced this bill. And I thank them for their hard work in the \nbusinesses they run. So it is to them today we dedicate this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Kentucky, our \nwhip, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today is a truly historic day for my \nState, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Burley tobacco production has been \na part of our way of life going back to 1792 when Kentucky joined the \nUnion. Tobacco itself--there are tobacco leafs painted in various \nplaces here in the U.S. Capitol--was the most important export product \nfrom the Colonies, predating the formation of our country.\n  Over the last 40 years, we have come to understand that the use of \ntobacco products is certainly not good for our health. More Americans, \ncorrectly, are choosing not to use tobacco products. Consumption has, \ntherefore, declined, as, frankly, it should.\n  Back in the 1930s, when tobacco was still at its peak but we were in \na national Depression, during the New Deal\n\n[[Page S11220]]\n\na Federal tobacco program was created. After that program was enacted \ninto law by President Roosevelt, employees from the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture went around and surveyed the farms in Kentucky and \nTennessee and Virginia and the Carolinas and Georgia to find out what \ntheir historical production had been and assigned those what we now \ncall quotas to the land.\n  That quota was like an asset. It could be sold. It could be leased. \nIt was an asset attached to the land. And that quota had in some early \nyears grown but, of course, over the last few years it dramatically \ncontracted. That asset was on its way to becoming worthless, many \npeople felt, in my State.\n  To give you a sense of how pervasive tobacco has been in the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky, when I came to the Senate some 20 years ago, \nwe grew it in 119 of our 120 counties. We had 100,000 producers. The \naverage base then was about three-quarters of an acre. So you had a lot \nof people in our State who got some income off burley tobacco. It \nprovided for many families a significant portion of their income. For a \nwhole lot of other families, because of the auction warehouse system \nunder which it was sold in the fall, it provided Christmas money for \nthe family, a second income, an opportunity for some extras. For a lot \nof other Kentuckians, it was very much a basic part of their income.\n  Well, all this is in the process of changing. Six years ago, I \nadvocated a buyout. At that time that was controversial in my State. In \nfact, I think a majority of the tobacco farmers thought I was in the \nwrong position. That certainly was the view of the Kentucky Farm Bureau \nand the burley council and the burley co-op, all of whom thought I was \nin the wrong position.\n  A few years later, I noticed I was then being treated as a visionary \nwho was ahead of my time and had sensed that this thing was heading in \nthe wrong direction and we better try to figure out some way to achieve \na buyout or we would never get an opportunity.\n  A lot of people have contributed to this day. This buyout that is in \nthis bill is not paid for by the taxpayers. And it is, indeed, a \nbuyout. It terminates the program. The program is entirely terminated \nand off the books. People who vote for this bill will be able to say, \namong other things, that they ended the Federal tobacco program.\n  It is paid for by a manufacturer's fee, which will no doubt be passed \nalong to the consumers. And as public health advocates will tell you, \nthe higher the cost of tobacco products, the fewer the number of people \nwho will use them. So it even has a public health aspect to it.\n  That is the version of the buyout, $10.1 billion over 10 years. That \nis in this underlying bill.\n  Mr. President, as I say, today is a historic day for Kentucky and \nother tobacco producing States that have suffered for far too long \nunder a Government program that destroyed their assets, sapped their \ncompetitiveness, and destabilized their communities.\n  The tobacco buyout included in this legislation is culmination of \nmany years of hard work and difficult sacrifice.\n  Kentucky has long been known for its three ``B''s: Bourbon, \nbasketball, and burley tobacco. Burley tobacco has been the lynchpin of \nKentucky's agricultural economy since Kentucky first became a State in \n1792.\n  Since the early years of the Commonwealth, burley tobacco provided a \nsteady and reliable income for farmers with small patches of land \nunsuitable for the production of other crops. There are virtually no \nother crops that can provide the return per acre that tobacco \nproduction does, and it has a unique place in the economy and the \nculture of Kentucky.\n  However, in recent years, increased foreign competition combined with \ndecreased consumption, increased taxation, and a broken Federal tobacco \nprogram created a perfect storm that had the potential to bring about \nan economic disaster of epic proportions for Kentucky.\n  The passage of this buyout will end the Federal tobacco program and \nend the suffering caused by this outdated program. The buyout will pay \nowners of quota for what remains of their disappearing asset, and it \nwill provide assistance to growers to help them move into other forms \nof agricultural production.\n  Those that choose to continue to produce tobacco will do so without \nthe price supports or Federal programs that support other crops. They \nwill have to compete on the free market. However, without this buyout, \nthey would not have been able to compete at all.\n  This is indeed a great day for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. But, no \nproject of this magnitude is undertaken alone, and there are many \npeople to whom I am grateful.\n  Many people deserve thanks for bringing us to the day we experience \ntoday. I thank Chairman Grassley. I know he, as indicated, was not in \nfavor of this, but this was part of the compromise worked out in the \nconference.\n  I particularly thank Chairman Bill Thomas over in the House, who did \nsupport it and aggressively advocated it, helped work with us to craft \na final version.\n  I particularly thank Richard Burr from North Carolina, who was on the \nconference and a particularly significant player in this whole process.\n  Here in the Senate, I thank Senator Elizabeth Dole, whose tireless \neffort on behalf of farmers in North Carolina is truly inspirational. I \nthank her staffer David Rouzer, who also worked for Senator Helms, for \nbeing a critical part of all of this. Senator Helms, of course, was so \nmuch associated with tobacco over the years.\n  I also thank Senator Bunning and Congressman Lewis of my State. I \nthank my own staff, former staffers Mason Wiggins and Hunter Bates, who \nin the early days were extremely important in this. I thank my chief of \nstaff Billy Piper, Scott Raab, and Michael Zehr, my agriculture aid. \nThey were all indispensable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before I yield to my friend from \nLouisiana, I would like to say how much I personally deeply appreciate \nand will miss the Senator from Louisiana. I don't know any Senator who \nworks harder on a bipartisan basis to get things done than the Senator \nfrom Louisiana. He is amazing. He has so many talents.\n  Now, maybe he is partly Cajun, I don't know, but it is that Louisiana \nstuff that enables him to see more, do more, be more creative, think of \nmore ideas than the rest of us mortals in the Senate. He is amazing. He \nis always thinking, always working. Many times in the Finance Committee \nI look over to the Senator from Louisiana and he is there working. He \nis reading reams of briefing materials. He has his magic marker out and \nhe is underlining and learning this stuff. And he knows it so well.\n  There are many areas he does know so well. One is health care. He \nknows health care intricacies probably better than anybody else in this \nbody. He has worked with it on several commissions. He cares \npassionately about reforming our health care system.\n  Tax policy, Social Security, you name it, if it is before the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee, he is very knowledgeable about \nit. He also, frankly, wants solutions. It is not just that he has \nknowledge and is very smart, but he is looking to try to find \nsolutions, looking for compromises, looking for ways to get things \ndone.\n  We are going to sorely miss him; I mean sorely. I do not know what we \nare going to do without him because he is a catalyst, not the only \ncatalyst but one of the major catalysts, here to get agreements, to get \nsolutions. We all know how partisan this place is. He is one of those \nwho is cutting against the grain to try to do what is right, do what is \nright for Louisiana, do what is right for the country, getting a \npractical solution: Come on, let's get something done here that makes \nsense. You may not like it totally, you may not like it completely, \nbut, heck, you all know this is more than half a loaf, it is three-\nquarters, seven-eighths of a loaf, so it is certainly better than no \nloaf. So come on, let's get something done here.\n\n  He is wonderful. I want him to know how much I am personally going to \nmiss him.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S11221]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see the senior Senator from Louisiana \non the floor. I know he will want to respond in a moment. I so \nappreciate the comments from the Senator. But I would like to add, very \nbriefly, that as you have spoken about the senior Senator from \nLouisiana, the great consensus builder that he is, and helping us to \nmove very important pieces of legislation, always with the greatest \nsense of dignity and principle, I want to say, as his partner in the \nSenate, I could not have a better partner. He is a person who works in \nsuch a complementary way with me. We work well together, and it is \nbecause of the great spirit he brings to his work. I think because of \nhis spirit, we have been a better team together than we are \nindividually for our State. I learned that from him. I want to give him \nso many compliments this morning and thank him for his great service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator, one final \npoint. I know he had a hard time deciding whether to retire, a very \nhard time. I spoke with him several times. I did not want to prejudice \nhim or bias him: Is there some way I can help John make this decision? \nAnd I mean that in the best sense of the term because, of course, I \nwant him to stay.\n  On the other hand, I didn't want to influence his decision. I wanted \nhim to do what is best for him. Because it was such a hard decision, \nthat to me is very strong evidence again of the deep public service \nspirit and desire he has. He loves public service, serving the public \nas well as Louisiana but specifically the country generally.\n  He decided there are other things in life besides the Senate. I will \nnot get into that subject. I don't think that is a subject on which \nvery many of us want to tread. But we deeply appreciate the friendship, \nthe legislative talents of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I was going to talk about the tax bill, but after the \nkind words of both the distinguished ranking member and my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, just let me say a very sincere thank you to both for \ntheir very generous comments. I will remember and cherish them always.\n  Russell Long told me one time, when I asked him about a tax bill they \nwere working on over in the Senate--at the time, I was a relatively \nvery young Member of the House--I said: Russell, that thing doesn't \nlook very pretty. He said: It is not supposed to look pretty; it is \nsupposed to be effective, and that is not necessarily pretty.\n  This bill probably represents that. It is not everything everybody \nwould like to have, but it is effective tax policy. The chairman, the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and Senator Baucus have worked very \nhard under very difficult circumstances to bring this measure to the \nSenate. It was not an easy task. A lot of compromises had to be made. \nThe House, led by Chairman Bill Thomas, was very strong in its \npositions and opinions. The fact that we have a final product goes a \nlong way to the good work of both the chairman and the ranking member.\n  To my colleague from Louisiana, I was not here over the weekend, but \nshe was handling the floor very well and was insisting on her point, as \nshe always does, very eloquently. Hopefully, ultimately she will get \nwhat she deservedly should get as a result of her efforts with regard \nto protecting the National Guard. This fight is far from over. I will \nhave more, perhaps in a lameduck, to say about what I think about this \nbody and how much I have loved it, how much I will always remember it \nduring our period of time in our lameduck session. But to Senator \nBaucus and my colleague, Senator Landrieu, I thank them very much. They \nhave both been a guide for me in learning the Senate Finance Committee, \nwhich has been a wonderful place to serve.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today is a historic day in the world of \ntax policy. We are about to pass the most significant reform of \nAmerican business taxation since 1986. I am not talking about large \ncorporate reforms. This bill contains some of the most important small \nbusiness reforms in years. This bill represents the most comprehensive \nagricultural, small business, rural community tax incentive package \never written by Congress. The bill contains far-reaching measures to \nrevive the manufacturing base in America by cutting taxes and creating \nincentives to invest and create jobs in the United States. This \nmanufacturing tax goes to large and small corporations, family-held S \ncorporations, partnerships, sole proprietorships, farmers, and co-ops.\n  This is the football season. With apologies to the Senate's chart \nexpert, my colleague from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, I am going to use \none last chart for this bill. This chart behind me is about the \nfootball. It is a chart that I used about 7 months ago. During that \ntime, spring drills were about the only football activity. The chart \nshows several sets of goalposts. As this important bill has wound its \nway through the legislative process, at each stage the goalposts were \nmoved and moved and moved. Sometimes we had to call timeout. But at \neach stage we held on to the ball. We had an overtime regulation \ngoalpost. We had a trade adjustment assistance goalpost. We had an \nunemployment insurance goalpost. Those were Senate floor goalposts. We \npassed each goalpost. Then we got to conference. In conference we ran \ninto the Food and Drug Administration tobacco buyout goalpost.\n  We have passed the final goalpost now. In this bill we had to go \nstraight over the tackle, and we did, just like good old-fashioned Big \nTen football. I will see the Senator from Minnesota the last Saturday \nof November. We are finally now in the end zone.\n  Now I would like to thank the team that got us over the goal line. \nThe first is Senator Baucus. I am certain that we would not be here \nwithout his good work and cooperation. In addition, I thank all other \nmembers of the Senate Finance Committee for their time and energy in \nmaking this bill a reality.\n  I would like to point out a special thanks to a couple senior members \nof the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Nickles and Senator John \nBreaux.\n  Senator Nickles has been a Finance Committee member since 1995. He \nhas left a big impact on trade, tax, health care issues that have come \nbefore the committee. He and I have not always seen eye to eye on all \nissues, but he is a hard-working, tenacious Member of the Senate. He \ntakes the work of the committee seriously.\n  Senator Breaux has been on the Senate Finance Committee since 1990. \nHe succeeded Senator Long in the Senate. Senator Long was a legendary \nmember of the Finance Committee, the longest serving chairman it has \never had, a major architect of much tax legislation. Senator Long left \na legacy on the Finance Committee. Senator Breaux followed up on the \nlegacy of Senator Long, taking the practical, constructive, and \ncreative approach of Senator Long. Senator Breaux has blazed his own \ntrail on the Senate Finance Committee.\n  In many cases, the Senate is paralyzed by partisan politics. I am \nproud that the Finance Committee is still a workshop of bipartisan \nproblem-solving. Senator Breaux has been a key element at that \ncontinuing bipartisan tradition. Hopefully, the Democratic caucus, \nwhich has been steadily moving to the left over the years, will replace \nhim with a like-kind pragmatist. The country will be better off for it.\n\n  Over the last couple of years, the States of Oklahoma and Louisiana \nhave been well represented on the Finance Committee. Unfortunately, \nthere will be a bit of a vacuum with the departure of Senators Nickles \nand Breaux. I am pleased that this bill contains many priorities of \nthese two Senators. For Senator Nickles, there was the depreciation \nchange that he has fought for over the years. For Senator Breaux, \nimportant priorities for his State of Louisiana included significant \nchanges in the tax treatment of key Louisiana interests such as \nagriculture, aquaculture, energy production, shipbuilding, forestry, \nand shipping. It is a fitting tribute to these two members of the \nFinance Committee.\n  We are also saying goodbye to Senator Bob Graham of Florida. Senator\n\n[[Page S11222]]\n\nGraham has been on the Finance Committee since 1995. In the 1990s, \nSenator Graham was also a bipartisan bridge builder on tax and trade \nissues. Senator Graham faithfully attended to Florida's interests \nduring his service on the committee.\n  I thank also Senator Frist for backing me all the way on this bill. \nHe took months to get it to the Senate floor. At times many of our \nRepublican caucus questioned whether it was worth the price of \nunrelated controversial amendments that were thrown our way. Our leader \nstayed the course. I appreciate that very much.\n  I would like to thank my staff on the Senate Finance Committee as \nwell: Kolan Davis, our staff director; Mark Prater, chief tax counsel, \nand the other tax counsels--Ed McClellan, Elizabeth Paris, Dean Zerbe, \nChristy Mistr, and John O'Neill, as well as John's predecessor, Diann \nHowland. These individuals, along with Adam Freed, the staff assistant \nfor the tax team, have been the workhorses for the committee--keeping \nthe lights burning long into the night to make this bill possible.\n  Finally, thanks go to the hard-working interns and law clerks. I \nrefer to Casey August, Grant Menke, and Peter Jordan. Grant took the \nsummer off to call balls and strikes as an umpire in the New York-Penn \nleague. Grant helped us with this bill in the spring and returned in \ntime for the conference.\n  Let me extend my thanks also to George Yin and the staff of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation for providing guidance in this effort. I want to \nparticularly point out the good work of Ray Beeman, David Noren, and \nGray Fontenot. The Finance Committee tax staff refers to this trio of \nspecialists as the ``three amigos.'' The three amigos helped us find a \nlot of gold out there in corporate loophole land. Brian Meighan \nrecently left the three amigos for the private sector.\n  I would like to thank the leadership staff for all their assistance. \nFrom Senator Frist's staff, I thank Lee Rawls, Eric Ueland, Ronit \nKumar, and Libby Jarvis. I also thank our Senate leadership team and \ntheir staffs, especially our able whip, Senator McConnell.\n  Finally my thanks to go Jim Fransen, Mark Mathiesen, Mark McGunable \nand their capable staff at legislative counsel for taking on our ideas \nand drafting them into statutory language. These talented lawyers are \nthe true wizards of the legislative process. They handle enormous \npressure with professionalism and amazing dexterity.\n  I invite everybody to relax a bit today. After the vote tonight, \neveryone should go home and get a good night's sleep. As for me, now we \nare getting ready to wrap up. I am looking forward to going home to \nIowa. It is harvesttime in the fields. I have some work to do on the \nfarm. We also have a bit of an election coming up. God willing, the \ngood folks of Iowa will send me back here to continue to do the \npeople's business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 4520.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Military Construction bill is a \nvery important bill this year. Senator Feinstein, the ranking member, \nand myself as chairman of the committee wanted to talk about its \nimportance.\n  This is a bill that focuses on the quality of life for our military \npersonnel and also makes sure they have the family housing and training \nfacilities they need.\n  In addition to our Military Construction bill, this is the disaster \nsupplemental. This is the bill that was chosen to provide help for \nhurricane victims in Florida and drought relief for our farmers. Also, \nthe Alaska pipeline that is so important to the economy of our country \nas well as to the economy of Alaska is in this bill. I am very pleased \nwe were able to produce a bill that encompassed all of these very \nimportant items at the close of this very important session.\n  There is in the military construction conference report $4.5 billion \nfor active components construction and $9.45 million for Guard and \nReserve construction. It is important that we increase the quality of \nthe training facilities for our Guard and Reserve. Senator Feinstein \nand I made a point of doing that during this conference because we felt \nthe Guard and Reserve is way behind in keeping up with the training \nfacilities they need and for the job we are asking them to do. They \ncertainly deserve it.\n  We increased funding for military housing and worked with the defense \nauthorization committee to make sure that the privatization cap was \nlifted--a very important step for the quality of housing for our \nmilitary personnel.\n  I am very proud of this bill. I am proud that we are meeting the \nmilitary construction needs. I am proud we were able to provide for the \nneeds of Florida in their disaster recovery efforts and also the \ndrought that has actually been funded for not only the present drought \nin certain parts of our country but droughts in the past in Texas and \nother places where the money has run out.\n  I am proud of this bill. I thank my ranking member, Senator \nFeinstein, for her help and valuable assistance in making this happen.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the conferees on the \nfiscal year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations bill have reached \nagreement, and I would like to say a few words about the bill.\n  The conference report includes important funding for the \nreconstruction efforts in States affected by recent hurricanes and \nassistance for agricultural producers suffering from drought and other \nnatural disasters.\n  First, let me address the military construction portion of the \nagreement. While the President's budget request was $9.55 billion, only \n2.5 percent over last year's enacted level, the conference report \nprovides $10 billion for military construction and family housing \nprograms for fiscal year 2005.\n  These new facilities are crucial to the well being of our troops, \nespecially at a time when our active and Reserve forces are, along with \ntheir families, being asked to make enormous sacrifices for our \ncountry.\n  The conference report also provides $11.6 billion in disaster \nassistance, including $8.8 billion for hurricane-related relief which \nis designated as emergency spending and $2.8 billion in assistance for \nagricultural producers suffering through drought and other natural \ndisasters, which is offset by a cap on spending for the Conservation \nSecurity Program.\n  I think we all recognize the importance of this assistance package, \nbut I am disappointed that the majority insisted on treating \nemergencies in different part of the Nation unequally.\n  Drought relief for farmers in the Midwest and across the Nation is no \nless important than hurricane relief in the Southeast and should not \nhave required an offset from the Conservation Security Program.\n  Offsetting this funding hobbles the effectiveness of one of the most \nimportant environmental programs in the Department of Agriculture.\n  I was also concerned that the package requested by the President \nleapfrogged Federal Highway Administration assistance for damage done \nby the hurricanes ahead of the backlog of projects required to repair \ndamage from past disasters.\n  However, this concern was addressed by an agreement to fully fund the \nbacklogged emergency relief program in the pending omnibus bill.\n  Chairman Hutchison indicated at the conference that Speaker Hastert \nand Majority Leader Frist have committed to fully fund the States that \nneed this assistance, and I appreciate their help on this issue.\n\n  There are currently $752 million in projects that have not been \nfunded, even though they have already qualified for emergency relief.\n  California alone has over $240 million in projects that have not been \nfunded. I appreciate Chairman Young's willingness to rectify this \nsituation and look forward to the emergency relief funding program \nbeing funded in the omnibus.\n  The conference agreement also includes Senator Stevens' provision on \nthe Alaska Natural Gas pipeline.\n  Senator Stevens has worked for the past few years to authorize \nfunding for this pipeline, and I am pleased that we could get this done \nfor the senior Senator from Alaska.\n  The provision authorizes the construction of a pipeline from Prudhoe \nBay, AK, to the lower 48, with a dedicated supply of natural gas to \nCalifornia.\n  The provision provides Federal loan guarantees to whatever entity \nbuilds/ decides to build the pipeline, as Senator Stevens requested.\n  The demand for natural gas in this country is growing exponentially, \nparticularly in my State of California. Natural gas prices have risen \ndramatically over the past several years, from $2 per thousand cubic \nfeet in 1998 to over $7 just this week.\n  We need more natural gas, and I hope that Senator Stevens' provision \nto bring Alaska natural gas down to the lower 48 states and \nparticularly California will help meet that demand.\n  Mr. President, while I would have preferred to pass the Military \nConstruction bill without the contentious issues surrounding this \ndisaster assistance package, I support this conference report and hope \nmy colleagues will do the same.\n  Finally, I want to thank Senator Hutchison for the manner in which \nshe handled this process. I have long admired her integrity and her \nleadership in reaching this agreement was outstanding.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. It has had some hiccups along the \nway. One of them, of course, was the House put in the disaster relief \npackage and had the signatures and would have eventually rolled us in \nconference.\n\n[[Page S11224]]\n\nHowever, Senator Hutchison said that we would have another conference, \nthat she would not do this, and she kept her word. That is a very big \nthing in this body, that if you give your word, keep your word, and she \ndid. I am very grateful for that.\n  Because of this conference we were able to receive an amendment from \nthe Senator from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, on drought relief. It \nwas defeated, but then we were able to pass the bill without rancor and \nwithout a sense that in the dark of night the Democratic side had been \ndone in.\n  I am very proud to say that I think it is a good bill. I want to give \nSenator Hutchison credit for that. She kept her word. That is a very \nbig item.\n  I thank Senator Hutchison, and I appreciate the time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I could just say thank you. I am \nvery humbled by the remarks of the Senator from California and \nappreciate very much her recognition. Her leadership also got a \ncommitment and will be in a colloquy regarding the highway funds that \nwill also be attached to this report. The Senator from California and \nmyself and other States took a back seat to the Florida highway needs \nafter the hurricane, but we got assurances from the Speaker, the \nmajority leader of the Senate, and the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee on the House side that we would address this issue and get \nthe funds for previous emergencies from the highway fund back into the \n39 States that gave them up for Florida to receive help right now.\n\n\n            federal highway administration emergency relief\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and General \nGovernment, I rise to discuss a matter of great importance to my State \nand 33 other States--namely, the continuing backlog of claims for the \nFederal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief program.\n  The Military Construction Appropriations conference report that we \nare currently debating includes a title containing emergency disaster \nassistance. Within that title, a total of $1.202 billion is made \navailable for the Emergency Relief Program. This appropriation carries \nwith it the necessary language designating the funding as emergency \nspending.\n  While I support the overall funding for the Emergency Relief Program, \nI strongly object to the bill language governing this appropriation. At \npresent, there are 90 projects from a total of 34 States that have been \nwaiting to receive emergency relief funds for road projects stemming \nfrom Presidentially declared disasters. A great many of these projects \nstem from disasters that took place years ago and those States have \nbeen waiting an inordinate length of time for reimbursement. Despite \nthis fact, the language governing the appropriation contained in this \nconference report effectively places the needs stemming from the four \nrecent hurricanes as well as one hurricane that took place 2 months ago \nto the head of the list. This language makes the $1.2 billion in the \nbill available only for those five hurricanes and then stipulates that, \nif there is any funding remaining after those needs are met, that \nremaining funding can be used for the projects on the backlog list.\n  To my knowledge, we have never allowed certain natural disasters to \nget preferential treatment over other disasters under this program. And \nthis new precedent will work a hardship on my state and a great many \nothers. My State of Washington is still waiting for reimbursement of \nsome $19.4 million stemming from six separate disasters dating as far \nback as the Nisqually earthquake in February 2001. The same can be said \nfor 33 other states that are also owed varying amounts.\n  Based on my objection and those of several other Senators, I \nunderstand that there have been a series of discussions among the \nappropriate congressional and administration leaders to set forth a \nplan on how this backlog of emergency relief claims will be addressed \nin the near future. This plan was discussed during the conference \ncommittee deliberations on the military construction bill so I would \nwelcome the comments of the managers of that bill on this matter.\n  Mrs. HUTCHINSON. I thank my friend from Washington for raising this \nissue. I share her concern that the existing backlog of emergency \nrelief projects has not been adequately addressed under the disaster \nassistance title of this bill. Indeed, my State of Texas is still \nwaiting to receive at least $17.2 million from no fewer than seven \nseparate disasters including floods, hurricanes and ice storms dating \nall the way back to the end of calendar year 2000.\n\n  During our conversations leading up the final conference meeting on \nthis bill, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. \nYoung of Florida, assured me that an agreement had been reached on this \nmatter between himself, the Speaker of the House and our majority \nleader. Under that agreement, sufficient emergency funding will be \nprovided in the final omnibus appropriations bill for this year to \nensure that the existing backlog of projects will be fully compensated. \nI made mention of this agreement during our open conference committee \ndeliberations and I want to assure my friend from Washington that our \nmutual concern over this matter will be addressed fully in the final \nomnibus appropriations bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I too wish to thank the Senator from \nWashington for raising this critically important issue. Indeed, no \nState has been more disadvantaged than my own by the decision to target \nthe available emergency relief funding in this bill largely if not \nexclusively to the recent hurricanes. That decision was not made by the \nconferees on the military construction portion of the bill. Rather, it \nwas made by the full committee leadership. As such, I am grateful to \nthe subcommittee chairman, Senator Hutchison, for working with her own \nleadership and Chairman Young in gaining their assurance that these \noutstanding emergency relief claims will be fully funded in this year's \nomnibus appropriations bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the managers of the bill for their attention to \nthis matter and I'm pleased that they have received assurances that \nthis problem will be addressed fully in the omnibus appropriations act. \nFor the interest of all Senators, I ask unanimous consent that the most \nup-to-date backlog list provided to me by the Federal Highway \nAdministration be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 CURRENT EMERGENCY RELIEF PROGRAM FUND REQUESTS\n                                           [Updated 10/4/04 8:00 a.m.]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                   Amount         Subtotal  by\n                  State                                  Event                    Requested           State\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlaska...................................

Mr. President, I am pleased to recommend approval by the \nSenate of the fiscal year 2005 Military Construction appropriations \nconference report, which contains emergency supplemental appropriations \nneeded by States seeking Federal funding from the disaster relief fund \nadministered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n  On September 8, the President signed into law $2 billion in \nsupplemental appropriations for FEMA. Since then, the President has \nmade 3 more requests for funding for various departments within the \nGovernment. Today we are responding to those requests and including \n$6.5 billion in emergency funding which will return the balance of the \ndisaster relief fund to a healthy level. This is in addition to the $2 \nbillion supplemental the Congress provided immediately following the \ndevastation caused by Hurricane Charley. Additional appropriations for \nFEMA's disaster relief fund cannot wait because the balance of this \nimportant program has again been depleted to a dangerously low level \nfollowing three additional hurricanes and other natural disasters.\n  This funding will not only be needed by the victims of recent \nhurricanes in the southeast but will also be used for the several \nhundred repair projects and mitigation activities across the country \nresulting from every other federally declared disaster of the past few \nyears. I have been assured by the Department of Homeland Security that \nthese funds are sufficient to cover the current needs of our Nation's \ndisaster victims and I support this funding.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Friday night, as Senators headed home \nafter the final vote of the day, the House-Senate conference on the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill reached its conclusion. With \nthe conferees in agreement, all that remained to be\n\n[[Page S11226]]\n\ndone on that bill was to file and pass the conference report.\n  But work on that bill did not stop there. In the dead of night, the \nleadership intervened in the conference to jam an additional $11.6 \nbillion funding package onto that bill. The Senators who served on that \nconference committee didn't know what hit them. This disaster \nsupplemental was never considered, debated, or voted on by the Senate. \nSenators never had a chance to examine or weigh in on this spending.\n  Appropriations for disaster relief to address the problems resulting \nfrom the four recent hurricanes are undoubtedly required. However, \nthere are extensive backlogs of unfunded needs resulting from earlier \ndisasters that are not addressed at all in this relief package. This \nbill fails to provide the funds to address the $752 million backlog for \n34 States in the emergency highway program or a $128 million backlog \nfor 43 States in the USDA debris removal programs. In 43 States, the \ndebris from past floods and other disasters has yet to be cleaned up. \nSo, the next time a flood comes rolling down the valley, the water will \nhave no place to go, making the damage even worse. What kind of a \nshort-sighted policy is that?\n  Sadly, our President and administration seem to only be able to focus \non the immediate crisis. By all means, we should provide the $11.6 \nbillion of assistance to the victims of the four recent hurricanes. But \nwhy has the President shown no interest in helping the communities hit \nby past disasters in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, or California? \nThe Federal Government owes just those four States over $307 million. I \nsimply do not under why this so-called compassionate President can \ntreat the victims of disaster in one State differently than victims in \nother States.\n  The military construction conference report also includes $2.9 \nbillion in emergency assistance for farmers experiencing crop losses \ncaused by natural disasters, such as drought conditions, hurricanes and \nother disasters.\n  It is a worthwhile effort for the Congress to assist the Nation's \nfarmers in their time of need. However, the same relief package \nincludes an onerous provision which decreases another farm aid program \nby nearly $3 billion to pay for the drought disaster aid. In short, \nthis disaster relief package robs Peter to pay Paul. While it increases \naid to farmers with one hand, it takes it away with the other.\n  This is no way to run the United States Senate. I signed the \nconference report for the military construction aspect alone. That \nfunding went through normal procedures. It was debated and voted on by \nboth Houses, and it was subject to bipartisan negotiations in \nconference.\n  I commend the two managers of this bill for their perseverance in \nfollowing regular order to the great extent that they did. The managers \nwere under great pressure from the Republican leaders of Congress to \ncut a backroom deal in the dead of night, simply to allow members of \nthe House to leave town before the Senate.\n  The managers stuck to their guns and insisted that the conferees meet \nagain in open session to consider the whole package. This is as much as \nthey could do in the face of the majority leadership. The managers of \nthe military construction bill held as firm as they could against the \narm-twisting of the Republican leaders. But the deck was stacked, and \nthe leadership never intended to allow the Senate a moment of debate on \nthis spending package. It was just jammed in at the last minute.\n  In this respect, my refusal to sign the conference report, except for \nthe military construction aspect, reflects my solidarity with the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, and his battle to implement the \nConservation Security Program, which he authored as part of the 2002 \nfarm bill. It is unfair for this Senator to have to keep fighting for \nthe survival of this program year after year before. Any Senator who is \nfamiliar with the difficult decisions a farmer must make to operate a \nsuccessful business knows that when a farmer decides to commit to the \nconservation practices required by this important environmental \nprogram, that farmer is making a long term commitment. But year after \nyear, the Republican majority tries to shackle this program with new \nlimits. How can a farmer make a long term commitment to conservation \nwhen the rules keep changing?\n  I hope that the Senate will return to its prior way of doing \nbusiness, when the regular order was followed and the rights of all \nSenators, including those in the minority, were fully protected. Such \npractices serve this institution well. It promotes respect among \nMembers and quells unnecessary disputes.\n  The leadership of the Senate would do well to turn away from the \nincreasingly common gambit of trying to jam legislation down the \nthroats of Senators at the last possible moment. It is most unfortunate \nthat the Republican leaders chose to pursue this tactic on spending \nthat is intended to help countless Americans recover from recent \ndisasters.\n  It is some small consolation that the Senate has recognized its \nobligation to the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, by agreeing to adopt a \nconcurrent resolution relating to the enrollment on the fiscal year \n2005 military construction appropriations bill. This concurrent \nresolution, if adopted by the House, would have the effect of deleting \nthe onerous offset against the Conservation Security Program that the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, and others find so offensive. The \nconcurrent resolution would, in contrast to the FY 2005 military \nconstruction appropriations bill, substitute language similar to that \nemployed with regard to the hurricane disaster aid, thus making the \ndrought aid to farmers an emergency without an offset.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today that the Senate \nwill accept by voice vote the fiscal year 2005 Military Construction \nAppropriations Conference Report.\n  The conference report includes important funding for the \nreconstruction efforts in States affected by recent hurricanes and \nassistance for agricultural producers suffering from drought and other \nnatural disasters.\n  First let me address the military construction portion of the \nagreement. While the President's budget request was $9.55 billion, only \n2.5 percent over last year's enacted level, the conference report \nprovides $10 billion for military construction and family housing \nprograms for fiscal year 2005.\n  These new facilities are crucial to the well being of our troops, \nespecially at a time when our active and reserve forces are, along with \ntheir families, being asked to make enormous sacrifices for our \ncountry.\n  The conference report also provides $11.6 billion in disaster \nassistance, including $8.8 billion for hurricane-related relief which \nis designated as emergency spending and $2.8 billion in assistance for \nagricultural producers suffering through drought and other natural \ndisasters, which is offset by a cap on spending for the Conservation \nSecurity Program.\n  I think we all recognize the importance of this assistance package, \nbut I am disappointed that the majority insisted on treating \nemergencies in different parts of the Nation unequally.\n  Drought relief for farmers in the Midwest and across the Nation is no \nless important than hurricane relief in the Southeast and should not \nhave required an offset from the Conservation Security Program.\n  Offsetting this funding hobbles the effectiveness of one of the most \nimportant environmental programs in the Department of Agriculture.\n  I was also concerned that the package requested by the President \nleapfrogged Federal Highway Administration assistance for damage done \nby the hurricanes ahead of the backlog of projects required to repair \ndamage from past disasters.\n  However, this concern was by an agreement to fully fund the \nbacklogged emergency relief program in the pending omnibus bill.\n  Chairman Hutchison indicated at the conference that Speaker Hastert \nand Majority Leader Frist have committed to fully fund the States that \nneed this assistance, and I appreciate their help on this issue.\n  There are currently $752 million in projects that have not been \nfunded, even though they have already qualified for emergency relief.\n  California alone has over $240 million in projects that have not been \nfunded. I appreciate Chairman Young's willingness to rectify this \nsituation and look forward to the emergency relief funding program \nbeing funded in the omnibus.\n\n[[Page S11227]]\n\n  The conference agreement also includes Senator Stevens' provision on \nthe Alaska Natural Gas pipeline.\n  Senator Stevens has worked for the past few years to authorize \nfunding for this pipeline, and I am pleased that we could get this done \nfor the senior Senator from Alaska.\n  The provision authorizes the construction of a pipeline from Prudhoe \nBay, AK, to the lower 48, with a dedicated supply of natural gas to \nCalifornia.\n  The provision provides Federal loan guarantees to whatever entity \ndecides to build the pipeline, as Senator Stevens requested.\n  The demand for natural gas in this country is growing exponentially, \nparticularly in my State of California. Natural gas prices have risen \ndramatically over the past several years, from $2 per thousand cubic \nfeet in 1998 to over $7 just this week.\n  We need more natural gas, and I hope that Senator Stevens' provision \nto bring Alaska natural gas down to the lower 48 States and \nparticularly California will help meet that demand.\n  While I would have preferred to pass the Military Construction \nconference report without the contentious issues surrounding this \ndisaster assistance package, I support this conference report and I am \npleased that my colleagues have agreed to accept it.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Hutchison for the manner in which she \nhandled this process. I have long admired her integrity and her \nleadership in reaching this agreement was outstanding.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to focus the attention \nof the Senate on the recent devastation to many nations in the \nCaribbean as a result of a half a dozen hurricanes and tropical storms \nin the autumn of this year, 2004.\n  More than a thousand people have perished; many are still missing. \nThousands of families are homeless and jobless. Non-governmental \norganizations such as the International Red Cross, the United Nations, \nand religious organizations, rushed to the scene with relief aid and \nvolunteers to help the survivors. The United States Government has sent \nU.S. AID teams to assess the damage. Early estimates reveal hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of physical damage to homes and businesses. On the \nIsland of Grenada industries have been completely wiped out. There are \nriots in the streets of cities in Haiti where stockpiles of \nnonperishable food and potable water are diminishing fast.\n  In April, 2001 President Bush instituted the ``Third Border \nInitiative'' that anticipated a quick response by our government that \nwould, in his words, ``. . . fund disaster preparedness and mitigation \nefforts to shield critical commercial and environmental infrastructure \nfrom natural disasters, such as hurricanes.'' This is important because \nit signals a focus not only on emergency assistance, but on trying to \nreduce the amount of damage caused by future hurricanes. In other \nwords, the President was also signaling a welcome focus on rebuilding \nhomes and businesses in a manner that is resistant to potential damage \nby hurricanes. These types of buildings would also reduce the dreadful \ndeath toll of future hurricanes.\n  We have an opportunity to aid our friends and partners in the \nCaribbean. The administration has attached a $50 million request for \nthe Caribbean to a larger package of help for Florida and other States \nin the South hit by the rolling series of storms this summer and fall. \nOur colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives have requested an \nadditional $50 million, so the total is $100 million for the Caribbean. \nSecretary Colin Powell recently visited Grenada and stated that the \nfirst aid will come in phases, starting with an emergency shipment of \nfood, medicine, construction materials and other supplies, about a \nquarter of which will go to Grenada.\n  It is at this time that we have an opportunity to thoughtfully help \nthe region. As Secretary Powell said, ``. . . that help was needed not \nsimply to repair homes and schools, but also to restore the economic \ninfrastructure of the country.'' He went on to say that, ``experts had \nbegun discussing `creative suggestions' for how Grenada could diversify \nits agricultural output. . . .'' I agree with Secretary Powell that the \ntime has come to try to better spend our assistance dollars. As is the \ncase with weather disasters, economic disasters also ruin the hopes of \nfamilies. As long as we are helping in the rebuilding efforts, we \nshould try to make more permanent improvements in infrastructure.\n  The region needs many ``creative suggestions'' for its redevelopment. \nAt the University of Vermont, the students and faculty have made many \nsuggestions, from agriculture and food processing to sustainable \npermanent modular housing solutions utilizing recycled materials. One \nappropriate solution has been devised by world acclaimed architect Adam \nKalkin. It is the Quikbuild Modular System. An example of this unique, \nsustainable housing solution is on display in the permanent collection \nof the Shelburne Museum, in Shelburne, Vermont.\n  This type of dwelling utilizes recycled cargo containers, many of \nwhich are being shipped down to the region with a full load; they will \nremain there empty without the cargo to fill them; and with no place to \nship them. Each is an ecological disaster waiting to happen. They also \npresent a great opportunity if we take advantage of using them.\n  Recycled containers may be converted into durable, sustainable, \nwater-tight, hurricane-proof dwellings that can be used as permanent \nhousing as well as field kitchens, medical triage units, schools, \ndormitories, as well as structures for commercial businesses and \nmeeting places. Ten percent of the funds we provide should be for these \nmore permanent housing solutions. It is imperative that the community \nplanners consider mid-range and long-term solutions today as they \nmanage the ``first response'' mission. We have seen in many regions \naround the globe that well-intentioned temporary and transitional \nhousing ultimately becomes permanent housing. Priorities shift, money \nruns out and a new disaster knocks the old disaster off the front page. \nThe inherent nature of shanty towns, full of permanent refugees, takes \naway the dignity and hope of their inhabitants.\n  I have received pleas from the family members residing in the United \nStates to help their loved ones. I have received a strong request from \nthe Ambassador of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Ambassador \nMarina Valere, on behalf of the affected nations imploring us to also \nthink about permanent housing solutions, that also respects their \nunique and fragile ecosystem. This request made clear that some portion \nof the aid package should be set aside for this purpose. Our friends in \nthe Caribbean need permanent, safe, secure dwellings otherwise this \ncrisis will repeat itself, year after year.\n  In addition to urgent emergency aid, America should help the \nsurvivors in the Caribbean to rebuild their communities with permanent \nhousing solutions as well as rebuild their respective \neconomies.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, with reservations I support passage \nof the conference report to the fiscal year 2005 Military Construction \nAppropriations Act. This bill provides $10 billion in funding for \nimportant military construction activities including base housing as \nwell as the construction and maintenance of base infrastructure.\n  When we passed the Senate version of this legislation, I declared \nthat this appropriations bill was a good example of how the legislative \nprocess is expected to work, wherein the work of the authorizers is \nfully taken into account by the appropriators. The legislation was \nrelatively free of earmarks and riders that were not related to \nMilitary Construction. However, during the conference, a legislative \nrider that has no business in an appropriations bill found its way into \nthe conference report.\n  I am referring to the section of the conference report that \nauthorizes a $18 billion loan guarantee program for the construction of \nan Alaska natural gas pipeline. This authorizing provision is found in \nneither the House nor the Senate version of this legislation, yet with \ncharacteristically little attention, it has found its way into the \nconference report. Once again, it pays to have powerful members of the \nAppropriations Committee representing your State or district.\n  Congress has a legislative process that has two separate tracks for \nauthorization and appropriation. Merging\n\n[[Page S11228]]\n\nthese tracks and eliminating the essential discourse and deliberation \nnecessary to establish sound public policy is not in the Federal \ntaxpayers interest. Nevertheless, here we are again, faced with the \nnecessity of approving appropriations for military construction with an \nenormous pork program attached at the last minute. All the more \nproblematic is that this same piece of legislative text was included in \nthe failed energy bill. The Senate rejected this provision then, but we \nare unable to do it again, as it was snuck into a conference report on \na totally unrelated bill. It is a clear violation of the legislative \nprocess, specifically Rule 28, and it's simply wrong.\n  My objections to the Alaska pipeline provision are not only \nprocedural. Many of my colleagues may not be aware that what they are \napproving here is an economic cushion for three extremely wealthy \ncorporations. Undoubtedly, these three corporations have the financial \nresources to proceed with this project without taxpayers' dollars, but \nonce again, we will manage to provide generous financial incentives to \ncorporate interests with public funds. These selective subsidies are \nclearly inequitable and contrary to the interests of the rest of \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  The sponsor of this provision may maintain that the American public \nwill benefit from the natural gas supply that may flow through this \npipeline years from now. Undoubtedly, if the supply is there, the \nconsumers will be, too. And that is my point. This is an economic \nventure that will yield significant profits for those companies \ninvolved. It is my understanding that as a result of the financial \npromise of this venture that there are other companies that would very \nmuch like to be involved. What this provision does is to codify the \nterms set by these three corporations to provide an even sweeter \nopportunity with $18 billion in federally backed loan guarantees.\n  These loan guarantees are the thick rich icing on the tax break cake \nincluded in the FSC-ETI conference report, which also passed today. Tax \nbreaks totaling $445 million are provided for pipeline construction and \ngas processing, again directed to the same corporations, which together \nhave shown after-tax profits of $95 billion since 2001. I am certain \nthat American taxpayers do not appreciate paying twice for their \nexpensive energy supplies. Once at the pump and for their home heating \nbills, and then again for tax subsidies to profitable energy subsidies.\n  Also contained in this legislation is funding for drought assistance. \nI sympathize with the proponents of this agricultural disaster \nassistance and I do not question that drought and abrupt changes in \nclimate are having a severe impact on the crops grown in the states \ncovered in this conference report. While I do agree that prolonged \ndrought and other natural disasters are having devastating effects on \nmany Americans and sectors of our economy, crop assistance does not \nbelong on Military Construction funding legislation.\n  When the Senate considers legislation to address drought-induced and \nother climate damages, shouldn't all affected states receive \nassistance? How are we to say that one group of people or sector of our \neconomy deserves financial assistance over another? According to the \nCongressional Research Service, Congress provided about $3 billion in \nassistance for crop and livestock losses in 2001 and 2002. Coupled with \nall the other billions in agricultural subsidies, American taxpayers \ncould conclude that Congress has determined, without clear \ndeliberation, that this is the priority need.\n  There are many States, including Arizona, that are facing terrible \ndrought-induced problems and do not receive assistance in this \nconference report. Destructive wildfires have spread through the \nWestern United States because of the dry conditions there, causing \nbillions of dollars in property and resource damage. Drought-induced \ninsect infestations have increased wildfire risks to our communities \nand natural resources. Water levels in reservoirs in our parched states \nhave dropped dramatically, reducing water supplies, causing millions of \ndollars in losses to the recreation and tourism industries and reducing \nhydropower generation. In some areas, the lack of precipitation and \nwater supply recharge, has resulted in wells running dry. I can't think \nof a more disastrous situation than that. However, the people who fall \ninto these categories are not covered by the drought assistance \nprovisions.\n  I have found this report contains 62 earmarks totaling $98.7 million. \nI am also troubled by a provision in the explanatory statement that \naccompanies this conference report. According to the explanatory \nstatement, ``The language and allocations set forth in House Report \n108-607 and Senate Report 108-309 should be complied with unless \nspecifically addressed to the contrary in the conference report and \nstatement of the managers.'' This has the composite effect of \nessentially doubling the number of earmarks in the Military \nConstruction Appropriations Act. As legislators we are often forced to \nmake difficult budgetary decisions. However, in the instance of this \nconference report, the most difficult decisions were avoided. With \nlooming budget deficits, it is as important as ever to practice fiscal \nresponsibility and avoid the practice of earmarks.\n  The above statement ensures all $44.7 million in earmarks added by \nthe Senate as well as the $38.5 million in earmarks contained in the \nHouse version of this legislation. As I stated when we considered that \nlegislation, nearly all of these earmarks are funded under the minor \nconstruction account. Normally, this account is intended to be used for \nurgent and unforeseen requirements and therefore neither the \nPresident's budget nor the authorizing committees identify specific \nprojects to be funded. Once the Services decide to spend the money, the \nauthorizing and appropriations committees must approve or disapprove of \nthe minor construction project to which the Services plan to fund. By \nearmarking the funds in the minor construction account, the \nappropriators have usurped the authority of the authorizing committee \nto approve or reject these projects. I can only hope that next year, \nwhen the appropriators stray from this practice.\n  With the passage of the conference report to the fiscal year 2005 \nDefense Authorization Act, the legislative branch has once again \naffirmed its support for the important round of base closure and \nrealignment that will occur next year. With this being an election year \nand Member's parochial concerns being as strong as ever, I am \nencouraged to see that my colleagues have resisted the temptation to \nadd pork to bases in their states in what would be a misguided effort \nto save their bases from base closure. Such efforts would be a waste of \ntaxpayer money, and would not prevent their base from being closed.\n  I commend the chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee, \nSenator Hutchison, and the ranking member, Senator Feinstein, for their \nhard work on this bill and their continued support for our military. \nTheir attention and commitment to only supporting high priority \nprojects for the Navy, Marine Corps, Army, and Air Force is once again \nexemplary and provide for a sound measure to fund military construction \nin the coming fiscal year. I only wish they were able to hold to the \nSenate version of this legislation and were able to keep extraneous \nnon-military construction provisions out of this conference \nreport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4567, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report accompanying (H.R. 4567), making \n     appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture is vitiated.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present for the Senate's \napproval today the conference report on H.R. 4567, the fiscal year 2005 \nHomeland Security Appropriations Act.\n  The conference agreement provides total new budget authority for the \nDepartment of $33.1 billion. Of the amount provided for fiscal year \n2004, $32 billion is for discretionary programs.\n  To further strengthen the capacity of the Nation's first responders \nto prepare for and respond to possible terrorist threats and other \nemergencies, this conference report provides a total of $3.9 billion \nfor the Office for State and Local Government Coordination and \nPreparedness, including: $1.1 billion for the State and local formula-\nbased grant program; $400 million for law enforcement terrorism \nprevention grants; $885 million for high-threat, high-density, urban \narea grants; $150 million for port security grants; $150 million for \nrail and transit security grants; and $715 million for the firefighter \nassistance grant program, of which $65 million is set-aside to begin \nimplementing the SAFER Act. The conference report also includes a \nseparate appropriation of $180 million for emergency management \nperformance grants.\n  The conference report includes a total of $5.1 billion for the \nTransportation Security Administration, furthering our commitment to \nsecure all modes of transportation. The conference committee made air \ncargo security a priority and provides $115 million for air cargo \nsecurity, an increase of $30 million from the President's request. This \nfunding will allow the Department to enhance its efforts to target and \nprohibit the transportation of high-risk cargo on passenger aircraft; \nas well as to advance efforts to research, develop, and procure the \nmost effective and efficient air cargo inspection and screening \nsystems. In addition, there is a statutory requirement for the tripling \nof cargo inspections on passenger aircraft.\n  Additionally, $8.8 billion is provided to secure our Nation's \nborders; $5.5 billion is provided for emergency preparedness and \nresponse; $7.37 billion for the Coast Guard; and $2 billion for \nresearch, analysis, and infrastructure protection. To increase rail \nsecurity the conference report provides $172 million for rail \ncompliance inspectors; canine explosive detection teams; rail, freight, \nand transit security grants; vulnerability assessments; and research \nand development of technologies to prevent suicide bombers. A total of \n$662 million is provided for the Federal Air Marshals, $50 million more \nthan the requested amount.\n  A matter of concern to some of my colleagues are the items funded \nthrough the offset provided by the extension of the customs user fees. \nThe largest single item that was funded through this mechanism was \nspeeding up the development and deployment of permanent airwings across \nour northern border. Unfortunately, once the customs user fee extension \nwas dropped from this bill, we lost the offset available to enhance \nfunding for these important items and not exceed the fiscal constraints \nplaced on our subcommittee.\n  The conference committee met on Thursday, October 7, 2004, and the \nconference report was filed on Saturday, October 9, 2004. It was \nadopted by the House of Representatives later that day by a vote of 368 \nyeas to zero nays. Senate passage of this conference report today will \nsend this fiscal year 2005 appropriations bill to the President for \nsignature into law.\n  In closing, I thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, my \ncolleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd; the chairman of the House \nsubcommittee, Mr. Rogers; and the ranking member of the House \nsubcommittee, Mr. Sabo, for their substantial contributions to this \nbill throughout the year. It has taken many hours of hard work by these \nMembers and their staff members to bring this bill to a successful \nconclusion. I would also like to thank the chairmen ranking members of \nthe House and Senate full Appropriations Committees and their staff \nmembers for the assistance and guidance they have provided to us \nthroughout the process.\n  I recommend the adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President. I thank Chairman Thad Cochran, the House \nchairman, Harold Rogers, Representative Martin Sabo, Representative \nDavid Obey, and all of the House and Senate conferees for their hard \nwork on this important legislation. We all share the goal of ensuring \nthat the new Department of Homeland Security has the resources it needs \nto secure the homeland.\n  I also commend the thousands of men and women who are on the front \nlines of homeland security. While I remain very concerned that we are \nnot giving these men and women the tools they need to do their jobs, \nthat in no way detracts from their commitment to serve the Nation every \nhour of every day.\n  It is particularly appropriate for us to be considering this \nlegislation as Congress reviews the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission. The President, the Vice President, the Attorney General, \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, the FBI Director, and the CIA \nDirector invoke the threat of another terrorist attack on an almost \nweekly basis. The 9/11 Commission concluded that on September 11, 2001, \nour government agencies were not prepared to deter or respond to such \nattacks. We are still not prepared to deter or respond to such attacks.\n  In light of all of these threats, one might anticipate that the \nPresident would have amended his anemic 2-percent proposed increase for \nthe Department of Homeland Security. One might have anticipated that \nthe President,\n\n[[Page S11230]]\n\nour war President, would have requested increased appropriations for \nsecuring our mass transit systems, for screening airline passengers for \nexplosives, for inspecting more containers coming into our ports, for \nincreasing inspections of air cargo, or for increasing the number of \nFederal Air Marshals. Sadly, this President talks the talk when it \ncomes to homeland security, but when it comes to doing the hard work of \nmaking the Nation more secure, the President takes a walk.\n  The conference report that is before the Senate provides $33.1 \nbillion, a level that is $896 million above the President's request. \nThis is an increase of only 5-percent over the levels approved by \nCongress last year, only 5-percent. At a time when our war time \nPresident and his entire administration is telling the Nation to expect \nanother attack, we are approving what is essentially a status-quo \nhomeland security bill.\n  The conference report that is before us does make several modest \nimprovements to the President's budget. In response to the Madrid \nbombings and threats of similar attacks here at home, we include \nfunding for mass transit and rail security. We increase funding for \nport security. We do more to secure air cargo on passenger aircraft. \nThe bill begins to invest in technologies to screen airline passengers \nfor explosives.\n  While these are important improvements, regrettably, the conferees \nwere simply not given sufficient resources to address serious gaps in \nour security that we all know exist.\n  I am particularly disappointed that the Senate majority leader \nchanged his mind and acquiesced to a demand from the Speaker that the \nconferees drop the customs user fee extension and the $784 million of \nhomeland security spending that the Senate approved last month. The \nfunding that was stripped from the bill is vital to the security of \nthis Nation. Not one Senator objected to adding the additional funding \nbecause it provides needed investments to protect our borders, equip \nfirst responders, enhance air and rail security, hire more Federal Air \nMarshals, and secure nonprofit institutions that are threatened by \nterrorists.\n  The 9/11 Commission report includes recommendations to deploy \nexplosives detection equipment at our airports, to address the \ncommunications interoperability problem, to focus homeland security \ndollars based on the greatest risk, and to secure non-aviation targets. \nThis bill simply does not do enough to respond to these \nrecommendations.\n  Mr. President, time and again, Senators on this side of the aisle \nhave tried to plug the holes in our Nation's security. We have worked \nto address some of the most basic, and most dangerous, holes in our \nprotections from another terrorist attack. But at virtually every turn, \nthe President and the Senate majority tell us no. The American people \nare told no. Why? It costs too much. It costs too much to protect the \npeople's lives. It costs too much to close our borders. It costs too \nmuch to screen cargo on our airplanes and to check passengers for \nexplosives. It costs too much to save lives.\n  This Administration has repeatedly warned that it isn't a question of \nif another terrorist attack will happen, but when. Unfortunately, I \nthink that the Administration has failed to heed its own warning. By \nfailing to support a significant investment in homeland security, by \nignoring the gaps that we all know exist, the White House foolishly is \ngambling with the lives and the safety of the American people.\n  However, we have done the best we can with the limited resources that \nhave been given to us and I urge Senators to support its passage. \nFinally, I want to thank the staffs of the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee. Both Chairman Cochran's staff and my staff have worked \ndiligently this year to produce this important legislation. We had an \nexcellent series of hearings this year that I believe helped the \nsubcommittee to produce a bill that contains significant improvements \nto the President's request.\n  Again, I urge Members to support the conference report.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to state my intention to vote for \nthe conference report to the fiscal year 2005 Homeland Security \nAppropriations Act because communities and first responders across our \nNation desperately need the funds provided in this legislation.\n  I want to express my extreme disappointment, however, with many \nprovisions in this conference report, and with the decision by the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate and House to fail to improve the \nconference report language, and in some cases making it even worse, \ndespite having many opportunities to do.\n  It is hard to know where to begin, but three aspects of this bill are \nespecially egregious; they defy common sense and are simply not in the \nbest interest of our Nation's homeland defense.\n  First, in outright defiance of recommendations of the National \nCommission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, the 9/11 \nCommission, and of commissions before it, the leadership inserted \nlanguage into this conference report that requires the Department of \nHomeland Security to allocate homeland security formula grant funds, \nsuch as funds under the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the \nLaw Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Grant Program, on a per capita \nbasis. This is directly contrary to the recommendations of the National \nCommission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  Specifically, in its report, the 9/11 Commission stated:\n\n       We understand the contention that every state and city \n     needs to have some minimum infrastructure for emergency \n     response. But federal homeland security assistance should not \n     remain a program for general revenue sharing. It should \n     supplement state and local resources based on the risks or \n     vulnerability that merit additional support. Congress should \n     not use this money as a pork barrel.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission also recommended that an advisory committee be \nestablished to advise the Secretary on any additional factors the \nSecretary should consider, such as benchmarks for evaluating community \nhomeland security needs. As to these benchmarks, the Commission stated \nthat ``the benchmarks will be imperfect and subjective, they will \ncontinually evolve. But hard choices must be made. Those who would \nallocate money on a different basis should then defend their view of \nthe national interest.''\n  In short, the Commission made unequivocally clear that the current \nmethod of allocating federal homeland security resources, i.e., on a \nper capita basis alone, must be changed.\n  Indeed, just a couple of weeks ago, \n9/11 Commission Chairman Kean stated:\n\n       We have recommended very strongly that homeland security \n     funds should be distributed according to assessment of risk, \n     and not simply by population or pork barrel or any other way. \n     Our understanding is that that recommendation, which is a \n     very important one to us, is not moving, and that other \n     people are saying that we should now remove the discretion \n     that Governor Ridge has now over those funds and mandate that \n     it be only by population. That would fly totally in the face \n     of our recommendations. We feel very strongly that the best \n     ways to distribute those funds are by the proper assessments \n     of risk.\n\n  Not only did the 9/11 Commission recommend that such changes be made \nin how Federal homeland security funds are allocated, but commissions \nbefore it, such as the Homeland Security Independent Task Force of the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations, chaired by former Senator Warren, have \nstrongly recommended it as well. Indeed, the Rudman Commission stated \nmore than a year ago that ``Congress should establish a system for \nallocating scarce resources based less on dividing the spoils and more \non addressing identified threats and vulnerabilities. . . . To do this, \nthe federal government should consider such factors as population, \npopulation density, vulnerability assessment, and presence of critical \ninfrastructure within each state.''\n  Moreover, the Senate just last week passed landmark legislation, the \nNational Intelligence Reform Act, which contains the Homeland Security \nGrant Enhancement Act of 2004, which the Senate passed by voice vote as \nan amendment to the intelligence bill.\n  The Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of 2004, originally \nintroduced by Senate Governmental Affairs Committee Chairwoman Collins, \ncontains a number of good provisions, but among the most important is \none that requires the majority of Federal homeland security grant funds \nintended for State and local governments\n\n[[Page S11231]]\n\nto be allocated based on threat and risk and other factors rather than \non the basis of population alone.\n  This legislation was the result of almost 2 years of work in the \nSenate. Legislation that calls for threat-based funding has also been \nintroduced by House Select Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Cox, \nwhich has been included in the intelligence reform legislation that the \nHouse of Representatives just passed.\n  In short, the language in the conference report to the Fiscal Year \n2005 Homeland Security Appropriations Act reflects an utter disregard \nfor the hard work performed over years by members of the Senate and \nHouse as well as the expert evaluations and recommendations of the 9/11 \nand Rudman Commissions.\n  For the sake of our Nation's homeland defense, I hope that the \nCongress will soon act on the conference report to the intelligence \nreform legislation that has now initially passed both the Senate and \nHouse. Both the Senate and House bills direct that homeland security \nfunds for States and local communities be allocated based on threat and \nother factors. Then, the tremendous wrong in this conference report \nthat was done to our Nation's homeland defense will be made right.\n  Second, this conference report actually includes less funding for our \nNation's first responders for fiscal year 2005 than was appropriated \nfor our fire fighters, police officers, EMTs and other first responders \nin fiscal year 2004, less funding for this year than last year, and at \na time when the threat of terrorist attack against many of our \ncommunities, especially the City of New York, and our Nation as a whole \nremains.\n  This conference report has less funding for the State Homeland \nSecurity Grant program, less funding for the Law Enforcement Terrorism \nPrevention Grant program, less funding for the FIRE Act, and less \nfunding specifically for high-threat urban areas.\n  Lastly, much of the improvements that the Senate made to the homeland \nsecurity appropriations bill during the Senate's initial consideration \nof the bill were stripped from the conference report by the House \nRepublican leadership. And when the conferees had the opportunity to \nremedy this egregious mistake by supporting an amendment by Senator \nByrd to restore $784 million in cuts, that amendment was defeated.\n  As the conference report itself states, the conference agreement \ndeletes section 518 of the Senate-passed bill, which included $200 \nmillion in additional funding for the Northern Border Air Wing, so that \nthe air wings across our border can be appropriately operated; $50 \nmillion for nonprofit organizations that are at greater risk of \nterrorist threats; $50 million in additional critical funding for FIRE \nAct grants, and $50 million for Emergency Management Performance \nGrants.\n  Though I am disappointed with other provisions either contained in \nthis bill, or missing, I am pleased that the conference committee \nincluded language from an amendment I sponsored to include funding for \nthe firefighters and police officers of New York City.\n  Specifically, I commend the conferees of both the House and Senate \nfor requiring the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide \n$4,450,000 for Project Liberty pursuant to the request of the Governor \nof New York. We know that $25,000,000 remains unexpended, and \nunobligated, at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and I know they \nwill respond to the direction of the Appropriations Committee to speed \nthese funds to New York.\n  We owe these heroes every penny available for mental health \ncounseling. Our firefighters and police officers have been receiving \nthis counseling since losing so many of their brothers, sisters, \nfriends, and family members in the attacks. Our firefighters and police \nofficers have had to cope with the unimaginable and yet they stand \nstrong on the front lines to protect the homeland.\n  The men and women of the New York City Fire Department and New York \nCity Police Department, their families, and retirees, have helped this \ncountry cope with the tragic losses of that day, and this Congress has \nsent a clear message that we stand with them in helping them cope with \ntheir own losses.\n  I will continue to do whatever I can in my capacity as a Senator from \nNew York to make sure our firefighters and police officers receive the \nfunding they need not only in the area of mental health counseling but \nin all areas of homeland security.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the conference report before the \nSenate today includes an important provision that will put a stop to \nthe ill-advised attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to \nprivatize jobs that are vital to keeping Americans safe. The conference \nreport prohibits DHS from spending money to process or approve the \nprivatization of Immigration Information Officer, Contact \nRepresentative, or Investigative Assistant positions. The House voted \nfor this exact amendment earlier this year by a vote of 242-163, with \n49 Republicans supporting it. The Senate voted 49-47 for this language. \nDuring the meeting of the conferees, both the Senate and House \ndelegations voted in favor of this language.\n  Immigration Information Officers, IIOs, are responsible for screening \napplications for immigration benefits for fraud, and for performing \ncriminal background checks on applicants. There are more than 1,200 \nIIOs and Contact Representatives around the nation, working for the \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, CIS, branch of DHS. The work they \ndo in attempting to discover and prevent immigration fraud--and prevent \ndangerous people from abusing the immigration system--is clearly \n``inherently governmental,'' making them an inappropriate target of a \nprivatization effort.\n  As our Nation continues to face the threat of terrorism, CIS carries \na heavy burden in its attempt to process immigration and naturalization \napplications while ensuring that terrorists--along with other \nfraudulent actors--do not abuse our immigration system. Information \nOfficers have played a vital role in meeting this burden. Indeed, the \nagency's own job description requires that IIOs have the ``[s]kill to \nidentify fraudulent documents in order to prevent persons from \nappealing for benefits for which they are not eligible,'' a skill that \nis obviously all the more important in this era. They are also required \nby DHS to have ``[k]nowledge and skill in interviewing techniques and \nobservation of applicants in order to determine if an applicant is \nmisrepresenting the facts in order to appear eligible for a benefit.'' \nWeeding out potential fraud in our immigration system must remain a \nresponsibility of government employees, especially when the perpetrator \nof the fraud may be a dangerous criminal or terrorist. This conference \nreport will ensure that is the case.\n  I have a personal interest in this issue because about 100 fine \nVermonters currently work as IIOs. I know the fine work they do, and I \nknow that my staff and indeed all of our staffs rely on them and their \ncounterparts throughout the country when we are seeking to help our \nconstituents. I know that our Nation will be better off because these \nfine men and women will remain in their current positions.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support the passage of \nDepartment of Homeland Security appropriations bill. This bill \naccomplishes in large part what must continue to be this Nation's first \npriority--protecting our country from terrorist attack.\n  This bill funds essential national programs which protect our \nborders, our aviation security, our ports, our emergency management \nassistance, and our critical infrastructure, such as nuclear power \nplants. In addition, the bill funds essential programs that do not only \nprotect us, but also prepare our States and communities should we be \nfaced with an emergency. These grant programs support our firefighters \nand other first responders whom we rely on in times of need.\n  The State Homeland Security Grants enable the States to organize \ntheir first responders and communications systems to respond to a \nterrorist attack. Further, the Urban Area Security Initiative \nrecognizes that our largest cities, such as Milwaukee, have special \nneeds given their large populations that require more directed \nassistance.\n\n[[Page S11232]]\n\n  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to support the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill today and I am encouraged that we are \ndoing what we can to protect our Nation.\n\n\n                   FEMA and faith based organizations\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I commend the leadership of the chairman \non this important disaster relief bill.\n  In the context of this Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA \ndisaster assistance bill, I want to express my appreciation for recent \nFEMA policy updates for disaster relief to faith-based organizations. \nThese ongoing challenges and tragedies provide FEMA an opportunity to \nmake certain that they are implementing these policies in a manner \nconsistent with the President's policy which includes faith-based \norganizations among those community-based organizations helping on an \nequal basis in these hurting communities.\n  On December 12, 2002, President Bush announced, ``I have directed \nspecific action in several Federal agencies with a history of \ndiscrimination against faith-based groups. FEMA will revise its policy \non emergency relief so that religious nonprofit groups can qualify for \nassistance after disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes.'' FEMA \nacted quickly to serve eligible religious groups, issuing policy \nstatement 9521.3 concerning Private Non-Profit Facility Eligibility to \nprovide guidance in delivering future grant awards.\n  In the words of the former FEMA Director Joe Albaugh, ``Disasters \ndon't discriminate, and neither should our response to them.'' The \nadministration recognized this important principle in the case of the \nSeattle Hebrew Academy. The academy's main building was rendered unfit \nafter it was damaged in the Nisqually earthquake of 2001, but the \nacademy's first application for FEMA relief was denied. After the \nAcademy entered a legal challenge, the Office of Legal Counsel at the \nDepartment of Justice entered an opinion on September 22, 2002, which \nstated, in referring to FEMA's original denial, ``We believe that the \nActing Regional Director's reading of 44 C.F.R. section 206.221 (e) is \nnot the better interpretation of that regulation.'' This is a \ncommonsense policy of fair treatment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor highlighting the importance of community-based organizations, \nincluding faith-based organizations, in disaster assistance efforts. I \nalso concur that religious organizations should not be excluded when \nthey are victims of disasters. I concur with the Senator that FEMA \nshould continue to see that faith-based organizations are treated \nfairly in accordance with the President's policy and for the benefit of \nthose in need in times of crisis.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Specter, I \nwish to express my appreciation to Senator Cochran, chairman of the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, for bringing out of \nconference $25 million in assistance for 501(c)(3) nonprofits \n``determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security to be at high-risk \nof international terrorist attack.'' I know this was difficult to \nachieve because the House bill did not have a similar item and due to \nthe loss of the customs users fees as a funding mechanism for our \nSenate provision.\n  There are a number of compelling reasons for dedicating homeland \nsecurity funds to nonprofits. First, nonprofits provide vital health, \nsocial, community, educational, cultural, and other services to \nmillions of Americans every day. Second, if nonprofits are forced to \ndivert funds to cover the entire cost of security measures, those funds \nwill deplete resources for vital human services, including capacity to \nrespond to disasters. Third, intelligence reports and the 9-11 \nCommission Report indicate some nonprofits are among the most \nvulnerable, highest risk institutions. Fourth, nonprofit institutions \nof all types serve as gathering places for millions of American \ncitizens every day of the year, and finally the security needs of the \nnonprofit sector have been largely unmet.\n  This assistance is intended for basic security enhancements to \nprotect American citizens from car bombs and other lethal terrorist \nattacks. This assistance is not intended for facility construction; \nrather, it is intended to be used for installation of equipment such as \nconcrete barriers, blast-proof doors, Mylar window coatings, security \nfences and hardened parking lot gates, as well as associated training.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence has stated that al-Qaeda has \nturned its attention to ``soft targets.'' Terrorists' willingness to \nattack soft targets of all types has been made readily apparent with \nattacks in the United States, England, Canada, Israel, Spain, Germany, \nIraq, Tunisia, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt, and Turkey, including an \ninternational Red Cross building, synagogues, schools, and cultural and \ncommunity centers.\n  It is my intention, as sponsor with Senator Specter of the Senate \nprovision, that the Secretary should issue regulations to ensure that \nsuch funds are disbursed in a manner that ensures basic assistance for \nthe maximum number of institutions and are dedicated to protecting \nAmericans operating or utilizing nonprofits from international \nterrorist attacks and are not used for other purposes.\n  Once again, I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman, my \ngood friend Senator Cochran, and my distinguished colleague Senator \nSpecter, on their assistance with this vital initiative to protect our \nNation's nonprofits.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 4567.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11232-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TO REAUTHORIZE THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to discuss with the Democratic \nleader the appointment of conferees to S. 2845, the 9/11 legislation.\n  I am so proud of the Senate's work on this legislation as anything we \nhave done these past 2 years. Chairman Collins, ranking member \nLieberman, and all Senators did a superb job in moving this bill \nforward.\n\n[[Page S11233]]\n\n  There was no partisanship in their Committee and they developed a \nbill that has been endorsed by both the 9/11 Commissioners and many of \nthe family's personally affected by the 9/11 attack.\n  The Democratic leader and I have worked closely together throughout \nthis process, and I appreciate his leadership and cooperation. Now I \nhope we can complete the process by appointing conferees today and \nreaching a final agreement with the House as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader for his kind words and for \nhis exemplary work on this bill. Both the process and substance of the \nSenate bill reflect upon the best traditions of the Senate, and the \nLeader deserves enormous credit for that.\n  Our side wants to appoint conferees and send a bill to President Bush \nas quickly as possible. But many on our side have concerns about what \nwill happen when we meet with the House.\n  The Senate bill passed by a 96-2 margin. It was, as you said, a model \nof bipartisan cooperation from start to finish. And every Republican \nSenator voted for S. 2845.\n  The House followed a different approach. Virtually every House \nRepublican just voted against the bill that every Republican Senator \nvoted for. So this could be a difficult conference.\n  In addition, many on our side are concerned over the pattern that's \nemerged in conferences with the House.\n  Almost a year ago Republican and Democratic Senators reached a \nconsensus on an omnibus appropriations bill. But when we went to \nconference, that consensus gave way to the House demand that their \nposition prevail. So Senate position on overtime, country-of-origin \nlabeling, and other issues were dismissed.\n  Earlier this year the Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation \ndealing with our Nation's pension system; the House passed a bill that \nhad no bipartisan consensus.\n  In that conference there was one outstanding issue regarding multi-\nemployer pensions. And despite the bipartisan consensus in the Senate, \nthe House again demanded that the Senate position be dropped. And it \nwas.\n  Just last week, we had a conference on the FSC bill. This bill passed \nthe Senate almost unanimously. But on critical issues dealing with FDA \nregulation and overtime provisions, the House conferees succeeded in \ndemanding that the House position again prevail.\n  So there is considerable apprehension on our side what will happen in \nthis conference if the House again demands that its position be \naccepted. All of those previous bills were important, but I think we \nall would agree that nothing is more important than making our country \nsafe from attack. We have to get this bill right and the Senate bill \ndoes that.\n  Mr. FRIST. I have a markedly different view than Senator Daschle \nabout some of his legislative history, but I understand his concern.\n  We do have to get this bill right and our side is committed to that. \nWe have to work together in conference just as we worked together in \nthe committee and on the floor. I have talked with Senator Collins, who \nwill lead the Senate conferees, and she has agreed that she will not \npursue a conclusion to the conference, nor sign any conference report, \nthat undermines the bipartisan working relationship that has existed in \nthe Senate.\n  If changes are made to the Senate bill, they will be the result of \nthe mutual, good-faith effort to reach agreement among Senate \nconferees. Moreover, the Democratic leader has my commitment that \nshould the process break down due to disagreements over either \nsubstantive matters or extraneous provisions, then I will not bring a \nconference report to the floor.\n  We are prepared to make these commitments on our side, but want to be \nsure that we have your commitment to continue to work with us in good \nfaith on this legislation and to complete action as quickly as \npossible.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader for his comments and \nassurances. For the Senate to work effectively we need to be able to \nrely on each other's word. We accept your word that the Senate \nconferees will stay together, and you have my word that we will \ncontinue to work in good faith and do everything possible to complete \naction on this bill as soon as possible.\n  As we act quickly we ought to make sure that we minimize logistical \nproblems for the conferees.\n  I think we can avoid scheduling difficulties if there is at least 48 \nhours notice prior to meetings, and that there be an understanding that \nthere will be ample time to meet and deliberate before decisions are \nmade on significant matters. I hope that's acceptable to the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I agree that's sensible and acceptable to our side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader and I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the statements of both of our leaders, and \nI think all Members understand the importance of this conference. I \nparticularly appreciate the desire to work in good faith on these \nprovisions. I have noted that in the House bill there are some \nextraneous provisions, particularly with regard to both immigration and \nrefugees.\n  There are important changes in asylum standards that turn back our \ntradition in terms of refugees, which has been more of an ideological \nposition, but really it is unrelated to the challenges, to the threats. \nAnd there have also been very important provisions in terms of \ndeportation that is to a far extent. We have not had any of those \nhearings on the Judiciary Committee, and those are very important \nissues and questions.\n  I thank our leaders for their willingness to say that we want to work \non what is the underlying legislation. There are extraneous issues that \nhave been added in the House. If they were to come back and be as \nnegative as they are in the House bill, then it seems to me that it \nwould fail to meet the kind of standards that have been outlined in \ngood faith.\n  So I thank both of our leaders for their excellent statements. I \nappreciate our leader raising these questions on some very substantive, \nimportant issues that are completely unrelated to the whole question of \nterrorism or intelligence. It would need a good deal of discussion here \non the Senate floor before they were done.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts. I share his view about the importance of these matters \nand about the urgency with which we must work to ensure the completion \nof our work on the same bipartisan basis that we demonstrated to pass \nthe bill here on the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11233-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11233-S11234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DISASTER ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today is a day that has taken too long to \ncome. But it is a day of victory for hard-pressed farmers and ranchers \nwho have been devastated by various natural disasters around the \nNation. Today, we have approved $2.9 billion in emergency relief for \nfamily farmers and ranchers across America.\n  From Florida to Washington State, all along the eastern seaboard and \ninto the Midwest and upper Midwest, farmers and ranchers have faced \ncircumstances beyond their control.\n  In my State of South Dakota, we have seen 5 years of drought. Farmers \nhave gone out of business and ranchers have sold entire herds. This is \nnot just an issue for farmers and ranch families alone, it is an issue \nfor the rural communities in which they live as well.\n  In a State like mine, whose primary industry is agriculture, weather-\nrelated disasters are truly economic disasters for the entire State's \npopulation. That is why many of us have been fighting for adequate \ndisaster assistance for so long.\n  When we passed the farm bill in 2002, a bill that I am very proud to \nhave been a part of, we added a new program, the Counter-Cyclical \nProgram. It only provides assistance to producers when prices are low. \nIn fact, this program has now saved $15 billion just in the last 2 \nyears.\n  We said at the time we would not need any economic disaster \nassistance, and we have not. But we will need weather-related disaster \nassistance. That is something that the administration has failed to \nacknowledge. In fact, in 2002, in the middle of the worst drought since \nthe Dust Bowl year of 1936, the President came to our State and told \nfarmers and ranchers to tighten their belts, that they were not going \nto get any disaster assistance. That\n\n[[Page S11234]]\n\nstatement stunned many of us who had witnessed firsthand the \ndevastation that the drought had caused for farm and ranch families and \nthe communities in which they live. As the drought persisted in 2003, \nwe still had no opportunity for help.\n\n  Finally, in difficult negotiations over the last several weeks and \nwith bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate, we have \nmanaged to craft disaster assistance that will go to the President for \nhis signature. So today the Congress is now approving the $2.9 billion \nin agriculture disaster assistance. That is the good news. It is a win \nfor farmers and ranchers, and it will allow many of them to stay on the \nland and continue their businesses and continue a rural way of life. \nThis bill will provide payment for farmers who have lost over 35 \npercent of their historic yields and livestock producers who have lost \nover 40 percent of their available grazing land.\n  I thank Congressman Charlie Stenholm. We would not have any disaster \naid without his leadership in the House. I thank my colleagues in the \nSenate, especially Senator Baucus, who led a bipartisan group of \nSenators, all of whom supported disaster aid and worked to pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  I also thank Senator Harkin for his passionate support for the \nrecognition that this aid ought to be declared an emergency like all \nother forms of assistance that we have passed for other parts of the \ncountry.\n  America's family farmers and ranchers do not just produce \ncommodities, they produce communities. They are an important part of \nour national identity. They reflect our national values. For too long, \nthey have been suffering, not because they made bad decisions but \nbecause of bad weather. We cannot do anything about the weather, but we \ncan take steps to help family farmers and ranchers weather this crisis.\n  So I am proud of what we have been able to do today, and I hope the \nUSDA will immediately begin the process of distributing this much \nneeded assistance to farmers and ranchers across the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take just a couple minutes to \nengage three of my colleagues in a brief colloquy: Senators Inouye, \nSenator Akaka, and Senator Domenici, to inform our colleagues of an \nagreement that was reached in an effort to clear a group of bills that \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee had worked on very hard and \nvery long, for a long period of time, and have, in fact, cleared the \nSenate and been sent to the House, and to ensure that at some point \nnext year, before August 7, a bill relating to native Hawaiians, \nsimilar to or the same as S. 344, would be considered by this body.\n  We reached that agreement, which was embodied also in a letter from \nthe two leaders to Senators Domenici and Inouye, who had inquired of \nthat possibility, in which the leaders promised their best efforts to \nensure that a native Hawaiian bill equivalent to S. 344 would be \nbrought to the Senate floor for debate and resolution no later than \nAugust 7 of next year.\n  I had told both Senators from Hawaii I would express publicly my \npersonal commitment to assist in that effort to ensure that no \nprocedural roadblocks would be thrown in the way of the consideration \nof that legislation, nor a final vote on it. I will indeed do that and \nencourage all of my colleagues to work with us toward that end.\n  I thank Senator Domenici for his leadership on that large group of \nbills that were so important to so many Members of this body and for \nhis work on this particular issue, as well as our good friends from \nHawaii, Senators Akaka and Inouye, for their cooperation in helping us \nreach this resolution.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I note that Senator Akaka and the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Hawaii are on the floor. First, I \nwant to say they have been gracious. Many Senators had a part in this \nvery major bill, with 24, 28, maybe even 30 pieces of legislation for \ntheir States.\n  I say to the Senators from Hawaii, you had a perfect right to insist \nthat your bill, which has just been described by the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, be in that bill. That could have caused the bill \nto probably be here a long time, the big bill, and you graciously said, \nif we can work something else out, let's try. We did.\n  As a result, we passed this bill for many Senators, and we said to \nyou, both Senators from Hawaii, we will do our best to get your very \nimportant bill, described by the Senator from Arizona, up. We cannot \nassure that. I cannot guarantee that. This is the Senate. But we do \nhave a letter with all of the people who are in the leadership, I, \nmyself, by the distinguished two Senators from Arizona, that we will do \nour best. We described it and everyone knows of it.\n  Today we thought we would tell the Senate and give this assurance in \nthe Record to our two Senators from Hawaii that we are serious, that we \nwill do our part in trying to make sure their bill comes to a vote in \nthe Senate by the date they have agreed to and we have agreed to.\n  I say to Senator Kyl, I thank you for your diligent efforts in \nhelping with this. Every Senator who got something in that legislation \nthat is now going to the House will know what we have done.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am extremely grateful for those \nreassuring words of my distinguished friend from Arizona and my \ndistinguished friend from New Mexico.

Mr. President, I want to express my sincere gratitude to \nSenator Kyl particularly and also to Senator Domenici for working with \nus on our Hawaiian bill.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the \nmost recently passed piece of legislation; that is, the FSC/ETI tax \nbill that consumed a great deal of time over the last several days. I \nbegin by congratulating Senators Grassley and Baucus who wrote a very \ngood bill in the Senate.\n  When that bill left the Senate, I thought that it was a very sound \npiece of legislation, one that not only addressed the immediate problem \ndealing with trade issues, but also incorporated some other good ideas \nthat all of us believed were important to be a part of that \nlegislation. All of them were in one way or another bipartisan \namendments offered on the floor of the Senate.\n  The legislation provided tax deductions for American manufacturers to \nstimulate job growth in our economy. It protected American workers' \novertime provisions that had been adopted by this body and the other \nbody on several occasions over the last year.\n  The legislation limited the outsourcing of American jobs with the use \nof American taxpayer money. Senator Specter and I and 68 of our \ncolleagues endorsed that amendment which was before the Senate.\n  In addition, the Senate-passed bill contained an extremely important \nand delicate compromise worked out between the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from Kentucky that would have provided \nfinancial relief to hard-pressed tobacco farmers, while at the same \ntime establishing critical new protections for the health and safety of \nour children, 2,000 of whom start smoking each and every day in the \nUnited States.\n  The Senate bill was a very good piece of legislation. It was a \nsensible bill and a well-crafted bill. Senators Baucus and Grassley did \nan outstanding job.\n  Unfortunately, that bill is at best dimly reflected in the conference \nreport that we voted on today. The Senate bill essentially has been \nmugged, if I might say, by the other body and by the administration. In \nits place, the Senate was asked to consider a conference report that \nlacks many of the provisions most important to America's small \nbusinesses and to workers. In their place, the conference report has \nadded a number of provisions that amount to little more than sops to a \nvariety of special interests from NASCAR to makers of ceiling fans.\n  In the process the bill neuters the ability of Congress to make \nmeaningful contributions to economic growth. At the same time it \ncreates new threats to fiscal discipline, which is at an all-time low.\n  Allow me to discuss several of these shortcomings in more detail, and \nto discuss other provisions that were either left out of this \nconference report or changed dramatically from the legislation that \nleft this body only a few weeks ago.\n  First, I am concerned that this bill may not achieve its central \ngoal: lifting the European Union duties, which currently are at 12 \npercent and could reach as high as 17 percent. Instead of simply \nrepealing the Foreign Sales Corporation and Extraterritorial Income \nExclusion (FSC/ETI), the conference report uses House language which \nphases the subsidy out over two years and allows companies to receive a \npercentage of the subsidy based on what they export each year. We were \ntold early on that the European Union would find the Senate language \nacceptable for the removal of sanctions. We were also told that the \nlanguage from the other body raises serious reservations within the \nEuropean Union.\n  In last week's Washington Post, the European Union spokesman Anthony \nGooch was quoted as saying:\n  ``The export subsidy phases out of existence slowly when it should be \nlifted immediately.''\n  So here we are, about to pass a massive tax bill that is supposed to \nfix our FSC/ETI problem, and yet we are not even sure if it will do \nthat job. In other words, we might have to do this all over again. The \nE.U. had said that the Senate-passed language would be acceptable, but \nhad expressed concern over the House language. And here we are with a \nconference report with the House language. I find this baffling and \ndeeply troubling. And while some would welcome another opportunity to \npass even more special interest tax cuts in another FSC/ETI bill, this \nSenator would certainly not.\n\n  Second, instead of meaningful, broad-based, and fiscally responsible \ntax relief for manufacturing here in the United States, the conference \nreport includes a smorgasbord of special provisions. Even the \nadministration's Treasury Secretary just last week highly criticized \nthis legislation as including a ``myriad of special interest tax \nprovisions that benefit few taxpayers and increase the complexity of \nthe tax code.'' I am quoting the Secretary of the Treasury about this \nbill we just overwhelmingly adopted.\n  Let me mention some of these provisions, and then ask your own \nconstituents whether they think this is a wise use of their tax \ndollars. We are going to provide a $101 million tax break that would \nallow NASCAR racetracks to recover costs over 7 years; a $445 billion \nAlaska energy tax break; $42 million for film and television \nproduction; $27 million to the horse and dog racing industries. Ask \nyour constituents whether they think these provisions are critically \nimportant at a time when we have massive deficits, whether these \ninterests are the kinds of interests we should be including in a bill \nprimarily designed to increase manufacturing, to limit the kinds of \nexport problems we have as a result of trade agreements.\n  It seems to me we have gone far afield of what we should have been \ndoing, far afield of what the Senate did only a few weeks ago.\n  I might point out as well that in this legislation we are not doing \nwhat we ought to be doing, and that is, of course, trying to provide \nsome real relief for the manufacturing sector in our economy. It is a \nwell-known fact that our manufacturing sector is hurting. The erosion \nof our manufacturing base is of great concern. Under the present \nAdministration we have lost nearly 2.7 million manufacturing jobs. Just \nlast Friday, the September unemployment numbers showed that we only \nadded 96,000 new jobs. This is one-third the job growth of 300,000 per \nmonth that would have been achieved if job growth had occurred at the \nrate this average for a recovery. The September unemployment numbers \nalso showed that we actually saw manufacturing jobs fall by 18,000--the \nlargest drop since December, 2003. Despite this fact, this conference \nreport weakens language that would have rewarded domestic manufacturing \nby giving an even bigger tax cut to companies that manufacture more of \ntheir goods in the U.S. It expands the definition of what constitutes \nmanufacturing to include industries that hardly fall within the \ncategory of manufacturing. By diluting the definition of manufacturing \nand expanding this out by some 9 or 10 percent, we are going to make it \nharder for the very industries which are critically important to our \nlong-term economic growth to create jobs. By expanding that definition, \nwe have set ourselves back.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation's complex analysis of \nthe manufacturing deduction in this bill, which they are required to do \nby law and which was tucked away at the end of the conference report, \nonly slightly more than 10 percent of small businesses will be affected \nby these provisions. Only 10 percent of small businesses will be able \nto enjoy the benefits of this legislation. Since the title of this bill \nis a jobs bill, I would have expected more help for our smaller \ncompanies which are the biggest source of job growth in our Nation.\n  The Joint Tax report also notes that ``the provision will result in \nan increase in disputes between small businesses and the IRS.'' Reasons \nfor such a dispute ``include the complexity of the provision and the \ninherent incentive for small businesses and other taxpayers to \ncharacterize the activities as qualified production activities to claim \nthe deduction under the provision.'' Just what a small business needs, \na more complex Tax Code and problems with the IRS.\n  Third, this legislation changes a major provision which was adopted \nin the bill as it left the Senate--a provision that stopped the use of \nfederal tax dollars to subsidize the outsourcing of American jobs. As \nthe author of this provision dealing with outsourcing, I\n\n[[Page S11236]]\n\nam terribly disappointed that, despite the fact that an overwhelming \nmajority of our colleagues on a bipartisan basis approved language that \nprohibited the use of American taxpayer money to outsource jobs outside \nof the United States, this provision was stripped out in the conference \nreport.\n  We ought to be exporting our products and our services, not jobs in \nthis country. At a time when as many as 14 million white-collar jobs \ncould be lost over the next 10 years from outsourcing and with 2.7 \nmanufacturing jobs already lost in the last four years, the American \npeople deserve a majority in Congress to stand up against the surge of \noutsourcing afflicting this country.\n\n  The unanimous vote of the 12 conferees on the Republican side to take \nthe outsourcing provisions out of this bill, I think, is a slap in the \nface of American workers. The fact we would be using Federal taxpayer \nmoney to hire someone offshore to do a job that ought to be done in the \nUnited States I think is wrong. I am for fair trade and free trade. We \nought to stand up for the American worker. They are worried and \nconcerned about their future. They are bothered about whether they are \ngoing to have enough to take care of their families' needs.\n  Yet we found nothing wrong with continuing to have provisions in our \npolicies that allow tax money to be used to hire people outside of this \ncountry, when jobs are needed in the U.S. We have the worst job \nproduction in almost 70 years in the U.S. We ought not to be stepping \nback. This bill stripped out a provision that was adopted here by a \nvote of 70 to 26. I think that was a great mistake. I regret that my \ncolleagues on the conference committee sought to do that.\n  It is no secret how much this Administration supports outsourcing. \nThey believe, it is, in their words ``a good thing.'' They said so in \nthe President's Economic Report to Congress this year, and they so \nagain in this conference agreement.\n  Fourth, the conference report does nothing to protect overtime pay. \nSix million citizens rely on overtime pay to provide for their \nfamilies' needs. So many families are struggling to make ends meet. The \ncutback in overtime is an unfair burden that American workers should \nnot have to bear.\n  Overtime pay amounts to about 25 percent of the income of workers who \nwork overtime. These include police officers, firefighters, nurses, and \nmany others. Workers stripped of overtime protections will end up \nworking longer hours for less pay.\n  The Bush administration's overtime regulation would deny overtime \nprotections to as many as 6 million hard-working men and women, \nincluding registered nurses, cooks, clerical workers, nursery \nschoolteachers, and others. Even veterans, who have served in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, would be hurt. If they received some training as soldiers \nthat would give the administration an excuse to classify them as \n``managers'' in the civilian workforce, they could be denied overtime--\neven if they resume the same job. That is an outrage.\n  The Senate has voted against the Bush rule three times and said you \nshould not impose that rule. The House voted twice to say don't impose \nthat rule. Yet the conference committee sought to drop it entirely.\n  So the Bush administration's rule on overtime will affect 6 million \nAmericans adversely. Fifty-five categories of jobs that qualify for \novertime pay are gone. That is now out, despite the fact we insisted it \nbe part of this legislation.\n  Fifth, the conference report breaks an agreement we made not only to \nprotect tobacco farmers but also children. It was a bipartisan \nagreement that simply said that if we were to help out tobacco farmers, \nwe were going to have FDA regulations to protect children from the \nlife-threatening dangers of tobacco. These dangers--and the costs they \npose to our nation--are enormous.\n  By regulating tobacco products and taxing them higher, tobacco \nfarmers are going to be adversely affected. Some tobacco--specifically \ntobacco made into cigar wrappers--is grown in my State. I see my \ncolleague from North Carolina here and I know how important that issue \nis to her and her constituents, just as it is in Kentucky. I think they \ndeserve help as a result of this legislation, but I also believe part \nof the deal here was that we were going to allow this industry to be \nregulated by the FDA. To strip the FDA provision out, I think, was a \ngreat mistake. I think that we will regret it.\n\n  It costs us $75 billion a year in health care costs to deal with \ntobacco-related illnesses in America. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, tobacco use by pregnant women alone \ncauses between $400 million and $500 million per year due to \ncomplications of low birth weight, premature births, and sudden infant \ndeath syndrome.\n  Every day, another 2,000 kids start smoking in America, one third of \nwhom will die prematurely. That is not speculation. That is a fact. Yet \nthis bill stripped it out and said we would provide relief to tobacco \nfarmers but forget about doing a better job of regulating an industry \nthat is causing so much harm and sadness in our country because of the \nrelated illnesses and death caused by people who smoke.\n  Sixth, the conference report is missing a provision included in the \nSenate bill I cosponsored, which is the Landrieu amendment. We are \ngoing to have a separate vote on that later. It is not a likely \namendment that will be offered and voted on in the House. We will vote \non it, but it is still not going to be included in legislation that \ngoes to the President for signature. That was the provision that would \nhave honored patriotic employers who continue to pay the salaries of \ntheir employees, who are members of the National Guard and Reserve and \nare deployed in the war on terrorism--whether it be in Afghanistan or \nIraq. Employers would have been eligible for a 50-percent tax benefit \nfor wages they paid to members of the National Guard and Reserve while \non Active-Duty status. The credit would have been good up to 12 months, \nabout the length of a standard deployment in Afghanistan or Iraq.\n  Forty-one percent of activated Guard and Reserve take a reduction in \npay when called to duty. This places a tremendous burden on their loved \nones back home. Yet conferees stripped the provision out of the \nconference report.\n  As my friend and colleague from Louisiana pointed out earlier, the \n$44 million tax credit for ceiling fans included in the conference \nreport would have paid for 1 year of Guard and Reserve tax credits. Yet \nthe conferees chose ceiling fans over businesses, or saving jobs for \nour National Guard and Reserve people.\n  Finally, this conference report is fiscally reckless. While the \noffsets are likely to expire, the tax breaks are likely to be \nextended--if past history under this leadership is any guide. That will \nonly add tens of billions of dollars to the deficit. We have the \nhighest deficit in the history of our country. This is a birth tax on \nyoung children being born because we already know they bear an \nobligation to pay back in interest to the Federal Government a \nstaggering amount of money. The idea we are going to have higher \nmortgage rates, higher car payments, and tuition costs because of \nmounting deficits, because $1.8 trillion of America's debt is held by \nnations outside of the United States--principally Japan and China. That \nis dangerous, in my view. This bill adds tremendously to the national \ndebt. We are not paying for it.\n  For all of those reasons, I think we would have been wise to wait \nwhen cooler heads prevail, and deal with what we should have been \ndealing with, or at least draft legislation that was the rationale for \nbringing it up in the first place, and deal with the trade issue. We \ndidn't do that well in this bill.\n  I was in a small minority to vote against this, but I believe \nstrongly that if you think something is as wrong as this is, you have \nto speak out against it. For the reasons outlined here, and because we \nso emasculated what we did in the Senate a few weeks ago and brought \nback a piece of legislation that hardly resembled what we did in the \nSenate, I could not vote for this legislation.\n  I hope we come back in January and reconsider some of the provisions \nincluded in this bill and do a better job on behalf of the American \ntaxpayer and future generations of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  For his last 5 years, Jesse's right hand on tobacco issues was David \nRouzer, and David has been my senior\n\n[[Page S11237]]\n\nadviser as we have worked through this buyout.\n  At a young age, David began working on his family's tobacco farm in \nJohnston County, NC. He understands the stress that tobacco farmers \nhave been under, and he has labored tirelessly to get us to this day.\n  I made the buyout a top priority when I arrived in the Senate because \nour tobacco-producing communities have suffered terribly--terribly--in \nrecent years. The rigid Government program created in the 1930s was not \ndesigned for the intense world competition of today. It was not \ndesigned to withstand the consequences of the master settlement \nagreement.\n  In past years, our farmers led the world in tobacco production. Now \nthey account for only 7 percent of flue-cured tobacco sold worldwide. \nThe time has come to end the last of the Depression-era farm programs. \nOur farmers want to operate in a free market.\n  As the U.S. market share of tobacco has slipped, the quota system, \nwith its price supports, kept U.S. producer costs artificially high. \nThese high prices led to tobacco imports from lower cost countries, \nsuch as Brazil and China. Under the current tobacco program formula, \nthe decline in demand for American tobacco produced a cut in quota, the \namount of tobacco a farmer can grow and sell.\n  In just the last 5 years, the tobacco quota has been cut almost 60 \npercent. That is the equivalent of cutting your paycheck by 60 percent. \nThere is not a business in America that would not take a serious hit \nwith a 60-percent cut in revenue. And according to agricultural \neconomists, these farm families were about to get an additional 33-\npercent cut in quota for the 2005 crop-year. These cuts have had \nprofound impacts on North Carolina's tobacco communities. For almost 70 \nyears, the U.S. Government-issued tobacco quota was something you could \ntake to the bank, literally.\n  Under permanent law, they could expect a yearly return on investment. \nFarmers used it as collateral for loans in order to put the next year's \ncrop in the field. Families handed quota down from generation to \ngeneration. That paid the death tax as part of keeping family farms \nalive. Widows have counted on quota as an investment to supplement \ntheir Social Security.\n  By buying out these quota holders, we give families the option of \nretiring with dignity. We give them the ability to pay off the banks \nfor loans made against an ever-shrinking collateral. By getting the \nbuyout done before the next quota cut, literally thousands of families \nin rural North Carolina will be saved from bankruptcy.\n  Rather than having to quit the farm, this buyout gives our farmers \nthe ability to compete in the free market, and if farmers want to \ncontinue to grow leaf, they can compete worldwide without the \nartificial cost increase.\n  Many will also use this opportunity to invest in new equipment and \ntransition to other crops. This tobacco buyout will help not only the \nfarmers and their families, but their hard-pressed communities. It is \nthe retailers, equipment dealers, chemical and fertilizer dealers, and \na whole array of small local businesses that will also benefit from the \ntobacco buyout. These are the very small businesses that create the \nmajority of new jobs in tobacco-producing States--jobs that are much \nneeded.\n  With our action today, we come to the end of an era in tobacco \npolicy. We stop conceding tobacco production to countries such as China \nand Brazil. We stop foreclosures to thousands of farmers, and we stop \nthe negative economic ripple effect throughout rural communities in the \nSoutheastern States. For that, we can all be extremely proud.\n  To those who have worked so hard on the tobacco quota buyout, on \nbehalf of the thousands of farm families in North Carolina and \nthroughout the Southeast, a heartfelt thank you. What has been \naccomplished is a legislative miracle and a monumental achievement. It \nhas been a great privilege to work with you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I join with others in the Senate to say \nit is with deep sorrow I note the death of Christopher Reeve. \nChristopher set a wonderful example of courage and perseverance for men \nand women all over this country who are afflicted by disabilities, and \nparticularly those who have spinal cord injuries.\n  Christopher never gave up hope that eventually he could be cured. He \nworked hard to keep his body in the best shape possible to prepare for \nthe day when an effective treatment for his injury would be available, \nand he fought unceasingly to foster the scientific research that offers \nhope and help to millions of others afflicted with severe injuries or \ndreaded disease.\n  He was particularly involved in the battle for stem cell research \nbecause he saw it as the best opportunity for curing not only his \ninjury but also a host of other diseases from Parkinson's and diabetes \nto heart disease. This election is critical in achieving Christopher \nReeve's vision because only one candidate for President, John Kerry, is \ncommitted not only to stem cell research but to good science generally, \nscience not constrained by ideology or partisanship.\n  I am going to come back to this subject matter in just a moment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11237-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LEGISLATIVE AGENDA\n\n\n                          Overtime Protections\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I take note that the Senate, a little \nwhile ago, for the fourth time, passed the overtime protections bill \nyesterday. This is the same bill the House has already passed twice. So \nI hope they act as soon as possible on the bill we sent them yesterday. \nThere is no reason we cannot get the discharge petition in the House of \nRepresentatives on that and also the provisions that we passed on FDA \nprotections for children.\n  I hope President Bush is listening to the bipartisan majorities in \nthe House and Senate who repeatedly tell him to repeal those parts of \nhis regulation on overtime that take away pay for hard-working, middle-\nclass Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11237-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11237-S11241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FSC/ETI\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on the FSC legislation that was just \npassed, I want to say a few words. The American middle class is the \nheart and soul of our country, but you would never know it from the FSC \nbill. We should be helping middle-class families, not hurting them, but \nthis bill uses your taxes to ship your jobs overseas. It allows \nPresident Bush to cut your overtime pay, and it allows big tobacco \ncompanies to market cigarettes to your children.\n  On issue after issue in this legislation, elite corporate interests \nare the winners at the expense of average Americans. If the middle \nclass is the backbone of America, then this bill is contrary to \nAmerican values. And if President Bush really cared about the middle \nclass instead of just big corporations, he would veto this bill when it \ncomes to his desk.\n\n\n                               Education\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on another matter, President Bush may be \nleaving 5 million children behind in our schools, but he is sparing no \nexpense in a national campaign to cover up the failures of his \nadministration on public school reform. Somehow the Bush administration \ncan never find the money in the budget to hire and train teachers to \nhelp failing schools to expand afterschool programs. But when it comes \nto politics and PR campaigns, he can find thousands and thousands of \nyour tax dollars for White House propaganda. In a line that President \nReagan made famous: There you go again.\n  They use taxpayers dollars to produce political ads for their bad \nMedicare bill, and they are doing it again with their failed education \nprogram.\n  I refer to the October 11 AP story by the education writer, Ben \nFeller. He writes:\n\n       The Bush administration has promoted its education law with \n     a video that comes across as a news story but fails to make \n     clear the reporter involved was paid with taxpayer money. The \n     Government used a similar approach this year in promoting the \n     new Medicare law and drew a rebuke from the investigative arm \n     of Congress which found that the videos amounted to \n     propaganda in violation of Federal law.\n\n  That is why we ask Secretary Paige to take this propaganda off the \nairways\n\n[[Page S11238]]\n\nnow. You just used a similar process on Medicare, and the GAO found it \nviolated Government law. They are following the same procedure. This \nviolates Government law, and it ought to be taken off the air and taken \noff now.\n  The videos and documents emerged through a Freedom of Information Act \nrequest by People for the American Way that contends the Department is \nspending public money on a political agenda. The group sought details \nof a $700,000 contract Ketchum received in 2003 from the Education \nDepartment.\n  One service the company provided was a video news release geared for \ntelevision stations. The video includes a news story that features \nEducation Secretary Rod Paige and promotes tutoring now offered under \nlaw. It does not identify the Government as the source of the report. \nIt also fails to make clear that the person purporting to be a reporter \nwas someone hired for the promotional video. Those are the same \nfeatures, including the voice of Karen Ryan, that were prominent on \nvideos the Health and Human Services Department used to promote the \nMedicare law and were judged covert propaganda by the General \nAccounting Office in May.\n  It is the same business, a different subject matter, and it is \ncompletely unacceptable. Enough is enough. It is time to get serious \nabout improving our schools. It is time for the Bush administration to \nrealize improving education in America is not about slogans. It is not \nabout propaganda. It is time to get about the hard work of training \nmore teachers, smaller class sizes, extra help for the children who \nneed it.\n\n\n                           Stem Cell Research\n\n  Now, to get back to my earlier comment about stem cell research--and \nI see a number of my colleagues on the floor who will address this \nissue as well--last evening I noted and saw my good friend the majority \nleader take the Senate floor to defend the indefensible, President \nBush's stem cell policy. Here is what the majority leader said: Stem \ncell research shows great promise. It shows great promise, and the \nPresident's policy harnesses that promise and it also strikes a balance \nwith the values of our people.\n  The fact is that the President's position does not strike a balance. \nIt does not harness the promise of stem cell research. In fact, it is \nan attempt to have it both ways. It is an attempt to satisfy the group \nof the President's supporters who oppose stem cell research on \nreligious grounds while pretending to the vast majority of Americans \nwho support such research that he is really behind it. No amount of \nrhetoric can hide the fact that the biggest obstacle to finding cures \nfor paralysis or Parkinson's disease or juvenile diabetes or heart \ndisease through use of embryonic stem cell is President Bush.\n  President Bush is fond of claiming that he is the first President to \napprove funds for stem cell research. That sounds good, but it is not \ntrue. Here is the actual record: For a number of years, the \nCongressional Appropriations Act had carried a prohibition against \nusing Federal funds for research that destroyed an embryo. Now that we \nbetter understand the importance of embryonic stem cell research, a \nprohibition would never pass today. President Clinton had asked a \nspecial committee at NIH to reexamine this policy, and they concluded \nthat the use of embryos for research was ethical and scientifically \nimportant.\n  In January of 1999, the HHS General Counsel concluded that despite \nthe appropriations bill language, NIH money could be used to support \nresearch on cell lines derived from embryos as long as NIH did not pay \nfor the destruction of embryos. Following this decision, NIH set up a \nspecial committee to review grant applications for such research. In \nApril of 2001, the new Bush administration suspended the committee and \nbarred NIH from awarding any funds for embryo research.\n  In August 2001, President Bush announced the policy that has \neffectively slowed stem cell research to a crawl. Under his policy, \nonly stem cell lines that had been created prior to 8 p.m., August 9, \n2001, would be available for funding with Federal money. Virtually \nevery scientist involved in the field said this policy was hopelessly \nrestrictive, but President Bush did not listen.\n\n  The experience of Professor Douglas Melton at Harvard, a \ndistinguished medical researcher, illustrates the folly of the Bush \nrestrictions. Professor Melton has created 17 stem cell lines that meet \nall of the ethical guidelines laid down at NIH, but his stem cell lines \nwere created after the date in the President's Executive order. He \nreceives no Federal funding for his work. He has had to create a whole \nseparate lab to conduct his research because his regular lab had \nreceived Federal funds. For this dedicated researcher, the barriers \ncreated by President Bush's policy in lost time and denied resources \nand, most of all, in potential missed opportunities for patients have \nbeen tragic.\n  The fact is that some of our most distinguished scientists are moving \nabroad to do their research. The last thing we need is a reverse brain-\ndrain.\n  When President Bush announced his policy, he claimed that more than \n60 stem cell lines would be available. At the time, experts said that \nthe President was simply wrong, and he was wrong, but he has not \nchanged his policy. The reality is that only 22 cell lines can actually \nbe used by scientists. The rest have failed to develop into usable \nlines. Even the few lines that NIH will fund are all contaminated with \nmouse cells. Because of the danger of using these contaminated lines, \nFDA rules make it almost impossible to use any of these lines to \ndevelop or test cures in human beings.\n  Worse yet, every single one of those lines comes with a restrictive \ncontract known as a materials transfer agreement that actually \nprohibits doctors from using them in patients. Let me make sure my \ncolleagues understand this. NIH researchers are legally barred from \nusing any of the stem cell lines available to them to help treat \npatients. Do not just take my word for it; go look it up. All the \nrestrictions are laid out in black and white on the NIH stem cell Web \nsite.\n  Most people would look at the facts that have come out since George \nBush laid down his policy and admit they made a mistake and then make a \nchange. No shame in that. But will George Bush admit he made a mistake, \nadmit that it is time for a change? Oh, no, he is never wrong. He has \nnever made a mistake. Sound familiar?\n  The reality is that the American people know the Bush policy is \ndenying help and hope to millions of American patients and their \nfamilies. The majority of the Senate knows it, too. Fifty-eight \nSenators sent a letter to President Bush to reverse this disastrous \npolicy before more precious time is lost in the battle against diseases \nsuch as diabetes, Parkinson's, spinal injury, and more. That letter was \nsigned by 14 Republicans, including prominent pro-life conservatives \nsuch as Orrin Hatch, Trent Lott, Ted Stevens, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and \nGordon Smith. These pro-life conservatives understand that the embryos \nthat would be used in research are byproducts of in vitro fertilization \nprocedures to be used to help couples who would otherwise not be able \nto have children. If these embryos are not used in research they will \nbe discarded or frozen in perpetuity. We are not talking about \ndestroying embryos for research; we are talking about using embryos in \nresearch that would otherwise be destroyed in any event.\n  In an eloquent editorial published in the Salt Lake Tribune in April \n2002, Senator Hatch wrote:\n\n       Regenerative medicine is pro-life and pro-family. It fully \n     enhances, not diminishes, human life. If encouraged to \n     flourish, it can improve the lives of millions of Americans \n     and could lead to new scientific knowledge that is likely to \n     yield new treatments and cures.\n\n  Why would anyone oppose that? As everyone knows, Nancy Reagan \nstrongly supports that position. The Nation's scientific community \nknows that embryonic stem cells have a unique potential to repair \ninjury and treat disease. According to a letter signed in 1999 by 36 \nNobel laureates, those who seek to prevent medical advances using stem \ncells must be held accountable to those, and their families, who suffer \nfrom horrible disease, as to why such hope should be withheld.\n  A later letter was sent by 80 Nobel laureates, and it said: Current \nevidence suggests that adult stem cells have markedly restricted \ndifferentiation potential. Therefore, for disorders that prove not to \nbe treatable with adult stem cells, impending human pluripotent stem \ncell research risk unnecessary delay for millions of patients\n\n[[Page S11239]]\n\nwho may die or endure needless suffering while the effectiveness of \nadult stem cells is evaluated.\n  Those most affected by the Bush administration's cruel restrictions \non this lifesaving research know it is wrong. Over 140 organizations \nrepresenting patients and health professionals, including Vanderbilt \nUniversity Medical Center, wrote to President Bush, urging him to end \nthese unwarranted restrictions. The organizations signing that letter \nrepresent patients afflicted with cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and many \nother serious illnesses.\n  Their letter was written on the third sad anniversary of the \nannouncement of the President's failed policy. It notes the grim \nstatistics, that in the 3 years since that announcement, ``more than 4 \nmillion Americans have died from diseases that embryonic stem cells \nhave the potential to treat.''\n  Even the Bush administration has admitted that adult stem cells \ncannot match the potential of embryonic stem cells. The conclusion of \nan NIH report in June of 2001 couldn't be clearer:\n\n       Stem cells in adult tissues do not appear to have the same \n     capacity to differentiate as do embryonic stem cells.\n\n  The fundamental fact is that the Bush administration's first action \non stem-cell research was to block the sensible policy that President \nClinton had instituted to allow NIH to fund stem-cell research with \nstrict ethical guidelines. As I noted earlier, President Clinton was \nthe first President to allow NIH to fund embryonic stem-cell research, \nnot President George Bush. His sensible policy was never implemented \nbecause the Bush administration blocked it.\n  If George Bush had not reversed President Clinton's sensible and \nwell-reasoned policy, National Institutes of Health funded scientists \nwould today be able to conduct research on stem cells uncontaminated \nwith mouse cells. Because of George Bush's restrictions, they cannot.\n  If George Bush had not reversed the Clinton policy, National \nInstitutes of Health funded scientists today would be able to search \nfor breakthrough new cures by researching stem cells from patients with \ngenetic disorders. Because of George Bush's restrictions, they cannot.\n  If George Bush had not reversed the Clinton policy, National \nInstitutes of Health researchers would be free today to research cell \nlines that could actually be used in patients. Because of George Bush's \nrestrictions, they cannot.\n  It is time to lift these restrictions. Millions of patients and their \nfamilies hope that George Bush will lift those restrictions. But \neveryone in this Chamber knows he will not. To restore hope and renew \nthe promise of medical progress, we need a change in November. We need \na President who will not let a blind and stubborn ideology stand in the \nway of cures for diabetes, hope for cancer, relief for those suffering \nfrom many other disorders. America's patients need a change. They need \nJohn Kerry.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes.\n\n\n                        The State Of The Economy\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see a number of my colleagues here. I \nwill be brief. But I want to address the subject matter which was so \neloquently addressed by our friend and ranking member on the Joint \nEconomic Committee this past week in the hearings that were held about \nthe state of our economy. I see him on the floor. I want to make some \nopening comments and hope he will help me to understand this issue \nbetter.\n  I have in my hand President Bush's statement that he made in \nMinnesota 2 days ago. President Bush, in Minnesota 2 days ago, said:\n\n       Our economy has been growing at rates as fast as any in \n     nearly 20 years.\n\n  I also have in my hand:\n\n       I have proposed and delivered four rounds of tax relief. . \n     . .\n\n  This is from the President's radio talk on Saturday. Two days ago he \ntalked about the economy ``expanding,'' ``growing,'' ``the best in 20 \nyears.'' Then on Saturday in his radio talk:\n\n       I have proposed and delivered four rounds of tax relief and \n     our economy is creating jobs again. We have added 1.9 million \n     jobs in the past 13 months.\n\n  What he doesn't point out is the economy is working well for Wall \nStreet but not for Main Street; that we are still short 1.6 million \njobs. This will be the first President since Herbert Hoover who has \npresided over an economy where we have not produced the jobs.\n  In that report we had last week, we found out a great many of those \njobs were temporary jobs. Of that number of 96,000 jobs, a third of \nthose were temporary. As was pointed out in the Joint Economic \nCommittee where the Senator from Maryland serves, it reminded us the \nreal unemployment rate is 9.4 percent because so many people have given \nup looking for work. And the long-term unemployment rate is the highest \nfor the longest in the history of keeping the information by the \nDepartment of Labor.\n  But I want to know if the senior Senator saw Monday's Washington \nPost. This is not a month ago. This isn't 6 months ago. Here it is, a \nfront-page story:\n\n       Permanent Job Proves an Elusive Dream\n\n  The story goes on about the rise of temporary workers.\n  The story goes on and talks about Phillip Hicks. He lost his job and \ncould only find temporary work.\n  It continues. I will ask unanimous consent the entire article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 11, 2004]\n\n                 Permanent Job Proves An Elusive Dream\n\n                         (By Jonathan Weisman)\n\n       Cynthiana, Ky.--Phillip Hicks had loaded his rusting pickup \n     and was heading to work one afternoon last year when his \n     tearful daughter called from a pay phone. She had been pulled \n     over for speeding, she told her father, and worse, she was \n     driving with a suspended license. The police had impounded \n     her car and left her by the side of a dusty highway.\n       To most workers at the sprawling Toyota plant where Hicks \n     works, the detour to pick up his daughter would be a \n     headache, no doubt. To Hicks, 40, it was considerably more. \n     He called his employer to say he would be late for the swing \n     shift. But since Hicks is a temporary worker, his daughter's \n     brush with the law became a permanent blemish on an already \n     shaky employment record. Temps are allowed only three days \n     off a year, and Hicks was coming up against that.\n       ``They told me I had an attendance problem,'' he sighed \n     wearily, his soft mountain accent revealing his roots in coal \n     country to the east.\n       Hicks is among the ranks of what economists call the \n     ``contingent'' workforce, the vast and growing pool of \n     workers tenuously employed in jobs that once were stable \n     enough to support a family. In a single generation, \n     ``contingent employment arrangements'' have begun to \n     transform the world of work, not only for temp workers, but \n     also for those in traditional jobs who are competing with a \n     tier of employees receiving lower pay and few, if any, \n     benefits.\n       The rise of that workforce has become another factor \n     undermining the type of middle-wage jobs, paying about the \n     national average of $17 per hour and carrying health and \n     retirement benefits, that have kept the nation's middle-class \n     standard of living so widely available.\n       Hicks has spent four years as a temp worker building cars \n     for Toyota Motor Corp., making manifolds and dashboards for \n     Camrys, Avalons and Solaras sold all over the United States. \n     He works alongside full-fledged Toyota employees who earn \n     twice his salary, plus health and retirement benefits.\n       When Toyota announced it would be coming to Georgetown, \n     Ky., in 1985, it promised to invest $800 million in the \n     community and employ thousands, with thousands more jobs \n     coming through its suppliers. By 1997, the plant exceeded all \n     expectations, with 7,689 full-time workers, a payroll over \n     $470 million, and a ripple effect creating more than 34,000 \n     other jobs in the Bluegrass state.\n       But by 2000, Toyota was carefully controlling any additions \n     to the workforce. When Hicks left his family in Knott County, \n     Ky., to seek work at the plant 140 miles away, the only door \n     left open was through a temporary agency, Manpower Inc. At \n     $12.60 an hour, the job would not even let him afford the \n     $199-a-week health insurance premium for his family of \n     five. But Hicks said Manpower assured him that after a \n     year--two at the outside--he would be on Toyota's payroll, \n     earning $24.20 an hour, with health insurance, a dental \n     plan, retirement benefits, incentive pay, the works.\n       ``I could stand on my head for a year or two for a $20-an-\n     hour job with benefits,'' he shrugged.\n       The increasing use of temps ``is part of the diminished and \n     inferior wages and fringe benefits you see in all the new \n     jobs that are becoming available,'' said William B. Gould IV, \n     a labor law professor at Stanford University and former \n     chairman of the National Labor Relations Board.\n       The government does not have up-to-date figures for the \n     size of the entire contingent\n\n[[Page S11240]]\n\n     workforce, which includes temps, independent contractors, on-\n     call workers and contract company workers. In 2001, the Labor \n     Department classified 16.2 million people--as much as 12.1 \n     percent of the labor force--as contingent workers.\n       It does track one slice of that workforce: temporary \n     workers. Since January 2002, the Nation added 369,000 temp \n     positions, about half of the private-sector jobs created \n     during that stretch. Temporary jobs accounted for one-third \n     of the 96,000 jobs added to the economy in September. In \n     1982, there were 417,000 workers classified as temporary \n     help. Today, there are more than 2.5 million, according to \n     Labor Department data.\n       That is about equal to the number of manufacturing jobs \n     lost in the past decade. Barrie Peterson, associate director \n     of Seton Hall University's Institute on Work in South Orange, \n     NJ, said that as many as half of those lost manufacturing \n     positions may have been converted to temporary employment.\n       The change can be abrupt. At A Service Co., a small auto-\n     parts assembler in Chicago, employees were told on July 15 \n     that the firm ``will no longer hold general labor employees \n     on its payroll. All general labor employees that choose to \n     work at A Service Company, LLC must be employed by Elite \n     Staffing effective immediately.'' On the announcement, \n     workers were asked to check a box accepting or declining the \n     new temporary employment, then sign and date the form.\n       Temps no longer fit the stereotype of the secretary filling \n     in for a day or two. Jobs categorized as precision \n     production, repair, craftsmanship, operations, fabrications \n     and labor now account for 30.7 percent of all temp jobs, \n     nudging out clerical and administrative support, which \n     represent 29.5 percent of the temporary army.\n       Peterson calls it ``the perma-temping shell game,'' part of \n     a broader effort by employers to convert sectors of their \n     workforce to temps.\n       Satisfaction with the arrangement varies. About 83 percent \n     of independent contractors in the Labor Department survey \n     said they were satisfied. By contrast, about 44 percent of \n     temps and 52 percent of contingent workers said they were not \n     satisfied.\n       The impact of the temp trend on the American middle class \n     can hardly be overstated. As the Federal Reserve Bank of \n     Chicago noted in a paper last year, temporary workers \n     ``receive much lower wages than permanent workers, although \n     they frequently perform the same tasks as permanent staff \n     members.'' An analysis by Harvard University economist \n     Lawrence F. Katz and Princeton University economist Alan B. \n     Krueger found that states with the highest concentration of \n     temps experienced the lowest wage growth of the 1990s.\n       Toyota executives say they use temporary workers as a \n     buffer, to insulate their full-time staff from the ups and \n     downs of consumer demand. Since it opened in 1988, through \n     two recessions, the Georgetown plant has never laid off an \n     employee, said Daniel Sieger, manager of media relations for \n     Toyota Motor Manufacturing in North America.\n       Even without layoffs, however, the plant's full-time staff \n     has declined by 706 positions from the 7,787 employees it had \n     in 2000, according to Toyota. Over that time, the temp \n     workforce dipped from 409 in 2000 to 301 in 2002, then rose \n     to 425 late this summer.\n       Toyota managers say they will try to hire all of their \n     long-term temporaries by the end of the year or in early \n     2005, after they see how many Toyota workers accept an early \n     retirement package. Forty-seven temps were hired in late \n     September. The management move came after The Washington Post \n     spent a week in Kentucky examining the temporary employment \n     issue at the Georgetown plant. Before September's hires, it \n     had been two years since the plant hired a full-time ``team \n     member,'' Toyota managers said, a period during which the \n     plant shed 240 full-time positions. Temporary employment \n     during that time rose by 124.\n       ``Certainly the long-term temporary issue is one that we \n     regret,'' said Pete Gritton, the plant's vice president of \n     administration and human relations. ``We never intended to \n     have those people in here for four years or whatever as \n     temporary.''\n       Temporary employment is an increasingly important issue for \n     unions. The expansive labor contract reached between the \n     United Auto Workers and Ford Motor Co. in September 2003 \n     includes six pages of rules governing the use of temps. Under \n     the agreement, Ford can bring on a temporary worker for a \n     maximum of 89 days, after which the worker must be hired or \n     dismissed. Most temps can only work two days a week, as well \n     as ``premium'' days such as holidays.\n       Just 62 miles west of the Toyota plant, the UAW made a \n     stand at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant, refusing even to \n     countenance 89-day temps.\n       ``It's a big, big deal,'' said Mike Stewart, the UAW's \n     building chairman at the plant in Louisville. ``Any time you \n     get this kind of [compensation] divide, it just means less \n     people making less money who can't afford your product. We \n     will always keep temps to a minimum.''\n       The use of temporary workers appears to be most pervasive \n     in plants owned by foreign companies, which tend to locate in \n     states where laws make union organizing difficult, said Susan \n     N. Houseman, a researcher at the independent W.E. Upjohn \n     Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, MI. One \n     Japanese auto parts plant estimated that a 5 percentage point \n     reduction in the share of temps in the workforce would \n     increase total labor costs by $1 million over a year, an \n     Upjohn study found.\n       At BMW's auto plant near Greenville, SC, about 175 \n     temporary workers supplement a production workforce of 3,500, \n     keeping the assembly line churning out Z-4 roadsters and X-5 \n     sport utility vehicles for the U.S. and global market through \n     lunch hour and break times, said Robert M. Hitt, a spokesman \n     for BMW Manufacturing.\n       At Faurecia S.A., a BMW supplier in nearby Fountain Inn, \n     SC, about a third of the workers making door panels, consoles \n     and dashboards for the Z-4 are temps, said Campbell Manning \n     of Palmetto Staffing Group Inc., the temporary employment \n     agency that staffs the French auto parts supplier.\n       ``They don't hire permanent,'' she said. ``After 90 working \n     days, they used to roll onto the payroll. Now they just keep \n     them as long-term temps.''\n       Palmetto Staffing charges Faurecia a flat $12-an-hour for \n     each of its temps. If Faurecia hired its own permanent \n     workers, expenses for workers compensation insurance, \n     unemployment insurance and other demands would add $4 to $5 \n     onto a $9-an-hour wage. Benefits would add more.\n       Even the temps cannot argue with the logic of hiring a \n     lower-cost workforce. ``I don't really blame Toyota,'' said \n     Roy Biddle, who went to work at the Georgetown plant at the \n     same time Phil Hicks did, nearly four years ago, with similar \n     assurances that he would land a full-time job after a year. \n     ``The law's the law, and they're just doing what they can do \n     under the law.''\n       To temper expectations, Toyota last year implemented a new \n     policy capping temporary employment at two years. After that \n     period, workers must leave, but can reapply in six months. If \n     hired again, a worker starts at the entry wage of $12.60 an \n     hour, compared with more than $14 per hour if they have been \n     there for a few years.\n       About 160 long-term temporaries, like Biddle and Hicks, \n     were grandfathered in and allowed to stay indefinitely.\n       Nancy Johnson, director of the Center for Labor Education \n     and Research at the University of Kentucky, said that because \n     of the new policy, temps now cycle from one plant to another, \n     working at Toyota, then at nearby E.D. Bullard Co., making \n     fire helmets, then perhaps at an auto parts supplier before \n     heading back to Toyota.\n       At the Kentucky State Cabinet for Health and Family \n     Services' community office in Georgetown, social workers say \n     more Toyota temps are applying for state aid to cover food \n     costs and medical bills.\n       ``It's the traditional Japanese model that people talked \n     about in the '80s,'' Johnson said. ``Toyota never lays people \n     off, sure, but the temps are absorbing the financial swings \n     of all these companies, and they're doing it at a price.''\n       Rick Hesterberg, a plant spokesman, noted that $12 to $14 \n     an hour in central Kentucky compares favorably to wages even \n     for some permanent jobs. ``These people still make good \n     money,'' he said of the temps. ``It's nothing to snuff your \n     nose at, at least in this part of the country.''\n       But many Toyota temps say their problems go beyond money. \n     Indeed, life seems always on the edge of disaster, where even \n     rewards--the small gift bag of cookie cutters or the ``Star \n     Performer'' T-shirts that are given out to temps--seem more \n     like petty humiliations. In February, a Toyota temp posted an \n     anonymous ``discussion'' paper in the assembly-line men's \n     rooms, pleading ``the `E' word, `E' for exploitation.''\n       ``There are temps at [Toyota] who have been here for 3 \n     years, some approaching 4 years, many waiting for the \n     permanent job offer,'' the essay reads. Toyota ``is \n     exploiting their patience, their economic status, their work \n     ethic, their work contribution, their reliability, their \n     health, their safety.''\n       Chris, a graduate of Western Kentucky University, once \n     interned at Toyota during college, doing computer-aided \n     design and drafting. He spoke on condition that his last name \n     would not be used. Even with a degree and an internship on \n     his resume, he, too, was steered to Manpower as the only door \n     into Toyota. But unlike the other temps, he figured his \n     temporary stint would quickly lead not just to the factory \n     floor, but to the white-collar suites.\n       Now, after four years, he frets that his wife wants a \n     second child but he's not sure how they'll pay for the \n     insurance.\n       ``These people are making extreme sacrifices, working \n     second shift, no benefits, low pay,'' fumed Matt Roberts, 31, \n     a full-time Toyota worker since 1997. ``It's a disgrace to \n     the American dream. That's what it is.''\n       For years, the United Auto Workers has tried to unionize \n     the Toyota plant, to no avail. Recently, the use of temps has \n     become a major issue. For full-time workers, the temps \n     present a quandary. On the one hand, the full-time workers \n     may see the temps as Toyota does, a buffer protecting their \n     jobs. The more low-paid workers there are at the plant, the \n     more profitable the company will be, and the less likely to \n     resort to layoffs, suggested David Cole, director of the \n     Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. A union \n     might threaten that buffer by demanding that temps be brought \n     on full-time or dismissed.\n       ``The temps may help keep the union out,'' Cole said. \n     ``It's in the selfish, vested interest of the full-time \n     workers to keep more temps.''\n       But some Toyota workers do not see it that way. Several \n     full-time employees said\n\n[[Page S11241]]\n\n     the growing presence of temps at the plant is holding back \n     their wage gains, while limiting their movement in the plant. \n     Some employees say they have been stuck working nights \n     because any open day-shift positions are quickly filled by \n     temps.\n       ``If you break down, they've got a new guy waiting at the \n     door,'' said Roberts, who with his wife, another Toyota \n     worker, clears a six-figure income. ``You're creating a tug \n     of war. There's no protection for either side.''\n       In Georgetown, the divisions can show up in strange, some \n     say demoralizing, ways.\n       Toyota is famous for the ``kaizen''--continuous \n     improvement--checks that it pays to workers who come up with \n     suggestions that save money. Earlier this year, Hicks and \n     Chris helped devise a change that cut two jobs from their \n     small quadrant of the assembly line. The change meant more \n     work for everyone, but it was more efficient. Toyota rewarded \n     the idea by sending out $500 checks to every member of the \n     team, every full-time member, that is.\n       The two temps who came up with the suggestion got nothing. \n     Their group leader did feel bad. He gave each of them a $25 \n     gift certificate to the Toyota company store.\n       Then a full-time worker slipped them both $50.\n       ``You guys got us this money,'' Chris recalled him saying. \n     ``Sorry I can't give you more.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The article does track one slice of the workforce: \ntemporary workers. Since January 2002, the nation has added 369,000 \ntemporary positions, about half of the private-sector jobs created \nduring that stretch.\n  This report says half of all the private sector jobs created under \nthis Administration since January 2002 are temporary positions. These \nare jobs without benefits. You talk about health insurance or \nretirement? Those are virtually nonexistent.\n  This is what is happening in this country. It is amazing to me to \nhear the President talk about how the economy is growing and crow about \nthe increased numbers of jobs that we had--96,000 this last month, \nwhich is not even enough to keep up with the growth of the population. \nAnd then we find a third of those jobs are Government jobs, a third are \ntemporary jobs, and the other third are not paying very much.\n  I want to also mention that, as difficult as this is, those are \nfigures that point out what happens to real people in their lives. But \nwhatever happens to these individuals I have just mentioned pales in \ncomparison to the kind of pain minorities and women are feeling; women, \nwhose real income has declined, and minorities--Hispanics, African \nAmericans--whose unemployment has increased dramatically.\n  I see the Senator from Maryland on his feet now. I am interested in \nhis reaction to that hearing and to those figures.\n  Before I run out of time, I would also like him to address the \nsubject of the foreign purchase of over half of the U.S. debt. Nearly \n$2 trillion of the national debt is now owned by foreign holders. \nRecent figures show China and Japan owning $1.3 trillion in U.S. \nTreasuries. I am concerned these foreign nations are basically buying \nup America. We know who has the whip in hand when you control the \nresources. One morning we will wake up and foreign countries will own \nAmerica. If they control our economy, then they control our destiny. \nThe American economy and American destiny ought to be in Americans \nhands.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that last point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The fact of the matter is, the tax cuts for the very \nwealthy, which is the centerpiece of the Bush economic plan, are being \nfinanced by borrowing overseas, primarily from China and Japan. That is \nwhat it comes down to. We do these excessive tax cuts, we run a \ndeficit, and we have to finance the deficit. Where do they find the \nmoney to finance the deficit? They sell U.S. Government paper overseas, \nprimarily to Japan and China. So we are borrowing money from overseas \nin order to finance these tax cuts.\n  It is bad enough to borrow internally, from our own people, in order \nto do this. But to go overseas and do it, as the Senator points out, \nand then give them this claim on American production on out into the \nfuture as far as one can see is absolutely irresponsible.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts made a very important point.\n  The President and his associates are busy out in the countryside \ntrying to put the spin on the jobs figures. The fact is, the economy \npicked up 96,000 jobs last month. That is not enough to keep pace with \nthe growth in population. This is the first administration since \nHerbert Hoover not to produce a net gain of jobs in the course of the \nadministration. The Bush administration is down 800,000 jobs, a total \nof 1.6 million private sector jobs, and 2.7 million manufacturing jobs.\n  The last time you have an administration which failed to have a net \ngain in jobs in the course of its 4 years was 75 years ago in the \nadministration of Herbert Hoover. This is a dismal job performance \nrecord. Yet the President is going around the country telling people we \nhave turned the corner. The trouble is every time you go around the \ncorner we are going in the wrong direction. That is the problem with \nthe President's policies. He may have turned the corner, but the corner \nis taking us in the wrong direction.\n  Second, as the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out, if you factor \ninto the unemployment rate the people who have dropped out of seeking a \njob because they are so discouraged by the economic conditions they \nencounter, and people are working part time for economic reasons--\nnamely, they want to work full time but they can't find a full time \njob, so they are working part time--if you include that in the \nunemployment figure as well, which is the most comprehensive measure of \nunemployment, the unemployment figure is 9.4 percent, coming up to 10 \npercent unemployed.\n  The final point I want to make is that unemployment benefits \nusually--and it is a very important point because I see many colleagues \non the floor who have joined with the Senator from Massachusetts and \nmyself to try to extend unemployment insurance benefits, and the \nSenator from Washington was very much involved in that effort and we \nwelcome so strongly her leadership in it--usually are for 26 weeks. \nWhen we hit an economic downturn, we extend it because the job market \ndoesn't pick up quickly enough to get people back to work. We usually \nextend it out to 39 weeks. The administration has resisted efforts to \nextend the payment period for unemployment insurance. We now have a \nrecord number of long-term unemployed.\n  This is the record even before the Bush administration of the long-\nterm unemployed. It ran along here, and now it has shot up to almost 22 \npercent of those unemployed who have been long-term unemployed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in this article, besides the \nadministration being against the increase in the minimum wage, they are \nagainst unemployment compensation and against overtime. In this report \nin 1982, there were 417,000 workers classified temporary. Today, there \nare 2.5 million. This is about equal to the number of manufacturing \njobs lost in the past decade.\n  These are the statements that we have about how good the economy is.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. We are confronting a \nvery serious economic situation for our workers. There is real \nanxiety--indeed even fear--in working America about what is going to \nhappen to people in terms of their employment and how they support \ntheir families. But we are not producing jobs fast enough to put people \nback to work. Yet the administration won't support extending payments \nfor unemployment insurance.\n  How are these people supposed to support their families? These are \nworking people. By definition, you cannot draw unemployment insurance \nbenefits unless you have a work record. You must have been working and \nhave built up a working record in order to qualify. We are talking \nabout working Americans. How do they support their families?\n  The President talks about 95,000 jobs as though it is some success. \nIt is not a success. This is the only President in 75 years in that \nentire period of time who has not had a net gain of jobs during his \nadministration.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I see my time has expired. I thank \nmy friend from Maryland for his excellent observations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11241-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11241-S11245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHRISTOPHER REEVE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

But in real life, Christopher Reeve was a super person, a \ntruly wonderful individual who embodied the indomitable human spirit in \na way that won the respect and admiration of people across the globe.\n  Christopher Reeve was a classic example of a person with a disability \nwho is remembered most of all for his ability, not his disability--the \nabilities that he mobilized to become an extraordinarily effective \nadvocate for stem cell research.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his eloquent and \nstraightforward presentation of the arguments on behalf of embryonic \nstem cell research.\n  But I want to commend the memory of Christopher Reeve. He marshaled \nforces, he traveled all over this country at great expense, and at \ngreat cost to himself personally in terms of his own health, to marshal \nthe forces necessary to promote embryonic stem cell research.\n  He spoke with passion and intelligence and conviction. Christopher \nReeve offered hope--not a false or idle hope. He offered hope grounded \nin science and discovery, hope grounded in the promise in possibilities \nof embryonic stem cell research. Forty-two Nobel laureates--I think \nmaybe many of them because Christopher Reeve called them on the phone \nand visited--came out in strong support of embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  Just yesterday there was a march here in Washington by families and \nsurvivors of those who had ALS, Lou Gehrig's Disease. One of those \nmarchers was a staff person of mine whose father just passed away from \nALS. She and her mother were both in that march yesterday.\n  Christopher Reeve's argument for stem cell research was compelling. \nIt was beyond personal. Yes, he did speak once about his own personal \nspinal cord injury and stem cell research at Ohio State University in \n2003 at a commencement address.\n  He said:\n\n       I come to know people of all ages and from all walks of \n     life that I would otherwise never have even met. For all our \n     differences, what we had in common was our disability and the \n     desire to find a reason to hope. I was inspired by so many \n     and gradually discovered that I had been given a job that \n     would create urgency and a new direction in my life. I could \n     do something to help.\n\n  Christopher Reeve really did do a lot to help.\n  Senator Specter as chairman and I as cochair of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services held the first hearing \non December 2, 1998, after Dr. Thompson of Wisconsin and Dr. Gerhart of \nJohns Hopkins isolated the first stem cells. I am proud that our \nsubcommittee had 15 hearings on this issue. At more than one of those \nhearings it was determined that we did have the authority to do stem \ncell research from embryos. That was determined. That was determined \nbefore August of 2001.\n\n  I also point out that Christopher Reeve very eloquently testified at \none of those early hearings on the necessity of embryonic stem cell \nresearch. We decided that the Government did have the authority. It is \nthe President's Executive order of August 9, 2001, that limited what we \ncould do.\n  When the President says that he is the first President to authorize \nstem cell research, that is not so, as Senator Kennedy pointed out. He \nis the first President to limit, severely restrict, what we could do in \nstem cell research. The President said all the stem cells that were \nderived prior to 8 p.m. on August 9, 2001, could be used. Anything \nafter that could not be used.\n  I remember watching that address. I was in my home State of Iowa. I \nthought to myself, why 8 p.m.? Why not 8:05? How about 8:10? In other \nwords, if someone derives a stem cell at 7:59, it is okay, but at 8:01, \nit is not. What kind of arbitrary restriction is this? Totally \narbitrary.\n  Because of that, he said there would be 60 stem cell lines--and we \nknow there are only 22, and as the Senator from Massachusetts said \nevery single one of those is contaminated because they used mouse cells \non which to grow. So their use in human treatments is highly unlikely, \nat best.\n  The fact is, embryonic stem cell research offers enormous potential \nto ease human suffering. That is why this person, Christopher Reeve, \nfought so hard. The promise of stem cell research gave Chris Reeve \nhope, just as it gives hope for those suffering from ALS, Parkinson's \ndisease, and diabetes, and all of their families. It is giving my \nnephew, Kelly McQuaid, hope. He was injured in the military. He is now \nquadriplegic and has been for over 20 years. He has hope that this stem \ncell research will allow him to again walk one day, just as Chris Reeve \nhoped it would for him.\n  We know stem cells have worked in rats. It has been proven that rats \nwith spinal cords that have been severed and reconnected with stem \ncells walk again. That has been done in rats. As I pointed out, we \nhumans are 99.5 percent rats--I don't mean just us politicians, I am \nsaying genomically, structurally, we are about 99 percent the same \ncells. If stem cells can get rats walking again, think of the hope it \nhas for humans. Yet this President says no.\n  There are those who say we cannot destroy these embryos because it is \nlife. This is something I have done before in my committee, and I did \nit once with Chris Reeve there. He liked it, so I will do it again in \nhis memory. I have a pen and a blank piece of paper. I hold this up and \nI ask if anyone can see what I put on that piece of paper. What I put \non that piece of paper is a dot, a little dot. That is the size of the \nembryos we are taking the stem cells from--a dot you can barely see on \na piece of paper.\n  People say that is life. Of course it is life. Every cell has life. \nAll my skin cells have life. My hair cells have life. Sperm has life. \nEggs have life. But they say we cannot destroy these for stem cell \nresearch. They equate that somehow with this human being right here. \nThey equate this little dot that you can barely see with someone like \nChris Reeve. This is what we are taking the stem cells from, that \nlittle dot.\n  A lot of people think when we talk about embryonic stem cell research \nthat somehow we are destroying fetuses. They get this confused. So I \npoint out it is as big as a dot on a piece of paper. We will equate \nthat with this human or that dot with my nephew, Kelly McQuaid? This is \nthe promise of stem cell research.\n  We already have over 400,000 of these little dots that you can barely \nsee frozen in liquid nitrogen. They are left over from in vitro \nfertilization. Guess what happens, folks. They are being destroyed. The \ndots are in test tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen. Every so often when \nthe donors do not want them any longer--they had their children or they \nreached the age they do not want to have children--they can call up the \nin vitro clinic and say, We do not want those saved any longer, and the \ntest tube is cleaned out and is washed down the sink. It is either that \nor use them for stem cell research.\n  That is why I wanted to pay homage to Chris Reeve's memory today. He \nwas a great friend, a personal friend. I remember him coming to Iowa. \nMy sympathies to Dana, his wonderful wife, and their family. But rest \nassured, we will prevail.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today with a \nheavy heart to pay tribute to Christopher Reeve.\n  I was lucky to be able to call Christopher Reeve a friend.\n  His passion for life and for improving the lives of all Americans \nserves an inspiration to all of us.\n  He may have played the character of Superman in the movies, but he \nlived the role of a superman through his life.\n  I consider myself quite fortunate that our paths crossed on many \noccasions, in Vermont, at his home in New York, and in the halls of \nCongress.\n  Chris was an outspoken advocate for the arts.\n  As the co-founder of the Congressional Arts Caucus and, for several \nyears, the Chairman of the Senate Committee with jurisdiction over the \nNational Endowment for the Arts (NEA), Chris and I shared the belief \nthat Federal support for the arts was critical.\n  At a time when the NEA was under attack in 1995, I asked Chris to \ntestify before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on the \nimportance of the agency.\n  His testimony brought attention to the issue, and highlighted the \nrole that\n\n[[Page S11243]]\n\narts and education play in the lives of children.\n  To this day, I believe that his testimony and advocacy helped \npreserve the agency through very difficult times.\n  Later, I turned to Chris again for help, this time on the important \nissue of lifetime caps on health insurance policies.\n  In 1996, as the Congress was writing new laws governing the \nportability and availability of health care coverage, Chris helped me \ngather support for a proposal to raise the lifetime caps of health \ninsurance policies.\n  Chris was an outspoken advocate in support of that proposal, and \nshared his own personal story concerning health insurance to raise \nawareness for the lifetime cap issue.\n  His courage and leadership brought that issue to the forefront of the \nCongressional debate.\n  His dedication to stem cell research was renowned.\n  His testimony before the Congress and advocacy for the issue--once \nagain--put a human face on the possibilities that could emerge from \nstem cell research for those with spinal cord injuries and other \ndiseases and afflictions.\n  Chris' commitment to bettering the lives of individuals with \ndisabilities never ended.\n  In 2000, Chris traveled to Burlington, VT, at my request to speak \nbefore a disability conference.\n  It was his first visit back to Vermont since his accident.\n  He called the disability movement the last great civil rights \nmovement, saying the primary obstacle for the disabled is other \npeople's fear.\n  Chris said:\n\n       Changing the public's perception of people with \n     disabilities takes time. It's about them getting over their \n     fear. Imagining that it could be them.\n       And once they know that, once they can really sympathize, \n     then you get change.\n       And then America lives up to its full potential.\n       And I think we're on that path.\n\n  Thanks to Christopher Reeve countless Americans will live to their \nfull potential.\n  We will continue to work on his behalf on the issues he was so \ndedicated to.\n  I send my deepest condolences to Chris' wife, Dana, and their entire \nfamily.\n  They cared for Christopher with a love and kindness that was \ninspirational.\n  Dana herself was an inspiration to all of us. She understood the \ndevotion and greatness of Chris. She helped Chris live out his desire \nto help the disabled.\n  I hope they are comforted with his memory, and the knowledge that \ntheir loss is shared by so many across this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is now recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \nvery eloquent presentation. I agree with him 100 percent. I also thank \nthe Senator from Massachusetts for his presentation.\n  As the senior Senator from California, a lifelong Californian, I will \nmake a few remarks about Chris Reeve.\n  I remember when I saw Chris Reeve in ``Superman.'' He was 25 years \nold. He was amazing. We now learn he did some of his own stunts. And \nthen what followed was the ``5th of July,'' and I remember ``Somewhere \nin Time.'' We saw this tall, handsome actor, seemingly invulnerable.\n  I remember the film footage when he went over that jump on a horse. \nWe learned that he had severed a vertebra high in his neck which \ncanceled out all speech and rendered him quadriplegic for the rest of \nhis life.\n  As many know, it is rare that an individual survives more than 2 \nyears with this form of injury. Yet he survived for 9 years. I remember \nlistening to a CNN interview with Paula Zahn over stem cells. He said: \nWhen somebody lies still and doesn't move anything for a matter of \ndays, cannot even scratch their nose, let them talk to me about stem \ncell research.\n  In fact, this is a catastrophic injury presenting him with a \ncatastrophic problem. So many people suffer from many of these injuries \nand from catastrophic disease, all of which may well be helped if we go \neagerly, enthusiastically, and scientifically into stem cell research. \nThat is the challenge. Parkinson, diabetes, Alzheimer's, spinal cord \ninjuries all can be helped.\n  Yet Christopher Reeve, who could not move, made amazing progress--not \na recovery but progress--and would appear here before hearings and hold \npress conferences and urge us to move forward with a stem cell bill.\n  I had the pleasure of introducing the first stem cell bill in this \nSenate. There are five Members--the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch; the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy; the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Specter; the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin--who are cosponsors of \nthe major stem cell bill. We will be back. We will reintroduce it as \none of our first bills in January in this new session. I will be asking \nmy colleagues to rename this bill the Christopher Reeve National Stem \nCell Act.\n\n  I want all of America, through this bill, to know Chris Reeve's last \n9 years on Earth were not, in fact, in vain, that we will produce a \nbill that will, in fact, put America on the scientific horizons of \nresearch for catastrophic and disabling diseases and injuries. If we do \nnot, I believe other States will follow with what California is doing.\n  California has on the ballot a proposition. It is known as \nproposition 71. It would produce $3 billion in bond funds to allow \nCalifornia to plunge ahead to produce stem cell research. Now, other \nStates will follow if we do not move with a national bill. So I hope we \nwill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to change that by unanimous \nconsent to 15 minutes and ask if the Chair would notify me when I have \n2 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nwhat she said. This tax bill came about because we got into a fight \nwith our trading partners over export subsidies. At the end of the \nfight, they won and we lost. An export subsidy that we had in the \nUnited States had to be taken off the books. So what was a minor \nfacelift when it came to an export subsidy turned out, after our \nfriends in the House and Senate got their hands on it, to be an extreme \nmakeover of the Tax Code. Unfortunately, the American people, who could \nnot afford the powerful lobbyists involved in writing this, ended up as \nthe people with the sad faces.\n  So when we take a close look at what this bill did, what was supposed \nto be a quick and minor fix of the Tax Code blossomed into a huge \ngiveaway of tax benefits and made some policy changes we are going to \nregret.\n  I have been fighting the tobacco companies as long as I have been in \nCongress but 15 years ago passed the law which banned smoking on \nairplanes. The passage of that law led to some very important things \nhappening in the U.S. Government and across the board. But I mistakenly \nbelieved that the trend was on our side, that those of us who wanted to \nprotect children from becoming addicted to tobacco really had the wind \nat our backs.\n  Well, we lost it in this conference committee because we put in the \nconference report a provision which the major tobacco company, Philip \nMorris/Altria, agreed on which said if we are going to buy out tobacco \ngrowers, then we are going to put FDA regulation in place so we can \nprotect children from being sold tobacco products that lead to an \naddiction that can lead to disease or death.\n  It was a good, balanced bill, a bipartisan bill. Senator DeWine, a \nRepublican of Ohio, and Senator Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, put \ntogether this FDA regulation. We sent it to conference and those \nconferees who put together this monstrous bill ripped it out.\n  Instead, they said, we are going to give billions of dollars to buy \nout tobacco growers but not one penny to protect children from the harm \nof tobacco products.\n  I will return next year, God willing, to renew this battle with my \ncolleagues. We cannot give up on our children as this bill did. It is \nnot the only thing wrong with the bill. It is the one that touches me \npersonally and one about which I feel strongly.\n\n[[Page S11244]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The bill that was passed by the Senate contained within \nit the provision that provided authority to the FDA to protect \nchildren; is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And that provision was then taken out in the conference \nwith the House Members, stripped out of the bill; is that right?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Maryland is correct. What they took out \nof the bill was the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to \nlist the ingredients on a tobacco package, to put on a warning label \nthat really means something, as opposed to the meaningless warning \nlabels that have been on for 30 or 40 years, and to establish standards \nand rules for selling tobacco products so children won't become \naddicted.\n  I have never met a parent who has said to me: I am so happy. I just \nlearned my teenage daughter has started smoking.\n  I have never heard that said. There isn't a single one of us who has \nreared a child who ever wanted to hear they were going to take up \nsmoking or cigarette tobacco. This bill established protections. Those \nprotections were removed. Those tobacco lobbyists who have a big grin \non their faces today, because we passed this bill by a big rollcall, \nshould understand their children are at risk, too. The children of \nfamilies across America are at risk as well.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say a word, too, about Christopher Reeve. I woke \nup this morning in Chicago before flying here and heard the news, as \ndid most Americans, about the death of Christopher Reeve at the age of \n52. I saw him in the movies--we all did--``Superman'' and others. He \nwas quite a handsome young actor who attracted a lot of attention at \nthe height of his career. Then about 9 years ago he was involved in an \naccident which left him a quadriplegic.\n  I remember the photos of Chris Reeve after this happened. There were \nphotos of a man in a wheelchair on a ventilator who looked as if he was \njust hanging on to life by a thread. He hung on for 9 years, and he \ndidn't just survive, he used his life and used it heroically.\n  Let me also say I thought so many times about his wife Dana and their \nfamily. Those of us who are married said we would stand by our mate for \nbetter or for worse, richer or poorer, in sickness and in health. You \nnever quite know what that vow means until you see someone like Dana, \nthe wife of Christopher Reeve, who stood with him, helped him every \nminute of every day so he could survive.\n  And he didn't just survive. He fought. What did he fight for? He \nfought for medical research so people just like him and others who \nwould be victimized like him might have a fighting chance in life. He \ncame here to Capitol Hill and testified, held news conferences, \ntraveled around the United States with the message.\n  Why is it important that we not just eulogize this brave man and the \n9 years of his life where he showed such courage? Because the issue he \nwas fighting for is an issue we will all get to vote for on November 2.\n  Christopher Reeve and many like him, such as Michael J. Fox, \nunderstand that embryonic stem cell research gives them hope, a chance \nto overcome quadriplegia, a chance to overcome Parkinson's disease, a \nchance for the millions of families who see their beautiful young son \nor daughter with juvenile diabetes, just a chance that the research \nwill open the door to find a cure, really breakthrough scientific \nresearch involving tiny stem cells that you can only see under a \nmicroscope.\n  Why is this important? Because this administration, the Bush \nadministration, has taken the position that the Federal Government must \nclose the door to embryonic stem cell research and only limit it to a \nhandful of these stem cell lines that were existing on August 2001 when \nPresident Bush announced he had in his own mind reached a compromise on \nthis issue. It may have been a political compromise to President Bush, \nbut it compromises the future for millions of Americans.\n  Some people argue it is a partisan issue: Durbin, you're a Democrat \ncriticizing a Republican President.\n  Listen closely: No one has ever suggested that Nancy Reagan is not a \ngood Republican, and she stood up to fight for embryonic stem cell \nresearch. And Orrin Hatch, a Republican Senator from Utah, has stood up \nto do the same, and Arlen Specter, another Republican, has stood up to \ndo the same. This is not a partisan issue.\n  The position we take on this issue is to take the politics out of \nscience. We have an opportunity for Christopher Reeve and people such \nas him to give them hope and a chance that medical research is going to \nopen doors and make lives better.\n  Some want this to be a debate on religion. There are some, by \nreligious belief, who do not endorse embryonic stem cell research. We \nbetter take care if that is going to be the standard. We could be \nwalking into a very dangerous area.\n  There are some, by religious belief, who don't believe in blood \ntransfusions. So should we say at this point blood transfusions are \nimmoral for all Americans because one religion or another does not \nagree they are necessary to prolong life?\n  There are some, by religious belief, who believe medical doctors \nshould not be turned to but the power of prayer should cure your \nillness. Should we take that as a moral position for America and say \nthat we cannot encourage medicine in America? I think not. So why in \nthis area, when it comes to medical research, are we going to close the \ndoors that the Bush administration has to the hopes for Christopher \nReeve and many like him, and for millions across America?\n\n  In just a few days, there will be a debate between President Bush and \nSenator John Kerry--the last one--in Arizona, about the economy. I hope \nthere is an opportunity for John Kerry to point out these facts:\n  Forty-seven States under the Bush administration have had a loss of \nmanufacturing jobs. I am sure this chart is hard to see on television. \nIn Illinois we lost 135,800 manufacturing jobs in the last 4 years; \nalmost 40,000 in Missouri; 23,000 plus in Iowa; 52,500 in Wisconsin; \n152,000 in Pennsylvania; 164,000 manufacturing jobs lost under the Bush \nadministration in Ohio; 10,000 in West Virginia. The list goes on and \non for 47 States. These are the jobs we have lost.\n  Trust me, when these jobs are lost, they are not replaced with jobs \nthat pay as much or that offer the same kind of benefits. These \nfamilies are going to have a tough time getting back to where they \nwere. Why has this happened? The Bush administration's economic \npolicies have failed. Tax breaks for the wealthiest people in America \nhave not given us the kind of economic boost that the President \npromised.\n  Look at what has happened in the Bush economy when it comes to \nAmerican families' household income. It is down over $1,500 since the \nPresident took office. We have lost ground. We have lost ground for \nfamilies who get up and work hard every day to try to make ends meet.\n  Take a look at what happened with unemployment figures. The Senator \nfrom Maryland got up and told us we have just set a record of 24 \nstraight months of long-term unemployment at record levels. We have \nnever had that bad a period of time or that bad a stretch in modern \neconomic history in America. It means you have been unemployed for more \nthan 6 months. Look at the numbers that they have grown under the Bush \nadministration, where out-of-work Americans are running out of \nunemployment benefits.\n  This President insists that he is not going to rest until every \nAmerican has a job. This President is not going to get much rest \nbecause there are a lot of Americans who have lost jobs. Over 800,000 \nnet jobs were lost under President Bush's administration, which is the \nlowest job creation number by any President of any political party in \nover 70 years. And this President is offering us 4 more years? I have \nto ask, as Senator Kerry did, can America take 4 more years of this?\n  This administration's approach to the economic problems in America is \nnot taking care of business. Look what is happening to the workers who \nare working harder. Productivity is up 15 times between 2001 and 2004. \nYet wages are stagnant and falling. The harder our people work in \nAmerica, the less\n\n[[Page S11245]]\n\nthey are paid. That is the American dream? Perhaps it is to President \nBush but not to the families across America.\n  Meanwhile, how are corporate profits doing in the recession, the \nstruggling economy? Very well, thank you. They are up 65 percent under \nthe Bush administration, while workers' wages are going down. The rich \nare getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, and the middle-income \nfolks are feeling the squeeze. That, unfortunately, is the reality of \ntheir tax policy.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is unparalleled in coming out of a recession that so \nmuch of the growth is going to profits and so little of the growth is \ngoing to wages. It is a stark contrast with what occurred as we tried \nto move out of previous recessions in the entire post-World War II \nperiod.\n  The point the Senator makes is extremely important. Productivity is \nup. The workers are producing, but they are not getting a return in \ntheir wages. The benefits are going heavily into corporate profits. The \nSenator is absolutely correct. And it is a marked departure with \nprevious performance, where there was a much more equitable sharing of \nthe economic benefits of the growth that was taking place, and the wage \nearner was doing better than under the circumstances we face today.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In closing, the Senator from Maryland will speak when I \nfinish and talk about the economic statistics, facts, and figures. That \nis the one thing we believe on this side of the aisle.\n  If this election is to be decided by facts and evidence, the American \npeople will vote for a new vision of America, a stronger economy at \nhome, and more respect for America around the world. But if we are \ngoing to let this campaign disintegrate in the last 3 weeks into \nsloganeering and name-calling, who knows what the outcome will be. We \ntrust the facts and the evidence. This administration has failed to \nmove this economy forward for working families. It has pushed a tax \npolicy that not only doesn't help them, in many instances it penalizes \nthem.\n  Look at what families are up against under the Bush administration. \nThe cost of medical care and health insurance, up 59 percent; gasoline \nis up 38 percent; college tuition is up 38 percent; housing costs are \nup 27 percent. Even the cost of a bottle of milk is up 13 percent. When \nthis President says in Arizona in the next debate that America is \nbetter off under his administration, he isn't feeling the pain families \nfeel every single day when they try to make ends meet.\n  Mr. President, this election is going to be a historic turning point \nfor America. We are either going to move toward 4 more years of the \nBush administration, with economic policies that have taken a toll on \nthe hardest working people in the world, or we are going to move \nforward with a new vision to help families have a better life for \nthemselves and their children.\n  We are going to decide, when it comes to foreign policy, if we are \ngoing to continue to squander the reputation and good name that America \nhas built up over many decades or whether we are going to move to a new \nlevel of respect for America around the world. The choice is in the \nhands of the voters on November 2.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Maryland is now \nrecognized for up to 20 minutes under the previous consent order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11245-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11245-S11250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, on Friday the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics came out with the latest unemployment figures. I commend the \nBureau of Labor Statistics. They are professionals. They bring us the \nfigures. They do not try to put a spin on them. They just lay out the \nfacts. That is a kind of unusual thing in our public discourse \nnowadays, I have to say. We do not seem to pay much attention to the \nfacts anymore. It is all spin--spin, spin, spin, spin, deception, \nmisstatement, so forth and so on. But there are still professionals in \nvarious parts of our Government, and I simply at the outset commend \nthem for sticking to the facts. Members of the Joint Economic Committee \ntried to draw the Commissioner and her associates into the spin \nefforts, and she resisted, as she should.\n  I wish to talk this afternoon briefly about some of the figures and \nthe facts, and I will try to lay them out as best I can.\n  We produced last month 96,000 jobs--I say a mere 96,000 jobs because \nwe need to produce about 140,000 jobs per month simply to stay abreast \nof the growth in population. So if we are producing fewer jobs than \nthat, we are obviously slipping backward.\n  This performance of this administration should be a matter of very \ndeep concern for people in the country. Back at the beginning of the \nyear, the administration did have a couple of months of good, solid \nproduction, and I want to put that right up front because, as I said, I \nwant to stay with the facts. But what has happened is over the course \nof the year, their job production has fallen very sharply, as this \nchart shows. We are now down to just below 100,000 jobs produced in the \nlast month of this Bush administration.\n  The cumulative record of this administration over the course of the \ntime it has been here has been a loss of 1.6 million private sector \njobs. Private sector jobs are down 1.6 million. In total jobs, because \nwe have had some uptick in Government jobs, the administration is down \n825,000 jobs over the course of its tenure. It is down 825,000 total \njobs, 1.6 million private sector jobs, and 2.7 million jobs lost in \nmanufacturing employment. Manufacturing employment is down 2,700,000 \njobs.\n  This job performance--or more accurately put, lack of performance--is \nthe worst in 75 years. We have to go all the way back to the \nadministration of President Hoover to find another administration which \nlost jobs in the course of its tenure; in other words, failed to \nproduce a net gain of jobs. Some administrations in the interim have \ndone very well, others fairly well, others not so well. All have had a \nnet gain in jobs except for this administration.\n  The unemployment rate which was reported on Friday as 5.4 percent \ndoes not tell the full story of the depth and breadth of unemployment \nwhich exists in the country. If we count in amongst the unemployed--and \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps this index--if you count in people \nwho have dropped out of looking for a job because they are so \ndiscouraged by how poor the labor market is and a very substantial \nnumber of people who are working part time for economic reasons--in \nother words, they want to work full time, but they cannot find a full-\ntime job, so obviously in order to try to support their family, they \ntake a part-time job, but they are seeking a full-time job--if you \nfactor in that underemployment, and if you factor in the people who \ndropped out of the workforce in terms of seeking employment, we end up \nwith an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent--9.4 percent. That is what we \nare confronting. And that rate, of course, is a consequence of failing \nto have a net gain in jobs over the course of this administration.\n  I was fascinated to watch the spin artists go out and try to spin \nthis 96,000 figure into some big success. Quite to the contrary. It \nshows a serious shortfall in economic performance. And the thing that \nmakes it an even deeper concern is the fact that the administration's \nperformance over the course of this year in producing jobs has \nseriously weakened. In other words, if we go back to the beginning of \nthis year, job creation has dropped markedly.\n  Some of the spin is to sort of say 9/11 did it all. They attribute it \nall to 9/11, but obviously this chart indicates to the contrary because \nwe had some fair job production here, and then it has fallen. The \ncumulative impact of having that happen is, in fact, now to have an \nadministration which does not have a positive job creation performance \nover the course of its tenure.\n  Now, we all know that everyone gets up on the Senate floor and they \nmake long speeches about the best social program is a job. I agree with \nthat. I doubt that there is anyone in this body who would disagree that \nthe best social program is a job, but the jobs are not being produced.\n\n[[Page S11246]]\n\n  As I said, we can go back through our history to every previous \nadministration, Democratic and Republican alike, until we get back to \nHerbert Hoover, who had a net positive creation of jobs in the course \nof his tenure. This administration has failed to do that.\n  There are now 825,000 jobs less than when this administration came \ninto office. There are 1.6 million jobs less in the private sector. \nThere are 2.7 million jobs less in manufacturing, which, of course, has \nbeen the hardest hit of all, and which I think this administration has \nbadly neglected in terms of a whole range of policies. But 2.7 million \njobs less in manufacturing, 1.6 million jobs less in the private \nsector, 825,000 jobs less total, because there has been some increase \nin jobs in the public sector.\n  This is the performance of this administration. As I said, if one \nfactors in all of the components of unemployment, including those that \nhave part-time work but want full-time work, those who dropped out of \nthe labor force because they are so discouraged by the job market, we \nhave an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent.\n  There is one other point I want to make, which I think is highly \nrelevant, and it also, of course, affects efforts in this Congress to \ndeal with the unemployment insurance benefits question. We define long-\nterm unemployed as people out of work for more than 26 weeks--in other \nwords, more than 6 months. The unemployment insurance benefit program \nis geared to pay 26 weeks of benefits. The assumption is to help people \nthrough a difficult period to support their families.\n  I hasten to point out that one cannot draw unemployment benefits \nunless they have a work record. In other words, one must have worked \nand had a work record in order to qualify to draw these benefits.\n  In previous recessions, when the economy has not strengthened and \njobs have not picked up, we have extended the period of time to pay \nunemployment benefits because how can someone be told, after 6 months, \nwell, they should have found a job and gone back to work, when the job \nmarket has not picked up and there is no job to be found and they find \nthemselves in the difficult situation, how are they going to provide \nfor their family if the benefits are cut off and the benefits, of \ncourse, pay only a fraction of what they earn, and there is no job to \nbe found?\n  So now, we have extended the benefits as a consequence. We have done \nthat in this recession, but much less than previously. The \nadministration has not been supportive of further extension, even \nthough the number of long-term unemployed, amongst all the unemployed--\nin other words, people out of work for more than 6 months, has almost \ntripled. It has gone from 680,000 long-term unemployed when George Bush \ntook office as President in January of 2001--in other words, we have \nreally brought that figure way down because of the high job production \nthat had occurred in the Clinton administration. It is now up to \n1,750,000 long-term unemployed.\n  As a consequence, the percentage of the unemployed who are long-term \nemployed, in other words, a consequence of this incredible growth in \nthe long-term unemployed from 680,000 to 1,750,000, is almost triple. \nThe percentage of workers unemployed who are long-term unemployed has \njumped from about 10 percent to over 20 percent. It is now almost at 22 \npercent.\n  In this period, these high figures above 20 percent of the long-term \nunemployed, this percentage of unemployed workers, this rapid runup and \nthen this continuing high figure, is a record. It has been above 20 \npercent for 24 continuous months, which is dramatic evidence of the \nfailure of the economic policies of this administration.\n  These figures reflect real human hurt. These are men and women who \nhad jobs, who worked, who lost their jobs, and cannot find another job. \nAs a consequence, when their benefits run out and the administration \nand the Congress fail to extend their benefits, they find themselves in \nan incredibly difficult situation. How are they then to support their \nfamily?\n  We have made repeated efforts on the floor to extend the unemployment \ninsurance. They have been blocked by the other side. The administration \nhas not been supportive of this effort. So we have one and three-\nquarter million people long-term unemployed no longer eligible for \nbenefits, not able to find work in a job market last month, where they \nproduced 96,000 jobs. That is not even close to keeping abreast of the \ngrowth in population, let alone putting people back to work. In my \njudgment, there is no way that these economic figures can be spun to \nrepresent some economic success which is, of course, what the President \nhas gone across the country to try to do.\n  In fact, he keeps going into States and saying we have turned the \ncorner. I think when one looks around the corner that we have \nsupposedly turned, one finds we are moving in the wrong direction. This \nis not the right direction to be moving with respect to the long-term \nunemployed. Who would want to turn a corner and find that the long-term \nunemployed is rising from about 10 percent of those unemployed to over \n20 percent of those unemployed? This steady diet of over 20 percent for \n24 months is unparalleled. Who would want to turn the corner and find \nthat the monthly job creation was on this downward trajectory?\n  The President says we have turned the corner, and I say to myself, \nwell, let us look at what we see when we turn the corner. What we see \nwhen we turn the corner is this decline in job creation.\n  We see, when we take a look in context--in other words, when we look \nover the period--that this administration has not created a net gain in \njobs. It is no wonder that working people all across America are \nconcerned and anxious, not only those who have lost their jobs, but \nthose who fear they are going to lose their jobs, or those who maybe \nfound another job but found themselves in this situation, that the jobs \ngained on average pay $20,000 less than the jobs lost. In other words, \nyou have long-term unemployed who cannot find a job, you have people \nvery apprehensive about their job situation because the number of jobs \nproduced month by month is on a declining line, and then you have those \nwho manage to find a job only to find it is at pay levels far less than \nthey were previously receiving. The consequence of this is to put an \nenormous squeezing pressure on working and middle-income people in this \ncountry.\n  The costs of everything are up, wages are almost level, and all \nacross the country working families are sitting down at their kitchen \ntables, trying to figure out how they are going to pay their bills.\n  I said earlier, when we were having this discussion, that in this \neconomic cycle a far greater percentage of the benefits are going to \ncorporate profits than are going to wages. When you look at the \nfigures, it is absolutely startling the contrast with what we \nexperienced at this point in previous economic cycles. So there is a \ntremendous skewing of whatever benefits there are from growth to \nprofits and away from working people. This, I submit, ought to be a \nmatter of deep concern all across the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                          The American Economy\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have sat here for the last 2 hours 15 \nminutes and listened to a number of speeches by my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. I can only conclude that they are invoking the \nmemory of Mark Twain, who said: ``I am not one of those who when \nexpressing opinions confines myself to the facts.''\n  What I mean is I find it curious that speaker after speaker has \ncriticized the Bush administration, and indeed, the majority in this \nCongress, for our progrowth economic policies when, in fact, the \nresults of those policies worked to the betterment of the American \npeople and create hope and opportunity and not despair and hand \nwringing. The only thing I believe contributes to despair and hand \nwringing and increased anxiety among the American people, and indeed \nthe voters who are going to vote on November 2, are speeches made by \nsupporters of the Democratic nominee on this floor and elsewhere, \ntalking gloom and doom and despair as if America was no longer the last \nbest hope on the planet.\n  First, I wish to talk about the bill that was passed a couple of \nhours ago, the FSC/ETI bill, more appropriately\n\n[[Page S11247]]\n\nnamed the JOBS bill. I was proud to be 1 of the 69 Senators who voted \nin support of that bill, for a number of reasons. First, we were able \nto eliminate a 12-percent penalty against exported goods made by \nAmerican companies exported to the European Union. That is something \nthat was long overdue. We really would not have had to wait this long \nto do that but for some obstruction on the other side of the aisle.\n  The second reason I am proud to have voted for this bill is because \nit ends the discrimination against those States such as mine, Texas, \nwhich have no income tax. In Texas, we tend to adhere to the idea that \ngovernment should not be a burden any bigger than absolutely necessary \nupon the people who earn the money, so they can save it, they can \ninvest it, and small businesses can create jobs. So we do not have an \nincome tax. We have a sales tax.\n\n  But for many years now, Federal laws discriminated against States \nsuch as Texas and I believe Washington--I see the Senator from \nWashington on the floor. I believe her State was also affected by this \nchange. Now taxpayers in Texas can deduct the sales tax they pay from \ntheir Federal income tax. I am very pleased that 69 Members of the \nSenate today saw fit to end that unjustified discrimination.\n  The reduction in the corporate tax rate for manufacturers that was \naccomplished by the passage of this bill earlier today has effectively \nreduced the corporate tax rate for these manufacturers by 3 percent. In \nother words, the corporate tax rate in the United States, which is 35 \npercent across the board, has now been reduced 3 percent for this class \nof taxpayers--manufacturers. This will, no doubt, provide an \nopportunity for manufacturing concerns to increase their \ncompetitiveness in a global economy where they have to compete with \nmuch lower wage-paying countries, such as China and elsewhere.\n  It is curious, though, to me, that America still has one of the \nhighest corporate tax rates in the world. Indeed, the University of \nMichigan, in a study from the Office of Tax Policy Research, says that \nin 2002, the last year for which figures were ready available, the \naverage corporate tax rate for countries all across the world was 29 \npercent across the board--29 percent. America's is 35 percent, except \nfor now when this bill becomes law, it will be reduced for a certain \nclass of taxpayers in the manufacturing business.\n  This chart shows that, for example, the Slovak Republic has a 25-\npercent corporate tax rate. Indeed, this past year I was privileged to \ntravel from Bratislava, with other Members of the Senate, to represent \nthe United States at a meeting of the Presidents of the new members of \nNATO, including the Slovak Republic. We learned from the Ambassador \nthat, indeed because of the low corporate tax rates, that small country \nhad been able to attract three major car manufacturers to the country, \ncreating thousands of jobs, primarily because of the low corporate tax \nrate and because of the population that is eager and willing to work.\n  The fact is, our policies do impact our competitiveness in the global \neconomy, and have a direct impact on the quality of life and the \nprosperity of the American people, something I am afraid is too often \nignored.\n  I am so glad to see some of my colleagues from the other side of the \naisle who rail against reduction in taxes for individual taxpayers \nagreed--all of us combined--by a vote of 69 to 17 that lower taxes \npromote economic growth and promote greater job creation. That is \nexactly why I believe we were wise to pass this bill in the Senate \ntoday. Unfortunately, what we hear too often when talking about issues \nsuch as economics and job creation is a lot of cynicism. I heard \nsomeone on the floor today talking about elite corporate interests will \nbenefit when tax rates are lowered, or I think there was a reference \nmade by the Democratic nominee for President about Benedict Arnold \ncorporations are traitors, in effect, of America by taking jobs out of \nAmerica into other countries. I want to talk about that more in a \nminute. But what these amount to is a philosophy of claim to love the \nworker but hate the employer. In other words, speaker after speaker \ntoday claimed that the policies of this administration were hurtful to \nthe worker at the same time they claimed that the only ones who \nbenefitted were the big corporations.\n  The fact is you cannot claim to love the worker and hate the employer \nwho provides the worker their job. That is why I believe we need more \nprogrowth policies. I think we need to look at our tax policies across \nthe board.\n  We need to look at our civil justice system which imposes a tort tax \non every consumer in this country and which stymies innovation and \nbusiness growth and thus job growth.\n  We need to look at our regulatory policies which make it difficult \nfor America to compete. And, yes, we need to look at policies which \nwill provide greater opportunities for innovation not by the Federal \nGovernment but by the men and women, the risk takers, the investors and \npeople who create jobs all across this great land--indeed, all across \nthe world.\n  What I have heard earlier today with regard to condemnation of elite \ncorporate interests and the like also reminds me of some of the debate \nwe heard earlier about outsourcing. It is my view that a lot of the \ndebate on outsourcing is largely based on the same sort of \nfearmongering and anxiety and hammering we have heard generally today \nin attacks against this administration and its economic policies, not \non the facts. The facts are that markets are rational.\n  In other words, if a company can open a business here in the United \nStates or increase the size of its business, but because of a higher \ntax burden and more litigation risk environment, more regulation and \nthe like, they are going to take a look at places such as India, China, \nand Mexico, and other places that do not have a lot of those same \nregulatory and legal burdens and tax burdens.\n  One reason why America continues to prosper is because, of course, we \nhave what many places in the world do not have; that is, stability in \nthe rule of law that promotes security of investment. So we can \ncontinue to attract foreign dollars in this country.\n  For example, the Congressional Research Service has produced a \ndocument entitled ``Outsourcing and Insourcing Jobs in the United \nStates Economy, An Overview of Evidence Based on Foreign Investment \nData.''\n  This research document reveals that by 2003 U.S. firms accumulated \n$1.5 trillion worth of direct investment abroad compared to the $1.4 \ntrillion foreign investors spent to require or establish businesses in \nthe United States. For 2003 alone, foreign direct investment in the \nUnited States was about $82 billion, whereas U.S. direct investment \nabroad rose to about $155 billion in 2003.\n\n  As I said, markets tend to be rational. People, unlike the Federal \nGovernment, have to look at the bottom line and make sure that they \ndon't operate in the red and thus go bankrupt and risk going out of \nexistence. They have to be rational. They cannot make the kinds of \nemotional decisions that are made too often in the political realm.\n  But it is no wonder because of the regulatory environment, the tax, \nthe high taxes in this country, because of the legal system which \nunfortunately rewards a few at the expense of the many, that we are \nfinding more jobs going overseas. And there is something we can do \nabout it. The fact is we in this Congress are well situated to enact \nprogrowth policies which will decrease the likelihood that companies \nwill go overseas or outsource jobs to other countries and other \nlocations around the globe. But we are not doing the things we need to \ndo to promote growth right here at home and ensure greater employment \nopportunities for the American people.\n  For example, we know that one of the biggest drags on the economy and \non job creation is expensive oil imports. We know a barrel of oil is \ncurrently selling on the spot market in excess of $50 a barrel. We had \nan opportunity--and unfortunately we didn't avail ourselves of that \nopportunity--to pass an energy bill which I think would have created \nmore domestic production here in America, and we would have had a \ngreater supply, and thus bring the price down. But we didn't do it.\n  We have high natural gas costs because we simply have put too much of \nthe domestic supply out of our reach by moratoria and other policies \nwhich said we may have the gas but we are simply not going to explore \nand drill for it. It should be no surprise that the cost of natural gas \nis at historic highs.\n\n[[Page S11248]]\n\n  It is no surprise that gasoline is so expensive when regulations have \nresulted in no new refineries being created in the United States since \nabout the early 1970s. The fact is most of the refiners are operating \nat maximum capacity.\n  One reason for oil and gas being expensive is because emerging \neconomies such as China and India and others are consuming more and \nmore energy and thus driving up the price.\n  We had a chance to do something about that by passing an energy bill \nthis year, and we simply have been unable to do that because of \nobjections on the other side of the aisle.\n  We also know one reason companies don't come to America or don't \nexpand jobs here in America relative to other countries is because of \nour legal system. Unfortunately, we have a mentality in this country \nthat says frivolous lawsuits are simply the order of the day. We know \nthat the costs of those lawsuits are passed on ultimately to the \nconsumers who pay in effect a tort tax. We also know that it affects \naccess to health care which is another cost that businesses incur when \nthey do business in the United States as opposed to other countries.\n  We had a chance to pass medical liability reform to improve access to \nOB-GYN doctors, emergency room doctors, and the like. We had a chance \nto reduce the paperwork that adds about a quarter of the cost to the \nhealth care expenses incurred by Americans and by American businesses \nwhen they provide health care coverage to their employees. \nUnfortunately, these policies resulted in a large number of people \nsimply going without health insurance because of the cost.\n  If no one believes what I have said to this point about low taxes \nbeing progrowth and being in the best interests of the American people, \nand people who want to work, I think all we would have to do is look at \nwhat happened after we passed the historic tax relief and growth \npackage in 2003. We know in June 2003 unemployment rates in this \ncountry were at 6.3 percent. Today, they are 5.4 percent, a .9-\npercentage point difference lower.\n\n  We remember hearing day after day discussions about the jobless \nrecovery. The fact is, since August 2003, as a direct result of the \nprogrowth economic policies of this administration and the leadership \nof this Congress, according to the payroll survey, 1.9 million new jobs \nhave been created in the United States.\n  I heard one of the distinguished Senators refer earlier to ``we'' \nproduced new jobs. I am sure they did not mean to suggest that the \nFederal Government produced the jobs because we know the Federal \nGovernment does not produce jobs. More often than not, it is the \nburdens imposed by the Government on employers that kill new jobs. The \nfact is, if you look at the household survey--of course, we will get \ninto the difference between the payroll survey and the household \nsurvey--more and more Americans are no longer working in a traditional \nemployer-employee relationship. Indeed, they are pursuing their own \ndream by starting their own business. According to the household \nsurvey, 2.2 million new jobs have been produced since August of 2003.\n  We are seeing a restructuring of the economy not only in the United \nStates but globally. Obviously, we know there is going to be some human \npain associated with that. None of us likes, regardless of whether we \nare Republicans or Democrats or Independent, when anyone wants to work \nand they cannot find a job. Our goal should be to keep our eye on \nopportunities for everyone to live up to their potential, to get a job, \nto provide for their family.\n  Unfortunately, the antigrowth policies pursued by many of our friends \non the other side of the aisle in terms of bigger government, greater \ntaxation, more regulation, runaway litigation, have exactly the \nopposite effect. They limit opportunity; they limit jobs; they limit \ninvestment.\n  I have heard the President criticized time and time again today and \nelsewhere for his economic policies. But I remind my colleagues when \nthis President came into office, we were in a recession. Not only that, \na short time after he came into office, we had the terrible events of \nSeptember 11. Osama bin Laden himself said his goal was to establish \nabout $1 trillion of cost to the American economy. Indeed, we know that \nmuch of the economy suffered a body blow as a result of that tragedy \nover and above the human loss of life that we suffered on that terrible \nday.\n  Then we also know that the birds came home to roost, so to speak, on \ncorporate scandals, some of which are still being prosecuted, that \ncaused a tremendous loss of public confidence in our markets and in \nbusinesses, resulting again in further economic distress.\n  The truth is, during this administration the American economy and the \nAmerican people have had many challenges. One of those challenges has \nbeen the attacks not only on us as human beings but on our economy and \non the economy's ability to generate new jobs.\n  Despite all the hand wringing, despite the naysaying, despite those \nwho would claim there is no hope unless we get a new President on \nNovember 2, the fact is there is tremendous reason for hope and, \nindeed, tremendous reason to believe that it is the policies of this \nadministration and the leadership in this body as well as the House \nof Representatives that have caused, have created the conditions \nwhereby the risk takers, the investors, those who create jobs, do so, \nand they have done so at remarkable levels.\n\n  I used to be very skeptical of the speeches I have heard of the \nSenator from North Carolina, the Democratic Party's nominee for Vice \nPresident, who talks about two Americas. Indeed, sometimes in listening \nto the debate in the Senate today and elsewhere, maybe he is right--but \nnot quite in the way he says. There is one America that is hopeful, \nthat seeks opportunity and believes that everyone, no matter who they \nare, where they come from, or how they pronounce their last name, is \nentitled to pursue their dream, the American dream. On the other side, \nthere must be another point of view, another America, so to speak, for \nthose who believe they should pursue their political objectives by \nfearmongering, by hand wringing, and increasing the anxiety of the \nAmerican people when it comes to their job security by making \nfallacious claims about how good the economy really is and the policies \nthat have produced tremendous growth in the economy and tremendous \nopportunity for people who have previously been out of work.\n  Ultimately, we have to do two things: Continue to do what we have \ndone with regard to people who are out of work and provide temporary \nbenefits until they can get back on their feet and get back in the \nworkforce--not a permanent subsidy for not working but provide help for \nthose who are truly looking for work, and then we need to continue to \nprovide educational opportunity to every American.\n  We need to change our frame of mine when we think about education. \nWhen I was growing up, I somehow got this idea that I would go to \nschool and graduate from high school and then I would go to college and \nI would ``finish'' my education. The truth is, that is not what \nhappened. The truth is, it cannot happen in today's economy and in \ntoday's competitive work environment. The truth is, we need to change \nour frame of mind and commit ourselves to life-long learning. That is \none reason I appreciate the President's emphasis on community colleges, \nwhich in many areas of the country are working in conjunction with the \nprivate sector to learn what sort of skills need to be taught to a \nworkforce in order to get the good high-paying jobs that exist. Indeed, \ncommunity colleges are working closely with the private sector to do \njust that in places such as the State of Texas and elsewhere.\n  We need to recommit ourselves to education because the one area that \nAmerica has always surpassed its competition anywhere in the world has \nbeen in the area of innovation. It is our brain power, our spirit, our \nfreedom and opportunity that have made us the envy of the rest of the \nworld.\n  I cringe when I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, or \nwhen I hear on the political stump about hope being lost, about those \npeople not having opportunities anymore, about the American dream \nleading to a nightmare, because the facts, No. 1, contradict that; and, \nNo. 2, the only way that America can be defeated in a global \ncompetition is if we defeat ourselves and give up.\n  It was Professor Harold Laswell who called politics a fight over who \ngets\n\n[[Page S11249]]\n\nwhat, when, and how. If all we are going to talk about in the Senate \nand in Washington, DC, it is about who gets what, when, and how, we \nwill be defeating ourselves. Indeed, we need to continue to enact \nprogrowth policies that will provide opportunity for everyone in this \ncountry. If we ever lose sight of our vision as America being the last \nbest hope of freedom-loving people around the world, we will have hurt \nourselves and hurt the American people at the same time.\n  Finally, those in this Senate who complain so mightily about lower \ntaxes for individual taxpayers and use class warfare to talk about the \nrich not paying their fair share, these are the same people in many \ninstances who voted for this tax cut for corporations that manufacture \ngoods.\n  I think their vote today was right. I think their rhetoric, when they \ntalk about the President's policies and tax relief being wrong, is \nwrong, because it is higher taxes, more regulation, out-of-control \nlitigation, and a burdensome regulatory environment that are hurting \nAmerica's ability to compete in the global economy and are hurting the \nopportunity for American employers, including small businesses, to \ncreate those new jobs.\n  Indeed, I think any fair observer would conclude that it is the \npolicies of this administration and this Congress that have created \ngreater opportunity. I do not believe we should give in to the hand \nwringing, to the anxiety-provoking rhetoric, or, indeed, the \nfearmongering that happens way too often in our political discourse \nbecause the facts point to the fact America is still and--as long as we \nretain our commitment to progrowth policies--will continue to be the \nlast best hope of the world.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington has 8 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today to address the \nlegislation we passed earlier, but I say to the Senator from Texas, it \nhas been a pleasure working with him and the senior Senator from Texas \non issues that we are going to talk about, the sales tax deduction for \nindividual States.\n  But I also say that I know this side of the aisle very much believes \nin pro job-creation activities. As somebody who has been in the private \nsector and seen the job creation that can happen in the private sector, \nno, I do not believe Government creates jobs, but I do believe \nGovernment has an investment strategy, that we are a partner with the \nprivate sector; and a good investment strategy then allows for capital \nto flow to people who need it most.\n  I guess I would say that this bill is not the perfect solution, and \nnot what 51 Members on this side of the aisle would have drafted, as \nthere are certainly things that have been overlooked. I think we have \nheard about them, including Senator Landrieu's language about a $15,000 \ntax credit to employers that would help them maintain their employees \nwho have been called up by the National Guard and Reserve on their \npayrolls.\n  As the Senator from Maryland has articulated, another item is the \nunemployment benefits that would have worked to benefit many Americans \nwhile they can't find jobs, because jobs the job growth we have been \npromised has not happened. Unemployment benefits are, therefore, \nsomething to help keep economic stimulus in our communities.\n  Another is the fact that when we talk about community colleges and \njob creation, we really are not keeping pace with the training and \nretraining dollars from the previous years' budgets to actually help \nmake this transition.\n  I would just point out that while we are having this discussion today \nabout where we go further with the policy, it is a fact that this side \nof the aisle definitely believes in investing in the human \ninfrastructure, not just in the corporate side of the equation but in \nindividuals, for unemployment, for job training, for our National \nGuard, for people who need the help and support to continue to do their \njobs.\n\n  But let me address, if I may, the key issue I wanted to talk about; \nwhich is, the issue of tax fairness. It is ironic. My colleague talked \nabout this side of the aisle and tax fairness, the two issues about \nwhich I am going to talk.\n  The first one was actually implemented under a Republican \nadministration and a Republican Senate. That was in 1986, not allowing \nthe State of Washington and six other States in the Union to be able to \ndeduct their state and local sales taxes in lieu of state and local \nincome taxes from their Federal income tax.\n  Now, since I have been in the Senate, since 2001, I have worked to \nmake the deduction of state and local sales taxes from their federal \ntax liability permanent for my constituents. When I entered the Senate, \nI first worked with the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, who had \nintroduced legislation, and then later with Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison from Texas with whom together we have introduced legislation \nin the 108th Congress to reinstitute the state sales tax deduction. \nWashington and Texas have known a long time that we needed to restore \ntax fairness to the people of these States. And while we have passed, \nthis afternoon, legislation that restores that fairness temporarily for \nthe next 2 years, we need to continue to work to make it a permanent \nresolution for people in those States.\n  Restoring that sales tax deduction will help strengthen our economy. \nWhat people do not realize is that when the 16th amendment to our U.S. \nConstitution was ratified, in 1913, it said you could make the way for \na Federal income tax, and Congress allowed taxpayers to deduct State \nand local taxes so that income would not be taxed twice. That was what \nthe exemption was about.\n  So why, in 1986, after 74 years of a precedent, was this tax equity \nabruptly ended? As I said, I am just pointing out to my colleague, it \nwas actually done by a Republican Senate, a Republican administration. \nI am saying that only because we need to move forward in correcting \nthese policies, as the previous speaker said, and work together on \ncommonality.\n  The taxpayers from the States that were given this raw deal--I \nbelieve because it was a budgetary squeeze, not based on, I think, \nreally valid principles--it was a great impact to States such as mine, \nwhich has just over 60 percent of our State revenue coming from sales \ntax--about 61-point-three percent. So for us, that is a huge impact. \nWhen you are asking constituents not to be taxed twice by what they \npaid to the State and what they pay to the Federal Government, not \nbeing able to deduct that was an inequity in our tax laws. We know that \nfor Washington State this could mean as much as $421 million that would \nbe saved by taxpayers. I am sure the number is higher in many other \nStates around the country.\n  But it also means job creation. The Economic and Revenue Forecast \nCouncil in our State says that it would create as much as 2,000 to \n3,000 jobs, and it would be about a 50-cent stimulus for every $1 spent \nin Washington State. So for an economy that has been hard hit by this \nrecession and continues to have one of the highest unemployment rates \nin the nation, this is the kind of tax policy we think helps us grow \nour economy and create jobs.\n  But the bottom line is that after this period of time, after 18 \nyears, Washington State is finally--instead of getting a raw deal--\ngoing to get a fair deal, in the fact that residents are going to be \nable to deduct their sales tax from their Federal income tax \nobligation. So I think that is the kind of job-creation stimulus and \nfairness we need to be focusing on as we look at these tough choices.\n\n  Another issue that is bringing tax fairness to our State and to many \nother rural parts of our country is an issue that Senator Craig Thomas \nand I worked on, the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment \nProgram. That also was passed this afternoon as part of this \nlegislation.\n  What this bill did was to focus on the fact we are trying to get and \ncontinue to push rural health care needs.\n  We have a deficit in some parts of our country in getting doctors \ninto rural communities. We have had a great program on the books for a \nnumber of years. I am proud that a previous Senator from our State, \nWarren Magnuson, actually created the National Health Service Corps \nProgram. What it did was, it said to physicians, if you will go \npractice in rural communities, we will either give you a scholarship \nfor doing that or we will give you loan repayment assistance.\n\n[[Page S11250]]\n\n  Well, I can tell you, in talking to physicians throughout my State, \nthe cost of repaying those loans can start off a career in hundreds of \nthousands of dollars of debt. Somewhere along the process we ended up \ntaxing the National Health Service Corps scholarship and loan money to \nthese physicians, as the IRS saw the payments as taxable income. In \nfact, later Congress realized: Well, that was not such a great idea of \ntaxing, so we will give more money to the National Health Service Corps \nto pay for those taxes and then tax that money on top of it. We ended \nup paying 40 percent of the program in taxes instead of creating the \nopportunity for those physicians. So this program will help get about \n67 percent more physicians into rural health care in America.\n  The last thing I would like to say is that as we continue to move \nthrough the rest of how we finish up this year, we want to continue to \ngive an opportunity to make sure the National Guard and Reserve men and \nwomen in our country are well taken care of. I am proud the Senate \npassed back to the House a bill that also included Senator Landrieu's \nlanguage about helping the National Guard.\n  Washington State is a State that is greatly impacted, and we \ncertainly need to help and support taking care of our National Guard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11250-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11250-S11251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to share a few thoughts about \nthe status of the economy. As we finish up this session, everybody has \na lot of different views, and we are in a political season. I think it \nis good to talk about it and discuss the issue and see what the facts \nare, and let the American people make up their own mind about what the \ncircumstances are that face our country.\n  One thing that I think is important for all of us to remember is that \nwithout economic growth we will not create jobs.\n  When we are in an economic situation in which we do not have growth, \nthen we are not going to have jobs created. We may not lose those jobs \nimmediately, but as growth lags, the number of jobs will fall as well. \nAs growth goes up, jobs will be created. Jobs, as the economists say, \ntend to lag behind growth, but they follow growth. When economic growth \nis declining, the number of available jobs will decline. When economic \ngrowth is going up, the number of available jobs also will be going up.\n  Growth in the American economy is affected by many different things. \nThe economy can be affected by world events, or by the strength of the \neconomy in other nations. Generally, we are not threatened by strong \neconomies in other parts of the world. Our economy does better when \nother economies are doing well, and when other economies are doing \npoorly, our economy tends to be dragged down.\n  The American economy is also impacted by business factors, by \npsychological factors, and by governmental factors that impact jobs and \ngrowth. If the President could snap his fingers and make everything \nhappen right, we would never have any problems. But we know the \nPresident cannot do such a thing. We know we need to be careful about \nplacing blame and credit.\n  I would like to show this chart. These are the years beginning in \n1995 going into 2003. We had good years through the 1990s.\n  The chart shows these undisputed facts. Former President Bush \nsuffered an economic slowdown in the second year or so of his \nadministration and it resulted in the phrase: It's the economy, stupid. \nBut the truth is, the nation's economy began to rebound significantly \nbefore former President Bush's term was finished. In fact, during his \nlast year in office, he got little or no credit for the rebounding \neconomy because he had been tagged by his political opponents for \ncausing an economic slowdown earlier. The fact is that this \ncharacterization was inaccurate, and that there was pretty solid \neconomic growth during this time.\n  President Clinton, I submit, inherited a growing economy from former \nPresident Bush. That is just a matter of fact. And it grew well through \nthe 1990s. We had low quarters and good quarters, but overall the \neconomy showed strength during this period.\n  In President Clinton's last year in office, however, things began to \nsour. By the time he had left office, the Nasdaq, the high tech stock \nmarket, had lost one half of its value. During the third quarter, of \nPresident Clinton's last year in office, the economy experienced \nnegative growth, though there was growth in the fourth quarter of his \nlast year in office.\n  But the first quarter that President Bush inherited, in which the \ndynamics in the economy were already set, and upon which he cannot be \nfairly said to have influenced, the economy suffered further negative \ngrowth. The second quarter that President Bush inherited also \nexperienced negative growth. The third quarter was 9/11, with its \nnegative impact on the economy. That is what President Bush faced when \nhe took office. Yes, we had some great years in the 1990s, but he \ninherited an economy that was in trouble, and I submit that fact is not \ndisputable.\n  He had to make some choices. Are we going to take the liberal idea, \nthe big Government, the tax-and-spend idea that we were going to get \nout of an economic slowdown, a recession, by increasing taxes and by \nincreasing the size of Government, or are we going to place our faith \nand hope in the ingenuity, the creativity, the work capability, of the \nAmerican people?\n  President Bush placed his faith in the American people. He fought \nfor, and we battled on the floor of this Congress and passed, a \nsubstantial tax cut that was designed to revive the economy, which was \nin trouble and was costing people jobs, making people worried. The \nstock market had gone down. It was a nervous time for all of us. We \nremember that.\n\n  President Bush led. And look what happened. As the chart shows, in \nthe wake of his actions the economy starts coming back. When we had the \nsecond tax cut that took place in 2003, in June, the middle of the year \n2003--and this chart only goes through 2003--we ended up with 8 percent \ngrowth during the third quarter of that year. Eight percent growth in \nthat quarter is the highest growth rate we have seen in 20 years. The \nfourth quarter was also about 4 percent. The first quarter of this year \nwas 4.5 percent growth. The next quarter was 3 percent growth. So we \nhave been blessed to see that this recession is one of the shortest \nrecessions in history. It is something for which we ought to be \nthankful.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am pleased to try to answer a question. I know how \nknowledgeable the Senator is in these areas.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator's chart continued out into this year--I \ntake it the chart stops in 2003?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I found that in my office a few moments ago. The first \nquarter was 4.5 percent.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If it continued out into this year, it would show a \ndescending line, would it not?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It would show the first three quarters of this year \nwould average higher than the last 20 years of growth in America.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to focus on----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It would show a decline from probably 4.5 percent to 3 \npercent growth.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is all I wanted to hear.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. You are not going to stay up there at 4.5 forever. But \nI think the numbers look pretty good. And we did it by investing and \nputting our faith in the private sector to create jobs and growth. It \nis pretty exciting.\n  We don't know how the economy will go. President Bush, as I said, is \nnot a magician. He can't make things happen by waving a magic wand. Any \nof us who have been around here long enough know that. You get blame \nand you get credit. Sometimes it is not the President's fault, \nsometimes it may be the Congress's fault. Sometimes it may be factors \nbeyond any of our control, historic factors.\n  Because we have had substantial productivity increases, which means \nwe can produce more widgets for less investment and often fewer \nworkers, that has made us competitive and helped our economy, but it \nhas also placed stresses on job production. We have had particularly \nnoticeable productivity increases in manufacturing. As a\n\n[[Page S11251]]\n\nmatter of fact, the whole world is seeing a decline in manufacturing \njobs because plants can produce more products with fewer people at less \ncost.\n  Since August of 2003, we have had 1.9 million new jobs created. But \nsignificantly, in the year 2004, we have had 97,000 new manufacturing \njobs created.\n  That is good. That is something we ought to be pleased about. Let me \nnote that the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4 percent. It was 6.3 \npercent last June. It is now 5.4 percent, which is lower than the \naverage unemployment rate for the 1970s, 1980s, or the 1990s.\n  The gross domestic product--the net production of goods and services \nin America--has grown for 11 straight quarters. So we have gotten out \nof this negative growth pattern left to President Bush by former \nPresident Clinton, and we have had 11 straight quarters of growth.\n  I think a factor in that was the President's leadership, for which I \nam very grateful. Some have said that job growth has failed to keep up \nwith population growth. But that is not true. As the Joint Economic \nCommittee, of which I am a member, reported: Since the unemployment \nrate peaked at 6.3 percent last June, total employment has increased by \n2.2 million. The labor force has increased by 949,000.\n  That means there are 949,000 more workers. Unemployment has fallen by \n1.2 million. Due to the large increase in employment and the large \ndecrease in unemployment, unemployment has fallen significantly despite \npopulation growth.\n  I think Senator Cornyn is correct in saying that there exists in our \ncountry today a larger than normal number of people who are working out \nof their homes, working as independent contractors, as consultants, as \ntruck drivers, and other things, who don't show up on a classic \npayroll. The statistics from the household survey that pick up that \nform of employment have been looking much better than the payroll \nsurvey for some time. The payroll survey is a valuable survey, but the \nhousehold survey is valuable, too. The emphasis in complaining about \nPresident Bush's leadership does ignore, consistently, and without \nvariation, the more positive numbers that show up in the household \nsurvey.\n  I think President Bush and this Congress have dealt with a very \ndifficult problem--this economic slowdown. We did it in a way that is \nconsistent with America's heritage and American values. As Americans, \nwe are not a people who embrace a socialist, state-run economy. We are \na vital, vibrant, innovative, creative people, and this allows our \neconomy, because we have no governmental domination of it, to flourish \nand reach its highest possible ideals.\n  That is why the Europeans, in my view, are not doing as well. Germany \nand France have double-digit unemployment of 10, 11, 12 percent, \nbecause they have a state-run, state-dominated, regulated, bureaucratic \ngovernment with high taxes. It has made it difficult for them to be \ncompetitive in the world marketplace. Why would we ever want to emulate \nthat? Why would we ever want to go to the socialist European ideal? Why \nwould we not want to affirm the direction that President Bush is \nleading us?\n  I think Congress is working in order to follow the American ideal of \nfreedom and independence, low taxes, and limited regulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11251-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HOME OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR NATIVE AMERICANS ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mentally Ill Offender \n     Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over 16 \n     percent of adults incarcerated in United States jails and \n     prisons have a mental illness.\n       (2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, approximately 20 percent of youth in \n     the juvenile justice system have serious mental health \n     problems, and a significant number have co-occurring mental \n     health and substance abuse disorders.\n       (3) According to the National Alliance for the Mentally \n     Ill, up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious \n     mental illness will come into contact with the American \n     criminal justice system at some point in their lives.\n       (4) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, over 150,000 juveniles who come into \n     contact with the juvenile justice system each year meet the \n     diagnostic criteria for at least 1 mental or emotional \n     disorder.\n       (5) A significant proportion of adults with a serious \n     mental illness who are involved with the criminal justice \n     system are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness, and \n     many of these individuals are arrested and jailed for minor, \n     nonviolent offenses.\n       (6) The majority of individuals with a mental illness or \n     emotional disorder who are involved in the criminal or \n     juvenile justice systems are responsive to medical and \n     psychological interventions that integrate treatment, \n     rehabilitation, and support services.\n       (7) Collaborative programs between mental health, substance \n     abuse, and criminal or juvenile justice systems that ensure \n     the provision of services for those with mental illness or \n     co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders can \n     reduce the number of such individuals in adult and juvenile \n     corrections facilities, while providing improved public \n     safety.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to increase public safety by \n     facilitating collaboration among the criminal justice, \n     juvenile justice, mental health treatment, and substance \n     abuse systems. Such collaboration is needed to--\n       (1) protect public safety by intervening with adult and \n     juvenile offenders with mental illness or co-occurring mental \n     illness and substance abuse disorders;\n       (2) provide courts, including existing and new mental \n     health courts, with appropriate mental health and substance \n     abuse treatment options;\n       (3) maximize the use of alternatives to prosecution through \n     graduated sanctions in appropriate cases involving nonviolent \n     offenders with mental illness;\n       (4) promote adequate training for criminal justice system \n     personnel about mental illness and substance abuse disorders \n     and the appropriate responses to people with such illnesses;\n       (5) promote adequate training for mental health and \n     substance abuse treatment personnel about criminal offenders \n     with mental illness or co-occurring substance abuse disorders \n     and the appropriate response to such offenders in the \n     criminal justice system;\n       (6) promote communication among adult or juvenile justice \n     personnel, mental health and co-occurring mental illness and \n     substance abuse disorders treatment personnel, nonviolent \n     offenders with mental illness or co-occurring mental illness \n     and substance abuse disorders, and support services such as \n     housing, job placement, community, faith-based, and crime \n     victims organizations; and\n       (7) promote communication, collaboration, and \n     intergovernmental partnerships among municipal, county, and \n     State elected officials with respect to mentally ill \n     offenders.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Madam President, the Mentally Ill Offender \nTreatment and Crime Reduction Act is a good bipartisan bill that will \nhelp State and local governments deal effectively with a serious law \nenforcement and mental health problem--the extent to which mentally ill \nindividuals commit crimes and recidivate without ever receiving \nappropriate attention from the mental health, law enforcement, or \ncorrections systems. The bill passed the Senate unanimously last year, \nand passed the House of Representatives in slightly revised form \nearlier today, by voice vote.\n  I have enjoyed working on this bill with Senator DeWine, who has \nshown commitment and leadership on this issue. I am also pleased that \nSenators Cantwell, Domenici, Durbin, Grassley and Hatch have joined \nSenator DeWine and I as cosponsors of this bill. And I very much \nappreciate the support of House Judiciary Committee Chairman \nSensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers, as well as Crime Subcommittee \nChairman Howard Coble and Ranking Member Bobby Scott, and Congressman \nWilliam Delahunt.\n  Human Rights Watch released a report last year discussing the fact \n``that jails and prisons have become the Nation's default mental health \nsystem.'' The first recommendation in the report was for Congress to \nenact this bill. Tonight we will follow that recommendation and send \nthis bill to the President.\n  All too often, people with mental illness rotate repeatedly between \nthe criminal justice system and the streets of our communities, \ncommitting a serious of minor offenses. The ever scarcer time of our \nlaw enforcement officers is being occupied by these offenders, who \ndivert them from more urgent responsibilities. Meanwhile, offenders \nfind themselves in prisons or jails, where little or no appropriate \nmedical care is available for them. This bill will give State and local \ngovernments the tools to break this cycle, for the good of law \nenforcement, corrections officers, the public safety, and mentally ill \noffenders themselves.\n  When I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held a hearing on \nthe criminal justice system and mentally ill offenders. At that \nhearing, we heard from State mental health officials, law enforcement \nofficers, corrections officials, and the representative of counties \naround our Nation. All of our witnesses agreed that people with \nuntreated mental illness are more likely to commit crimes, and that our \nstate mental health systems, prisons and jails do not have the \nresources they need to treat the mentally ill, and prevent crime and \nrecidivism. We know that more than 16 percent of adults incarcerated in \nU.S. jails and prisons have a mental illness, that about 20 percent of \nyouth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental health \nproblems, and that up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious \nmental illness will come into contact with the American criminal \njustice system at some point in their lives. We know these things, but \nwe have not done enough about them at the Federal level, and our State \nand local officials need our help.\n  The bill does not mandate a ``one size fits all'' approach to \naddressing this issue. Rather, it allows grantees to use the funding \nauthorized under the bill for mental health courts or other court-based \nprograms, for training for criminal justice and mental health system \npersonnel, and for better mental health treatment in our communities \nand within the corrective system. Although the House did reduce the \nfunding authorized by the bill from $100 million to $50 million, that \namount will still be enough to make a real start at addressing this \nproblem. This is an area where government spending can not only do good \nbut can also save money in the long run--a dollar spent today to get \nmentally ill offenders effective medical care can save many dollars in \nlaw enforcement costs in the long run.\n  This bill has brought law enforcement officers and mental health \nprofessionals together, as we have seen at both of the hearings the \nJudiciary Committee held on this issue. I hope that it will provide \nmuch-needed support to our communities and make a difference for both \nlaw enforcement officers and the mentally ill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate concur in the House amendment, that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statement relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I believe that is all I have. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I was struck by the fact that when my \ncolleague from Alabama presented his chart on economic growth, it \nstopped at the end of last year and did not carry forward into this \nyear. Of course, had it carried forward into this year, it would have \nshown a declining trend in economic growth and that is a matter, \nobviously, of very deep concern. In fact, there was a story last week, \na Reuters news story last week, that said:\n\n       Top U.S. executives are pessimistic about next year's U.S. \n     economy. About 70 percent of the chief executives surveyed by \n     the Business Council projected flat to 2 percent U.S. \n     economic growth. More bearish than forecasts by major \n     economists, the Business Council survey, often seen as a \n     gauge of corporate sentiment, was released ahead of a meeting \n     of the group's members, about 125 CEOs from companies . . .\n\n  Then they cite a number of the large companies in the country, saying \ngenerally CEOs are a bit more pessimistic, referring to the difference \nof opinion between executives and economists.\n  The U.S. economy actually grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the \nsecond quarter of this year. Now these chief executives are projecting \na flat to 2-percent growth. My colleagues on the other side, if you \nbring these uncomfortable facts to their attention, they say, well, you \nare talking doom and gloom. But how are we going to realistically deal \nwith our problems if we do not face what our problems are?\n  I want to address one question, because the previous presentation \ntalked as though the only relevant factor is economic growth. It never \naddressed job growth. It only addressed job growth in the sense of \nsaying if you had economic growth, you would have job growth. If you \ndidn't have economic growth, you would have job loss. But the problem \nis more complicated than that, the problem we are confronting right \nnow. I want to point out a couple of factors in that regard.\n  This chart shows how unemployment has moved in previous postwar \nrecoveries, and how it is moving in this one. What it shows: Of course, \nyou obviously get a downward trend in employment as you go into a \nrecession. Then you try to come out of a recession. Of course, \nrecessions are measured by economic growth figures. In the average of \npostwar recoveries, this is what has happened with respect to \nemployment. We have had this kind of growth. So we have had a good, \nrising trend in employment.\n  In this recession, this is what has happened to employment. There is \na huge gap here in terms of the recovery with respect to jobs. That is \nwhy we are so concerned about jobs. That is why we continuously stress \nthat point.\n  This figure was underscored earlier in the conversation we had about \nthe number of long-term unemployed, which has jumped so substantially. \nOne question becomes, Why are we not getting the jobs? I think one \nanswer to that is to be found in these two charts. What we see in \nrecent years is a sharp increase in productivity. In other words, that \nis what a worker can produce for each hour of work. But we do not see \nan increase in worker wages. Productivity is growing much faster than \nworker wages. The workers who are producing more for each hour worked \nare, in effect, not sharing in the benefits and their wages are running \nvirtually constant.\n  One might ask, What happened in other recessions? What usually \nhappens is that worker wages, as you come out of the recession, rise \ncommensurate with their share of the economy, which is about two-\nthirds. But here is what is happening this time. The worker wages are \nnot rising, but the corporate profits are rising 65 percent. So most of \nthe benefit from the economic growth in this partial recovery is not \ngoing to the workers, but it is going to corporate profits. This is in \nmarked contrast with previous recoveries. I want to underscore that \npoint. This is a very different pattern than we have seen in the past. \nOf course, part of the reason for that is the policies of this \nadministration.\n\n  Then the counterargument is made on the other side: If you give the \ncorporation these profits, they will invest them and therefore \nstrengthen the economy, build the economy and create jobs. But here is \nwhat has happened in this Bush administration. These are the growth \nrates of plant and equipment investment by U.S. corporations. As you \ncan see, it actually is down, negative during this Bush administration, \ncompared with previous administrations in which it was a positive \nfigure. So what is happening is the benefits are being skewed away from \nthe workers, but those receiving the benefits are not investing them in \nthe economy in order to build businesses and create jobs. That, of \ncourse, explains in part, in my view, why there is such a tremendous \nlag in this recovery in terms of producing jobs. There is no way you \ncan get around the fact.\n  I listened earlier. No one actually challenged any of the figures or \nfacts about the employment situation. There is no way you can get \naround the fact that this is the first administration in 75 years not \nto have a net gain of jobs in the course of the administration. They \nare still down 825,000 jobs from where they were when they came into\n\n[[Page S11273]]\n\noffice. They are down 1.6 million jobs in the private sector and they \nare down 2.7 million manufacturing jobs.\n  My colleague from Alabama says we have produced this year a gain of \n93,000 jobs. He says that is a good thing. It is a good thing in the \nsense that we want to be positive in producing manufacturing jobs. It \nis not such a good thing if you put it in the context of the fact that \nwe have lost 2.7 million jobs since January of 2001. If you put the \nfigure in context, I am relieved that we gained a few manufacturing \njobs this year. That is certainly better than losing them. But if you \nare looking at the record of this administration, the fact is in the \ncourse of this administration they have lost 2.7 million manufacturing \njobs.\n  You can come to the floor and say we gained 93,000 manufacturing jobs \nthis year, and that is a good thing. As far as that statement goes, it \nis a good thing. But it is in the context of the fact that we lost 2.7 \nmillion jobs over this time period, over the entire time period. That \nalso relates, of course, to the points that are being made now about \nthe gain in jobs that has taken place--well, the month that is usually \nused by my colleagues on the other side is, I think, August of 2003. I \nam pleased and relieved that we have gained some jobs. But the fact \nremains these job gains have tailed off in recent months.\n  The other side would have a story to tell if they had sustained job \ngains. They might have gotten out of the hole and actually produced \nmore jobs, a net gain of jobs in the course of their administration. \nThe Treasury Secretary was projecting it would create a huge number of \njobs. It has not happened.\n  As this chart indicates, we are on a descending line month to month \nin terms of job creation going back to the beginning of this year. That \nis the concern about jobs.\n  It is fine and good to come to the floor and show economic growth \ncharts, although one would have hoped that the chart would have carried \nout into this year and not stopped at the end of last year.\n  Second, one has to take into account what people are now saying about \nwhat to expect on economic growth, and particularly the story from last \nweek about the Business Council meeting. The leading U.S. corporation \nchief executives met in Irving, TX, where the top U.S. chief executives \nsaid they are pessimistic about next year's economy. About 70 percent \nof the chief executives surveyed by the Business Council projected flat \nto 2 percent U.S. economic growth.\n  That is why we are concerned. That is why the public is concerned. \nThat is why working people are concerned. They feel it.\n  You may come to the floor and say everything is a rosy scenario. But \nif you are long-term unemployed, you know it is not a rosy scenario. \nLong-term unemployed now as a share of the unemployed is at the highest \nfigure it has been--over 20 percent now for 24 straight months.\n  Trying to portray a rosy scenario is not going to take care of the \nproblem of the long-term unemployed. We tried to do something about \nthat in the Senate. We tried to extend the unemployment benefits, but \nthat was beaten back, regrettably. People who exhaust their benefits \nand aren't able to find a job find themselves in dire circumstances in \nterms of meeting the needs of their families.\n  I think we have a serious job unemployment situation. I think we need \nto face it. I don't think it helps to simply try to brush it away, \npaper it over. These trend lines, regrettably, are not working in the \nright direction.\n  Now, with this forecast from these top U.S. executives of the \nBusiness Council, we can see that we face an even greater challenge as \nwe move towards 2005.\n  I simply close with the observation that this administration has not \nproduced a net gain of jobs in the course of its tenure. You have to go \nall the way back to Herbert Hoover to find an administration, whether \nDemocrat or Republican, through that period that failed to produce a \nnet gain of jobs in the course of that administration. That, of course, \nis one of the very key reasons this election that comes before us on \nNovember 2 is so important for the future of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland. I know he is very skilled in his knowledge of these issues. I \ndon't know how the President can be blamed for this or that, or how any \nPresident can be.\n  I will just say this: When President Bush took office this economy \nwas in trouble. In the first quarter he inherited there was negative \ngrowth; the second quarter was negative growth; the third quarter was \n9/11. In the third quarter of former President Clinton's last year in \noffice there was substantial negative growth, and one-half of the value \nof the NASDAQ stock exchange had been lost by the time President Bush \ntook office. I will just say that he inherited a problem. And in the \nlast 12 to 15 months, 1.9 million jobs have been created in this \ncountry. We had growth as high as 8 percent late last year for the \nthird quarter, which is the highest growth in 20 years.\n  Yes. We have challenges. Five and four-tenths percent unemployment is \ntoo high for me. It is a lot better than Europe. It is a lot better \nthan most countries in the world. But it is not good enough.\n  But I note this: The 5.4 percent unemployment rate that we have \ntoday, which we are working to improve, is better than the average \nunemployment rate of the 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s.\n  I hope we will continue to work on it here together in Congress, the \nPresident and everyone, to see what we can do to continue to help grow \nthe economy. Certainly, if we don't have a growing economy we will not \ncreate jobs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Was the Senator disappointed by the jobs figures for \nthe month of September of 96,000?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have not been disappointed for the last 6 months of \njob figures. There have been some tremendous numbers. What was the \nhighest month we had this year? There were 300,000 or 400,000 jobs \ncreated in 1 month, and there was 1 where it was 100,000. I would like \nto see it stay at 200,000 or 300,000. Sure. The unemployment rate today \nis stable. But we did add jobs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator has to go back to March of this year to get \nthe kind of job figures he is talking about.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. March of this year was just a few months ago. It is not \nas if it were 5 years ago.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The concern is that these job figures are coming down \nlike this. It seems to me that the Senator has to face the fact that \nthis is where the job figures have been trending over the last 6 \nmonths.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We had--how many was it? I believe 240,000 jobs were \ncreated last month.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The month before last?\n  I reclaim the floor, Madam President. I was going to speak on another \nsubject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would like to answer the question he just put to me.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Maybe the Senator could read the last 3 or 4 months in \njob creation. Does he have them? There have been some pretty good \nmonths in there.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Not in the last 3 or 4 months, earlier in the year. \nEmployment, again for the last 4 months, totaled 400,000 in the last 4 \nmonths. So it has averaged about 100,000 a month.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is better than what President Bush inherited from \nPresident Clinton.\n  Mr. SARBANES. He inherited a very strong economy in terms of the \nnumber of people who were working. And participation in the labor force \nwas up very high. We broke records in terms of job production in the \n1990s in the number of people we put to work.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right. Madam President, I will just say this: The \neconomy was sinking when President Bush took office from President \nClinton. And a sinking economy inevitably means you are going to have \njob losses, and that is what occurred. The President has turned this \neconomy around. We have seen some robust growth in the last year. And \nwe have created 2 million new jobs, as the Senator well knows, and we \ncan debate that round\n\n[[Page S11274]]\n\nand round forever. I think the glass is at least half full. I guess the \nSenator is seeing it half empty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11274-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11274-S11275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am going to speak about the stem \ncell research issue, which I think is important. I don't have an answer \nto it fully.\n  I so much admire Christopher Reeve, whose death we have noted today. \nHis commitment to dealing with the terrible problem of spinal cord \ninjury was a passion of his. We believe that stem cell research may \nwell result in improvement, and hopefully even a cure for spinal \ninjury. It is certainly something that I support. I know the President \nsupports it. I think every Member of this body supports it.\n  I want to share a few thoughts.\n  Last night, Dr. Bill Frist, our majority leader, who, as the Senate \nknows, is one of America's great doctors--he was a heart and lung \ntransplant surgeon at the Vanderbilt University Medical School, and he \nis a highly trained and skilled physician. He discussed these issues \nlast night and I entered into a little dialog with him on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  But in light of some of the comments that have been made today, I \nthink it is appropriate that we at least get some perspective on this \nissue and try to get back to a rational discussion about it.\n  There are different types of stem cells. The one that causes some \nconcern is the embryonic stem cell. If it is not destroyed and allowed \nto develop, it will become a human being. That embryo has within it its \ngenetic makeup, the markers that will determine whether that person is \ntall or short, red hair or brunette, whatever the color of eyes and \nevery other characteristic of that unique human being in that cell. It \nis a stunning, remarkable, marvelous miracle of life.\n\n  When we destroy that which is on the way to being a fully developed \nhuman person, I don't think anyone can say such destruction does not \nraise at least some moral and ethical dilemmas. Doesn't it raise some \nquestion about how we should be able to proceed in dealing with it? I \nmake that point first.\n  It is not a matter of insignificance, the concerns raised here, when \nwe deal with an embryo that, if allowed to develop, would be a human \nperson.\n  Senator Frist laid it out well last night. He quoted Senator Kerry in \nthe debate as criticizing President Bush for imposing a ``sweeping \nban'' on stem cell research. We had Senators this afternoon say \nPresident Bush's policy would ``close the door'' on stem cell research. \nSenator Frist said as a physician, putting on his physician robes, he \nsaid that this is a cruel thing to say to patients who are ill and \ndying, and it is just not true.\n  Senator Kerry knows it is not true. His comments are an attempt to \nmake something out of nothing and to misrepresent the position of the \nPresident and this Congress on this issue. It is not true that the \nPresident wants to stop stem cell research.\n  Let me say where we are, as I understand it. People can agree or \ndisagree with the policies. I agree with the policies.\n  First, there are what we call adult stem cells. These come from bone \nmarrow and other parts of the human anatomy. President Bush has \nincreased substantially the funding for adult stem cell research. We \nhave made some medical progress in various diseases, including \ndiabetes, using adult stem cell research. We are spending more money \nthan we have ever spent on it, and we all support that. Private \nresearch is also ongoing on adult stem cell research.\n  Then there are the embryonic stem cell research issues that raise \nthese moral and ethical questions. I don't claim to have the answer to \nall the concerns.\n  I remember the 100th Psalm that says, Without our aid he did us make. \nOr the Declaration of Independence says, We are created equal. If you \nbelieve we are created beings and that there is a sacredness to life, \nanybody ought to have at least some concern about this question of \ncreating a human being in the making and then destroying that to carry \nout research matters.\n  It is a matter that deserves serious moral and ethical discussion. I \ndon't think we respect life very much if we lightly move into this area \nwithout any limitations.\n  There are stem cell lines that have already been created from embryos \nthat have been killed and destroyed, in effect, in their capability of \nbecoming human, and those cell lines continue to produce today. There \nare 26 or more lines producing on a regular basis--embryonic stem \ncells--and Federal funding is allowed for that. Those that we have \nalready done--and the President considered it carefully and \nthoughtfully, saying, well, we cannot go back and reverse that--let's \ngo ahead and allow the research to go forward in that area.\n  In addition, I note there are no bans whatever on stem cell research. \nThe question has simply been whether we will take Federal tax money and \nspend it on embryonic stem cell research. That has been the discussion \non how we are going to do it. President Bush said we will do it for the \nexisting lines but we will not take taxpayers' money and destroy life \nto do an experiment.\n  Universities, private labs, and hospitals, can all freely conduct \nscientific research on embryonic stem cells. It is not against the law. \nIt is not prohibited. It is simply that we are not going to have the \ntaxpayers--many people have strong feelings about this life issue--to \ntake that money and fund it. It is appropriate to recognize this \nethical issue and to show this small bit of respect for this marvelous, \nunique, sacred bit of life that is the beginning of a human person. I \ndon't think we ought to be spending taxpayer money on it.\n\n  Dr. Frist explained last night only adult stem cell research today \nhas shown progress in medical research. The embryonic stem cells have \nnot. Senator Sam Brownback has talked about this. He said scientists \nare finding that the embryonic stem cell tends to be volatile and not \nas capable of being utilized in a therapeutic way as adult stem cells. \nRegardless of how it may turn out in the future, that appears to be the \nstate of the science today.\n  So we are putting the tax money into the areas that not only do not \nraise ethical questions but have the most proven success in making \ntherapeutic breakthroughs.\n  We are not slamming the door or closing the door on stem cell \nresearch. We do not have, as Senator Kerry falsely stated in the \ndebate, a sweeping ban on stem cell research. That is not true. He \nought not to have said that. He knows better. He is trying to scare \npeople. It is a cruel thing for people out there with illnesses today \nwho think there is a ban and that they cannot be helped with research \nfrom stem cells. There is unprecedented research in the stem cell area. \nWe are going to continue that.\n  I don't know the answers. I am not a physician or scientist. Is there \nnothing we won't prohibit in the name of science or research?\n  I am familiar, from my home State of Alabama, with the research done \non syphilis that left people infected so they could study them, and \ncompare them to people who were treated for syphilis. We now know that \nwas wrong.\n  We, in this country, have believed by a substantial majority that \ncloning human beings is not right and should not be done. We certainly \nhave all seen the rejections of Nazi Germany's abuses of science. As a \nsociety and a nation, there ought to be some limit on what we can allow \nor should allow. People should be able to talk about it and wrestle \nwith it and Congress ought to act on it. If there is serious doubt \nabout one phase of scientific research, maybe it is perfectly \nappropriate that taxpayers not be required to fund that because when \nthe Government funds it, there is a governmental and societal \naffirmation that this is a good and healthy way to operate. We should \nwork on these issues very carefully.\n  I close with these thoughts. In the history of the world, no nation \nhas invested so much in its effort to cure disease as this Nation. I \nhave been pleased and proud of this Congress since I have been here 7, \n8 years now, that we promised several years ago to double the funding \nfor the National Institutes of Health. We have met that goal.\n  We have had tremendous increases in spending for the National \nInstitutes of Health which is where our research money goes. For the \nmost part, we\n\n[[Page S11275]]\n\nallow physicians and scientific experts to say how that money is spent, \nwhat diseases have the best chance of being cured, what experiments \ngoing on out there have the greatest opportunity for breakthrough. We \ndon't try to micromanage that. In general, that is good and I support \nthat.\n  There are things we as a society can speak about. We are not denying \npeople hope. It would be terribly wrong to suggest what is going on as \na policy in our Congress and in our Government is denying people hope \nthat medical breakthroughs can occur from stem cells.\n  We are going to continue unprecedented Federal spending. We will \ncontinue unprecedented private spending on stem cells. We will spend \nFederal money on embryonic stem cells and Federal money on adult stem \ncells. Who knows, some of those may result in great breakthroughs that \nwill help prolong the life and health of millions of American people \nand not just in America but the whole world.\n  This Nation, through our investment in scientific research, has \nlifted and improved the lives of people all over the world. It is \nsomething that we can take pride in as a people. It is something for \nwhich I am proud. I want to continue to see it developed.\n  As we go forward, as we continue to debate these ethical and moral \nmatters, as we continue to see the improvements in science and learn \nmore from science, we may adjust and be able to come up with different \nideas as we go forward on stem cell research. Who knows what we will \nlearn as time goes forward.\n  Based on what I understand today, I see no reason in science, I see \nno reason in ethics--that requires that we blindly go in and destroy \nlife for scientific experimentation when there is no clear indication \nthat experimentation will result in health benefits to American people.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11275-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11275-S11276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A MILITARY DRAFT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, whenever I travel in Iowa, I hear moms and \ndads worrying out loud that if President Bush gets a second term, he \nintends to reinstitute the military draft. I hear the same thing from \ncollege-aged Iowans. In fact, a national poll of young people found \nthat 55 percent expect the draft to be started up again. Of course, the \njoke that is going around is: President Bush insists that there will be \nno draft. And if anybody knows how to avoid a draft, it is George W. \nBush.\n  But the facts tell a different story. The facts tell us that if \nPresident Bush continues on his current course, he will have to \nreinstitute the draft. In fact, to meet personnel needs in Iraq, \nPresident Bush has already imposed stage one of a new draft. Many \nsoldiers whose enlistment time is up are not being allowed to leave the \nservice, and people who left the service years ago are being forced to \nput on the uniform again against their will. So we already have a \nbackdoor draft. Let's be honest about it. President Bush has already \ndone away with the All-Volunteer military. Stage two of the reinstated \ndraft would be easy to implement. Draft boards are already in place in \nevery county in America. Young men who turn age 18 are already required \nto register with their local draft board. It is becoming increasingly \nobvious that because of President Bush's new doctrine of preemptive \nwar, our military is stretched dangerously thin. We do not have enough \npeople in uniform to meet current needs in Iraq and Afghanistan, much \nless to deal with a confrontation with Iran or North Korea or some \nother hot spot.\n  Here are the hard realities that cannot be ignored. Right now, total \nActive Army and Marine personnel number about 655,000. That includes \nsupport units, training units, headquarters personnel, and others who \ndo not see combat.\n  In a long, drawn out war such as a Vietnam or an Iraq, units sent to \nthe front lines have to be rotated out periodically and replaced by an \nequal number of forces. Now, currently, we have 135,000 troops in Iraq, \n20,000 in Afghanistan, 36,000 in Korea, more than 100,000 in Europe, \nand some various troops scattered in Japan and Okinawa and a few other \nplaces.\n  Our Armed Forces have been stretched and strained to the breaking \npoint. To fill the gaps and shortages, tens of thousands of guardsmen \nand women reservists have been called up, some for several years at a \ntime. But there is a cost to all of this. Morale is suffering. \nEnlistments and reenlistments are down. The Army National Guard fell \n10-percent short of its 2004 recruiting goal. The Regular Army has had \nto ease up on standards in order to meet its recruitment goals.\n  Now, what happens if all-out civil war breaks out in Iraq and we have \nto increase our troop strength to 200,000 or 300,000 to quell it? What \nhappens if a newly reelected President Bush decides it is time for a \npreemptive war against Iran or Syria or North Korea?\n  President Bush has already effectively ended the All-Volunteer \nmilitary. People are hesitant to join the Guard or Reserve because the \nodds of being sent into combat have skyrocketed.\n  So how in the world would a second-term President Bush meet the \npersonnel needs of his doctrine of preemptive war? Bear in mind, \nPresident Bush has changed the standard for justifying preemptive war.\n  As the New York Times reported on Sunday, originally the criterion \nwas that a rogue nation was an imminent threat to us, that it either \npossessed weapons of mass destruction or was actively attempting to \nbuild these weapons of mass destruction. But in response to the Duelfer \nreport last week, which found no weapons of mass destruction stockpiles \nand no active program to produce these weapons in Iraq, President Bush \nsays that does not matter. He said that a preemptive invasion is \njustified if an enemy is trying to avoid United Nations sanctions by \n``gaming the system,'' as the President put it.\n\n  As the New York Times concluded:\n\n       Mr. Bush appears to be saying that under his new standard a \n     country merely has to be thinking about developing illicit \n     weapons at some time.\n\n  Or as Joseph Nye of Harvard concludes:\n\n       The President is saying that intent is enough.\n\n  Well, given either the old or the new standard for justifying \npreemption, the U.S. military is going to be very busy indeed if \nPresident Bush is reelected. Our military personnel needs will grow \ndramatically as morale, enlistments, and reenlistments fall. That is \nexactly why I have taken the floor today, to state this: That I believe \nPresident Bush intends to reinstate the draft. Why can I say that? \nBecause he has no choice. To pursue his agenda of aggressive \npreemption, he must reinstate the draft.\n  Now, if you look at history, incumbent Presidents never reveal their \ntrue intentions on matters of war and the draft. Those of us who were \naround in the 1960s remember President Lyndon Johnson, a President of \nmy own party. When he was running for election in 1964, people were \nafraid he had a secret plan to escalate the war in Vietnam. He denied \nit. President Johnson repeatedly promised: I will not send American \nboys halfway around the world to do a job that Asian boys ought to be \ndoing for themselves.\n  Well, Mr. Johnson was reelected and, sure enough, millions of \nAmerican boys were drafted and sent halfway around the world to \nVietnam.\n  So young people today have good reasons for fearing the draft. They \nhave good reasons for not believing President Bush's reassurances that \nhe has no intention of reinstituting the draft. After all, President \nBush has quite a lengthy track record of saying one thing and doing \nexactly the opposite. Well, I guess there is some kind of a technical \nterm for this. I guess it is called: Flip-flopping.\n  Remember, as a candidate in 2000, President Bush was for a ``humble \nforeign policy'' before he was against it. He was against nation \nbuilding in foreign countries before he was for it. He was for a \npeaceful resolution of the\n\n[[Page S11276]]\n\nconfrontation with Iraq before he was against it. He was for an All-\nVolunteer military before the pressures of war in Iraq obliged him to \ndo away with the All-Volunteer military.\n  Now he says he is against the draft. I think our young people can be \nforgiven for doubting President Bush is going to stick with that \nposition. George W. Bush may have avoided the draft when he was a young \nman, but he is not going to be able to avoid the draft as President if \nhe is reelected and pursues his policy of preemptive war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11276-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11276-S11282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              OVERTIME PAY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I also want to talk about a few of the \nthings that have happened here this year in the course of our \ndeliberations and debate on legislation in the Senate and in the \nCongress.\n  One of the issues I would like to talk about--and it came to a head \nhere at the end--has to do with agriculture. But before I get into \nthat, I want to talk about overtime pay. Then I want to talk about \nagriculture and conservation.\n  Last week, in a replay of what happened almost a year ago, the Bush \nadministration used a conference committee to kill my provision to stop \nthe Department of Labor's new rule on overtime pay, a new rule which, \nif it is allowed to stand, will strip 6 million workers of their right \nto time-and-a-half overtime pay.\n\n  Once again, the overtime provision I offered and which was adopted by \nthe Senate was killed in conference, despite votes in both Houses of \nCongress demonstrating strong bipartisan support for my amendment to \nstop these onerous rules of the President from going into effect and \ndenying the right of overtime pay to some 6 million Americans.\n  Now, yesterday, we in the Senate, yet again, voted to protect hard-\nworking Americans' right to earn overtime pay. That bill we passed--as \nthe amendments I have offered before that we passed four times--serves \nthe simplest of purposes. It lets stand the new threshold of $23,660, \nbelow which anyone who is working is automatically guaranteed the right \nto overtime pay, and it guarantees that no worker who currently \nreceives overtime pay would lose the right to overtime under the new \nrule. That is what this Senate voted to keep four times, and the House, \ntwice.\n  This is a subject I feel deeply about, and I know I am not alone. \nWherever I travel in the United States, people come up to me and talk \nabout what overtime pay means to them and their families. They can \nbecome quite emotional about it. They know what this administration is \ntrying to do. They are angry that this administration wants to roll \nback this new overtime rule.\n  It is a simple matter of honoring work. People believe that when they \nput in more than 40 hours of work in a week, that they are giving up \ntheir premium time, their time with their families, and that their \nemployers should provide them with premium pay if they are giving up \ntheir premium time.\n  Also, many Americans rely on that premium pay as a substantial part \nof their income--to put a little bit aside for a college education, a \nrainy day fund, or perhaps maybe to buy a better house, move up the \nladder a little bit, buy a new car.\n  Other people, to tell the truth, would just rather not work a lot of \novertime hours. They believe a 40-hour workweek is a full workweek. \nThat is what the Fair Labor Standards Act established when Congress \npassed it in 1938. It established in law the principle of a 40-hour \nworkweek, that anyone basically who works over that gets time-and-a-\nhalf overtime pay. That was 1938.\n  But get this, in 1933, this Senate, right here in this very Chamber--\nin 1933, after lengthy debate--passed a bill to establish not a 40-hour \nworkweek, or 50-hours, as it was then, but a 30-hour workweek--a 30-\nhour workweek, in 1933. Think about that. They voted here to establish \na 30-hour workweek in 1933.\n  Congress fought about it for about 5 years, and finally, in 1938, \nthey compromised at 40 hours. It has been that way ever since. I will \nbet we couldn't pass a bill in this Senate today to establish a 50-hour \nworkweek. By letting these rules go into effect, we are telling people, \nhey, you can work over 40 hours a week, but don't expect time-and-a-\nhalf overtime pay. That is exactly what we are talking about.\n  Again, we know that if overtime is free to the employer, if they \ndon't have to pay anymore, they will work people overtime. This chart \nillustrates that. The red block is those who have no overtime \nprotection. The green represents people who do have overtime pay \nprotection. Of those who have overtime protection, only 19 percent work \nmore than 40 hours a week, about one out of every five. These are \npeople who get paid for overtime. But if you are not eligible for \novertime pay, 44 percent work more than 40 hours a week, almost one out \nof every two. So if you don't have overtime pay protection, you are \ntwice as likely to work overtime.\n  How about working more than 50 hours a week? If you have overtime pay \nprotection, only about 5 percent work more than 50 hours a week, but if \nyou don't have overtime pay protection, three times as many--15 \npercent--work more than 50 hours a week.\n  That tells the whole story right there. That is what is happening. If \nthis new rule is allowed to stand, we will be back here 5, 6, 7 years \nfrom now, and you are going to see this red mark way up there, 50, 60 \npercent or more of people without overtime pay protection working more \nthan 40 hours a week.\n  Last year, the Bush administration launched an assault on the time-\nhonored principle of time and a half pay for over 40 hours. Actually \nthe proposal of the President came out in a set of proposed rules from \nthe Department of Labor. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 has been \namended and changed a number of times since 1938, but it has always \nbeen done through the legislative process, not administrative \nrulemaking.\n  Ordinarily, the administration comes to Congress. They say they would \nlike to modify the Fair Labor Standards Act for one reason or another. \nThe appropriate committees have hearings. They bring in witnesses. We \nwork it out. We bring it to the floor. We pass it. It goes to a \nconference with the House, and it is sent to the President for \nsignature. That is the way it ought to be done.\n  This time, for the first time, this President issued a proposed set \nof regulations drastically changing the overtime pay rules without one \npublic hearing. They issued these proposed rules without having one \npublic hearing. It actually took us several weeks, kind of plodding \nthrough the proposed rules, to see what they were proposing. The \nmagnitude was breathtaking.\n  Some of the most harmful provisions were not discovered until months \nlater. Frankly, we were shocked when we first saw in these proposed \nrules of the administration that they were proposing to strip overtime \npay from police officers, firefighters, veterans, nurses, and many \nothers--radical stuff. Of course, once the true intent and extent \nbecame known, many of those affected were in open rebellion. We talked \nabout it, and I talked about it here on the Senate floor.\n  When the Department of Labor issued the final rule just this spring, \nthe White House seemed to have an election year conversion. Under \nextreme pressure from labor unions as well as us here in Congress, the \nadministration backed off its attempt to strip overtime from certain \nhigh-profile groups such as rank-and-file police officers, \nfirefighters, emergency medical technicians. I salute the efforts of \nmany individuals and groups who fought hard and who forced the \nadministration to abandon several of these most offensive and egregious \nproposals.\n\n  But what did the change do? They took us from an estimated 8 million \npeople hurt by these overtime rules to 6 million. So basically we went \nfrom a proposed set of rules that were profoundly terrible to a set of \nrules that were just plain terrible.\n  The administration said they fixed it up. Sure, I admit there are \nabout 2 million fewer people who were affected in the final rules, \npolicemen and others. But make no mistake about it, up to 6 million \nhard-working Americans earning as little as $23,661 a year will lose \ntheir right to time-and-a-half overtime pay.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield for a question? It is really an \ninquiry about tonight's schedule. About how\n\n[[Page S11277]]\n\nlong do you think you will be? You are the last speaker. I know you \noutlined all the things you will be talking about. Just so I can plan \npersonally.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have been guaranteed 2 hours today. I spoke 10 minutes \nearlier. I assumed I had about an hour and 50 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. I can come back later tonight. My son's birthday is \ntonight. I have been here for the last 3 days. I wanted to plan for my \ndinner. Again, I can come back later tonight.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have probably about 10 more minutes on overtime. I want \nto talk about the conservation program and just a little on the \neconomy, so maybe 45 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. OK.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Frankly, at this point the administration has zero \ncredibility. As I said, when the proposed rule was issued more than a \nyear ago, it took months of reading the fine print before we realized \njust how destructive it was. Only belatedly did we discover that the \nadministration was giving tips and advice to employers as to how they \ncould avoid paying overtime to employees. Right in the rules there is \nadvice to employers how they can get around it. I had never seen that \nbefore, either.\n  Here we go again. The administration is all smiles and happy talk. \nAgain the administration is assuring workers they won't lose their \novertime rights. When the Bush administration smiles and says it only \nwants to fix overtime, I have five words of advice to American workers: \nHang on to your wallets.\n  What I am telling you about this new overtime rule is not just \naccording to me. Just a couple of months ago, the top three people who \nadministered these regulations over the course of the last two decades \nreleased a report detailing their indepth review of these rule changes. \nOf all the people in the universe of labor experts who have weighed in \non the Bush overtime rule, I would have to think that the credibility \nof these three persons is unparalleled on this issue. Why do I say \nthat? They have no ax to grind. They worked for Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, going clear back to President Reagan, the \nfirst President Bush, and President Clinton. One of them worked for \nthis Bush administration. These are the three experts who administered \nthis program. If you have any reservations about my interpretation or \ncriticism, I invite you to read their analysis.\n\n  These three career officials have said:\n\n       In every instance where DOL [Department of Labor] has made \n     substantive changes to the existing rules, it has weakened \n     the criteria for overtime pay exemptions and thereby expanded \n     the reach and scope of the exemption.\n\n  Let me repeat the administration's central claim. They are saying \nthat no workers earning less than $100,000 a year will lose their right \nto overtime pay. Well, one of these career DOL officials was quoted in \nthe New York Times as saying by his analysis, 3 to 5 million Americans \nwould lose their eligibility.\n  This other chart I have shows the impact of this new rule. It is \nclear that employees earning $100,000 a year or more can be exempted \nbecause they are exempted under the highly compensated employee \nprovisions, if they make more than $100,000. Then if you earn less than \n$23,660, you are automatically nonexempt. You have to be paid time and \na half. Who is in between? Well, a lot of people but especially team \nleaders. I will talk a little bit about team leaders.\n  Under the new rule, a worker who leads a team of other workers loses \nhis or her right to overtime. Under the old rule, there was no \nprovision concerning so-called team leaders. There wasn't even such a \nterm. But the new rule, section 541.203(c), states:\n\n       An employee who leads a team of other employees assigned to \n     complete other projects for the employer meets the \n     requirements for exemption even if the employee does not have \n     direct supervisory responsibility of the employees on that \n     team.\n\n  This team leader loophole is big enough to run an Amtrak train \nthrough. Team leaders are commonplace throughout the manufacturing and \nservice sectors. They are especially common in factories, refineries, \nchemical plants.\n  MIT professor of management Tom Kochan estimates that this team \nleader loophole alone could deny overtime rights to as many as 2.3 \nmillion workers. Again, the administration claims that no worker making \nbetween $23,660 a year and $100,000 a year will be denied overtime. \nThat statement is just plain false.\n  When Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, it \nanticipated there would be a number of less than honorable employers \nwho would try to cheat workers out of their overtime pay. So Congress \nincluded a penalty provision that would act as a strong deterrent. Here \nis what it was. Under the old rule, if an employer was cheating \nemployees out of overtime pay, the penalty could be massive. All \nemployees in the enterprise--all employees, including even salaried \nemployees who were exempt from overtime--had to be paid time and a half \novertime for the period that the improper practices took place. It was \nknown as the nuclear deterrent. It was very tough.\n  Now, by contrast, under the new rule, the penalty is limited to the \nwork unit where the violation was detected. This ignores the fact that, \nin nearly all instances, overtime violations are not limited to a \nrenegade supervisor. They are almost always as a result of companywide \npractices. In other words, we have gone from the nuclear deterrent of \nold to the new sort of pussycat deterrent under the new rule. Under the \nnew rule, many workers will legally lose their right to overtime pay. \nThat is one part of it. And employers who cheat workers out of overtime \npay illegally will receive a penalty that is nothing more than a slap \non the wrist. No wonder the Wall Street Journal called the new rule a \nvictory for business groups. No wonder this new rule is so strongly \nsupported by corporate America.\n  It is time for the Bush administration to listen to Main Street, not \njust Wall Street; listen to ordinary working Americans. One of their \nhighest concerns is economic security. Not only do they fear losing \njobs, health care, and retirement; they are now afraid they will lose \ntheir right to time and a half compensation. They have good reason to \nfear that. They fear they will work a 50- to 60-hour week, with zero \ncompensation. That is what is going to happen under these new rules. \nLast week, in 17 cities across the country, thousands of workers, who \nare angry about these new overtime rules, rallied in parks and outside \nFederal buildings. They delivered scores of boxes full of postcards to \nthe Bush-Cheney campaign headquarters, asking the President to take \nback this overtime pay cut.\n  Dixie Harms, a long-time trainer of nurses in Des Moines, said:\n\n       If overtime is changed for hospital nurses, we will see a \n     mass exodus of registered nurses from the hospital setting, \n     because they will get fed up and refuse to volunteer so many \n     hours to do what they really love doing.\n\n  It is bad enough to deny American workers overtime pay rights, but \nwhat is striking is the mean-spiritedness of the Department of Labor. \nAs I said, the Department offered employers what amounts to a cheat \nsheet, giving helpful tips on how to avoid paying overtime to the \nlowest paid workers. For example, the Department suggests cutting a \nworker's hourly wage so any new overtime payments will not result in a \nnet gain to the employees. It also says you can take a worker's salary, \nraise it up a little bit so that it meets the threshold. Say an \nemployee is making $23,600 a year. All you have to do is give them a \n$61 increase, and guess what. You don't have to pay them overtime; you \ncan exempt them. That is in the Department's rule, those tips. I liken \nthat to the IRS giving helpful hints to tax cheats, saying if you want \nto cheat on your taxes, here are some tips on how to do it. We would be \nup in arms if the IRS were to do that. But we let the Department of \nLabor do it. Here are helpful hints on how to cheat your workers out of \ntheir legitimate right to overtime pay.\n\n  It happened recently. According to an article in the Detroit News \nlast month, 2 managers out of 150 at Rozwell's Metro Detroit Burger \nKing franchises became eligible for overtime. Listen to this. Rather \nthan make them hourly workers, the company gave them a $20 a week raise \nto maintain their salary status. Two managers out of 150 are eligible \nfor overtime under these new rules. What a deal.\n\n[[Page S11278]]\n\n  I want to close my statement on this by saying there is one group \ndisproportionately harmed by these new overtime rules: working women. \nWhy? Because women tend to dominate the workforce in retail, services, \nand sales positions, which would be particularly affected by the new \nrule. Three in 10 working women earn all or almost all of their family \nincomes. Three in 5 earn about half or more of their family's income. \nFour in 10 women work evenings, nights, or weekends on a regular basis. \nOne-third work shifts different than their spouses or partners. From \n1979 to 2000, married women increased their working hours by nearly 40 \npercent. Their contributions are especially important to lower and \nmiddle-income families.\n  Yet, now the administration's new rule will take overtime pay \nprotection away from millions of American women. They will have to work \nlonger hours for less pay. This means more time away from their \nfamilies, more childcare expenses, with no additional compensation. \nListen to what Sheila Perez of Bremerton, WA, says. She is a single \nparent, working hard to support her family. When she leaves work after \na difficult 8-hour shift, she says:\n\n       My second shift begins. There is dinner to cook, dishes to \n     wash, laundry, and all the other housework that must be done, \n     which adds another 3 or 4 hours to my workday. My time at \n     home with my kids and family is truly my premium time. It is \n     personal time. It is the most valuable time of the day. So if \n     I am required to work longer than 8 hours, if I have to \n     sacrifice that premium time with my family, then I ought to \n     receive premium pay. That is overtime pay.\n\n  I have never heard it said better. Sheila Perez is right. If she is \ngoing to sacrifice her personal time, premium time, with her kids, it \nis only fair that she be compensated on the premium basis, with time \nand a half overtime pay.\n  Later this week, we will have another debate between President Bush \nand Senator Kerry. It is going to be on domestic issues--that is what I \nunderstand--the economy and domestic issues. I hope we will hear about \nthis issue of overtime pay.\n  I am sure the President will say: Look, we expanded overtime pay. \nWhy, we raised the base from $8,000 to $23,660.\n  Yes, with one hand, they raised up the base for low-income workers; \nand with the other hand, they took it right back. What a nice shell \ngame. I gave you examples of how employers are getting around it, and \nthe fact that the Department of Labor put out a cheat sheet on how to \ncheat workers out of overtime pay legally. How about the workers making \n$24,000, $25,000, or $26,000 a year? That is barely poverty wages. They \nare above the threshold. They will be exempt from overtime pay. Senator \nKerry has stated that if he is inaugurated President in January, the \nnext day he will rescind those onerous Bush administration rules. We \nwill keep the base raise; we will raise the base from $8,000 to \n$23,660. That is what my amendment did. But we will guarantee that \nevery worker in America who is eligible for overtime pay this last year \nwill be eligible next year and the year after and the year after.\n  If President Bush is reelected, up to 6 million Americans will lose \ntheir right to overtime pay. To me, this is a gut issue. This affects \nour working families. We want to protect our overtime rights in \nAmerica, getting time and a half over 40 hours. Senator Kerry, the day \nafter he is sworn in as President, will rescind those onerous rules and \nput us on the right track.\n  I want to close my comments on this legislative year today regarding \na couple of other matters, including the insistence by this \nadministration that we take money for disaster assistance out of USDA \nconservation programs. Now, I have here a statement of the President of \nthe United States, George W. Bush, that he made when he signed the farm \nbill.\n  I was there. I was chairman of the Agriculture Committee at that \ntime. He touted the new farm bill for what it did on conservation. He \nsaid:\n\n       This bill offers incentives for good conservation practices \n     on working lands.\n\n  That is the Conservation Security Program. The President went on to \nsay:\n\n       For farmers and ranchers, for people who make a living on \n     the land, every day is Earth Day. There are no better \n     stewards of the land than the people who rely on the \n     productivity of the land. And we can work with our farmers \n     and ranchers to help improve the environment.\n\n  That is what he said when he signed the bill. However, twice now--\nonce a little over a year and a half ago--the President has tried to \ntake some $3 billion out of conservation funds. He succeeded in 2003, \nbut then we put it back early this year.\n  Here we are again with the legislation that passed today. The \nPresident has once again taken just short of $3 billion out of \nconservation after saying he is for conservation. He said this in the \ndebate last Friday. In his debate with Senator Kerry, he talked about \nhow he was for strong conservation. I about came out of my chair when I \nheard that because at the very time the President in St. Louis was \nmaking this statement in the debate about how much he supported \nconservation, his people were up here on the Hill trying to gut it, \ntake money away from it. Amazing.\n  Let me talk a little bit about this program. We have always had \ndifferent conservation programs in America. We helped farmers who built \nterraces or grass waterways, for example. We supported practices to try \nto conserve soil and water, but much of Federal efforts entailed taking \nland out of production.\n  For years, farmers and ranchers all over the country have said: It \nseems that the people who get the USDA money are mostly those who are \nthe worst in protecting soil and water. They plow up the turn rows, \nthey go up and down the hills. They plant one crop right after the \nother. They do not rotate the crops, and they do not worry about soil \nerosion. Those were the ones who got the USDA funds. The good stewards \nstop runoff. They do not allow the streams to be polluted. But there is \nnot much help for them, and these are most of our producers. These are \nthe people who produce our food and fiber, the most abundant food \nanywhere in the world at the lowest cost, and the safest food.\n  Out of that came this idea that we ought to have an incentive \nprogram, as the President said in his statement, an incentive for good \nconservation practices on working lands.\n  We put that into the farm bill of 2002. It was called the \nConservation Security Program. The idea was to begin to reward farmers \nfor adopting and maintaining good practices. Unlike the commodity \nprograms that give more money the bigger you are--the bigger the \nfarmer, the more money he gets--unlike that, this program said: We do \nnot care how big or small you are, it depends on what conservation you \ndo. The more conservation work you do on your working lands--we are not \ntaking land out of production; it is how you farm--then that is how you \nwill get incentive payments.\n  The most any farmer, no matter how big you are, could ever get out of \nthis is $45,000 a year. So it does help family-size farms. It helps all \nkinds of farms--vegetable farms, orchard and fruit farms. It helps \ncorn, soybean, cotton, rice farms, and anybody else who wants to \npractice good conservation on their working lands. That was the \ncornerstone of the conservation title in the 2002 farm bill. And that \nis what the President talked about. That is what he touted. That is \nwhat he said he supported as recently as last Friday night in the \ndebate.\n\n  The farm bill had a major conservation initiative. The President and \nhis administration keep talking about it, but the President's people \nare up here gutting the program. Soon, right after it became law, they \nmoved to take $3 billion out. They succeeded for a little while, but we \nput the money back. For 2005, the President in his budget is cutting \nnearly $600 million in conservation programs. That cuts the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, called EQIP, the Wetlands \nReserve Program, the Farmland Protection Program, the Grassland Reserve \nProgram, the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, and the Watershed \nRehabilitation Program, and, of course, the Conservation Security \nProgram. All of those are cut in his budget, yet the President last \nFriday night said he was for strong conservation.\n  For EQIP alone, President Bush requested a cut of more than $215 \nmillion. That does not include the additional $75 million to $100 \nmillion in cuts that will come from EQIP to pay for technical \nassistance, again a problem caused by this administration.\n\n[[Page S11279]]\n\n  President Bush claims he supports efforts to restore wetlands, but \neach year he advocates cutting acreage for the Wetlands Reserve Program \nby 50,000 acres below the farm bill level. The Wetlands Reserve Program \nis the best tool we have to restore and protect wetlands, and the Bush \nadministration is leading the way in keeping the enrollment down. \nAgain, words are not matching what the President is doing.\n  In August of this year, President Bush announced in Minnesota--I was \nup there right about the time--he is going to direct the Secretary of \nAgriculture to offer early reenrollments and extension of existing \ncontracts in the Conservation Reserve Program, those contracts that \nwere set to expire in 2007 and 2008. Again, words do not match the \ndeeds.\n  There is no automatic or guaranteed enrollment in CRP for producers \nwhose contracts are expiring. On the contrary, all these producers got \nwas the right to comment on how USDA should enroll the expiring \nacreage. There was no guarantee that any of the currently participating \nproducers would get back into the CRP program; no guarantee that all \nthese acres will be reenrolled; and certainly no reenrollment any time \nsoon. So what was the President talking about in August in Minnesota?\n  In 2001 and 2002, we had a drought in many Western States. The Bush \nWhite House did not want to provide farmers and ranchers relief, as we \nhave done in past emergency situations. They insisted if we are going \nto have disaster assistance, we have to get money out of the farm bill. \nWhat did they do? They went after the conservation funds to get the \nmoney to pay for it.\n  The Conservation Security Program is about our future. Here is what \nthe Des Moines Register said in an editorial:\n\n       The CSP holds enormous promise to sustain the soil for \n     agriculture, to clean up rivers and lakes, to boost rural \n     development. People will want to live and visit a fresh, pure \n     countryside where wildlife and recreation flourish. Moreover, \n     the program could be the template for the farm programs of \n     the future, superseding the crop subsidies which are almost \n     certain to be outlawed some day under the rules of \n     international trade. CSP could give farmers an income safety \n     net based on how well they take care of the land instead of \n     how much they produce. It is shortsighted to fail to invest \n     enough in the conservation security program.\n\n  That is what the Des Moines Register said about it, and yet the \nadministration keeps wanting to gut the program.\n  There is uniform opposition to this action taken by the \nadministration from farm, conservation, and environmental groups. When \ncan anyone ever remember the commodity groups, the environmental \ngroups, and the wildlife conservation groups being in such agreement?\n  I have served on Agriculture Committees in the House and Senate for \nnearly 30 years, and I can never remember in my life all of these \ngroups being so united in one cause. That tells us something. It tells \nus that the administration's actions are just plain wrong.\n  The White House, through the OMB, insisted on taking money from the \nConservation Security Program. Now we have heard a lot of talk that \nthis program is spending more money than what was anticipated. Well, \nthat is not really true. Here is what happened: In 2002, when we passed \nthe farm bill, the CBO made an estimate as to how much CSP would cost \nover 10 years. They said it would cost $2 billion. OK, fine. We passed \nthe bill. The President signed it. About 6 months later, not one rule \nhas been written, not one regulation promulgated, nothing has been \ndone, and now OMB comes out and says, well, they reestimated CSP's cost \nat $7 billion over 10 years.\n  Where did they get that figure? They just plucked it out of thin air. \nBut then they said, well, now that we have $7 billion there we can take \n$3 billion out. Right away that tells us they are up to something \nfunny, but that is what they did.\n  In so doing, they capped the program, changed the nature of the \nprogram, so it could not operate as intended by the farm bill. As I \nsaid, we reversed that, but just a few months later, just this month, \nthey have come back and proposed it again. They reached in again, took \nnearly $3 billion out of it, put a cap on the program.\n  Some are saying we need to put a cap on it; it might cost too much. \nWell, we do not know for certain what it is going to cost. But I think \nCBO is way out of line exaggerating the cost. That is from my own \npersonal standpoint. We do not hear this call to limit other programs. \nWhat about food stamps? Food stamps is an uncapped entitlement program. \nIf one qualifies income-wise, they are eligible for food stamps.\n  We know as unemployment goes up, wages go down, more people apply for \nfood stamps. When employment is up, wages are up, the cost of food \nstamps comes down. Medicaid is another program. It has no cap on it. If \none qualifies, they get it. In agriculture, the commodity program has \nno cap. My goodness, the corn, the soybean, the cotton, the rice, and \nwheat, there is no cap on those programs. It depends on what kind of \nyear one has.\n  If prices are high, we spend less. If prices are low, we spend more. \nI thought it was pretty interesting also when the farm bill passed we \nhad a milk income loss contracts program. It was estimated by CBO to \ncost $1.7 billion for the life of the program. After the bill passed, \nCBO raised its cost estimate to $4.2 billion.\n  Now it looks like it may cost less than that, but it has already cost \nsome $2 billion already, which is higher than the $1.7 billion \nestimate. We have another year to go under this program, and it may \nwell spend more money, my point being that these are uncapped programs \nso that they can operate as intended. The CSP program was uncapped to \noperate as intended, that if one does certain things, if one meets \ncertain requirements of conservation practices, they will qualify for \ntier 1, tier 2 or tier 3, anywhere from $20,000 to $45,000 a year for \nthe life of the contract, which is 5 to 10 years.\n\n  By what the administration has done, by taking the money out and \ncapping it, they have turned a national program into a selective \nconservation program for only a few people, and it has led to all kinds \nof distortions and problems. What the administration did this year is \nthey said, OK, certain watersheds will be eligible to get in the \nConservation Security Program and only a few farmers in those \nwatersheds. So there could be a farmer in a watershed who is eligible \nfor CSP, and 2 miles away there could be a farmer who is a better \nconservationist, who is doing better work on his farm in saving soil \nand water, but is not eligible.\n  The second abnormality is that even within a watershed, there could \nbe farmers who are good conservationists, but they did not get \naccepted, they did not get in that little select group. And guess what.\n  They have to wait 8 years before they can apply again. What signal \nare we sending to farmers? Forget about it, that is the signal. Forget \nabout help for conservation unless you are part of this little select \ngroup. Maybe you will be in it; most likely you will not. That is what \nthey have done to this Conservation Security Program.\n  The President had the gall, last Friday, to say that he was strong \nfor conservation. Well, I have just pointed out that they have been \ngutting conservation, and they continue to do so. To those who ask why \nthey are opposed to the program because it is uncapped, I am sorry, \nthat is what the Agriculture Committee voted. We hammered this out in \nlong sessions and long negotiations between the House and the Senate, \nbetween Republicans and Democrats, between those from the South, the \nNorth, the West and the East. There is no surprise.\n  This is what we voted. It is not right for OMB and the \nadministration, through the Appropriations Committee, of which I am a \nmember, to come in and unilaterally change this program. That is not \nthe purview of the Appropriations Committee. It is the purview of the \nAgriculture Committee. That is why I kept the Senate in this week and \nthat is why I stood here on Friday and Saturday because I am fighting \nfor farmers and for conservation. I am fighting for the right of our \nfarmers to rely upon what we passed in the farm bill, not having the \nAppropriations Committee take it away. So we passed a resolution on \nSaturday. We passed a resolution--I am not going to read all the \n``whereases,'' but here is the resolution.\n  One of the things I negotiated to let some bills go through was I \nsaid, let us have another vote on whether the Senate wants to take \ndisaster money out\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\nof conservation or whether they want to treat disaster money as an \nemergency like we ought to and have before.\n  This is the resolved clause of that resolution: Resolved that it is \nthe sense of the Senate that the 108th Congress should provide the \nnecessary funds to make disaster assistance available for all \ncustomarily eligible agricultural producers as emergency spending and \nnot funded by cuts to the farm bill.\n  Guess what. It passed the Senate 71 to 14. Seventy-one Senators said, \nyou are right, it ought to be treated as an emergency. But the \nPresident of the United States says, no; no, we will treat some \ndisaster losses as an emergency but not the drought that hit Iowa or \nthe floods that hit North Dakota or the drought that hit Colorado. No, \nthey are going to be treated different. What the administration said we \nare going to do is we will take money out of conservation, out of \nagriculture to pay for that.\n\n  The junior Senator from Pennsylvania was here on the floor the other \nday arguing heatedly that disaster assistance should be taken out of \nthe farm bill. I pointed out that Pennsylvania is one of the States \ncovered by hurricane assistance. The hurricane money is not taken out \nof the farmers' pockets. Why should their disaster be different than \nthe ones out west?\n  I heard one Senator say: They have had a drought for 4 or 5 years, \nand we cannot be putting emergency money into those States where they \nhave a drought year after year.\n  Wait a minute. It seems to me that Florida gets hit by a hurricane \nevery couple of years. That is hurricane alley. We don't get hit by \nhurricanes in Iowa, but Florida does. Maybe we should not have \nhurricane assistance because Florida gets hit year after year by \nhurricanes? What kind of nonsense is that?\n  Again, we passed that resolution on emergency funding 71 to 14.\n  Also, an agreement was struck between the leadership, the Republican \nleadership and the Democratic leadership, on another resolution that \npassed today. Since it passed by unanimous consent--that means no one \nobjected--I want to read it because it was not read today. Here is a \nresolution:\n\n       To instruct conferees to the Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2005, or on a Consolidated \n     Appropriations Measure that includes the substance of that \n     act.\n       Resolved that, for the purpose of restoring the provisions \n     governing the Conservation Security Program to those enacted \n     in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act--\n\n  That is the farm bill of 2002--\n\n       and restoring the practice of treating agricultural \n     disaster assistance as emergency spending, the Senate \n     instructs conferees to the Agriculture, Rural Development, \n     Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Bill, 2005, or a Consolidated Appropriations \n     Measure that includes the substance of that act, to insist \n     that the conference report contain legislative language \n     striking subsections (e) and (f) of section 101 of division B \n     of H.R. 4837. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a copy of these resolutions be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record,\n\n                              S. Res. 454\n\n       Whereas, agriculture has been the cornerstone of every \n     civilization throughout history and remains the driving force \n     behind the nation's economy;\n       Whereas, American farmers and ranchers help keep food \n     affordable in this country and also help to feed the world;\n       Whereas, America's farmers and ranchers produce the food \n     and fiber that is so vital to our economy while protecting \n     our soil, helping to keep our waters clean, and reducing air \n     pollution across the country;\n       Whereas, all sectors of our country rely in some way on a \n     successful, strong and vibrant agriculture industry;\n       Whereas, it is the nature of agriculture that farmers and \n     ranchers will suffer production losses because of the \n     vagaries of weather;\n       Whereas, Congress has responded to natural disasters by \n     providing assistance to those affected including the nation's \n     farmers and ranchers to help restore financial stability in \n     times of such losses; and\n       Whereas, Congress has traditionally provided such \n     assistance on an emergency basis without cutting programs to \n     the class of those suffering.\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that the 108th \n     Congress should provide the necessary funds to make disaster \n     assistance available or all customarily eligible agricultural \n     producers as emergency spending and not funded by cuts to the \n     farm bill.\n\n                              S. Res. 465\n\n       Resolved, That for the purpose of restoring the provisions \n     governing the Conservation Security Program to those enacted \n     in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act and restoring \n     the practice of treating agricultural disaster assistance as \n     emergency spending, the Senate instructs conferees to the \n     Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2005, or a \n     Consolidated Appropriations Measure that includes the \n     substance of that act, to insist that the conference report \n     contain legislative language striking subsections (e) and (f) \n     of section 101 of division B of H.R. 4837, An Act Making \n     Appropriations for Military Construction, Family Housing, and \n     Base Realignment and Closure for the Department of Defense \n     for the Fiscal Year ending September 30, 2005 and for Other \n     Purposes.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. What does all that language mean? It means that the \nSenate went on record today to instruct conferees, those of us on the \nAppropriations Committee, to undo what the administration did, to \nrestore what was in the farm bill for conservation, and to not take the \nmoney out of conservation for disasters but to treat agricultural \ndisaster assistance as emergency spending, as it should be.\n  So 71 Senators voted that way on the earlier resolution to treat it \nas emergency spending. Now we have an instruction to conferees. Can we \nget any plainer than that?\n  We will see. We come back in November. We have to come back in a \nlameduck session because we have a continuing resolution to keep the \nGovernment running until November 20. So sometime before November 20 we \nin the Appropriations Committee and the Congress, we have to come back, \nare going to meet to either pass what is called an Omnibus \nappropriations bill or something of that nature, and we have \ninstructions from the Senate to undo what the administration called for \nto cut conservation. We will see. We will see if Senators on that side \nof the aisle have the courage to stand up to this administration and to \nfollow the will of the Senate and tell the President, no, you are not \ntaking the money out of conservation. We will see. We have the \ninstructions. We have 71 Senators who voted that way.\n  I will say about the future consequences to agriculture if this cut \nto the farm bill stands, this will set a precedent that will be used \ntime and time again. Today it is conservation. Next time what will it \nbe? How about the commodity programs? Those are uncapped entitlement \nprograms. They go to rice and cotton and corn and soybean and wheat \nfarmers. Someone will point out payments that go out to farmers and \nthey will say: Wait a minute, we ought to cap that. If we cap it, we \nwill have a lot of money to do other things. That is next. Or payment \nlimitations. That has been fair game out here on the floor before.\n  My message to the farm groups in America is this is just the first \nstep in reopening the farm bill. Reopen it here, and look out, it is \nfair game.\n  Shame on those in this administration who just 2 years ago loudly \ntouted the farm bill. We signed off on it. We hammered out our \nagreements. Now they want to reopen it and take money out for disaster \nassistance. Look out. They will be coming after it again because there \nis money there. Commodity programs are uncapped entitlement programs. \nThey are going to want to take that money for other things because \npeople will look at this. There is a lot of staff around here. There \nare a lot of people looking at, where can I get money for this program \nand where can I get money for that? Those of us who represent farmers, \nare in the minority around here, aren't we?\n  There are a lot of good programs out there that maybe need money. \nSome of them I would even support myself. People are going to want to \nget money for them. Guess what. They are going to come after the farm \nbill because Congress and the White House now opened it. It is opened \nup wide. That barn door is open, and they are going to come after it. \nMark my words. What are we going to say? We didn't protest enough? We \ndidn't take strong stands against this administration when it refused \nto protect conservation, to protect our farmers? We will see when we \ncome back. We will see when we come back in November whether we have \nthe courage to override the administration.\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to talk about the economy \nand what is happening to American families. There is one question I \nnever hear the President of the United States ask of anyone. I never \nhear it when I see him in all of the rallies. I never hear him asking \none question: Are you better off today than you were 4 years ago? You \nnever hear that question. Are you, your families, or is the country, \nbetter off than they were 4 years ago?\n  I want to talk briefly about why the answer to that is obvious. We \nare not better off, either personally, our families, or the country as \na whole. If there is one word that describes the Bush economic policy, \nit is ``reckless.'' If there is one word to describe the President's \nforeign policy in Iraq, it is ``reckless.''\n  This President has recklessly pursued tax cuts for the most affluent \nin our society above other priorities. He has recklessly squandered the \nsurpluses he inherited from President Clinton. He has recklessly \nsupported outsourcing of our jobs. The President has recklessly ignored \n45 million Americans without health insurance, and he has recklessly \nset us on a course to run up nearly $5 trillion in new debt over the \nnext 10 years.\n  Last month, the Congressional Budget Office announced that this \nyear's budget deficit will hit around $422 billion, a new record. What \nwas the President's response? Let's cut some more taxes and run the \ndeficit up even more. When it comes to fiscal policy, President Bush is \nsimply out of control. He is driving this country the way he would be \ndriving recklessly down a road.\n  For him, these tax cuts are practically theology, not ideology. \nUnfortunately, we don't have a prayer getting our economic house in \norder under his leadership.\n  Last year, the President's Council of Economic Advisers said that \nwith the 2003 tax bill, the economy would create 306,000 jobs every \nmonth. In the past 4 months we have created jobs at a third of that \nrate.\n  We have suffered a net job loss of nearly a million since Mr. Bush \ntook office, the only President since Herbert Hoover during his 4 years \nwho has not created one net new job.\n  The unemployment rate, they will say, went down in September. Why? \nNot because people were getting jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, the labor force shrunk by 152,000. Why? People gave up on \nlooking for work. Therefore, conveniently they are no longer counted as \nunemployed.\n  Recent data released last month by the Census Bureau shows that since \nthis President took office, real household income has fallen by $1,535. \nThat compares to a gain of $5,498 during the Clinton years. Families \nwere better off after Bill Clinton was President; with this President, \na $1,535 loss in household income.\n  How about what consumers are paying for gasoline now. I filled up my \ncar yesterday. It was $1.99 a gallon for regular. Today oil hit a new \nhigh--53-something dollars a barrel. I understand it may go as high as \n$60 a barrel. Gasoline prices are going up. Families have to drive \ntheir cars to work. Rural Americans have to drive a long way. Farmers \nhave to fill up their combines and tractors with diesel.\n  The farm prices have come down, corn prices are down, bean prices are \ndown, wheat prices are down. Guess what. Their fuel prices are up. Our \nfarmers are hurting.\n  The number of Americans living in poverty has risen by nearly 4.3 \nmillion people. That is the number of people newly living in poverty \nunder this President. During the Clinton years, we reduced those who \nlived in poverty by 6 million. You were better off after 4 and 8 years \nof Bill Clinton.\n  Over the last 4 years, the cost that employers paid for health \ninsurance has climbed an extraordinary 59 percent. We wonder why so \nmany of our small businesses are no longer covering their employees' \nhealth insurance. They simply can't afford to.\n  But this administration demanded a provision in the new Medicare law \nthat expressly forbids the Government from negotiating lower drug \nprices, even though virtually every other developed nation negotiates \nlower drug costs with the pharmaceutical companies. But we have one \nagency of our Government that is allowed to do so, and that is the \nVeterans Administration. Guess what. The veterans get the cheapest \ndrugs in America. God bless them. I am all for them. But why don't we \nlet Medicare do the same thing as VA is doing? This administration says \nno. They wouldn't let them do that. This administration won't do it \nbecause they are joined at the hip, like Siamese twins, with the big \npharmaceutical companies.\n  As I mentioned earlier, they have turned the clock back more than 60 \nyears in taking away overtime pay rights of 6 million American workers. \nThe President keeps saying we turned the corner. Maybe we have turned \nthe corner and we are headed back to the 1930s. We are going back to \nthe 1930s.\n  Remember the Depression? There had been all of these tax breaks for \nupper income people. We got into the Depression. People were working \n50, 60 hours a week to try to make ends meet, if they could even get a \njob. So we put in a 40-hour workweek. We raised salaries and wages of \npeople.\n  This administration has turned the corner. Mr. Bush says we have \nturned the corner but in fact it is back to yesterday, back to the \n1930s.\n\n  When Mr. Bush took office we had the largest budget surplus in \nAmerican history. Think of that. The largest budget surplus in American \nhistory.\n  According to all estimates, we were working toward a cumulative \nsurplus of $5 trillion in this decade. Think about what a strong \nposition that would have put our country in as the baby boomers began \nto retire. In less than 4 years, all of that has been turned upside \ndown. This year we are running the largest budget deficit in American \nhistory; as I said, $422 billion.\n  What about this decade? We were going to have a $5 trillion surplus. \nBut we are now looking at a cumulative deficit of $5 trillion. We went \nfrom a $5 trillion surplus to a $5 trillion deficit.\n  I am sorry. This President simply can't handle money. I don't think \nhe could handle money when he was in the private sector either. But it \nis obvious this President can't handle our money either.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that by 2009 we will be \npaying roughly $1,000 for every man, woman, and child just in interest \non the public debt. That is $4,000 for a family of four.\n  President Bush says he has cut your taxes. That is wrong. We are \npaying more in property taxes, sales taxes, and everything else.\n  But think about this: By 2009, every family of four will be paying \nabout $4,000 a year in taxes to pay the interest on the national debt. \nGuess what. You can't cut that tax. We have to pay the interest on the \ndebt.\n  As soon as a baby is born in the year 2009, that baby owes that \nyear's interest on the national debt. I don't know how that 1-year-old \nbaby or her family is going to earn enough.\n  Some keep talking about a death tax around here, an estate tax as a \ndeath tax. How about the birth tax? That is going to hit in 2009. For \nevery child born in America, $1,000 that first year they will have to \npay to cover interest on debt. Why? Because we took their money and we \ngave the tax breaks to the wealthiest in our society today. That is \nwrong. That is just simply wrong.\n  One last thing: As I said, those bonds must be paid, and that \ninterest must be paid. Who is buying the bonds? Who will be paying \ninterest? More and more foreign governments and their central banks.\n  Since Mr. Bush took office, Japan and China have more than doubled \nthe U.S. debt that they own. Our Government now owes just those two \ncountries $854 billion. Pretty soon it will hit $1 trillion.\n  We have all learned who pays the piper. It is called the consumer.\n  Just ask yourself. Would you rather be a creditor or a debtor? Which \nposition would you like to be in, creditor or debtor? Think about our \ncountry being in debt to China and Japan to the tune of $1 trillion. \nWhat happens if we want to negotiate a little trade deal that is better \nand more fair? Who is holding all the cards then? They are the \ncreditors and we are the debtors.\n  These are the realities that we have today: Massive tax cuts, rapid \nincreases in Federal spending, record budget deficits, record trade \ndeficits,\n\n[[Page S11282]]\n\nskyrocketing public debt. But the credit card bill will come due. You \ncan't repeal the laws of economics. Eventually, massive Government \nborrowing will squeeze out private investment and force interest rates \nup.\n  Eventually, massive indebtedness to foreign nations will cause the \ndollar to fall even more dramatically than it has so far on Mr. Bush's \nwatch. Instead of making the needed adjustments to meet our \nresponsibilities to retiring baby boomers and our children, this \nadministration undercuts those responsibilities.\n  The President just does not get it. He continues on his reckless way, \nreckless and stubborn, cutting funding for veterans and public \neducation and other domestic needs but he wants to send some people to \nMars.\n  Priorities, priorities, reckless priorities. Reckless in economics \nand stubborn in continuing to do the same thing over and over again and \nexpecting a different result.\n  The President seems to say as long as we keep cutting more and more \ntaxes for the wealthy, as long as we continue on this reckless course \nin Iraq, as long as we continue this reckless deficit spending, well, \nthen it will all work out. It will be different sometime down the road.\n  I am sorry, it is going to dig us deeper and deeper in the hole. \nSomeone once described insanity as doing the same thing over and over \nand over again and expecting a different result. But we cannot keep \ndoing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result. \nWe know what the result will be.\n  Public opinion polls show the majority of Americans believe the \ncountry is headed in the wrong direction. They are right. We are headed \nin the wrong direction economically. We are headed in the wrong \ndirection for our kids and our grandkids. It is time to end this \nreckless course that we are on, to get back to a sound fiscal and \neconomic policy in this country. This President will not do it. He is \njust stubborn. He is going to continue his war policy. He is going to \ncontinue his policy in Iraq, and he is going to continue his domestic \neconomic policy because he believes it is right. He may believe it is \nright, but the majority of Americans do not think so.\n  That is why we need to chart a new course for America. That is why, \nunder a President John Kerry we will turn this country around. We will \nturn around the mess in Iraq. We will save young American lives. We \nwill set right our economic policies. We will invest in education and \nthe health care of our people. We will do it in a sound manner and 4 \nyears from now we will stand here and say truthfully: You are better \noff today than you were 4 years ago because John Kerry has been \nPresident of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11282-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11282-S11283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNFINISHED BUSINESS OF THE 108TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we set to adjourn, I think back to \nwhat I said earlier this year about the need to set aside bitter \npartisanship and move towards a new politics of common ground.\n  During campaigns, candidates and parties should be clear about where \nwe stand on the issues and how we differ with our opponents so that \nvoters can make a choice. That is an essential part of democracy. But \nwe also have a responsibility to work together constructively, where we \ncan, to find common ground.\n  It is not simple, but it is the essential ingredient to making \nCongress work for the American people.\n  By this measure, the record of the 108th Congress is mixed.\n  At times, we have been able to work across party lines and, as a \nresult, we have been able to make meaningful progress on some of the \nissues and challenges that matter most to Americans.\n  There is no better example than the National Intelligence Reform Act. \nSenators from both parties worked together with the members of the 9/11 \nCommission and the families of the victims of 9/11 to pass real \nintelligence reform that will make our Government better able to deal \nwith the new threats we face, and make Americans safer in the process.\n  This legislation passed 96-2. It demonstrated how much common cause \nwe can find--and how much we can do--when we put the needs of Americans \nfirst.\n  There have been other examples through the course of the 108th \nCongress.\n  We passed commonsense tax relief for middle-class families, ending \nthe marriage penalty and extending the child tax credits. Under this \nnew law, the 70,000 families in South Dakota will benefit from a $1,000 \nper child tax credit\n  We passed legislation protecting the pensions of 35 million \nAmericans.\n  Notwithstanding the majority's claims, the Senate confirmed 201 of \nthe President's 211 judicial nominations--95 percent--and the judicial \nvacancy rate now stands at an historic low.\n  I am particularly pleased that Senator Johnson and I have been able \nto work with our colleagues to advance measures deeply important to the \ncitizens of South Dakota.\n  We honored the service of our National Guard members and Reservists \nby extending their access to the military's TRICARE health care system.\n  We approved key incentives for the ethanol industry that will mean \nthousands of jobs for South Dakota and millions of dollars in revenue \nfor South Dakota farmers.\n  And we have offered significant help to farmers and ranchers \nstruggling to deal with the effects of the 5-year drought.\n  Each of these accomplishments was the product of bipartisan \nleadership. They testify to the fact that the Senate can make progress \nfor the American people when we put aside partisanship and focus on the \nreal challenges facing Americans.\n  We all agree, however, that those moments were far too rare.\n  On a number of occasions, the Republican leadership pursued an all-\nor-nothing strategy that can be poisonous to the legislative process.\n  One of the most regrettable instances was the Transportation bill. In \nFebruary, we passed legislation to modernize our transportation \ninfrastructure and create 2 million jobs by an overwhelming, bipartisan \nmargin. But despite that, the White House and House blocked the Senate \nbill from becoming law.\n  The same process was at work with the Energy bill. The Senate passed \na bipartisan bill that had few controversial provisions. But once the \nRepublican leadership insisted on attaching poison pill provisions, \nthis bill became impossible to pass.\n  The same all-or-nothing approach kept us from passing a bipartisan \ngun liability bill.\n  It doomed a bipartisan effort to bring down the cost of prescription \ndrugs for America's seniors by enabling them to shop for better prices \nacross the border.\n  It prevented us from raising the minimum wage at a time when millions \nof Americans work full time yet still live and raise their families in \npoverty.\n  And it kept the Senate from passing a mental health parity bill that \nhas 77 cosponsors in the Senate and 249 in the House.\n  There is a long list of bipartisan legislation that has been left \nundone. That list exists solely because the leadership put the needs of \nAmerican families behind those of insurance companies, drug companies, \nHMOs, and other special interests. Rather than listening to the voices \nof the American people, they have worked to advance rigid ideological \ntheories.\n  Nowhere has that dogmatic stance been more damaging than to the \nbudget and appropriations process.\n  The minimum requirement of any Congress, our most basic \nresponsibility, is to pass the appropriations bills that enable our \nGovernment to continue working for the American people.\n  At the beginning of the 108th Congress in 2003, we were told that the \nWhite House and Republican leadership would ensure the budget and \nappropriations process ran more smoothly than ever before.\n  But each of the last 2 years, the process has broken down. Last year, \nthe Republican leadership was forced to resort to an omnibus spending \nbill that combined seven different appropriations bills.\n  This year, we might return after the November elections to vote on a \nmassive omnibus spending bill that sews\n\n[[Page S11283]]\n\ntogether nine different appropriations bills.\n  This is not merely a difference of procedure. We all know that \nomnibus spending bills are fundamentally undemocratic, because they \ndeny the American people the right to have their representatives the \nchance to vote on the details of how the Government is spending their \nmoney.\n  Omnibus bills are invitations to abuse. Last year, for instance, the \nRepublican leadership used conference negotiations to attach to the \nomnibus a series of provisions that could never have passed the House \nor Senate on their own. We don't know what provisions will be attached \nto the omnibus this time, and we won't until the spending bill comes \nout of conference in November.\n  One thing is clear. This is not the way the Framers intended us to \nlegislate or fund our Government. And it is not what the American \npeople sent us here to do. They deserve better. They deserve leadership \nthat put their needs first.\n  Throughout this Congress, we should have applied a simple test to our \nwork. With each piece of legislation that came before us, we should \nhave asked: Does it do right by America? Does it do right by our troops \nfighting for our security overseas? Does it do right by the seniors who \nneed help buying prescription drugs? Does it do right by middle-class \nfamilies struggling to make ends meet? Does it do right by our children \nwhose future is in our hands?\n  Doing right by America demands a politics of common ground. We were \nable to achieve this common ground for the people of South Dakota.\n  And as the Intelligence Reform Act proved, Congress is able to put \naside partisan politics for the sake of all America, as well.\n  We are capable of doing right by America.

Mr. President, at the close of the 108th Congress, we say \nfarewell to Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald who is leaving us after one \nterm.\n  The former congressional intern, commercial banking attorney, and \nIllinois State Senator was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998. In fact, \nhe was the first Republican in Illinois to win a Senate seat in 20 \nyears.\n  It has been a busy 6 years for Senator Fitzgerald. During his brief \ntenure in this chamber he served on the Senate Agriculture, Commerce, \nGovernment Affairs, Small Business, and Aging Committees. He was active \nin a number of legislative areas, including mutual fund reform, \nconsumer safety protection, aviation, environmental, and agricultural \nissues. And he actively pursued the expansion of overseas markets.\n  During his 6 years in this chamber, Senator Fitzgerald threw himself \ninto some of the most challenging and complex issues considered by the \nSenate. In 2000, he attacked waste in Government contracting and \ncrafted legislation to improve the process by which contractors are \nawarded taxpayer monies. He later worked with me to address the \nPentagon's ``revolving door''--an egregious practice utilized by \ngovernment contractors in exerting influence over the contracting \nprocess. In 2002, the former commercial banking attorney lashed out at \nEnron executives who robbed thousands of workers of millions of dollars \nof their life savings, and he later crafted legislation to reform the \nmutual fund industry.\n  Time and again he showed himself to be a Senator who is not \nintimidated by complexity. He did not simply talk about the issues of \nthe day, he took time to study them, and understand them, and then try \nto do something about them. Time and again he demonstrated that he was \na workhorse, not a show horse. The Senate needs more members like him, \nSenators whom we can look to when confronting difficult and complex \nissues.\n  And the Senate needs more Senators like Senator Fitzgerald who, on a \nnumber of high-profile issues, including gun control, health care, \npatient's bill of rights, and the environment, ANWR drilling, put the \ngood of the people of his State, in particular, and the American \npeople, in general, above partisan party interests and ideology.\n  In attacking political corruption and cronyism, he was bipartisan, \nnot simply in rhetoric, which is easy, but rather in action, which is a \ngood deal more difficult.\n  I wish Senator Fitzgerald and his wife Nina the best as they begin a \nnew phase of their lives.\n\n\n                          senator john breaux\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, when the 109th Congress convenes in January, \n2005, this Chamber and our Nation will, unfortunately, be without the \nservices of Senator John B. Breaux.\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\n  This will truly be a loss to the Senate and to our Nation. With the \nretirement of Senator Breaux, we lose a man of exceptional political \nexperience. This son of an oil-field worker and a dressmaker began his \npolitical career as a staff aide to Congressman, and later, Governor, \nEdwin Edwards.\n  Mr. Breaux was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives seven \ntimes, the first when he was just 28 years of age, making him the \nyoungest member of the United States Congress at the time. He served in \nthe House for 14 years where he, among other things, was a principal \narchitect of the 1983 reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act.\n  In 1986, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, and has served three \nterms in this chamber. Now, after 32 years of congressional experience, \nSenator Breaux is leaving us.\n  With the retirement of Senator Breaux, we lose one of those Senators \nwho is always ready and willing to reach across the aisle to find \ncommon ground, to achieve the workable compromise. He has constantly \ndemonstrated the ability to reach beyond partisan and ideological \ndifferences, without abandoning his basic principles. Politics is said \nto be the art of compromise, and this was an art that Senator Breaux \nconstantly practiced. On issue after issue, including health care, \nenergy production, tax cuts, and welfare, he demonstrated his ability \nto broker bipartisan deals, his penchant for deal making, and his \ntalent for fashioning legislative coalitions. With his efforts to break \nSenate stalemates on Medicare, Social Security, education, health care \nfor the uninsured, and other issues, he earned a well-deserved \nreputation as a behind-the-scenes mediator. Senator Breaux exemplified \nthe wisdom of not allowing the perfect to be the enemy of the good.\n  Even when I disagreed with him, which I have, I still admired his \nefforts to find that workable solution. Even when he was unsuccessful, \nwhich was rare, I still respected his skill and the cause he was \nadvocating. With wit, determination, and patience he is always in \npursuit of a constructive course of action, and that won him many \nadmirers, including me.\n  Because of his efforts and his considerable skills, he chaired the \nNational Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare and he co-\nchaired the National Commission on Retirement Policy. He also served as \nchairman of the Special Committee on Aging and as chairman of the \nSurface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee. He is \ncurrently the senior member of the Finance Committee.\n  Recognizing and appreciating his leadership abilities, in 1993, his \nDemocratic colleagues elected him chief deputy whip, and in this \npostion Senator Breaux has served this chamber, my party, and our \ncountry effectively and successfully for more than a decade.\n  With the retirement of Senator Breaux, the Senate will also be losing \na fine musician. Every year at Mardi Gras, Senator Breaux entertains \nthe multitudes by playing a washboard. As a musical instrument, a \nwashboard is not a fiddle, but I am sure it sounds good, as good as a \nwashboard can, I guess.\n  With the retirement of Senator Breaux, we will be losing a Senator \nknown for his disarming humor. During the anthrax problem of October \n2001, he boasted that the fish in his office would survive because \n``they are not weak Northeast fish . . . They are strong Louisiana \nfish.'' I think that was supposed to be funny. If it was supposed to be \na fact, I will put up a good West Virginia mountain rainbow trout any \nday against his Cajun aquatic bottom feeders.\n  Most importantly, with the retirement of Senator Breaux, we will be \nlosing a good man. A man who was always there to help. A man whose word \nis his bond. A man who has constantly demonstrated his loyalty to this \nchamber and to his country. A man who came up the ``hard way,'' without \nanything being handed to him, but through hard work, dedication to duty \nand to his State and our country, fashioned a remarkable and successful \ncareer.\n  I wish Senator Breaux and his wife Lois the best as they enter the \nnext phase of their lives and careers.\n\n\n                             SENATOR GRAHAM\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Bible tells us that ``unto whomsoever \nmuch is given, of him shall be much required.''\n  When Bob Graham came to the United States Senate, ``much'' was \nexpected from him because much had been given.\n  He came to the Senate from a wealthy and successful family. His \nfather, Ernest ``Cap'' Graham, was a wealthy and successful Florida \ndairy man and politician. His half-brother, Phil Graham, was a well-\nknown publisher of a major newspaper here in the Nation's capital.\n  He came to the Senate with a wealth of experience. After graduating \nfrom the University of Florida and Harvard Law School, he served two \nterms in the Florida House of Representatives, 1967-1971; two terms in \nthe Florida State Senate, 1971-1979. In 1978, he was elected Governor \nof Florida, where he served two terms, 1978-1986.\n  In 1986, having never lost an election, and with a record of \naccomplishments as both legislator and a chief executive, he was \nelected to the U.S. Senate. Therefore, no one could have been faulted \nfor expecting much from him, and I am pleased and proud to say he has \ndelivered.\n  He was a most effective member on a number of important Senate \ncommittees, including the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and \nUrban Affairs, the Senate Finance Committee, the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, and the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs. He has also served as chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  In his committee work, and in his daily work on the Senate floor, \nSenator Graham earned the respect of everyone in this chamber for his \nhonesty, his decency, and his integrity. In the rough and tumble world \nof American politics, Senator Graham always remained a gentleman.\n  He also earned the respect of his colleagues for his ability to reach \nacross the aisle for the greater good of his State and our Nation. As a \nresult, Senator Graham established a long record of bipartisan \naccomplishments on issues of national security, health care, education, \nenvironment, veterans benefits, and intelligence matters.\n  The people of Florida have been well served by their Senator. In this \nChamber, he has helped protect the workers in his State from unfair \ncheap imports, worked to secure the protection of the Everglades, and \nhas fought tenaciously to reduce the traffic in illegal drugs in \nFlorida. He was one of the principal architects of the 1988 omnibus \nanti-drug bill and organized efforts to attack money laundering by drug \nsmugglers.\n  During his political career, Senator Graham also became famous for \nthree things. The first is his wardrobe, that is, the ties that he \nwears. Everyone who knows Senator Graham knows that he only wears ties \nwith an outline of Florida on them.\n  The second is that for almost three decades he has recorded in detail \nevery waking moment of his life.\n  The third thing for which Senator Graham is well known is his so-\ncalled ``workdays.'' One day each month for the past three decades, he \nhas performed a job, usually manual labor, in order to stay in touch \nwith and to better understand the problems and the needs of the people \nof his State.\n  He has now performed nearly 400 different jobs. He has been a flight \nattendant, a truck driver, and a chicken plucker. He has cleaned up \nafter hurricanes, and he has cleaned up after dogs as he once spent a \nday handling a ``pooper scooper.'' He once spent a day bagging \ngroceries, and has even performed on stage. He has worked with \npolicemen, doctors, fishermen, firefighters, and teachers.\n  These ``workdays'' were not gimmicks or media events. They were \nimportant means by which he could better serve people of his State. \nWhile Governor of Florida, it was during his workday as a public \nschoolteacher that he experienced firsthand the serious overcrowding in \nhis State's school system. As a result, when he got back to \nTallahassee, he sought more funding for school construction to \naccommodate the State's booming student population.\n  On his 355th workday he worked in a hospital, trying to secure \ninsurance provider authorization for treatment in the emergency \ndepartment. This frustrating experience led him to introduce the \nEmergency Medical Services Act.\n\n[[Page S11285]]\n\n  While serving customers in a Florida pharmacy, he heard from seniors \nwho could not afford to pay for their prescription drugs. Afterwards, \nhe played a lead role in the effort to expand Medicare benefits to \ncover prescription drugs for seniors.\n  Despite my admiration for Senator Graham, I must confess that I have \nhad my disagreements with the senior Senator from Florida. More than \nonce, I have heard him issue his boast that, ``the future of America is \nFlorida.'' We all know, of course, that the future of America is West \nVirginia. But neither this, nor other disagreements, has deterred or \nsubtracted from my respect for him. He has made an enormous \ncontribution to the Senate, where he has effectively and successfully \nserved his State and our country.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Graham has decided that, after three terms in \nthe Senate, it is time to leave us. We will miss his wisdom, his \ndecency, and his remarkable dedication in service to our Nation. Much \nwas expected of Senator Graham, and he, indeed, exceeded all \nexpectations.\n  I wish him and his wife, Adele Khoury, the best of health and \nhappiness in their retirement.\n\n\n                          SENATOR DON NICKLES\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the motto of the great State of Oklahoma is \n``Labor Conquers All.''\n  How perfect this is for the senior Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Don \nNickles, who has accomplished so much, and gone so far because of his \nwillingness to work.\n  As a young man, after the death of his father, Don Nickles worked his \nway through college as a janitor making minimum wage. After graduation, \nhe returned to his home town of Ponca City to help run the family \nbusiness, the Nickles Machine Corporation, of which he became vice \npersident, and then general manager.\n  In 1978, he was elected to the Oklahoma State Senate.\n  Two years later, in 1980, he was elected to the U.S. Senate as part \nof the ``Reagan Revolution.'' When he took office in 1981, he was just \n31 years of age, the youngest Senator in the 97th Congress. Seventeen \nyears later, in 1998, he became the only Oklahoma Republican ever \nelected to a fourth term in the U.S. Senate.\n  During his 24 years in the Senate, for better and for worse, Senator \nNickles has remained consistently true to his basic conservative \nprinciples. Congress Daily has justly referred to him as, ``the keeper \nof the conservative flame.''\n  Being true to his conservative principles has sometimes led him into \ntaking some lonely stands. And his unflinching commitment to his \nconservative principles have led him to take positions that have \nangered constituents of his own State. His principles have even led him \ninto positions on issues that have annoyed me. In addition to his views \non tax cuts, I could mention his efforts to block the Patient's Bill of \nRights, his efforts to defeat increases in the minimum wage, and his \neffort to scuttle a Democratic initiative to help unemployed workers to \nbe able to afford medical insurance coverage. Still, I have always \nadmired and respected him for the firmness of his convictions and his \nbeliefs, and his willingness to stay with them despite the \nconsequences.\n  Even with the firmness of his convictions, he has never allowed \nhimself to be trapped or bound by dogmatic partisan stands. Time and \nagain I have watched and admired his willingness to reach across the \naisle and work with Democratic Senators in bipartisan efforts to extend \nunemployment benefits, to win passage of a regulatory reform bill, and \nto secure passage of other measure that, otherwise, may well have gone \ndown in defeat.\n  During his 24 years in this chamber, Senator Nickles has served on \nthe Senate Finance Committee, Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, Labor and Human Resources Committee, Small Business, and \nJoint Committee on Taxation.\n  For 14 of his 24 years in the Senate, he has served in Republican \nSenate Leadership, first as chairman of the Senate Republican \nSenatorial Committee, and then as chairman of the Republican Policy \nCommittee, which he transformed from a lunch club into a ``conservative \nthink tank.'' In 1996 and again in 1998, he was elected Assistant \nRepublican Leader, Republican Whip.\n  In January, 2003, Senator Nickles left the Senate Republican \nleadership to become chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and this \nis where I really came to know and appreciate what an outstanding \nlegislator he is.\n  As I attended Budget Committee hearings and markups held by Chairman \nNickles, I came to realize his appreciation for the Senate as an \ninstitution, and his determination to make this institution work. I \nsaw, first hand, his efforts to accommodate differences and to restore \nbipartisanship to the Senate Budget Committee. While he staunchly \nadvocated his beliefs, Budget Chairman Nickles emphasized politeness, \ncourtesy, cordiality, and amiability. These qualities endeared him to \nDemocratic and Republican members of the Budget Committee.\n  It was here in the work of the Budget Committee that I really saw his \npersonal side. I remember Senator Nickles's first Budget Committee \nmarkup as chairman. Senator Nickles arrived at the markup and announced \nthat his daughter had given birth to his first grandchild, Nicholas \nFenton Rossiter. I had seen many times the look of pride on a new \ngrandfather's face, and it inspired me to recite a poem for his \ngrandson. ``Dear Nicholas, first, in thy grandfather's arms, a newborn \nchild, thou didst weep, while those around thee smiled, so live, that \nin thy lasting sleep, thou mayst smile while those around thee weep.''\n  But at the same announcement of the birth of his grandson, I could \nnot help myself in reminding Budget Chairman Nickles that, given his \nsupport for a budget that embraces record deficits, his sweet \ngrandchild was born owing $24,000 on the national debt.\n  Although I failed to disabuse him of his egregious interpretation of \nthe budget reconciliation process, Senator Nickles, I am convinced, has \ncome to understand the importance of debate in the Senate. Earlier this \nyear, he devoted many hours to studying the budget rules for ways to \neliminate the so-called ``vote-a-ramas'' that usually accompany the \nSenate's budget debates. To his great credit, Senator Nickles \ndemonstrated that rule changes are not necessary. Together with Senator \nConrad, he orchestrated this year's budget debate in a manner that \nallowed adequate time for all Senators to offer and debate their \namendments. For the first time in many years, there was no ``vote-a-\nrama,'' thanks to Senator Nickles.\n  It has been reported in the media that Senator Nickles was \ndiscouraged and disappointed that, in his final year as chairman of the \nBudget Committee, the Senate was not able to reach a consensus with the \nHouse of Representatives on a budget resolution. I hope Senator Nickles \nrealizes that the model of civility he created as chairman of the \nBudget Committee will be remembered and emulated, and that this \naccomplishment will survive in the annals of the Senate longer than any \nbudget document.\n  While I must admit that I will not miss some of the values that he so \neloquently advocated, and for which he so effectively fought, I do \nregret anytime the Senate loses a good person, and Senator Nickles is a \nvery good person. During his 24 years, this outstanding Senator, \nthrough his hard work, his friendliness and his dedication and \ndetermination, has helped make the Senate a better place, and for that, \nI am grateful and thankful. Time and again he has demonstrated that \n``labor'' certainly does ``conquer all.''\n  I wish him and his wife, Linda, happiness, health, and prosperity as \nthey enter the next phase in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11285-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11285-S11286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        BUSH TRANSPORTATION POLICIES ARE WRONG FOR RURAL AMERICA\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 4 years ago, candidates George Bush and Dick \nCheney promised those of us from rural America that they understood the \nchallenges we face and that they would work to make our lives better. \nNow, the President and Vice President are going back out to the rural \nparts of the country, to Appalachia, to my home State of West Virginia, \nto tell us that we have turned the corner. They are saying that, thanks \nto their work during these past 4 years, our prospects are improving. \nThey tell us that, due to their policies, job growth is increasing. And \nthey argue that if we want\n\n[[Page S11286]]\n\nmore of the same in the future, we need to re-elect them to another \nterm.\n  The reality is a far cry from the picture the President paints. Those \nof us in rural America, and for me that means the rugged Appalachian \nmountains of West Virginia, have known that, in order to improve our \nability to attract and maintain good-paying jobs, we have to build an \ninfrastructure to match those in the urban parts of America. That \nincludes more four-lane divided highways and an improved national \npassenger rail network. But, the President has proposed policies to \nslow highway construction and shut down Amtrak. If enacted, these \nproposals would add to the staggering job losses already experienced in \nrural America under the Bush administration.\n  This Congress is now a year late in passing reauthorization \nlegislation for the Federal Government's surface transportation \nprograms. The main reason for this delay is that the President opposes \nefforts to adequately fund the construction of better and safer roads, \nparticularly in rural America. In the meantime, transportation projects \nare stalled and tens of thousands of construction jobs have been lost.\n  In 1965, the Congress adopted the Appalachian Regional Development \nAct that promised a network of modern highways to connect the \nAppalachian Region to the rest of the Nation's highway network and, \neven more importantly, the rest of the Nation's economy. Absent the \nAppalachian Development Highway System, ADHS, my region of the country \nwould have been left solely with a transportation infrastructure of \ndangerous, narrow, winding roads which follow the paths of river \nvalleys and stream beds between mountains. These roads are still, more \noften than not, two-lane roads that are squeezed into very limited \nrights-of-way. They are characterized by low travel speeds and long \ntravel distances and are often built to inadequate design standards.\n  The rationale behind the completion of the Appalachian Development \nHighway System is no less sound today than it was in 1965. \nUnfortunately, there are still children in Appalachia who lack decent \ntransportation routes to school; and there are still pregnant mothers, \nelderly citizens and others who lack timely road access to area \nhospitals. There are thousands upon thousands of people who cannot \nobtain sustainable, well-paying jobs because of poor road access to \nmajor employment centers.\n  We have virtually completed the construction of the Interstate \nHighway System and have moved on to many other important transportation \ngoals. However, the people of my region are still waiting for the \nFederal Government to live up to its promise, made some 39 years ago, \nto complete the Appalachian Development Highway System. And under the \nPresident's plan, they may have to wait several more decades.\n  Regrettably, the President has threatened to veto the highway bill \nthat was passed by an overwhelming margin in the Senate. That bill \nwould provide the funds necessary for a robust investment in rural \nAmerica's infrastructure, including the Appalachian Development Highway \nSystem. It appears that under this administration, investments in road \nconditions are beginning to mirror the distribution of wealth in our \ncountry. The rich are getting richer while the poor get poorer.\n  The President and Vice President also have proposed to further limit \nour transportation options in rural America, including West Virginia, \nby underfunding and thereby shutting down Amtrak. Each of the Bush \nadministration's four budget requests has targeted Amtrak and suggested \nfunding levels that would have rendered the system inoperable. \nPresident Bush has proposed to limit Amtrak to the Northeast where it \nwould serve only as a commuter rail network. Long distance trains, such \nas the Cardinal that provides a lifeline for communities across \nsouthern West Virginia, or the Capitol Limited that serves the eastern \npanhandle, would be eliminated under the President's plan.\n  Amtrak is a critical transportation link for people in all corners of \nthis country. Each day, millions of people ride the rails to get to and \nfrom work, to visit family and friends living many miles away, or to \ntravel on vacation. Make no mistake, if Amtrak closes operations, it \nwill not be without great cost to communities both large and small. If \nAmtrak were to shut down, the Nation's transportation system would be \nthrown into chaos.\n  For many rural Americans, Amtrak represents the only major \ntransportation link to the rest of the country. If the President has \nhis way, West Virginians who live in or near Harpers Ferry and \nMartinsburg would lose access to the Capitol Limited train that runs \nfrom Washington, DC, to Chicago. Others who live in or near White \nSulphur Springs, Hinton, Beckley, Thurmond, Montgomery, Charleston, and \nHuntington would lose access to the Cardinal train that runs from New \nYork City to Chicago.\n  At a time when countries across the globe are moving forward by \nmaking investments in various passenger rail projects, whether it be \nhigh-speed bullet trains in Taiwan or Mag-Lev trains in Japan, \nPresident Bush has proposed to shut down America's passenger rail \nservice. Next time the President or Vice President campaigns in \nHuntington, Charleston, or Beckley, I hope they will explain why they \nbelieve the economic prospects of these communities will be improved \nwith the elimination of the national passenger rail network.\n  I have worked my entire Congressional career to ensure that West \nVirginia gets a fair shake from the Federal Government. My State was \nlong ignored by those deciding where Federal monies would be spent. \nInfrastructure development in rural America still lags far behind the \ninvestments being made in our urban areas. And this problem will only \nbe compounded by the re-election of a President who is tone-deaf to the \nneeds of rural America.\n  The President continues to make empty promises, continues to assure \nus that we have, indeed, turned the corner. But, for many rural \nAmericans, that corner is on a dangerous, winding road with no help in \nsight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11286-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11286-S11287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ATTEMPTS TO KILL THE ESLGP\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Bush administration would like us to \nthink it has spent the last 4 years standing up for steel in West \nVirginia and across the Nation. But this administration has never stood \nup for steel. If the West Virginia steel industry has benefited at all \nin the past 4 years, it is in spite of the Bush administration.\n  The Bush administration said it would impose Section 201 tariffs on \nimports of unfairly traded steel, but then it lifted the steel tariffs \n15 months early. The Bush White House refused to stand up for steel, \nand I would like to take this opportunity to remind America's \nsteelworkers, including those in West Virginia, of this important fact.\n  Let's look at some other important facts: over the past 4 years there \nhas been a program to provide tangible relief to steelworkers in West \nVirginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. That program is the Emergency Steel \nLoan Guarantee Program, which I enacted in 1999 with bipartisan support \nto help steel companies in economic distress. Over the past 2 years, \nthat program has served as an absolute life-line to thousands of \nsteelworkers from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The Steel Loan \nGuarantee Program has saved thousands of jobs in spite of the Bush \nadministration, which has worked night and day to kill the Emergency \nSteel Loan Guarantee Program.\n  The story of steel in West Virginia over the past 4 years is a \ndramatic story of hard work, hope, and triumph. But that is no thanks \nto this administration. Over the past 4 years, both Weirton Steel and \nWheeling-Pittsburgh Steel filed for bankruptcy due to unfair imports. \nBut the Bush administration still thought it was a good idea to lift \nthe steel tariffs 15 months ahead of schedule.\n  In dire straits, both companies sought the only real relief that was \navailable to them, which were loan guarantees provided by the Emergency \nSteel Loan Guarantee Program. The steel companies filed applications \nfor emergency steel loan guarantees with the program's loan board to \nenable them to stay in business and not put 8,000 to 10,000 people out \nof work.\n  And what was the Bush administration's response? In both its fiscal \nyear 2003 and 2004 budget requests, at exactly the time when Weirton \nand\n\n[[Page S11287]]\n\nWheeling-Pittsburgh Steel and their thousands of workers desperately \nneeded a loan guarantee to stay alive, what did this administration do? \nIt sought to rescind all of the funds available to the Emergency Steel \nLoan Guarantee Program. These rescission requests were pending at \nexactly the same time that both Weirton and Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel \nhad loan guarantee applications pending before the loan board. When \nWheeling-Pittsburgh's first application was denied, it had to refile. \nThe administration continued to request rescission of all funds in the \nloan program.\n  But those of us who know West Virginia, who love West Virginia, and \nlove its people, stood up for steel and stood against the Bush \nadministration. We put our shoulders to the grindstone and pushed with \nall our might to find a way to keep West Virginia's steel industry in \nbusiness. Unlike the Bush administration, we kept faith with the people \nof West Virginia. As ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, I \nwas able to persuade the committee to retain funding for, and reject \nthe administration's attempts to kill, the Emergency Steel Loan \nGuarantee Program in both 2003 and 2004. But that didn't stop the Bush \nadministration. When it became clear that they couldn't kill the \nprogram in their budget, they tried to kill it administratively, by \nshifting funds out of the steel loan guarantee program and into another \nCommerce Department account. Instead of helping steelworkers keep their \njobs, the Bush administration wanted to shift money in the loan \nguarantee program to some other account at the Commerce Department, an \nagency that, in this administration, has spent millions of dollars \nhelping multinational corporations transfer American jobs overseas.\n  But, some of us, unlike the Bush administration, believe in keeping \nAmerican jobs here at home. So we kept pushing to save our steel jobs. \nTo stop them from being sent overseas. And, we did it. We did it in \nspite of the Bush administration. If you don't believe me, listen to \nwhat Jim Bradley, the CEO of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Company said on \nMarch 26, 2003, the day on which Wheeling Pittsburgh's application for \na steel loan guarantee was approved. He stated:\n\n       Without the leadership of Sen. Robert Byrd, Wheeling-\n     Pittsburgh Steel's 3,800 employees would be facing a bleak \n     future. By creating and fighting for the Emergency Steel Loan \n     Guarantee Program, Sen. Byrd has given this company and its \n     workers the opportunity to build a future for themselves and \n     for the communities in which they live and work.\n\n  Now, I am not reading this to toot my own horn. I am reading it to \nremind West Virginia steelworkers and their families that this \nadministration is not here to help you. I am reading it to remind \neveryone listening that this administration worked to kill the very \nsteel program that saved the steel jobs of thousands of steelworkers \nfrom Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. And that is not Robert Byrd \nsaying it; that is the president of the steel company where 4,000 jobs \nwere saved saying it.\n  So, let me say this, loud and clear: steelworkers in West Virginia \nand across the Nation, believe me when I tell you that this \nadministration is not in your camp. Don't be hoodwinked by their phony \nconcern for your welfare. It is not sincere. They don't care about you. \nWords are cheap. Actions matter.\n  As the Book of James states, ``What good is it, my brothers, if a man \nclaims to have faith but no deeds?'' This administration loves to talk \nabout what it has done for West Virginia steel, but it did nothing. \nWhere are the deeds? The Bush administration hasn't been there for \nWeirton and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel's thousands of steelworkers and \nretirees when they needed its help.\n  And we know that, based on its deplorable track record, the Bush \nadministration won't be there for them in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11287-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11287-S11288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LEAVING WEST VIRGINIA CHILDREN BEHIND\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I attended a two-room school house as a \nyoung boy. When I moved on to high school, I was one of 28 students in \nmy graduating class at Mark Twain High School. At Mark Twain, there was \nno question of accountability. The teachers were in charge. The \nstudents were there to study. My parents drilled one idea in my head, \nand it remains a guide for me today: learn. Learn, and always strive to \nmake yourself smarter tomorrow than you are today.\n  Sadly, too often today, that same emphasis is not placed on teaching \nand learning. I know it. Parents know it. Members of Congress know it. \nThat is why we voted to create the No Child Left Behind Act. Congress \nand President Bush worked together to ensure greater accountability in \nAmerica's schools. We established standards. We set the bar. But to \nhelp schools reach those standards and surpass them, Congress and the \nPresident promised increased resources to help schools succeed. To \ndate, it has been an empty promise.\n  Since President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act into law \nwith such great fanfare in 2002, not one Bush administration budget has \nprovided the funds that America's schools expected. In fact, \nnationwide, the Bush White House has shortchanged schools by $33 \nbillion. How often do we hear that fact from the White House? Not once. \nThe administration trumpets its No Child Left Behind Act, but fails \nmiserably when funding it. Accountability cannot just be a standard for \nteachers; it must also be a standard for this administration.\n  Compounding the problem and the frustration for parents and teachers, \neach time I and other Senators offer amendments to make good on the \npromise of No Child Left Behind, the Bush White House and the \nRepublican congressional leadership line up and defeat those \namendments. Making false promises to teachers and students and parents \nis no way to improve teaching and learning. It is another in this \nadministration's broken record of broken promises.\n  Look at one program as an example. The Federal title I initiative \nprovides dollars geared specifically for children from poor school \ndistricts. The No Child law established specific funding levels for \ntitle I for every year through 2012, including $20.5 billion this year. \nBut the Bush administration tells schools to make do with a whole lot \nless, undercutting that pledge in its budget by more than $7 billion.\n  In my state of West Virginia, about half of the public schools \nreceive title I funding. While the President's No Child Left Behind Act \npromised Mountain State schools $154 million for title I for 2005, the \nBush administration's budget undercut that funding by 36 percent. \nTranslated into students, the President's budget would deny full \nservices to 18,398 West Virginia children. Evidently, ``Leave Only \n18,398 Children Behind'' was not a catchy enough title for the new law.\n  When President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act on January 8, \n2002, he made a statement that I wholeheartedly endorse. The President \nsaid:\n\n       There's no greater challenge than to make sure that every \n     single child, regardless of where they live, how they're \n     raised, the income level of their family, every child receive \n     a first-class education in America.\n\n  That is what the President said.\n  But what the President said and what the President coughs up in \nfunding have proved to be vastly different stories. The No Child Left \nBehind Act promised to give schools the money they need to help every \nyoung person in this country succeed in the classroom. That promise has \nbeen broken. When it comes to America's schools and keeping the promise \nof No Child Left Behind, the Bush White House gets an F.\n  The title I program is not the only education program facing funding \nshortfalls. The Bush administration freezes Pell Grant awards for the \nthird straight year, cutting back on college financial assistance. The \nWhite House also has proposed to eliminate funding for 38 school \nprograms including dropout prevention, school counseling, alcohol abuse \nreduction, and arts in education.\n  If there is one Federal investment that can offer real dividends down \nthe road, it is education. But the White House continues to play \npolitical games with classroom funding. It is time to end the posturing \nand give students and teachers the resources that they need to succeed.\n  In the coming weeks, the Senate will once more vote on the \nlegislation that funds No Child Left Behind and Pell\n\n[[Page S11288]]\n\nGrants and education initiatives throughout the country. I urge \nSenators to finally make good on the promise made to parents and \nstudents and teachers. And I urge the administration to stop playing \ngames with America's kids. Our schools and our children cannot afford 4 \nmore years of broken promises.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11288-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DOD AUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Department \nof Defense Authorization conference report.\n  This bill funds important priorities for our troops. It gives them a \n3.5-percent pay raise. It makes last year's increases in special pay \nfor combat duty and family separation permanent.\n  The bill expands health care coverage for our National Guard and \nReserve members and improves retirement and survivor benefits for those \nwho have served.\n  The bill also funds the safety needs of our troops for the coming \nyear. It includes over $750 million for force protection gear, \nincluding over $430 million for body armor. More than $570 million is \nprovided for additional armored humvees, and another $100 million will \nbe used on more armor for existing vehicles.\n  This bill gives our troops the tools they need to do their jobs, and \nthe benefits they and their families deserve.\n  This bill also contains important reforms to the Energy Employees \nCompensation Program.\n  The Bunning-Bingaman worker compensation Amendment was added in the \nbill when it was on the Senate floor. The amendment included reform for \nthe compensation program and was cosponsored by a bipartisan group \nincluding myself and 18 other Senators.\n  I thank the Senate managers, Senators Warner and Levin, for their \nconsideration and support of this important provision in the conference \nreport.\n  This provision will fix the problems with Subtitle D of the \nDepartment of Energy's Energy Employees compensation program for sick \ninjured cold war workers at Energy sites throughout the country.\n  Since the end of World War II, workers at Department of Energy sites \nacross the country helped our Nation face threats from our enemies by \ncreating and maintaining our Nation's nuclear weapons.\n  Many of these workers sacrificed their health and safety and were \nexposed to harms unknown at the time in their work to preserve our \nfreedoms.\n  Congress passed a compensation program for the energy workers in 2000 \nin an effort to help these workers.\n  The Department of Energy's Subtitle D program failed miserably. \nDuring the past 4 years the Department received $95 million but \nprocessed and paid only a small number of the more than 25,000 claims \nfor workers who were made ill by their work.\n  DOE's miserable job with this program was especially troubling \nbecause of the Kentucky workers at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion plant, \nwhere the uranium shipped to sites throughout the country was refined.\n  Under DOE's operation, more than 3,000 former Paducah workers have \nfiled for compensation for their illnesses. But zero Paducah workers \nhave received compensation for their illnesses.\n  The provision in this bill transfers Subtitle D claims processing \noperations from the Department of Energy to the Department of Labor, \nwhich is currently handling thousands of similar claims under Subtitle \nB of the program.\n  The Department of Labor runs one of the largest and most efficient \nclaims operations in the country.\n  Payments will be made directly by the Department of Labor to the \nworker or survivor. This solves the current issue of no willing payer \nfor all eligible claims. Workers will get prompt medical care for their \ncovered illnesses with no need to go through another system at the \nState.\n  This reform effort finally fulfills the promise that Congress made to \nDOE workers in 2000.\n  Many of these workers are ill and dying. Because of this reform, they \nwill not have to wait for the Department of Energy to get its act \ntogether to process and pay the valid claims in a timely manner. DOL \nwill take over these operations and process the claims much more \nefficiently and get deserving claimants the compensation Congress \npromised.\n  I urge you to support this conference report to help protect those \nworkers who risked their health and safety to help us win the cold war.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern about \nsection 3116 of the fiscal year 2005 Department of Defense \nAuthorization Conference Report, S. 4200, which the Senate passed by \nunanimous consent this week. Section 3116 establishes new procedures \nfor the disposal of high-level radioactive waste in South Carolina and \nIdaho that resulted from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at \nDepartment of Energy, DOE, facilities.\n  As my colleagues will recall, 48 members of this body voted to remove \nthese provisions during Senate floor consideration of the fiscal year \n2005 Department of Defense Authorization bill. Senators were concerned \nthat the provisions in the Senate-passed bill would allow the \nDepartment of Energy to leave millions of gallons of high-level nuclear \nwaste next to drinking water supplies in South Carolina. While these \nprovisions have been modified in conference and some changes have been \nmade in an effort to strengthen the language, I regret to say that \nloopholes still remain that cast serious doubt about whether the \nenvironment near these facilities will be protected.\n  I want to be certain that this language does not preempt the ability \nof States in which these facilities are located to issue permits to \nprotect the surface and drinking water near these DOE facilities. The \nnew conference report language in section 3116 appears to protect the \nright of states to approve closure plans or issue permits for the \nclosure of nuclear waste containing tanks. The opening lines of section \n3116 specifically eliminates the ability of the Federal Government to \nregulate these tanks under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the \nEnergy Reorganization Act of 1974 or ``other laws that define classes \nof radioactive waste.'' This language is silent on state's authority, \ndelegated to them by the federal government under the Clean Water and \nSafe Drinking Water Acts, to issue permits protecting surface water and \ndrinking water. The conferees did not exempt the requirements of the \nClean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts. These laws and the \nregulations that implement them, which do contain lists of radioactive \npollutants, are not overridden. It is my hope that these laws will be \nimplemented the way the conferees intended, and States will continue to \nbe allow to protect their citizens from exposure to radioactivity \nthrough the water they drink and our lakes, rivers, streams and \nwetlands.\n  I am also concerned that nuclear waste greater than class C, and \ngenerally not suitable for near surface disposal, will remain onsite \nwith limited oversight. Section 3116 allows these wastes to stay onsite \npursuant to a plan developed by the DOE in consultation with the NRC. I \nwould have preferred that NRC be explicitly required to follow current \nregulation regarding disposal of greater than class C waste. Section \n3116 instead requires a new ``plan'' that has no particular \nrequirements. Mr. President, radioactive waste remains environmentally \nharmful for an extremely long period of time. It had been my hope that \nwe could have been more clear about the guidelines for its disposal.\n  As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, one of \nthe Senate Committees with jurisdiction over the management of nuclear \nmaterials, I am deeply concerned with this provisions. It is \nunfortunate that it will soon be law. I am concerned that, in the \nfuture, with one small change in this legislation, several other States \nmay find their water resources at risk.\n  Indeed, if this waste sludge remains, the Savannah River site would \ncontinue to be among the most radioactively contaminated sites on the \nplanet. It is my hope that the agencies responsible for implementing \nthis section will do so responsibly, and I will be monitoring their \nactions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11288-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11288-S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       20TH ANNIVERSARY OF NATIONAL BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to share my support and\n\n[[Page S11289]]\n\nthoughts on the 20th anniversary of October's designation as National \nBreast Cancer Awareness Month. I am pleased to see the dedication and \nawareness that has grown over the past 2 decades regarding this \nspecific type of cancer.\n  Twenty years ago, very few people openly discussed breast cancer. \nGeneral public awareness regarding the high occurrence or symptoms was \nnext to none. As a result many lives were lost do to the lack of \nknowledge and education regarding detection, treatment, and prevention. \nHowever, over the past 2 decades awareness has reached astronomical \nlevels. Today, breast cancer awareness is displayed by various \norganizations and facets of all kinds both in and out of the health \ncare community. Most of all breast care awareness is highlighted by the \ngrowing number of survivors who are alive to share their stories of \ndifficulty and hope. That alone is a feat in itself which shows that \npublic awareness has grown and continues to do so.\n  My wife Barbara is one of these survivors, who battled this \ncondition, not once, but twice. If it was not for the continuous \nefforts over the past 2 decades, my wife may not have had the knowledge \nor encouragement to detect early symptoms and seek diagnosis and \ntreatment. My family and I are thankful everyday that Barbra made it \nthrough these difficult ordeals. Together we learned how important it \nis for women of all ages to be proactive in learning about prevention, \ndetecting symptoms, and seeking early treatment.\n  I applaud the various efforts that are being carried out nationwide \nby varying entities such as business, corporations, media, \npublications, schools, spokespersons, and women and men of all ages. \nThis widespread dedication is a tremendous force that has proven to be \ninfluential in our Nation's efforts to combat this disease.\n  I believe it is important for all of us to take an active part in \nhelping to educate the public and find a cure. Currently, there are \nlegislative initiatives geared towards increasing research and funding \nfor all types of cancer, including breast cancer. It is my hope that as \nthis Congress draws to a close that we work together in a broad \nbipartisan manner to see that we secure necessary funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH, and the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, CDC. The President has requested inadequate funding \nlevels in the fiscal year 2005 budget for these programs, which oversee \na great deal of cancer research done in this country. As a member of \nthe Senate Committee on Appropriations I was pleased to support and \nhelp pass increased funding for the NIH and CDC in the fiscal year 2005 \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriation bill. But \nit is still critical that my colleagues work in a bipartisan manner and \nsupport these increases as we complete the final stages of the \nappropriations process.\n  Once again, I commend the work and dedication of all the individuals \nwho continue to bring awareness to this important cause in the month of \nOctober, as well as year round. These efforts have saved numerous lives \nand will someday hopefully eradicate this type of cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11289-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MILC PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Spina bifida affects more than 4,000 pregnancies each year, \nwith 1,500 babies born with Spina bifida each year. There are three \ndifferent forms of Spina bifida--the most severe being myelomeningocele \nSpina bifida, which causes nerve damage and severe disabilities. \nMyelomeningocele Spina bifida is diagnosed in 96 percent of children \nborn with this condition. Additionally, 70 to 90 percent of the \nchildren born with Spina bifida are at risk of mental retardation, a \ncondition caused when spinal fluid collects around the brain.\n  The exact cause of Spina bifida is not known, but researchers have \nconcluded that women of childbearing age who take daily folic acid \nsupplements can reduce their chances of having a Spina Bifida pregnancy \nby up to 75 percent. Progress has been made with regard to the \nimportance of consuming folic acid supplements and maintaining diets \nrich in folic acid. The September 17, 2004, edition of the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention publication, Morbidity and Mortality \nWeekly Report, finds that 40 percent of women of childbearing age \nreported taking a vitamin containing folic acid every day, an increase \nof eight percentage points from 2003. This increase suggests a \nsubstantial positive change in behavior. Since the Food and Drug \nAdministration decision to fortify enriched grains with folic acid, the \nCDC has documented a 26 percent decline in these birth defects. Despite \nthis success, thousands of pregnancies each year continue to be \naffected by these preventable birth defects. Thus, increasing use of \nvitamins containing folic acid remains an important strategy for \npreventing these birth defects.\n  Although folic acid consumption reduces the risk and incidence of \nSpina bifida pregnancies, we will still have babies born with Spina \nBifida who need intensive care and families that need guidance and \nsupport in caring for and raising these children. As a result of this \nneural tube defect, most babies suffer from a host of physical, \npsychological, and educational challenges, including paralysis, \ndevelopmental delay, numerous surgeries, and living with a shunt in \ntheir skulls in an attempt to ameliorate their condition. Today, \napproximately 90 percent of all babies diagnosed with this birth defect \nlive into adulthood, approximately 80 percent have normal IQs, and \napproximately 75 percent participate in sports and other recreational \nactivities. With proper medical care, people who suffer from Spina \nBifida can lead full and productive lives. However, they must learn how \nto move around using braces, crutches or wheelchairs, and how to \nfunction independently. They are also at risk of a host of secondary \nhealth problems ranging from depression and learning disabilities to \nskin problems and severe latex allergies.\n  Lifesaving breakthroughs in research, combined with improvements in \nhealth care and treatment of children with Spina Bifida, now \nfortunately lead many with Spina bifida to live into adulthood. \nHowever, adults with Spina bifida face many new challenges in the \nfields of education, job training, independent living, health care for \nsecondary conditions, and concerns related to aging.\n  I am grateful for my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond who, along \nwith myself, has been working to improve the quality of life for \nindividuals with Spina bifida with the passage of the Birth Defects and \nDevelopmental Disabilities Prevention Act of 2003 and supporting \nincreased funding for the National Spina Bifida Program at the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention. In fiscal year 2004, Congress \nprovided a much needed $3 million in funding for the National Spina \nBifida Program. I strongly urge my colleagues to support increased \nfunding in fiscal year 2005 to ensure that the CDC has the resources \nnecessary to prevent Spina bifida, improve quality-of-life for those \nliving with the condition, and to deliver important public health \nmessages to those communities most at-risk for a Spina bifida \npregnancy.\n\n[[Page S11290]]\n\n  I want also to recognize the special work of the Spina Bifida \nAssociation of America, an organization that has helped people with \nSpina bifida and their families for nearly 30 years, working every day \nto prevent and reduce suffering from this devastating birth defect. The \nSBAA was founded in 1973 to address the needs of the individuals and \nfamilies affected by Spina bifida and is currently the only national \norganization solely dedicated to advocating on behalf of the Spina \nbifida community. As part of its service through approximately 60 \nchapters in more than 125 communities across the country, the SBAA puts \nexpecting parents in touch with families who have a child with Spina \nbifida. These families answer questions and concerns and help guide \nexpecting parents. The SBAA then works to provide lifelong support and \nassistance for affected children and their families.\n  Together, the SBAA and the Spina Bifida Association of Connecticut \nwork tirelessly to help families meet the challenges and enjoy the \nrewards of raising their child. I would like to acknowledge and thank \nSBAA and the SBAC for all that they have done for the families affected \nby this birth defect, especially those living in my State. The Spina \nbifida community and our nation owe a tremendous debt to the SBAA for \nits work over the past three decades. I am honored to be an honorary \nco-chair along with Majority Leader Frist of the 16th Annual Roast for \nSpina Bifida to benefit the Association and its work in local \ncommunities around the country.\n  As a nation, we have accomplished a great deal in our battle against \nbirth defects. However, much more work remains to be done. I urge all \nof my colleagues and all Americans to endorse the important efforts to \nprevent Spina Bifida but also to support those already living with this \noften debilitating birth defect. Those living with Spina bifida and \ntheir loved ones deserve our utmost support. It is my hope that by \nrecognizing National Spina bifida Awareness Month we can move closer to \nthe laudable goal of eventually eliminating the suffering caused by \nthis terrible birth defect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11290-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LEGISLATION\n\n  (At the request of Mr. REID, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we live in a nation of the most \ncreative and inventive people in the world, but apparently some of my \nRepublican colleagues do not appreciate them or their efforts. Thanks \nto the ingenuity, the inspiration, and the hard work of thousands of \nour fellow citizens, the United States enjoys the best in artistic \nexpression and technological advancement, but that seems to mean little \nto those Senators. We enjoy the fruits of the labors of all the \ninventors and authors and artists--and of all the people who work in \nconnection with them--not only as individuals but as a nation, but not \neveryone here recognizes the debt we owe them. In the twenty-first \ncentury, it is intellectual property that keeps this country at the \nforefront of the world economy, and what preserves our force as a \nglobal power, and I would think that those across the aisle would value \nthe importance of that power.\n  Affording that intellectual property the most straightforward and \nreasonable protections, and giving law enforcement officials the \nresources to give those protections genuine power, would seem to be a \nsensible goal. Indeed, failing to do so would be unconscionable. In the \nUnited States, copyright industries alone account for 12 percent of the \ngross domestic product, and employ more than 11 million people. Those \ncopyright industries have been adding workers at an annual rate that \nexceeds that of the economy as a whole by 27 percent, and those \nindustries have achieved annual foreign sales and exports of almost $90 \nbillion. But some Republicans are preventing the Senate from passing \nthe most important intellectual property legislation before the \nCongress this year, and they are hiding behind anonymous holds. This is \nwrong.\n  Senator Hatch and I, and many of our colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee, have been working on this legislation for some time now--\nmost recently doing so late at night and through the weekends. We have \ndone so because of the crushing need to ensure that the intellectual \nproperty laws are adequate to the legitimate and pressing concerns \nraised by many about the effectiveness of those laws. We have a package \nof strong and significant measures that would bolster protection of the \nintellectual property that drives our nation's economy and that would \nensure law enforcement has the tools it needs to offer that protection. \nThere was no reason not to send this package to the House immediately, \nand work with our colleagues there to ensure it became enacted into \nlaw, as soon as humanly possible.\n  In blocking this legislation, these Republicans are failing to \npractice what they have so often preached during this Congress. For all \nof their talk about jobs, about allowing the American worker to \nsucceed, they are now placing our economy at greater risk through their \ninaction. It is a failure that will inevitably continue a disturbing \ntrend: our economy loses literally hundreds of billions of dollars \nevery year to various forms of piracy.\n  Instead of making inroads in this fight, we have the Republican \nintellectual property roadblock. It is a barrier that stands in the way \nof the CREATE Act, a noncontroversial bill the text of which has \nalready passed both the Senate and House. The CREATE Act clarifies an \nimportant component of the Bayh-Dole Act that, when read literally by \nthe courts, runs counter to Congress's intent. By failing to make this \nclarification Congress is creating a deterrent to forming the very same \npublic-private research partnerships meant to be encouraged by that \nAct. These partnerships have proved incredibly beneficial to \nuniversities, the private sector, the American worker, and the U.S. \neconomy. All are placed in jeopardy by Congressional inaction.\n  The roadblock has also scuttled the ART Act, a bill that passed the \nJudiciary Committee and then the full Senate by unanimous consent. This \nlegislation would have provided new tools in the fight against bootleg \ncopies of movies snatched from the big screen by camcorders smuggled \ninto theaters. And it would have adopted a creative solution developed \nby the Copyright Office to address the growing problem of piracy of \npre-release works. Our anonymous Republican friends have ensured that \nthese problems are left unaddressed by the 108th Congress.\n  The PIRATE Act, too, passed the Senate by unanimous consent. That \nbill would have given to the Attorney General new tools in the fight \nagainst piracy of books, music, movies and other creative works. \nSenator Biden's Anticounterfeiting Act, which would have marked a step \nforward in the fight against software piracy, was also included in the \nintellectual property package. We can tell our software companies that \nthey will have to wait at least another year for the remedies promised \nby this legislation. And it is important to note that the Business \nSoftware Alliance tell us that $29 billion in software was stolen in \n2003 alone.\n  There are other noncontroversial provisions in this legislation as \nwell, such as language that would help ensure that the Library of \nCongress is able to continue its important work in archiving our \nnation's fading film heritage. Some of America's oldest films--works \nthat document who we were as a people in the beginning of the 20th \ncentury--are literally disintegrating faster than they can be saved.\n  None of these were partisan provisions. And when Senator Hatch and I \nput our names on the same piece of legislation, you can bet that the \nresult is never a bill that veers very far to the right or the left. He \nand I have worked together to produce a great deal of good intellectual \nproperty policy over the years, and I am sorry to see that some on his \nside of the aisle have blocked our efforts at similar progress this \nyear.\n  We can foresee the disappointing result of this roadblock: our \ncopyright holders will suffer, our patent holders will suffer, and so \ntoo will the American worker. In yet another important area, the \nRepublicans that control the House of Representatives, the Senate, and \nthe White House, have failed to respond to the needs of the American \npeople. That is a shame.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11291-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11291]]\n                       HUNGARIAN GOLD TRAIN CASE\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in \nsupporting the quest for justice in the Hungarian Gold Train case. I \nhave heard from these Holocaust survivors. Their story is painful, and \nthe evidence is overwhelming. Our moral duty is clear.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of this is that we should not be \nhaving this debate at all. The facts of the Gold Train incident are not \nreally in dispute. And for all the effort expended by the Federal \nGovernment in court trying to evade these facts, the facts were \ndisclosed to the world by the Federal Government itself.\n  The reason we know about the Gold Train is because of the \nPresidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets, PCHA. In the \n1990s, our own Government told other nations they should look into \ntheir pasts--face the facts--and make redress as appropriate. Seventeen \nnations established commissions to do that. So did we. This Congress \ncreated the PCHA to study the past and reveal the truth. The Commission \nwas fortunate to have Edgar Bronfman, then chairman of the World Jewish \nCongress, as its head. Stuart Eizenstat, the government's top official \ndealing with these matters, was a key member. It had a full staff of \nhistorians and researchers and a budget of several million dollars.\n  The Commission found that the record of the United States was a \nsource of pride. Our Nation not only liberated Europe, but after the \nwar, served as a model for how to handle the assets that had been \nstolen from Europe's Jews--with one glaring exception. In 1999, the \nCommission issued a report on the Gold Train. After half a century of \nsilence and coverup, the Federal Government stated that the Gold Train \nwas an ``egregious failure of the United States to follow its own \npolicy regarding restitution of Holocaust victims' property after World \nWar II.'' We cannot be proud of this conduct, but we can all be proud \nthat the Government made this admission.\n  We should all have expected that the next step was to make good on \nthese disclosures and this conclusion. The Government should have \ncompensated these survivors. Instead, the survivors were forced to go \nto court. The Justice Department is fighting them inch by inch.\n  One would expect the Justice Department to defend the Government's \nPCHA report. Instead, the Justice Department has disputed the accuracy \nof the report and claimed that the Commission withdrew its report. \nHowever, as Chairman Edgar Bronfman has made plain, the Progress Report \nis an ``accurate account of the United States' handling and disposition \nof the `Gold Train' property.'' Bronfman also has noted that, ``In no \nway . . . did the PCHA intend to retract or retreat from the findings \nof the Progress Report.'' In fact, Mr. Bronfman points out, the report \nis prominently displayed on the commission's website.\n  Our Nation has a duty to the past. It has a duty to these people. \nThey are dying every day. The Justice Department should sit down and \nresolve this matter with these survivors. That is the right thing to \ndo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11291-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to briefly remark on H.R. \n2391 and H.R. 4077, a package of bills referred to as the Intellectual \nProperty Protection Act of 2004. I have objected to the further \nconsideration or passage of these bills by unanimous consent.\n  From the text of the bills that have been available to date for \nSenators to review, I believe that one part of this broad legislation, \nthe Family Movie Act, may actually harm consumers while appearing to \nhelp them. To be clear, I support the stated goal of the act's authors: \nimmunizing from legal challenges a technology that enables parents to \nskip offensive material from prerecorded copies of films and \ntelevision. While I applaud the merits of their stated intent, I fear \nthat the very exemption designed to achieve this laudable goal \nsimultaneously creates an implication that certain basic practices that \nconsumers have enjoyed for years--like fast-forwarding through \nadvertisements--would constitute criminal copyright infringement. I \nnote that Consumers Union and Public Knowledge, as well as a host of \nothers parties interested in protecting consumers, share my concerns.\n  Americans have been recording TV shows and fast-forwarding through \ncommercials for more than 30 years. Do we really expect to throw people \nin jail in 2004 for behavior they've been engaged in for more than a \nquarter century?\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in this Chamber to \naddress not only these concerns, but also the uncertain liability \ncreated for manufacturers that bring other innovative and pro-family \nproducts to market in the face of continual threats of extinction from \npowerful interests who seek to thwart their entry.\n  For these reasons, I do not intend to remove my hold on these bills \nuntil I am satisfied that consumer interests have been protected in \nthis legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11291-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONGRATULATIONS TO ASCAP ON 90 YEARS OF SUCCESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am delighted to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 90th Anniversary of ASCAP, the American Society of \nComposers, Authors and Publishers.\n  In 1913, nine men braved foul New York weather to attend a small \nmeeting at a restaurant called Luchow's. The meeting had been organized \nby three of the men; Raymond Hubbell, a composer, George Maxwell; a \npublisher; and Nathan Burkan, an attorney. They were brought together \nby the novel idea of creating a society to ensure writers and \npublishers received the recognition and revenue their works generated. \nEnlisting the help of songwriter Victor Herbert, the group found five \nother writers and publishers to get the word out. A second meeting was \nscheduled, and in February 1914, over 100 members of the music \ncommunity officially began the American Society of Composers, Authors \nand Publishers.\n  In the time that has passed, ASCAP has represented many of the \ngreatest musical talents in recent history. The society's members have \nincluded Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Peggy Lee, Garth Brooks, Jimmy \nHendrix, Carly Simon, Bob Marley, Henry Mancini, Billy Joel, Bruce \nSpringsteen and Madonna. Members have won countless awards for their \nwork, including current president Marilyn Bergman, who, in \ncollaboration with her husband, has won three Oscars, two Grammys and \nfour Emmys. Under her outstanding leadership it has grown to 185,000 \nmembers, including many of the newest and greatest names in music.\n  This year, ASCAP celebrates its 90th anniversary in a time of great \nimportance to the music copyright community. With the current debate \nover file sharing and constantly developing technology, individual \nartists are virtually powerless to protect their own work from illegal \ncopying. As a songwriter and member of ASCAP myself, I truly understand \nthe joy and pride that comes with the creation of a song, as I also \nunderstand the need for artists' rights to their songs to be protected. \nI have also had a professional connection with the property rights \nissues the society addresses. As the chairman and a long-time member of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees matters of intellectual \nproperty law, I appreciate the dedication the society has shown toward \nmaintaining the integrity and efficiency of copyright laws.\n  In the past 90 years, ASCAP has witnessed the transitions from \nrecords to 8 tracks to cassettes to compact discs and now to mp3s. It \nhas been through the many trends of music, from big band and swing in \n1920s and 1930s, to the wide range of musical styles available today. \nASCAP has stood the test of time. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nrecognizing its great contributions to the world of intellectual \nproperty law and wishing ASCAP and its members well in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11291-4", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11291-S11297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, I have previously addressed the Senate to \ndiscuss the issue of so-called global warming. I have taken a special \ninterest in this issue because the gravity of what is at stake demands \nit. I have taken a simple, yet profound approach to dealing with \nenvironmental issues, working to\n\n[[Page S11292]]\n\nensure that the laws we pass represent sound public policy. Of my three \nguiding principles for all committee work, the first principle is that \nGovernment should rely on the most objective science.\n  Unfortunately, a commitment to drawing conclusions based on science \nis not a popular approach. What has most galled my critics is that I do \nnot ``spin the science'' to make it something it is not. Good science \nis and should remain the product of well designed and reproducible \nstudies and research.\n  All too often, however, the studies that are touted by my critics are \ntainted by political and ideological agendas and cannot be reproduced \nbecause the authors will not release the data that supposedly supports \ntheir conclusions--all of which raises the eyebrows of credible \nscientists. Such science has no place in our system of government and \nshould not be used to drive major U.S. policy.\n  When I led the congressional delegation to Milan last December, I was \ngreeted by posters that quoted me as saying global warming is ``the \ngreatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.'' I thanked the \ngreen activists for uncharacteristically quoting me correctly. Global \nwarming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people. \nIt was true when I said it before, and it remains true today.\n  Perhaps what has made this hoax so effective is that we hear over and \nover that the science is settled and that there is consensus that, \nunless we fundamentally change our way of life by limiting greenhouse \ngas emissions, we will cause catastrophic global warming. This is \nsimply a false statement.\n  Mr. President, 4,000 scientists, 70 of whom are Nobel Prize winners, \nsigned the Heidelberg Appeal, which says that no compelling evidence \nexists to justify controls of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. \nOver 17,000 scientists signed another document that directly \ncontradicts the false claims of consensus. The Oregon Petition, \ncompiled by Dr. Frederick Seitz, a past president of the National \nAcademy of Sciences and a professor emeritus at Rockefeller University, \nreads as follows:\n\n       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human \n     release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse \n     gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause \n     catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption \n     of the Earth's climate.\n\n  What a powerful, unequivocal statement that is. So powerful, in fact, \nthat ideologues fraudulently sent in made-up names and belittled \nlegitimate scientists on the Petition, such as Dr. Perry Mason, simply \nbecause he and a few others shared their names with famous fictional \ncharacters. Such immature acts belong on a grade school playground, but \nare simply shameful in a serious policy debate. Yet we have heard these \nbaseless charges repeatedly. But these distortions only serve to \nunderscore the fragileness of the myth that there is consensus. If \nthere truly is consensus, why would so many renowned scientists sign \nsuch statements? If there truly is consensus, why would these \nenvironmental activists be so threatened by these documents that they \nwould make fraudulent submissions? In short, if there is such \ncontroversy over whether there is consensus, how can there possibly be \nconsensus? The controversy over its existence is itself proof that no \nconsensus exists.\n  This point was made succinctly by former Carter administration Energy \nSecretary James Schlesinger, who wrote in the Washington Post: ``There \nis an idea among the public that the science is settled. That remains \nfar from the truth.'' He also wrote that the global warming theory has \nhardened into orthodoxy that searches out heretics and seeks to punish \nthem.\n  And that was James Schlesinger, Energy Secretary in a Democrat \nadministration.\n  Thankfully, despite the efforts to ``punish them,'' credible \nscientists continue to conduct well-designed, reproducible studies, and \nI will list some of them here today. Last year, I spoke at length to \ndescribe the great number of uncertainties surrounding claims of global \nwarming. I described real science that contradicts the alarmists, who, \nwracked by fear, see a future plagued by catastrophic flooding, war, \nterrorism, economic dislocations, droughts, crop failures, mosquito-\nborne diseases, and harsh weather--all caused by man-made greenhouse \ngas emissions.\n  We cannot afford to forget that climate change alarmists' visions \nhave been with us for decades. In 1972, the National Science Board, the \ngoverning body of the National Science Foundation, observed:\n\n       Judging from the record of the past inter-glacial ages, the \n     present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end \n     . . . leading into the next glacial age.\n\n  In 1974, Time magazine in an article entitled ``Another Ice Age?'' \nwarned:\n\n       However widely the weather varies from place to place and \n     time to time, when metrologists take an average of \n     temperatures around the globe they find that the atmosphere \n     has been growing gradually cooler for the past three decades. \n     The trend shows no indication of reversing. Climatological \n     Cassandras are becoming increasingly apprehensive, for the \n     weather aberrations they are studying may be the harbinger \n     of another ice age.\n\n  These fears became the motivation of a drumbeat from \nenvironmentalists that we must fundamentally alter our way of living to \navoid a cataclysmic ice age. Of course, these fears proved baseless.\n  And when this 30-year cooling cycle ceased, these same alarmists \nagain proclaimed we must fundamentally alter our way of living to avoid \ncataclysmic global warming. From the scientific literature, I believe \nthese fears are equally baseless.\n  I believe it would be unconscionable to heed the alarmists' cries for \neconomic disarmament without subjecting these claims of doom to the \nscrutiny they deserve. Predictably, those who peddle fear do not want \ndiscussions of science. Hiding behind claims of ``the science is \nsettled,'' they conjure ever more creative ways to market the myth.\n  The most recent example is the movie, ``The Day After Tomorrow,'' in \nwhich the laws of physics are repeatedly violated to create fear of an \nice age caused by global warming. First it was an ice age. Then it was \nglobal warming. Now it is an ice age caused within days because of \nglobal warming. Seems they can't make up their minds what they are \nafraid of--but their solution is always the same, restrict the economy \nand outsource American jobs overseas.\n  Of course, the movie was widely panned, not simply as a ``bad'' \nmovie, but a ``stupid'' movie. Even some environmentalists had to admit \nthere was no science to support the movie. For instance, Dan Schrag, a \npaleoclimatologist, said:\n\n       My first reaction was, ``Oh my God, this is a disaster \n     because it is such a distortion of science.\n\n  What disturbed me was not the movie, which after all is simply the \nvision of a German film producer with a dislike for Americans who says, \n``My secret dream is that this film moves politicians to act.'' No, \nwhat disturbed me was he may get his wish. Former Vice President Gore \nteamed up with the activist group, MoveOn.org, to use the movie as an \nopportunity to market their alarmist views and economy-capping \nsolutions. This is exactly what is wrong with how alarmists discuss \nthis issue. Rather than joining me and those like me in a commitment to \nusing the best, nonpoliticized science--whatever it finds--politically \nmotivated groups, such as MoveOn.org, pander to our worst fears to \ndrive their political agenda.\n  I would rather discuss what real science is showing. I said last July \nthat:\n\n       After studying the issue over the last several years, I \n     believe that the balance of the evidence offers strong proof \n     that natural variability is the overwhelming factor \n     influencing climate.\n\n  After continuing to study the science over the last year, that belief \nhas been strengthened. I submit, furthermore, that the scientific \ndebate is shifting away from those who subscribe to global warming \nalarmism.\n  IPPC incorrectly attributes ground station temperature rise to \nclimate change instead of local activity. One of the areas that has \ncaused global warming advocates the most heartburn has been the \ninconvenient, yet inescapable, fact that records from satellites using \nhighly reliable microwave sounding units show little warming, on a \nglobally averaged basis, in comparison to ground station records. This \nimportant discrepancy on its face would suggest the ground-based data \nis contaminated.\n\n[[Page S11293]]\n\nIt is now widely recognized that ground-based measurements are affected \nby such things as the ``heat island'' effect, large-scale land-use \nchanges and problems with maintaining ground-stations.\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, report \npublished in 2001 is claimed to be the most authoritative source for \nclaims that temperatures are rising due to climate change. The IPCC has \nbecome increasingly alarmist in its three successive reports. In its \nsummary referring to globally averaged temperature data, it says only \nthat ``These numbers take into account various adjustments, including \nheat island effects.'' The discussion within the body of the report to \nthis important issue, which must be thoroughly explained if ground-\nbased data is to be considered of more importance than highly reliable \nsatellite data, is disappointingly brief and uninformative as well. \nMoreover, it leaves the impression that everything except for \ntemperature changes due to climate has been factored out.\n  Thus, the entire validity of the conclusions from ground-station \ntemperature data rests on the claim that these temperature bias effects \nin the data from such things as growing cities, construction, \nagricultural practices and other economic activities which potentially \ncould impact temperature measurements have been completely subtracted \nout from the conclusions. But this may not be true.\n  A new study by Drs. Ross McKitrick and Patrick Michaels that was \npresented in an article published in the May 25 issue of ``Climate \nResearch,'' throws these assurances of the IPCC into serious doubt.\n  The study examined temperature records for 218 individual stations \nlocated in 93 countries since 1979, when satellite data first began \nbeing collected. The study then compared these to the IPCC grid cells \ncontaining these 218 stations.\n  The study concluded that the differences between the satellite data \nand the ground station data were almost completely explained by local \neconomic and social factors, and data quality control. Moreover, it \nfound that:\n\n     outside the dry/cold regions the measured temperature change \n     is primarily explained by economic and social variables.\n\n  In short, the IPCC's claims of increasing temperatures based on \nground-based data appear to be greatly overstated. As the article puts \nit, non-climate-related variables ``add up to a significant net warming \nbias at the global level.''\n  This finding is of tremendous importance, seriously eroding the \nfoundation for the house of cards upon which the global warming \nhysteria is built. Moreover, the study is well-designed and \nreproducible.\n  Mann's hockey stick is flawed and irreproducible. That study's design \nand reproducibility stands in stark contrast to another study heavily \nrelied upon by global warming advocates--the famous, or perhaps I \nshould say, infamous hockey stick chart published by Dr. Michael Mann. \nThe conclusions of this study have become a rallying cry for alarmists \nwho would have us believe this is final proof that 20th century \ntemperatures have spiked up dramatically. These results are routinely \nused in presentations to corporate officers to demonstrate that they \nhad better restructure their companies' operations and annual reports.\n  But Mann's conclusions have come under intense criticism recently, as \nother researchers have challenged both the methodology he used and the \nreliability of the results.\n  A team of scientists led by Dr. Willie Soon and Dr. Sally Baliunas, \nwho are astrophysicists from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, surveyed \n240 articles concerning local and regional-scale climate \nreconstructions over the last 1,000 years. The proxy record they \nexamined was far more extensive than that used by Mann. While Mann's \nanalysis relied mostly on tree-ring data from the Northern Hemisphere, \nthe researchers offer a detailed look at climate changes that occurred \nin different regions around the world over the last 1000 years using \nover 20 different proxies.\n  As a result of this extensive survey, Drs. Soon and Baliunas \nconcluded that:\n\n     the 20th century does not contain the warmest anomaly of the \n     past millennium in most proxy records, which have been \n     sampled world-wide. Past researchers implied that unusual \n     20th century warming means a global human impact. However, \n     the proxies show that the 20th century is not unusually warm \n     or extreme.\n\n  Other studies that are devastating to Mann's conclusion focus not on \nits inconsistency with the results of work of a multitude of other \nresearchers, but on his extremely questionable and improper methods. In \nan attempt last year to perform an audit of Mann's unique conclusions, \nDrs. McIntyre and McKitrick found that Mann's work was irreproducible \nwithout resorting to the use of flawed data sets, inappropriate data \nmanipulation, or ill-advised statistical procedures. To quote the \nresearchers, ``the dataset used to make [the Mann reconstruction] \ncontained collation errors, unjustified truncation or extrapolation of \nsource data, obsolete data, incorrect [methodological] calculations, \ngeographical mislocations and other serious defects.''\n  When the researchers corrected for these data and methodological \nflaws, they conclude that temperatures in the early 1400s rivaled those \nof today, indicating that human influences have not taken the climate \nto unprecedented territory.\n  Dr. Esper, a paleoclimate researcher, and his colleagues published a \npaper that suggests that the tree-ring histories heavily relied upon by \nMann in his temperature reconstructions were manipulated in such a way \nas to have most of the long term variability removed, making the 20th \ncentury temperatures appear much more unusual than they in fact were. \nEsper and his colleagues produced temperature reconstructions for the \npast 1,000 years using a more scientifically defensible approach to \nhandling tree-ring records that preserves long-term variability.\n  The study concludes that the past 1,000 years have been characterized \nby periods of warm and cold, and that as far back as about 1,000 years \nago, temperatures were as warm or warmer than in the late 20th century.\n  Of course, these studies show that the ``shaft'' of the hockey stick \ncreated by Mann is wrong. And it is intuitively true that the shaft is \nwrong. We have known for years about the Medieval Warm Period from 800 \nto 1400 A.D. We have known for years about what has been called the \nLittle Ice Age from 1600 to 1850 A.D. And the new studies I've just \ndescribed confirm these well-established naturally occurring climatic \nevents.\n  In other words, in creating his so-called hockey stick, Mann \ndeliberately eliminated the first blade of the hockey stick. By \neliminating the blade he left the false conclusion that the 20th \ncentury temperatures are unprecedented. They are not. The fact is that \nthe real temperatures spike far higher during the period he portrays as \na straight shaft than current temperatures--despite that his \nextraordinarily flawed results indicate we are living in the hottest \nperiod in the last 1,000 years.\n  Ironically, the often-criticized IPCC report itself contradicts \nMann's findings. As I described earlier, a new reproducible study \nindicates the IPCC's estimates of temperature rise themselves appear to \nmistakenly attribute socioeconomic and data quality factors that affect \ntemperature readings to climate change. Yet even so, the IPCC shows a \nfar smaller temperature increase than Mann. The IPCC shows an increase \nof 0.6 degrees Celsius over the last 100 years, but the ``blade'' of \nthe Mann hockey stick shows an increase of 0.95 Celsius--more than a 50 \npercent larger increase.\n\n  Moreover, the so-called hockey stick ``blade'' does not appear to be \nexplained by the statistical techniques Mann claims he used. In a \nrecent letter published in Geophysical Research Letters, Drs. Soon, \nBaliunas, and Legates closely examined the ``blade'' and found that it \ncould not be reproduced using either the technique Mann says he used, \nor other common statistical techniques. Once again, this key \nrequirement of reproducibility seems missing from the flagship study of \nthose crying that the sky is falling.\n  Most recently, Dr. Chapman and his colleagues commented on a \ncomparison of borehole temperature measurements with Dr. Mann's proxy \nrecords and questioned Dr. Mann's analysis techniques, concluding they \nare ``just bad\n\n[[Page S11294]]\n\nscience'' and that Dr. Mann had undertaken a ``selective and \ninappropriate presentation'' of results.\n  Thus, as Dr. Legates concluded in testimony before the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, this so-called flagship study:\n\n     certainly does not conform to the requirements of open access \n     and reproducibility, required by the Data Quality Act, nor \n     does it meet even minimal quality standards.\n\n  Dr. Legates went on to say in respect to the many problems inherent \nin Mann's study:\n\n       This leads me to reject Dr. Mann's . . . conclusions . . . \n     that anthropogenic factors provide the overwhelming influence \n     on global and hemispheric temperatures in the last 1800 years \n     and that the 1990s are the warmest decade, and 1998 the \n     warmest year, of the last 1800 years.\n\n  Some may try to defend the Mann conclusions, and believe his work is \nunimpeachable. But a recent article published in the July 1st, 2004 \nissue of Nature magazine repudiates that belief. In a brief \n``corrigendum,'' Mann makes a clear admission that the disclosure of \ndata and other methods supporting the hockey stick was materially \ninaccurate. This corrigendum was ordered by the Editorial Board after \ntwo other scientists, Dr. McIntyre and Dr. McKitrick filed a \n``Materials Complaint.'' According to these scientists, the on-line \nsupplemental information accompanying Mann's correction notice \nessentially concedes for the first time that key steps in the \ncomputations behind his conclusions were left out of and conflict with \nthe description of methods in the original paper.\n  Despite this, Mann continues to assert that these errors do not \naffect his results, saying: None of these errors affect our previously \npublished results.\n\n  But as McIntyre and McKitrick point out:\n\n     if this were true, then a simple constructive proof could \n     have been provided, showing before and after calculations. \n     This is conspicuously missing . . . We have done the \n     calculations and can assert categorically that the claim is \n     false. We have made a journal submission to this effect and \n     will explain the matter fully when that paper is published.\n\n  While this sad spectacle clearly is not yet over, three things are \nclear. Mann's hockey stick has never been reproduced, efforts to do so \nshowed that the study was replete with errors and miscalculations, and \ndespite his continuing faith in his hockey stick conclusions, Mann has \nyet to offer any proof whatsoever that they are correct. And yet the \nalarmists continue to claim we should unilaterally disarm America's \neconomy based on Mann's unbelievable--literally unbelievable--results.\n  Another controversial claim is that sea level is rising, and that \nthis is due to climate change. It has been claimed for years that sea \nlevel was rising rapidly, yet again fueling the call for action. Based \non modeling, the IPCC estimates that sea level will rise 1.8 \nmillimeters annually, or about one-fourteenth of an inch.\n  In a study published this year in Global and Planetary Change, Dr. \nNils-Axel Morner of Sweden found that sea level rise hysteria was \noverblown. In his study, which relied not only on old observational \nrecords, but satellite altimetry as well, he concluded that:\n\n     there is a total absence of any recent ``acceleration in sea \n     level rise'' as often claimed by IPCC and related groups.\n\n  Morner's findings go to the heart of the debate--the reliance by \nglobal warming advocates on faulty models that conflict with \nobservational records instead of observational records themselves. \nAccording to Morner, the:\n\n       IPCC made an estimate of all variables and their possible \n     contribution to sea level rise. They arrived at a mean value \n     of 0.9 millimeters per year. This value is in harmony with \n     the records of the present and near-past . . . Still--and \n     this is remarkable, [says Morner,]--IPCC compared their own \n     value with a model value of 1.8 millimeters per year and \n     discarded their own estimate as unrealistic.\n\n  Morner has blunt words for the IPCC approach, saying that he \n``discard[s] the model output of IPCC as untenable, not to say \nimpossible.''\n  Using satellite altimetry and other observational data, Morner finds \nthat the late 20th century lacks any sign of acceleration of sea rise, \nincluding the last decade. He concludes that, based on long-term \nobservational data as well as the newest technology, sea level in a \ncentury can be expected to be within the range of a 10 centimeter sea \nlevel decline to a 20 centimeter sea level rise, which translates to \nabout a four inch sea level decline to an eight inch sea level \nincrease.\n  Yet, remarkably, we still hear fears that the world will become \nflooded due to global warming. Such claims are, to be blunt, completely \nout of touch with most comprehensive science. As Sweden's Morner puts \nit, ``there is no fear of massive future flooding as claimed in most \nglobal warming scenarios.''\n  Something else I am told is that there has been an increase in the \nnumber and intensity of severe weather events. Typically these \ndoomsayers point to the droughts in the Southwest or point to more \nviolent hurricanes to prove that global warming is occurring.\n  In response to the current 5-year drought in the southwest, the New \nYork Times proclaimed on May 10 that ``Drought may be normal, but there \nmay be nothing normal about this drought.'' Of course, the paper \ninserted a weasel word to avoid actually describing how it was \nabnormal.\n  This is one of those claims that makes me want to utter the old \ninsult, ``You are so wrong, I don't know where to begin.'' If an \nincreased number of severe droughts is to prove global warming, it \nwould have to be true that the number and severity of these droughts \nare, in fact, increasing. But nothing could be farther from the truth.\n  Drought is a serious and damaging climate-related hazard. But this \nfact should not obscure the fact that carbon dioxide is not the cause \nof this recurring disaster that plagued even the Ancient Egyptians. The \ntwo worst droughts to hit this country in the last century occurred in \nthe 1930s--known as the Great Dustbowl--and the 1950s. But they were \nneither the longest droughts to afflict this country, nor the most \nsevere.\n  According to an article published in the December 1998 Bulletin of \nthe American Meteorological Society, Dr. Connie Woodhouse and Dr. \nJonathan Overpeck conducted tree-ring reconstructions in the Southwest \nthat suggest the lengths and severity of droughts of the 1930s and 50s \nhave been equaled or, in some regions, surpassed by droughts in the \npast several centuries.\n  They further concluded that it is clear that major multi-year Great \nPlains droughts have occurred naturally once or twice a century over \nthe last 400 years. And there is evidence that during the 13th and 16th \ncenturies, there were two megadroughts that exceeded the severity, \nlength and spatial extent of 20th century droughts.\n  Of course, this study was published before the onset of the most \nrecent 5-year drought in the Southwest. More recent studies published \njust last year, however, confirm its findings. In a 2003 article in \nGeophysical Research Letters, Dr. Stephen Gray and his colleagues \nstated that:\n\n     like the 1950s drought, the late 16th century megadrought was \n     followed by a wet period, and both events were associated \n     with intense La Nina episodes typical of southwestern U.S. \n     and Great Plains droughts.\n\n  In an article in the July 2003 issue of the American Meteorological \nSociety, Dr. Falko Fye and his colleagues found that:\n\n       There appear to have been at least 12 droughts since 1500AD \n     that were analogous to the 1950s drought in terms of \n     location, intensity, and duration. . . . [and] the 16th \ncentury megadrought lasted some 18 years and the tree-ring data \nindicate it was the most severe sustained drought to impact North \nAmerica in the past 500 to perhaps 1000 years.\n\n  What is also worth noting is that the global temperature record \ndoesn't provide any useful information concerning drought conditions.\n  In the wake of this year's successive hurricanes hitting Southeast \nand Gulf States, some have even had the gall to claim it is due to \nglobal warming. Credible meteorologists have been quick to dismiss such \nclaims. As Hugh Willoughby, senior scientist at the International \nHurricane Research Center of Florida International University stated in \nthe plain language we non-scientists can understand:\n\n       This isn't a global-warming sort of thing. . . . It's a \n     natural cycle.\n\n  Benjamin Preston, senior research fellow at the Pew Center on Global \nClimate Change--a green activist organization that promotes the global \nwarming theory echoed his sentiments, saying about the link between \nhurricanes and global warming:\n\n\n[[Page S11295]]\n\n\n       The general consensus is that it's unlikely. . . . We can \n     actually explain an active hurricane season using natural \n     variability.\n\n  If even the Pew Center has said that, it seems pretty obvious that \nthe activists and writers who have been quick to implicate global \nwarming should be dismissed as the opportunists they are. Weather \nsimply changes. In the words of Professor Perry Samson, associate chair \nof the Department of the Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences at \nthe University of Michigan:\n\n       Abnormal weather is normal.\n\n  When it comes to the argument that hurricanes are getting worse, it \nis typical to hear statistics about increasing costs due to hurricane \ndamage. Of course, we can expect monetary damage from hurricanes to \nincrease in the future, ``not as a result of anthropogenic climate \nchange, but from natural climate cycles, and . . . increasingly \nexpensive properties along the coast.''\n  These are not my words, but of a top U.S. Government scientist named \nDr. Christopher Landsea.\n  Science simply doesn't support the claims that there is a link \nbetween hurricanes and global warming. A team led by the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Dr. Landsea concluded that the \nrelationship of global temperatures to the number of intense \nlandfalling hurricanes is either not present, or is very weak. In fact, \nif we examine hurricane records for which we have good data going back \nto the 1800s, there is much evidence supporting the conclusion that we \nhave had more hurricane activity historically than in the last few \ndecades, so an increase the last several years should perhaps be \nexpected as part of natural variability. The overall number of \nhurricanes and the number of the strongest hurricanes fluctuated \ngreatly during the last century, with a great number in the 1940s. In \nfact, through the last decade, the intensity of these storms has \ndeclined somewhat.\n  Hopefully, we can finally put to rest the unsubstantiated claim that \nglobal warming is leading to more severe and unpredictable weather. \nWhat is certain is that the drought record in the Southwest over the \nlast 1,000 years and the hurricane record flatly refutes that claim.\n  Global warming advocates will often recite statistics that glaciers \nare in retreat. For instance, it is said that the number of glaciers in \nGlacier National Park has dwindled from 150 more than a century ago to \nabout 35 today and that the part of the Arctic Ocean that remains \nfrozen year-round has been shrinking.\n\n  But what do these examples really say about global warming? \nScientists know very little about glacial activity, but what they do \nknow suggests there are as many expanding glaciers as there are \nshrinking ones--this even happens with two glaciers within a few miles \nof each other--and that there is no universal trend either way. There \nare more than 160,000 glaciers on the planet. Scientists have good, \nlong-term mass balance measurements on a comparative handful of them. \nSo how can someone assert that glaciers are shrinking?\n  Dr. Roger Braithwaite last year looked at mass balance trends in 246 \nglaciers worldwide from 1946 to 1995. He found that ``there are several \nregions with highly negative mass balances in agreement with a public \nperception of ``the glaciers are melting,' but there are also regions \nwith positive balances.'' This holds true even within continents. In \nEurope, ``Alpine glaciers are generally shrinking, Scandinavian \nglaciers are growing, and glaciers in the Caucasus are close to \nequilibrium for 1980-95.'' Globally, adding all the results together, \n``there is no obvious common or global trend of increasing glacier melt \nin recent years.''\n  Indeed, the observed variability of Arctic sea ice thickness, which \nshows that the sea ice mass can change by up to 16 percent within one \nyear, contrasts with the concept of a slowly dwindling ice pack, \nproduced by global warming.\n  But if global warming is not the cause, what is? In 2002, work done \nby Dr. Greg Holloway and Dr. Tessa Sou, showed that the decadal-scale \nwind pattern changes were responsible for rearranging the ice, giving \nsome regions thinner and others thicker amount of ice. Research by Dr. \nIgnatius Rigor in 2002 confirmed this, finding much of the so-called \nArctic ice thinning is caused by decadal variations in wind patterns \nover the Arctic.\n  Alarmists also speak eloquently about Kilimanjaro, and like to show \ntwo pictures--one from the early 1990s with a modest snow cap on it, \nand another from 2000 showing the snow caps had shrunk.\n  Of course, those are just two pictures. Let me tell you about three. \nYes, Kilimanjaro's snows were smaller in the late 90s than the 80s, but \nthey were bigger in the 80s than in the 70s. In fact, the snows of \nKilimanjaro in 1997 appear to resemble the snows of Kilimanjaro in \n1976.\n  This makes a simple point. If you are given only partial facts, you \ncan easily be misled into thinking you see something when in fact you \nare seeing a very different thing indeed. The pictures you have been \nshown are simply transient snows and are meaningless. To quote an April \nwhite paper from the Center for Science and Public Policy entitled The \nConsensus on Kilimanjaro is Wrong, ``though a photograph may be worth a \nthousand sound bytes, those words and photos do not go together.''\n  Of course, the real question is what does the issue of melting \nglaciers on Kilimanjaro have to do with man-induced global warming? Not \nmuch. On November 26, the New York Times had some interesting insights \ninto Kilimanjaro and global warming. Here's what the Times had to say:\n\n       The glaciers on Kilimanjaro have been in retreat for at \n     least a century, shrinking by 80 percent between 1912 and \n     2000. Although it is tempting to blame global warming, the \n     most likely culprit is deforestation.\n\n  As explained in Nature's Science update, with forest present, the \nnatural updraft from the slopes carried moist air to the summit and \nhelped reinforce and sustain the ice cap. Without those forests, the \nupdrafts are dry and fail to replenish the ravages of the sun on the \nsummit ice cap. And since the equatorial sun is extremely hot, \ndeforestation also means the updrafts are warmer than they were when \nKilamanjaro's forests were abundant.\n  Conjuring up fears of global warming because of Kilimanjaro's \nglaciers--to my mind--represents exactly the kind of misuse of science \nthat leads to increased misunderstanding instead of understanding. If \nthe problem is deforestation and there is public will to fix the \nproblem, fix it. Don't try to mislead people into thinking the problem \nis something else simply because that fits your agenda.\n  This is a point I have made repeatedly. I believe it is extremely \nimportant for the future of this country that the facts and the science \nget a fair hearing. Without proper knowledge and understanding, \nalarmists will scare the country into enacting its ultimate goal: \nmaking energy suppression, in the form of harmful mandatory \nrestrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse emissions, the \nofficial policy of the United States.\n  While the science underlying hysterical claims of catastrophic global \nwarming is thin, the analyses showing the costs of capping our economy \nare not. Perhaps the most well known study examining the Kyoto Protocol \ncame from Wharton Econometric Forecasing Associates, or WEFA. According \nto WEFA economists, Kyoto would cost 2.4 million American jobs and \nreduce GDP by 3.2 percent, or about $300 billion annually, an amount \ngreater than the total annual expenditure on primary and secondary \neducation.\n  It is hard to imagine such huge amounts, so I will put the findings \nin context. Because of Kyoto, American consumers would pay 11 percent \nmore for food, 14 percent more for medicine, and 7 percent more for \nhousing. Electricity prices would nearly double and gasoline prices \nwould go up an additional 65 cents per gallon.\n  New studies that have come out since my last speech on global warming \nexamining the consequences of unilaterally putting a cap on the economy \nthrough carbon restrictions are also revealing. Using perhaps the most \nsophisticated model to assess the issue--what is known as a dynamic \nmodel that incorporates future changes in behavior--the renowned \neconomic forecasting firm of Charles River Associates has concluded \nthat under the McCain-Lieberman bill, S. 139, economic growth would \nslow.\n  The Nation would lose up to a quarter million jobs by 2010, \nincreasing to\n\n[[Page S11296]]\n\nup to 610,000 jobs by 2020. Energy-intensive industries would be the \nhardest sector hit. Natural gas prices would increase by up to 82 \npercent, driving thousands of companies overseas, as we have already \nseen happen to fertilizer manufacturers, who cannot afford to make \ntheir product at even today's natural gas prices. Production from these \nenergy-intensive industries alone would decline annually by up to $160 \nbillion.\n  The bill would hit specific state economies harder. For instance, \nOhio and West Virginia, both with economies that rely on coal \nproduction, would see their industries decimated, with production \ndecreasing by as much as 73 percent.\n  Average households in the United States would incur a financial cost \nup to $1,300 in the year 2010, with the annual cost rising up to $2,300 \nby 2020. Families' direct costs in the form of higher electricity and \ngasoline prices would increase dramatically. Within 6 years, \nresidential electricity prices would rise by up to 30 percent, \ndramatically increasing families' monthly electricity bills. By 2020, \nthose prices would rise by up to 43 percent due to carbon restrictions.\n  Regardless of which study one looks at, gasoline price increases will \nbe substantial. According to the Energy Information Administration, gas \nprices will increase by 27 percent, or 40 cents. The more sophisticated \nCharles River Associates assessment puts the cost even higher, with \ngasoline prices increasing by up to 50 cents.\n  Of course, for many wealthier people, these may seem like trivial \ncosts. Rich people don't think about their electric bills or the cost \nof gasoline at the pump. But average Americans do. And the elderly \nliving on fixed income, and the poor, pay attention to these costs even \nmore. What is worse, these costs are regressive, which means that poor \npeople will bear a bigger burden because they spend a larger share of \ntheir income on energy, such as gasoline and electricity. When the \ncosts go up, they must give up something else important to them.\n  And what do we buy for costs?\n  As even James Hansen, the NASA scientist who popularized the global \nwarming theory, admits, it would take massive reductions in carbon \nemissions to have any appreciable impact on climate change. And, of \ncourse, his views are based on the assumption it even exists. \nCalculating what affect implementing the Kyoto Protocol would have, \nMartin Parry and other researchers concluded in Nature that Kyoto would \nonly reduce global surface temperatures by 0.06 Celsius by 2050. Coming \nto a nearly identical conclusion, U.S. Global Change Research Program \nresearcher Tom Wigley estimated in Geophysical Research Letters that \nimplementing the Kyoto Protocol would reduce global surface \ntemperatures by 0.07 Celsius by 2050. The temperature differences \nwithin this room exceed such a minuscule amount.\n  Despite these studies which increasingly suggest that precipitous \naction to combat global warming is unjustified, alarmists often trot \nout a concept known as the precautionary principle--which is that it is \nbetter to be safe than sorry. But they misunderstand or at least, \nmisapply this concept. From all I have learned about the subject of \nglobal warming, I believe that the safest course is to reject the \nhypothetical claims of those who fear planetary doom is around the \ncorner and are willing to doom the economy to avert it. The science of \nglobal warming is uncertain, the costs of capping our economy with \ncarbon restriction are high, and even if the doomsayers were correct, \nit would do little to nothing to reduce the temperature increases.\n  But there is more to the story. Taking precipitous action will \nactually do more harm than good.\n  A 2003 study by Indur Goklany of the Department of Interior examined \nthis question in some depth. In the study, which did not challenge the \nvalidity of global warming's existence and its consequences in its \nassumptions, Goklany examined the benefits and opportunity costs of \ntaking action to mitigate global warming. In essence, the study \nexamined whether humanity would be better off if we tried to avert or \notherwise mitigate global warming or whether humanity would better off \nadapting to it.\n  What the study concluded was remarkable. Even if global warming were \nreal, money spent to combat global warming would do comparatively \nlittle--as a percentage of the problem to reduce the afflictions of \nhunger, malaria, and water shortages versus if no action were taken at \nall. Yet it went farther--it then examined the benefits of diverting \nthe money spent on global warming and using the monies to directly \nfight these afflictions through such activities as agricultural \nresearch and development and investments in treatment and prevention in \ncombating malaria. The final results? Fewer people would go hungry, \nfewer would suffer from malaria, and fewer would lack access to \nadequate supplies of water if we simply adapted rather than attempted \nto combat global warming. And at far less cost, meaning those resources \ncan be invested productively.\n  So rationing our energy supply would make the world not safe, but \nsorry. And that is assuming global warming is happening. How much \nsorrier will we be if it isn't?\n  British Prime Minister Tony Blair's goal of serious investment in \npublic health and infrastructure for energy and water, and delivering \nreal progress on African development is in conflict with his aims on \nglobal warming. His Science Advisor, Sir David King, has stated that \nchoices won't have to be made as to how to spend resources. But that \nflies in the face of basic economics. If resources are spent in one \nway, they are not available to be spent another. In short, even a \nwealthy future world will have constraints on the resources it can \ndevote to disease and other problems. How much more will those \nconstraints be in a poorer world.\n  The point is clear. Back in the earlier part of the last century, \nwhen Asia was far poorer than it is today, deaths from climate events \nwere far higher than now, when the region is wealthier. And let's look \nat the hurricanes from this hurricane season. Unfortunately, 100 \nAmericans died during four naturally occurring hurricanes to hit land. \nBut compare the fate of this wealthy country to that of Haiti, where in \nthat small, terribly poor country 2,000 people died and 300,000 become \nhomeless from a single hurricane--Hurricane Jeanne.\n  It is not simply common sense, its backed up by data. Capping carbon \nwill cap the economy. There is an incredibly strong relationship \nbetween a country's GDP growth rate and its carbon dioxide growth rate. \nBecause carbon is synonymous with economic activity. While we can and \nshould increase our energy efficiency because its good business, we \nmust realize that we are tied to carbon.\n  Fossil fuel is the energy base of this country. And while some may \nclaim we can simply and easily move to a non-carbon based society, they \nare not being honest. We have an enormous infrastructure reliant on \nfossil energy that will be with us for many, many decades to come. And \nfor those few alternatives that could replace older units such as \nbuilding wind-farms off Nantucket or building new dams or new nuclear \nplants, green activists bring efforts to a grinding halt. As the chart \nshows, technology will not quickly restructure our energy \ninfrastructure.\n  Unfortunately, despite the many studies, facts and figures I have \nshared with you today demonstrating that the science does not support \ncatastrophic global warming claims, well-designed, reproducible studies \nare not the driving force behind today's climate science debate. \nRather, ideology is.\n  This point was made by Dr. Richard Lindzen in regards to his \ncontributions to the preparation of the United Nations IPCC report. \nLindzen stated:\n\n       I personally witnessed coauthors forced to assert their \n     `green' credentials in defense of their statements.\n\n  But Lindzen's words are tame compared to those spoken earlier this \nyear in Russia. At a press conference on global warming and the Kyoto \nProtocol, Russian Presidential Economic Advisor Andrei Illarionov made \nsome comments about ideology that are nothing short of remarkable. Let \nme share with you what he says is driving the global warming debate. \nIllarionov stated:\n\n       There have been examples in our fairly recent history of \n     how a considerable portion of Europe was flooded with the \n     brown Nazi ideology, the red Commie ideology that caused \n     severe casualties and consequences for Europe and the entire \n     world. Now there is a big\n\n[[Page S11297]]\n\n     likelihood that a considerable part of Europe has been \n     flooded with another type, another color of ideology--[and he \n     is speaking of global warming here--again, another type, \n     another color of ideology]--but with very similar \n     implications for European societies and human societies the \n     world over.\n\n  He also said that imposition of the Kyoto Protocol ``would deal a \npowerful blow on the whole humanity similar to the one humanity \nexperienced when Nazism and communism flourished.''\n  And that was the chief economic advisor to Russian President Putin. \nThe world has certainly turned on its head that we Americans must look \nto Russians for speaking out strongly against irrational authoritarian \nideologies. Putin's economic advisor's words are underscored by the \nconclusion of the Russian Academy of Science which this last May \nconcluded that there is a high degree of uncertainty that global \nwarming is caused by anthropogenic factors, that the Kyoto Protocol \ndoes not have a scientific basis and it would not be effective in \nachieving the IPCC's aims.\n  And while the Russia legislature may well indeed ratify the Kyoto \nProtocol, Illarionov has stated that it would occur for political \nconsiderations, not scientific or economic. Last May, it was reported \nthat the European Union had promised to help Russia enter the World \nTrade Organization and would smooth over WTO requirements in exchange \nfor signing the Kyoto Protocol. Additionally, there is speculation \nwithin Russia that the Kyoto Protocol will fail of its own weight since \nonly two European countries will meet their carbon emission targets. \nSo, clearly, Russia is playing politics with the issue for its purposes \njust as others have for their own.\n  That much of this debate is about world governance and not science is \nnot news. At the Hague in November 2002, French President Jacques \nChirac stated that Kyoto represents ``the first component of an \nauthentic global governance.''\n  Those are his words, not my characterization of his words.\n  To summarize my remarks today, it makes no sense to take action on \nclimate change when the costs are so profound and the benefits are non-\nexistent.\n  Last year, I spent two hours addressing the Senate about the state of \nscience regarding the global warming debate. And today, I have spent \nanother two hours providing the latest, most up-to-date information on \nthe science about global warming--or more to the point--the lack of \ncredible science supporting it.\n  I have been told many times that the science is irrelevant--that we \nhave moved beyond the science, and that we must now concentrate on what \nto do to stop global warming from happening. I, for one, would hope \nthat we never abandon the science. Those who are afraid of the newest \nand best science are usually the same people who are afraid that the \nmore the public actually knows, the more it will interfere with their \ngrand geopolitical plans to ration America's energy.\n  I believe we should be held accountable for the actions we take, and \nnot bet the American economy on something unless it is firmly rooted in \nscience, and our actions can have some beneficial effect. Global \nwarming ideology has no place in policy debates regarding scientific \nissues. Credible, reproducible studies should be our gold standard--our \nminimum standard. By that standard, carbon restrictions fail the test.\n  Unfortunately, we are in a political season and some legislators \nbelieve that they can score political points with this issue. Last \nyear, when Senator John Kerry was focusing on the liberal base in his \nprimary, he criticized President George Bush on his campaign website \nfor rejecting the global warming treaty, stating:\n\n       Dropping out of international implementation of the Kyoto \n     Protocol was foolhardy then, and it is even more obviously \n     foolhardy today.\n\n  But now that John Kerry is trying to be more mainstream he has \nremoved that statement from his website and replaced it with the \nfollowing:\n\n       John Kerry and John Edwards believe that the Kyoto Protocol \n     is not the answer. The near-term emission reductions it would \n     require of the United States are infeasible, while the long-\n     term obligations imposed on all nations are too little to \n     solve the problem.\n\n  Yet in the September 30 presidential debate, he criticized President \nBush when he said:\n\n       You don't help yourself with other nations when you turn \n     away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when \n     you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations.\n\n  I am trying to figure out what he means by those statements.\n  And unless he is simply doing another of his all-too-familiar flip-\nflops, I can only conclude that while he does not believe the Kyoto \nProtocol is the answer, he would support it anyway. If I lived in the \nMidwest, I would find his shifting stances worrisome.\n  I have laid out my case today for why capping our economy with carbon \nrestrictions is wrong-headed and rash. And I believe that the future \nhealth of our great Nation and the world is too important to have an \nissue as vital as this one relegated to the status of a political \nfootball. My hope is that the legislators who have moved beyond the \nscience will, once again, develop a healthy respect for what it has to \nsay in guiding our actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11297-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11297-S11298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ARIZONA WATER SETTLEMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the water users and providers of Arizona have \nwaited a long time for this day. The Arizona Water Settlements Act, S. \n437, is the product of 15 years of negotiation, litigation, and more \nnegotiation. Virtually every major water user and provider in central \nArizona has devoted itself to the passage of this bill. In fact, S. 437 \nwould codify the largest water claims settlement in the history of \nArizona. The three titles in this bill represent the tremendous efforts \nof literally hundreds of people in Arizona and here in Washington over \na period of 15 years. Looking ahead, this bill could ultimately be \nnearly as important to Arizona's future as was the authorization of the \nCentral Arizona Project, CAP, itself.\n  Since Arizona began receiving CAP water from the Colorado River, \nlitigation has divided water users over how the CAP water should be \nallocated and exactly how much Arizona was required to repay the \nFederal Government. This bill will, among other things, codify the \nsettlement reached between the United States and the Central Arizona \nWater Conservation District over the State's repayment obligation for \ncosts incurred by the United States in constructing the Central Arizona \nProject. It will also resolve, once and for all, the allocation of all \nremaining CAP water. This final allocation will provide the stability \nnecessary for State water authorities to plan for Arizona's future \nwater needs. In addition, approximately 200,000 acre-feet of CAP water \nwill be made available to settle various Indian water claims in the \nState. The bill would also authorize the use of the Lower Colorado \nRiver Basin Development Fund, which is funded solely from revenues paid \nby Arizona entities, to construct irrigation works necessary for tribes \nwith congressionally approved water settlements to use CAP water.\n  Title II of this bill settles the water rights claims of the Gila \nRiver Indian Community. It allocates nearly 100,000 acre-feet of CAP \nwater to the community, and provides funds to subsidize the costs of \ndelivering CAP water and to construct the facilities necessary to allow \nthe community to fully utilize the water allocated to it in this \nsettlement. Title III provides for long-needed amendments to the 1982 \nSouthern Arizona Water Settlement Act for the Tohono O'odham Nation, \nwhich has never been fully implemented. Title IV creates a placeholder \nfor a future settlement on the Gila River for the San Carlos Apache \nTribe and reiterates the fact that titles I, II, and III do not affect \nthe water rights claims of the San Carlos Apache Tribe or the claims of \nthe United States on their behalf.\n  For the San Carlos Apache Tribe and other Indian communities in \nArizona that have not yet settled their water rights claims, this bill \noffers hope for the future. This bill creates a fund for future Indian \nwater settlements in Arizona. In addition, through this legislation, \n67,300 acre-feet of CAP water will be set aside for future Indian water \nrights settlements. The water needs of each Indian tribe in Arizona are \nparticular to that individual tribe. Likewise, the contours of each \nIndian water rights settlement must be tailored to\n\n[[Page S11298]]\n\nthe needs of the tribe and the local communities that surround it. \nThrough this bill we give those tribes, the Secretary of the Interior, \nand future Congresses a framework of water and funding that can be \ncustomized to meet the needs of each settlement.\n  For now, this bill will allow Arizona cities to plan for the future, \nknowing how much water they can count on. The Indian tribes will \nfinally get ``wet'' water--as opposed to the paper claims to water they \nhave now--and projects to use the water. In addition, mining companies, \nfarmers, and irrigation delivery districts can continue to receive \nwater without the fear that they will be stopped by Indian litigation.\n  All final issues between the parties or the United States have been \nresolved. In particular, the states of Arizona and New Mexico have \nnegotiated the best way to address New Mexico's right under the 1968 \nBoulder Canyon Project Act, authorizing the CAP, to exchange CAP water \non the Gila River.\n  In summary, this bill is vital to the citizens of Arizona and will \nprovide the certainty needed to move forward with water use decisions. \nFurthermore, the United States can avoid litigating water rights and \ndamage claims and satisfy its trust responsibilities to the Tribes. The \nparties have worked many years to reach consensus rather than litigate, \nand I believe this bill represents the best opportunity to achieve a \nfair result for all the people of Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11298-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11298-S11299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          U.S. POLICY IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this evening on the campus of Michigan \nState University in Lansing I will be speaking on U.S. policy in Iraq.\n  My conclusion is that just as it took a new administration to extract \nthe United States from Vietnam, it will take a new administration to \nextract us from Iraq in a way which leaves that country stable and \ndemocratic. We cannot leave Iraq as we did Vietnam.\n  Nor can we just continue a western occupation of a Muslim nation that \nis the target and magnet for violence and terror, and that has become \nmore destabilizing than stabilizing. We must change course in Iraq--or \nelse Iraq's future is not likely to be stability and democracy, and the \nlegacy to the world of the Iraq war is likely to be greater turmoil and \nterror.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I will be making this \nevening be included in full at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          ``Iraq: What Next?''\n\n       Good evening. I am delighted to be here with you to discuss \n     where we are and where I think we need to go in Iraq.\n       This is going to be a pretty sober discussion, because I \n     agree with what Republican Senator Chuck Hagel said recently: \n     ``We're in deep trouble in Iraq.'' Although President Bush \n     continues to say that things are going well in Iraq, even \n     Secretary of State Colin Powell acknowledged recently that \n     the situation is ``getting worse.''\n       And it is. American soldiers and Marines face an ever \n     strengthening insurgency that puts our troops, the Iraqi \n     people and a stable Iraq at increasing risk. Our troops \n     continue to die and suffer wounds at increasing rates. \n     American and other contractors are being taken hostage and \n     brutally murdered.\n       The lack of security is having a profound effect on \n     reconstruction and on the effort to establish a stable Iraqi \n     government. We are paying the price for a failed strategy \n     that included rosy pre-war assumptions and a rush to war \n     without first allowing United Nations weapons inspectors to \n     complete their work and without first building a credible and \n     effective international coalition, including Muslim \n     countries, as President Bush's father did in the first Gulf \n     War. This was compounded by the failure to plan for the post-\n     war period and the major mistake of abolishing the Iraqi army \n     rather than using it to help provide security after the \n     cessation of major combat operations.\n       President Bush said recently that ``It's hard to help a \n     country go from tyranny to elections to peace when there are \n     a handful of people who are willing to kill in order to stop \n     the process...'' Only a handful of people willing to kill? \n     That's not facing reality--that's ignoring reality.\n       Late last month, the Washington Post, quoting figures \n     released by Iraq's Health Ministry and the Pentagon, reported \n     that attacks over the previous two weeks had killed more than \n     250 Iraqis and 29 U.S. military personnel. Further, a \n     sampling of daily reports produced for the U.S. Agency for \n     International Development shows that such attacks now \n     typically number about 70 each day, in contrast to the 40 \n     to 50 a day during the weeks prior to the transfer of \n     sovereignty from the Coalition Provisional Authority to \n     the Iraqi Interim Government. Those reports also indicate \n     that the attacks are wide-spread, with a majority \n     occurring outside the three provinces that have been the \n     principal locations for insurgent violence.\n       The security situation has deteriorated to the point that \n     there are cities and towns in Iraq where the U.S. and \n     Coalition forces do not go. In the absence of a presence on \n     the ground in places like Fallujah, which has been taken over \n     by insurgents, the U.S. military has resorted to air power to \n     strike safe houses and other places where intelligence \n     indicates the insurgents are located. These attacks have \n     caused death and injuries to innocent Iraqi civilians, and an \n     even greater lack of support for the U.S. presence in Iraq \n     and for the Interim Iraqi Government which supports and \n     relies upon our presence. Assassinations, kidnapings, and \n     beheadings are becoming more frequent. The result is that \n     Iraqis who would like to cooperate with us are deterred from \n     doing so, and we are denied the intelligence that we need to \n     fight the insurgency.\n       The President may say things are going well in Iraq, but \n     the U.S. Intelligence Community has a different view. The \n     July 2004 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq reportedly \n     sets out three possible scenarios for Iraq. The worst case \n     was developments that could lead to civil war, and the best \n     case was that the security environment would remain tenuous. \n     This pessimistic National Intelligence Estimate bears out the \n     analysis of former president George Bush in his 1998 book A \n     World Transformed concerning the question of whether to march \n     to Baghdad during the 1991 Gulf War. He wrote that ``To \n     occupy Iraq would instantly shatter our coalition, turning \n     the whole Arab world against us. . . It would have taken us \n     way beyond the imprimatur of international law bestowed by \n     the resolution of the Security Council. . .'' He wrote \n     further that doing so would also commit our soldiers to an \n     ``urban guerilla war'' and ``plunge that part of the world \n     into even greater instability and destroy the credibility we \n     were working so hard to reestablish.''\n       Sound familiar?\n       The President recently dismissed that pessimistic July 2004 \n     analysis of the Intelligence Community, saying ``they were \n     just guessing as to what the conditions might be like.'' \n     Conservative columnist Robert Novak wrote that ``for \n     President Bush to publicly write off a CIA paper as just \n     guessing is without precedent.'' Publicly stating so might be \n     unprecedented, but it appears that this is not the first time \n     the President has actually dismissed CIA warnings. According \n     to the New York Times recently, ``two classified reports \n     prepared for President Bush in January 2003 by the National \n     Intelligence Council, an independent group that advises the \n     director of central intelligence . . . predicted that an \n     American-led invasion of Iraq . . . would result in a deeply \n     divided Iraqi society prone to violent internal conflict.''\n       The Administration disregarded that warning, insisting that \n     an American invasion would be welcomed by the Iraqis with \n     open arms. The violent bottom line is that when we attacked \n     Iraq, we blew the lid off the boiling Iraqi pot without a \n     plan to keep the contents from boiling over.\n       General Franks, the former Commander in Chief of U.S. \n     Central Command, told Senator John Warner and me that he had \n     been told to focus on the combat phase of the war plan and to \n     leave the planning for the stability phase, the aftermath, to \n     the Pentagon's civilian leadership. Then that leadership \n     failed to ensure an adequate number of troops were committed \n     to provide for security, prevent looting, and nip the \n     resulting insurgency in the bud. Back in April of 2003 at the \n     height of the looting in Iraq, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld \n     dismissed newspaper reports of chaos, violence and unrest in \n     Iraq by saying ``it was just Henny Penny--the sky is \n     falling.'' Eighteen months later, it is still falling.\n       These failures to adequately plan for the post-combat \n     stability phase and to ensure that adequate numbers of troops \n     were on-hand were compounded by the Administration's \n     disastrous decision to disband the Iraqi Army, thereby \n     forcing the U.S. military to begin from scratch to build a \n     new Iraqi security force, and throwing thousands of trained \n     Iraqi military men into the ranks of the unemployed and many \n     into the arms of the insurgency's recruiters.\n       It is difficult to discern a strategy that is being \n     followed for Iraq today. Marine Lieutenant General Jim \n     Conway, then Marine Corps commander in Iraq, publically \n     criticized the conflicting orders he received with respect to \n     Fallujah--first the initial order to go in and remove the \n     insurgents, which went against the Marine Corps' strategy \n     of engagement with the civilian population; and then the \n     subsequent order to withdraw, after the Marines had only \n     partly secured the city and after the loss of Marines. \n     Once the orders were reversed, the Marines were withdrawn \n     and control of the city was turned over to a local \n     security force which quickly lost control to the \n     insurgents.\n       The chaos in Iraq puts the Iraqi elections scheduled for \n     next January at great risk. The UN Special Representative for \n     Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, reported to the Security Council on \n     September 14 that the ``vicious cycle of violence'' and the \n     lack of security was undermining the world body's efforts to \n     assist in elections set for January. UN Secretary\n\n[[Page S11299]]\n\n     General Kofi Annan told me last week that the United Nations \n     had supervised many elections in the past, but never one in a \n     war zone like Iraq. He is concerned that the lack of security \n     and the tight time-table will be major impediments to a \n     successful election.\n       This is compounded by the fact that the Administration has \n     so far been unable to convince any country to provide troops \n     needed to protect the UN presence in Iraq. According to \n     Secretary General Annan, they will be unlikely to do so and \n     the UN will have to depend on the United States and British \n     forces now in Iraq to provide that security. That will mean \n     about 5,000 troops being diverted from fighting the \n     insurgency to protecting the UN presence. Secretary General \n     Annan told me that an American general committed to do that.\n       This failure to convince any other nations to contribute to \n     a UN security force is a direct consequence of the \n     Administration's alienation of large portions of the world \n     community by its go-it-alone approach to the war in the first \n     place.\n       The unfortunate result is that a scant four months before \n     nation-wide elections in Iraq, there are only 35 UN staff \n     members in Iraq--far short of the 200 required to support the \n     U.N. staff so essential to a credible election. Just as \n     troubling, virtually none of the 120,000 Iraqis needed to run \n     the 20,000 to 30,000 polling places have been identified and \n     trained for the task.\n       In the upcoming election, seats in the 275-member National \n     Assembly will be allocated based upon a percentage of overall \n     votes received throughout Iraq. The Secretary General told us \n     that it is not possible to have a credible election in Iraq \n     if parts of the country are not able to participate because \n     of an on-going insurgency. Apparently Secretary of Defense \n     Rumsfeld does not share that concern. In recent testimony \n     before the Senate Armed Services Committee he said, ``Let's \n     say you tried to have an election and you could have it in \n     three-quarters or four-fifths of the country. But in some \n     places you couldn't because the violence was too great . . . \n     Well, so be it. Nothing's perfect in life, so you have an \n     election that's not quite perfect. Is it better than not \n     having an election? You bet.''\n       Well, maybe it is not better than not having an election--\n     in fact, it very well might be worse. How would people in \n     Lansing, Detroit and Traverse City feel about the legitimacy \n     of a state-wide election for Governor that they couldn't vote \n     in? A single district election in which large numbers of \n     Iraqis are unable to participate is not likely to move Iraq \n     forward toward a stable political system but toward civil war \n     because it would further alienate a significant portion of \n     the population from the Iraqi government.\n       The first step in dealing with the problems in Iraq is to \n     face reality. If we insist things are going fine, or if we \n     pretend, as the President incredibly enough put it, that we \n     are dealing with just a ``handful of people who are willing \n     to kill,'' we will be less willing to search for ways to \n     change the negative dynamic and downward spiral which have \n     been unleashed in Iraq. And we will be less willing to search \n     for ways to motivate Iraqi factions' leaders and Islamic \n     countries to become more involved in and be willing to take \n     the risks necessary to build a democratic nation in Iraq. \n     Surely, unless Iraqis want a democratic nation for themselves \n     as much as we want it for them--unless they suppress the \n     violent ones inside their own communities and the terrorists \n     who want to prevent the election in January from happening--\n     our presence will continue to be more destabilizing than \n     stabilizing.\n       In a recent interview, President Musharraf of Pakistan was \n     asked whether the world is a safer place because of the war \n     in Iraq. He replied, ``No. It's more dangerous. It's not \n     safer, certainly not.'' President Musharraf continued, ``I \n     would say that [the war] has ended up bringing more trouble \n     to the world.'' President Musharraf concluded that the war in \n     Iraq has ``complicated'' the war on terror and ``has made the \n     job more difficult.'' The leader of a pivotal Muslim nation \n     and one of America's key allies in the fight against al Qaeda \n     has concluded that the Iraq war has made the world more \n     dangerous and complicated the overall war on terror.\n       On September 12, 2001, the day after the 9/11 attack upon \n     us, headlines in European newspapers proclaimed ``We are all \n     Americans.'' The world community united behind America in \n     the effort to destroy al Qaeda and remove the Taliban \n     regime in Afghanistan that supported it. But the \n     President's unilateralist policies and cocky ``bring 'em \n     on'' rhetoric squandered that good will and undermined \n     that spirit of cooperation by terminating UN inspections \n     and invading Iraq without any Islamic nations' support--\n     thereby diverting the focus from the real terrorist threat \n     of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The \n     western invasion and occupation of an Islamic country has \n     swelled the ranks of terrorists.\n       We would be compounding that strategic blunder by leaving \n     Iraq as an unstable, failed state dominated by Islamist \n     extremists and a haven and breeding ground for even more \n     terrorists. To succeed we must be willing to change direction \n     to seek an alternative third path to the two stark choices \n     the President offers--of staying the course or cutting and \n     running.\n       The alternative is to change our course with an \n     Administration that sees the reality on the ground; that is \n     open to new approaches and isn't locked in to a course of \n     action that isn't working; and that hasn't dismantled bridges \n     to the international community, particularly Islamic \n     countries, whose support we need.\n       President Bush is incapable of rebuilding the bridges to \n     the international community which he dismantled. A poll by a \n     Canadian company found that only 20% of the people in the \n     countries surveyed overseas support President Bush's \n     policies.\n       Loss of public support in other countries isn't simply a \n     matter of losing a popularity contest--it is a direct threat \n     to our security. The leaders of those countries are far less \n     likely to take the political risks that are entailed in \n     joining us in Iraq with troops or police if their publics \n     strongly oppose their doing so and strongly disagree with the \n     policies of the American administration. Listen to what the \n     Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Admiral Lowell \n     Jacoby, told the Senate Armed Services Committee about how \n     America is viewed in the world:\n       ``Much of the world is increasingly apprehensive about U.S. \n     power and influence. Many are concerned about the expansion, \n     consolidation, and dominance of American values, ideals, \n     culture, and institutions . . . . We should consider that \n     these perceptions mixed with angst over perceived `U.S. \n     unilateralism' will give rise to significant anti-American \n     behavior.''\n       So what should we do in Iraq?\n       We need an Administration which can rebuild those bridges \n     to the international community, so we can ``de-Americanize'' \n     this conflict and move towards a stable and democratic Iraq. \n     To do that, we need additional international troops, \n     particularly from Muslim nations, which this Administration \n     has proven incapable of obtaining.\n       We also need to train and equip Iraqi troops more quickly \n     and more throughly than we are currently doing. It is \n     particularly critical to provide these Iraqi troops far more \n     quickly with the equipment that will instill in them a \n     confidence in their abilities to defeat insurgents.\n       Creating a secure environment is not only a military task, \n     but a political one as well. We must make it clear to all \n     segments of Iraqi society that the U.S. has no design on \n     Iraqi oil or other resources and has no intention of creating \n     a long-term base structure or military presence in Iraq.\n       The reconstruction effort must be brought back on track. \n     According to a recent report by the Center for Strategic and \n     International Studies, ``The lack of sufficient electricity \n     in major cities continues to undermine public confidence, \n     fueling worrisome discontent in cities like Fallujah and \n     Mosul, which were favored under Saddam and now receive \n     considerably less power than in prewar days. Sewage systems \n     are worse that they were under Saddam, causing spillover \n     health and environmental problems.''\n       Eleven months after Congress approved the money, only 6% of \n     the $18.4 billion for Iraq reconstruction has been spent. And \n     recently the Administration asked Congress for permission to \n     transfer nearly $3.5 billion from Iraqi water, sewer and \n     electricity projects to security and electoral efforts. \n     Unfortunately this needs to be done, but it is another \n     example of how the failure to properly plan for the post-\n     combat stability phase and the failure to ensure the \n     necessary troop levels to ensure security has hampered \n     reconstruction and the creation of a stable Iraq.\n       The Republican Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \n     Senator Dick Lugar, recently blamed the mismanagement of the \n     whole Iraq reconstruction effort on ``incompetence in the \n     administration''. The focus of the reconstruction effort must \n     be shifted from large projects awarded to U.S. and other \n     foreign companies to those that will employ the greatest \n     number of Iraqis, giving Iraqi society at large an economic \n     stake in the post-Saddam Iraq that will contribute to a \n     politically stable state.\n       None of this will be easy. But we are where we are in Iraq. \n     Just as it took a new administration to extract the United \n     States from Vietnam, it will take a new administration to \n     extract us from Iraq in a way which leaves that country \n     stable and democratic. We cannot leave Iraq as we did \n     Vietnam.\n       Nor can we just continue a western occupation of a Muslim \n     nation that is the target and magnet for violence and terror, \n     and that has become more destabilizing than stabilizing. We \n     must change course in Iraq--or else Iraq's future is not \n     likely to be stability and democracy, and the legacy to the \n     world of the Iraq war is likely to be greater turmoil and \n     terror.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11299-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11299-S11300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           JOHN F. KENNEDY CENTER REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the passage of HR \n5294--the ``John F. Kennedy Center Reauthorization Act of 2004.'' As \nChairman of the Senate Committee with jurisdiction over the John F. \nKennedy Center for the Performing Arts, I am pleased that, working \nclosely with the Kennedy Center, we were able to reach an agreement \nwith the House of Representatives. This legislation authorizes funding \nfor the maintenance, repair and security, as well as capital projects \nthrough Fiscal Year 2007. Additionally, the legislation revises the \nJohn F. Kennedy Center Plaza Authorization Act of 2002 to direct the \nSecretary of Transportation to establish a Center Plaza\n\n[[Page S11300]]\n\nProject Team consisting of the Secretary, the Administrator of General \nServices, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, or their designees, \nand other individuals the Project Team considers appropriate. The Board \nis required to consult with the Project Team on specified matters, \nincluding construction of buildings.\n  I wish to recognize Marty Hall and Andrew Wheeler of my Committee \nstaff for their work on this legislation. I also wish thank Michael \nKaiser, President of the Kennedy Center for his support for this bill. \nMr. Kaiser has done an outstanding job of making the Kennedy Center a \nworld class operation and center for the performing arts. Mr. Kaiser is \nresponsible not only for the artistic programming, he is also the \nperson charged with ensuring its financial health. By any measure, he \nhas been very successful in both ventures. I would also like to express \nmy appreciation to Kennedy Center staff, specifically Jared Barlage and \nAnn Stock, who have worked very closely with my staff in developing \nthis legislation.\n  From its very beginnings, the Kennedy Center has represented a unique \npublic/private partnership. Because the Center is the Nation's living \nmemorial to President Kennedy, it receives federal funding each year to \npay for maintenance and operation of the building, a federal facility. \nHowever, the Center's artistic programs and education and outreach \ninitiatives are paid for almost entirely through ticket sales and gifts \nfrom individuals, corporations, and private foundations. I am pleased \nthat we can send this legislation to President Bush and continue the \ngood work of this valued institution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11300-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11300-S11303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE IMMIGRATION PROVISIONS OF H.R. 10\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have serious concerns about the \ndirection our Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives \nhave taken on the legislation to implement the recommendations of the \n9/11 Commission. The House bill, H.R. 10, departs in significant and \nproblematic ways from the Commission's specifically-tailored \nrecommendations to protect our country against future terrorist \nattacks. The recommendations call for preventing terrorist travel, \nestablishing an effective screening system to protect our borders, \ntransportation systems, and other vital facilities, expediting full \nimplementation of a biometric entry-exit screening system, establishing \nglobal border security standards by working with trusted allies, and \nstandardizing identity documents and birth certificates.\n  Instead of adhering to these carefully considered measures, as the \nSenate has done, the House Republican leadership has included long-\nrejected, antiimmigrant proposals that have nothing to do with the \nCommission's recommendations. The House bill severely limits the rights \nof immigrants, asylum seekers, and victims of torture and fails to \nstrengthen the security of our nation.\n  Among the worst provisions in the House bill are those which create \ninsurmountable obstacles and burdens for asylum seekers, including many \nwomen and children, eliminate judicial review, including the \nconstitutional writ of habeas corpus, for certain immigration orders, \nand which allow the deportation of individuals to countries where they \nare likely to be tortured, in violation of our international treaty \nobligations.\n  Many share my concerns with the House bill. The list of critics, lead \nby families of the 9/11 victims, is rapidly growing. A recent letter to \nHouse members, signed by more than two dozen family members of persons \nwho died in the terrorist attacks, states that the immigration \nprovisions are outside the scope of the Commission's recommendations \nand urges House members not to enact them. To underscore their \nconcerns, the families state their ``strong collective position that \nlegislation to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations not be \nused in a politically divisive manner.''\n  Similarly, the chair of the 9/11 Commission, Thomas Kean, has said \nthat the House immigration provisions ``which are controversial and are \nnot part of our recommendations to make the American people safer \nperhaps ought to be part of another bill at another time.'' Likewise, \nthe vice-chair, Lee Hamilton, warned that the inclusion of these \n``controversial provisions at this late hour can harm our shared \npurpose of getting a good bill to the President before the 108th \nCongress adjourns.''\n  I am submitting for the record the letters of a broad spectrum of \nreligious, immigrant, human rights, and civil liberties groups voicing \ntheir strong opposition to the immigration provisions in the House \nbill. These groups include the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination \nCommittee, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Immigration \nLawyers Association, the American Jewish Committee, Amnesty \nInternational, the Arab-American Institute Center for Community Change, \nthe Fair Immigration Reform Movement, Freedom House, the Hebrew \nImmigrant Aid Society, Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, the \nLutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, the National Asian Pacific \nAmerican Legal Consortium, the National Council of La Raza, the \nNational Immigration Forum, the RFK Memorial Center for Human Rights, \nthe Service Employees International Union, the Tahirih Justice Center, \nthe U.S. Catholic Bishop's Committee on Migration, World Relief, and \nthe Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children.\n\n  In these difficult times for our country, we know that the threat of \nterrorism has not ended. We have to keep doing all we can to see that \nour borders are protected and our immigration laws are enforced, and \nthat law enforcement officials have the full support they need. But we \nmust do so in ways that respect fundamental rights. Congress should not \nenact laws that ride rough-shod over basic rights in the name of \nnational security. Immigrants are part of our heritage and history. We \njeopardize our own fundamental values when we adopt harsh security \ntactics that trample the rights and liberties of immigrants. We must \nlearn from the past, so that we do not continue to repeat these \nmistakes in the future.\n  This legislation is too important for it to be derailed by political \npandering to anti-immigrant extremists. We need to pass this reform \nlegislation, but we need to get it right. The American people expect, \nand deserve, better.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced letters in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             An Open Letter\n\n     To: House of Representatives.\n     From: Family Members of 9-11 Victims.\n     Re: H.R. 10.\n       Dear Representatives: We are family members of those who \n     died in the tragedy of 9-11. While we have diverse political \n     views on many issues, we write to you today in one voice to \n     express our strong collective position that legislation to \n     implement the 9-11 Commission recommendations not be used in \n     a politically divisive manner. The discussion around these \n     recommendations is extremely serious and important to 9-11 \n     families across the political spectrum. We have heard the \n     House Bill to implement the 9-11 Commission Recommendations \n     (H.R. 10) also includes provisions to expand the USA Patriot \n     Act and reform immigration law in ways not recommended by the \n     commission.\n       We strongly urge you to take these provisions out of the \n     bill, and not vote for any bill that contains them. These \n     provisions are outside the scope of the Commission's \n     recommendations, and this is neither the time nor place to \n     consider controversial, unrelated issues. Those issues can be \n     discussed at a later date and proposed in different \n     legislation. Last week, members of the 9-11 Commission \n     themselves (3 Republican and 3 Democrats) also called on \n     House leaders to drop these provisions. The Chairman of the \n     9-11 Commission, Thomas Kean, said on September 30th: ``We're \n     very respectfully suggesting that provisions which are \n     controversial and are not part of our recommendations to make \n     the American people safer perhaps ought to be part of another \n     bill at another time.''\n       Please respect the seriousness of the discussions around \n     the Commission Recommendations and immediately remove all \n     unrelated provisions.\n           Yours Sincerely,\n       Colleen Kelly (Sister of William Kelly Jr.).\n       Adele Welty (Mother of Timothy Welty, FDNY, killed 9-11 in \n     line of duty).\n       Laurette Poulos Simmons (Sister of Stephen Emanuel Poulos \n     who died in the WTC).\n       Karen Shea (Niece of Steven Tighe).\n       Barry Amundson (Brother of Craig Amundson, killed at the \n     Pentagon).\n       Kelly Campbell (Sister-in-law of Craig Amundson).\n       Wright and Meredith Salisbury (Father- and mother-in-law of \n     Ted Hennessy, Jr., who was killed on 9/11).\n\n[[Page S11301]]\n\n       John Leinung (Step-father of Paul Battaglia, WTC Tower 1, \n     100th floor).\n       Andrew Rice (Brother of David Rice).\n       Rita Lasar (Sister of Ephraim Lasar).\n       David Reynolds (Cousin of Scott M.

If we do \n     not rise to this challenge, legislation that is passed and \n     signed into law could have the unintended consequences of \n     hurting our security and making our immigration processes \n     even more dysfunctional than they are today. Unfortunately, \n     H.R. 10 was not crafted in a bipartisan manner and the House \n     did not hold a sufficient number of hearings on the important \n     issues this legislation raises. The bill also includes many \n     provisions that we strongly oppose that go well beyond the \n     scope of the Commission's recommendations. These provisions \n     will distract our government from effectively enhancing our \n     security and threaten to stall the passage of needed reforms. \n     We urge you to oppose them:\n       Section 3005--Prohibition on Acceptance of the Consular \n     Identification Card: This provision would prohibit federal \n     employees from accepting consular identification cards. \n     However, in a security-conscious environment, people who are \n     here, whatever their status, must be able to prove their \n     identity. Many cities, counties and law enforcement agencies \n     accept consular identification cards as valid forms of \n     identification.\n       Section 3006--Expedited Removal: This provision \n     significantly expands the expedited removal regime and would \n     subject all individuals who entered the U.S. without \n     inspection to expedited removal unless they have been \n     physically present in the U.S. for more than 5 years. \n     Expedited removal currently has created significant due \n     process concerns; this provision would magnify those concerns \n     immeasurably.\n       Sections 3007, 3009 and 3033: These provisions encompass \n     key aspects of the so-called ``Fairness in Immigration \n     Litigation Act (H.R. 4406) that would further undermine the \n     availability of basic due process protections for non-\n     citizens by: prohibiting habeas corpus review of a variety of \n     immigration decisions; raising the bar substantially for a \n     grant of asylum; prohibiting federal courts from granting \n     stays of deportation while a case is pending except in \n     extraordinary cases; and authorizing the government to remove \n     foreign nationals to countries that lack a functioning \n     government so long as that country does not physically \n     prevent the removal.\n       Section 3008--Revocation of Visas and Other Travel \n     Documents: This provision makes individuals who enter the \n     U.S. on a valid visa that is subsequently revoked by the \n     State Department subject to removal. This provision would \n     prohibit all administrative and judicial review of the \n     revocation decision. Thus, an individual whose visa is \n     revoked based on false information (or other errors) would be \n     removable from the U.S. without the opportunity to challenge \n     the basis for the removal.\n       Section 3053--Minimum Document Requirements and Issuance \n     Standards for Federal Recognition: This provision bars \n     Federal agencies from accepting driver's licenses or other ID \n     cards issued by a state unless it satisfies certain \n     requirements established by the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security. These requirements include: verification by the \n     issuing agency of the authenticity of documents prior to \n     issuance of a driver's license or other ID; proof that \n     the applicant possesses a social security account or that \n     the person is not eligible for one; and confirmation by \n     the SSA of the accuracy of the social security number \n     presented. Not only would these requirements grind to a \n     halt the issuance of driver's licenses throughout the \n     country, they also would lead to a de facto immigration \n     status requirement. Such a result would severely undermine \n     the law enforcement utility of the Department of Motor \n     Vehicle databases by discouraging individuals from \n     applying for licenses.\n       Legislation that would enhance our security and our \n     immigration system, and reinforce due process, civil \n     liberties and privacy concerns needs to address the \n     following:\n       1. Create a system that can deliver on its ``basic \n     commitments.'' The Commission notes that an immigration \n     system unable to deliver on ``basic commitments'' was one of \n     the ``two systematic weaknesses'' that ``came together in our \n     border system's inability to contribute to an effective \n     defense against the 9/11 attacks.''.\n       2. Strengthen the U.S.'s intelligence capacity and create a \n     multi-layered border with several tiers of protection to most \n     effectively enhance security. The Commission report \n     repeatedly underscores the need to enhance our intelligence \n     capacity and develop layers of protection that keep targeted \n     people from entering the U.S. to implement such a layered \n     border, Congress and the Administration must, among other \n     actions, direct more money to our consulates, ensure the \n     accuracy of watchlists and create a process that allows the \n     deletion of names that do not belong on such lists, mandate \n     adequate and consistent training for those who implement \n     immigration law, and ensure that ports-of-entry receive \n     sufficient funding and are adequately staffed with well-\n     trained officers with access to accurate, functioning, and \n     interoperable databases. Another critical component to well-\n     functioning borders and ports-of-entry is access to counsel \n     to facilitate the flow of people and ensure that the \n     government's broad powers to admit or bar noncitizens from \n     entry are not used improperly.\n       3. Effective security measures must include rigorous civil \n     liberties, due process, and privacy protections. In this \n     context, Congress must not erode judicial review. These \n     measure must reflect our nation's binding commitment to \n     protect civil liberties, due process, and individual privacy. \n     The Commission recognizes the need to reconcile ``security \n     with liberty, since the success of one helps protect the \n     other.'' While acknowledging the difficult challenge involved \n     in preserving this balance, the Commission emphasizes the \n     critical importance to get it right. The Commission also \n     points out the importance of placing the burden of proof on \n     the Executive for retaining governmental power.\n       4. Our nation needs an immigration system that shrinks the \n     haystack by facilitating the entry of ``trusted travelers'' \n     so we can better focus our resources on those who mean to do \n     us harm. The 9/11 Commission recognizes the importance of \n     facilitating travel so that resources can be focused on those \n     who mean to do us harm. The Commission urges that the \n     ``programs to speed known travelers'' be made a ``higher \n     priority, permitting inspectors to focus on greater risks.'' \n     In addition, because the U.S. cannot shrink the haystack, \n     enhance our security, and secure our borders without \n     reforming our immigration laws, it is vitally important to \n     reform our laws by legalizing the status of those currently \n     living and working in the U.S., reducing the long backlogs in \n     family-based immigration, and creating break-the-mold worker \n     programs that allow people to enter and leave the U.S. \n     lawfully.\n       5. Measures designed to enhance our security must include \n     provisions that mandate sufficient funding, an adequate \n     number of well-trained officers, reasonable deadlines, \n     accurate databases, technology that is up the task, and \n     Congressional oversight of implementation, along with \n     prioritizing initiatives. Our history is riddled with laws \n     that do not take these factors into account. Congress also \n     must engage in rigorous risk-based and cost-benefit analysis \n     to ensure that agencies are guided by clear priorities and \n     are not overwhelmed by a flood of unachievable mandates.\n       6. The United States must remain a nation that welcomes \n     people to its shores. Immigration is in our national \n     interest, and a system that works is essential to our \n     national and economic security. Our immigration system needs \n     to reflect the importance of reuniting families, fulfilling \n     the needs of American business, maintaining America's \n     economic security (which contributes to our nation's well-\n     being and national security), protecting refugees and asylees \n     to meet our moral and international obligations and, as the \n     Commission underscores, helping to enhance our security. The \n     U.S. is a nation of immigrants and immigration remains \n     central to who we are and helps to explain our success as a \n     people and a country.\n           Sincerely,\n       ACORN, American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, \n     American Immigration Lawyers Association, American Jewish \n     Committee, Arab-American Institute, Center for Community \n     Change, Fair Immigration Reform Movement, Hebrew Immigrant \n     Aid Society (HIAS), Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, \n     National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, National \n     Council of La Raza, National Immigration Forum, Service \n     Employees International Union (SEIU), AFL-CIO, CLC, Tahirih \n     Justice Center.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 30, 2004.\n       Dear Representative: We strongly oppose a provision in H.R. \n     10 that would authorize the outsourcing of torture to brutal \n     dictatorships like Syria, Saudi Arabia, and China.\n       Section 3032 of H.R. 10, the 9/11 Recommendations \n     Implementation Act of 2004, would make it official U.S. \n     policy to send or return individuals to countries where they\n\n[[Page S11302]]\n\n     would be at grave risk of torture. This provision would \n     violate U.S. law and policy, and it is completely \n     inconsistent with decades of efforts by Republicans and \n     Democrats alike to make America a world leader in the fight \n     against torture and for human rights. Far from implementing \n     the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, it directly \n     contradicts the Commission's counsel that the United States \n     should ``offer an example of moral leadership in the world, \n     committed to treat people humanely, [and] abide by the rule \n     of law.''\n       The legal prohibition on torture is absolute. Along with \n     135 other countries that have ratified the Convention against \n     Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n     Punishment, the United States has committed itself to \n     upholding this fundamental principle of human dignity. Just \n     as governments cannot engage in torture directly, they cannot \n     send people to places where they risk being tortured. The \n     Convention against Torture states that ``no State Party shall \n     expel, return (`refouler') or extradite a person to another \n     State where there are substantial grounds for believing that \n     he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.''\n       Congress reiterated its commitment to upholding this \n     obligation in 1998 when it passed section 2242 of the Foreign \n     Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, stating that ``[i]t \n     shall be the policy of the United States not to expel, \n     extradite, or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any \n     person to a country in which there are substantial grounds \n     for believing the person would be in danger of being \n     subjected to torture, regardless of whether the person is \n     physically present in the United States.'' Section 3032 of \n     H.R. 10 would violate that legal and moral obligation by \n     permitting the U.S. government to turn over people to other \n     countries even if it is 100 percent certain they will be \n     tortured. This will have immediate and damaging consequences.\n       For example, the government of China has been demanding \n     that the United States turn over to it a number of ethnic \n     Uighur detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Because it \n     believes the detainees would likely be tortured, the Bush \n     Administration has rightly refused and is instead seeking \n     other countries to accept them. If Congress were to approve \n     this provision, there would be no legal bar to sending these \n     detainees back to torture.\n       By contrast, in 2002 the U.S. government sent a transiting \n     Canadian-Syrian national, Maher Arar, to Syria despite its \n     systematic use of torture. Now safely back in Canada, Arar \n     alleges he was severely tortured, including beatings with \n     electrical cords, during his ten months in a Syrian prison. \n     Such incidents undermine the credibility of U.S. efforts to \n     promote human rights and democracy in the Arab world, which \n     President Bush has identified as a key element in the \n     Administration's long-term strategy to combat terrorism. If \n     this provision is passed, such incidents will become more \n     common, dealing a profound blow to America's moral authority \n     in pursuing a vital goal.\n       In the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal, President Bush and \n     the Congress have gone to great pains to persuade the world \n     that U.S. policy does not condone torture. If Congress enacts \n     this legislation, it would make tolerance of torture official \n     U.S. policy. We urge you to strike this provision from the \n     bill and to reaffirm America's commitment to a world without \n     torture.\n           Sincerely,\n         William Schulz, Amnesty International USA; Douglas A. \n           Johnson, The Center for Victims of Torture; Jennifer \n           Windsor, Freedom House; Elisa Massimino, Human Rights \n           First; Kenneth Roth, Human Rights Watch; Scott Horton, \n           International League for Human Rights; Ralston H. \n           Deffenbaugh, Jr., Lutheran Immigration and Refuge \n           Services; Robin Phillips, Minnesota Advocates for Human \n           Rights; Loenard Rubenstein, Physicians for Human \n           Rights; Todd Howland, RFK Memorial Center for Human \n           Rights; R.

We applaud the bipartisan 9-11 Commission's \n     recommendations that effectively target terrorism and not \n     immigrants. Similarly, the bipartisan Senate bill appears to \n     capture these recommendations and is largely free of attacks \n     on the newcomer community. Unfortunately, House leaders \n     crafting H.R. 10 have decided to take a different tactic and \n     play politics with this critical legislation.\n       Several immigration-related provisions of H.R. 10 are of \n     grave concern. They focus on limiting immigrants' rights to \n     due process and legal identification documents, measures \n     which are not only un-American, but actually \n     counterproductive to our goal of improving national security. \n     Specifically, we are opposed to the following provisions of \n     this legislation:\n       Subjecting an immigrant with less than five years' physical \n     presence in the U.S. to an expedited deportation, without a \n     hearing on her right to remain in the United States (3006).\n       Restricting states' right to permit all immigrant drivers \n     to be legally licensed and insured (3052).\n       Barring federal acceptance of identity documents issued by \n     foreign governments (other than passports), no matter how \n     secure the documents are determined to be (3005).\n       Putting up new hurdles and pitfalls for asylum-seekers that \n     purport to address terrorism concerns, but which are \n     unnecessary, excessive, and in violation of international \n     conventions (3006, 3007, 3031, 3032, 3033).\n       Further limiting immigrants' access to meaningful judicial \n     review (picking up where the 1996 immigration laws left off), \n     including the right to a simple challenge of their detention \n     pursuant to the writ of habeas corpus (3006, 3008, 3009).\n       Expanding the instances in which individuals can be \n     deported to countries with no functioning governments or \n     where they are likely to be tortured (3032, 3033).\n       As the 9-11 Commission pointed out in its report, \n     intelligence is the key to finding terrorists and shutting \n     down their operations; broad-based immigration restriction \n     measures that cast a wide net are ineffectual at best, and a \n     waste of precious resources. The H.R. 10 immigration \n     provisions outlined above fail on all counts: they don't \n     enhance the government's ability to collect or analyze \n     intelligence, to use intelligence in making law enforcement \n     decisions, or to respond to or prevent terrorism. These \n     provisions simply expand the federal government's authority \n     to deport foreign nationals quickly and without proper \n     judicial review, and push immigrants who want to play by the \n     rules further underground. They have no place in this ``9-11 \n     Commission recommendations bill,'' which is why distinguished \n     members of the Commission, and even the White House, have \n     called for the removal of several of these sections.\n       We urge members of the House of Representatives to strike \n     these provisions from H.R. 10 and to pursue instead the well-\n     reasoned recommendations of the 9-11 Commission.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Angela Kelley,\n     Deputy Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Women's Commission for\n\n\n                                   Refugee Women and Children,\n\n                                                  October 5, 2004.\n     Hon. David Dreier,\n     Chair, Committee on Rules,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to you on behalf of the \n     Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children concerning \n     several immigration-related provisions contained in H.R. 10, \n     the ``9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act.'' While the \n     Women's Commission understands the need to pass legislation \n     addressing the findings and recommendations of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, we \n     believe that several of the provisions in the proposed bill \n     go beyond the scope of what the report called for and \n     unnecessarily harm women and children asylum-seekers. \n     Specifically, we are concerned with the following provisions:\n       Section 3006. Expedited Removal: We believe that this \n     provision impacts women and children escaping persecution in \n     a particularly harmful manner. The new provision provides no \n     review process for those individuals expressing a fear of \n     persecution if they have been in the United States for longer \n     than one year. Refugee women and children who are escaping \n     rape, female genital mutilation, honor killings, forced \n     marriages, sexual slavery, trafficking, recruitment as child \n     soldiers, and other forms of age and gender related \n     persecution often face the most difficulty in presenting \n     their cases. Due to the extremely sensitive and often painful \n     nature of such claims and cultural barriers that inhibit \n     women and children from expressing themselves and their \n     needs, women and children often require significant time and \n     counseling before they can articulate their claims, \n     particularly in front of government officials.\n       Moreover, highly specialized skills are needed to interview \n     women and children asylum seekers in a gender and age \n     sensitive manner, and it is unlikely that front line \n     immigration officials will have these skills. The result \n     could be returning at-risk women and children to life-\n     threatening situations.\n       Finally, children have traditionally been exempt from \n     expedited removal in recognition of the vulnerabilities that \n     their tender age creates. H.R. 10, however, would apply \n     expedited removal regardless of age, thus subjecting children \n     to a process that they cannot reasonably be expected to \n     understand or appreciate. Even if protections are put in \n     place for children, children may be improperly classified and \n     treated as adults due to the lack of a scientifically sound \n     method to determine age.\n       Section 3007. Preventing terrorists from obtaining asylum. \n     This section in actuality is irrelevant to terrorism. \n     Instead, it fundamentally alters the evidentiary standards \n     for asylum claims and the burden of proof for asylum \n     applicants.\n       This section would require an asylum seeker to establish \n     that the central motivation for his or her persecutor's \n     actions was one of the five protected grounds under the \n     refugee definition. This change would be catastrophic for \n     both women and children asylum-seekers. Even under current \n     law, which\n\n[[Page S11303]]\n\n     requires a finding of ``mixed motivation,'' many women and \n     children asylum-seekers have a difficult time proving motive. \n     Most gender and age related claims are based on persecution \n     by a private rather than government actor. Often, the \n     violence occurs in private settings. It is thus extremely \n     difficult to prove that the perpetrator is motivated by the \n     victim's age or gender.\n       Furthermore, the provision would require the applicant to \n     provide corroborating evidence unless unreasonable to do so. \n     The private nature of most gender and age related persecution \n     makes it highly unlikely that such evidence will be \n     available. Moreover, even if it exists, children in \n     particular are unlikely to be able to produce it unless \n     intensive legal assistance is provided; the reality is that \n     more than one-half of children are unrepresented when \n     presenting asylum claims.\n       This section would also allow an adjudicator to consider \n     any statements made by asylum-seekers in determining \n     credibility. Thus, if a woman or child discusses their \n     persecution for the first time in front of an asylum officer \n     or an immigration judge, their failure to discuss it in prior \n     conversations with immigration officials could be considered \n     proof of inconsistent statements. This requirement again \n     fails to consider the extremely difficult nature of age and \n     gender related claims. It is unrealistic to expect a woman or \n     child claimant to articulate the embarrassing details of \n     their abuse to immigration officials when they first arrive \n     in the United States and are still fearful and confused. To \n     later use this natural reticence against them is grossly \n     unfair.\n       Furthermore, this section condones the evaluation of an \n     applicant's demeanor in assessing credibility without \n     clarifying that an applicant's behavior should be considered \n     in the context of their culture. This framework completely \n     discounts the complex psychological, social and cultural \n     context of many women and children asylum-seekers.\n       Section 3033. Additional Removal Authorities. This section \n     authorizes the removal of individuals to countries other than \n     their country of origin. Deporting women and children to a \n     third country may be extremely hazardous to their safety. \n     Women often and children always are heavily dependent on \n     family and community support to ensure their well-being.\n       Section 3082. Expanded pre-inspection at foreign airports. \n     This provision would require the expansion of pre-inspection \n     at foreign airports. Immigration officials charged with \n     enforcing pre-inspection would not have sufficient training \n     or expertise to determine whether a woman or child is fleeing \n     persecution. Even if such training were provided, the lack of \n     oversight of such officers and the absence of assistance for \n     women and children are likely to result in many at-risk women \n     and children being prevented from departing the country in \n     which they are being persecuted.\n       Section 3083. Immigration Security Initiative. This \n     provision mandates the posting of immigration officials at \n     overseas airports to check documentation of individuals \n     traveling to the United States. This provision may \n     inadvertently lead to more trafficking in women and children. \n     Asylum seekers who are desperate to leave countries in which \n     they are experiencing persecution often resort to the \n     assistance of outsiders, who may wish to exploit them through \n     trafficking. The more difficult it is to travel without \n     appropriate documents, the more such vulnerable refugees will \n     resort to avenues that could result in their further \n     persecution.\n       While we have limited our comments to those sections of \n     H.R. 10 that we believe are particularly harmful to women and \n     children, we stand with our colleagues in also opposing those \n     other sections (for example, section 3032) that harm all \n     people fleeing past and future harm. Women and children \n     constitute both the majority of and the most vulnerable of \n     the world's refugees. Regardless of the critical merits of \n     fighting the war against terrorism, we cannot afford to \n     relinquish our strong international leadership role in their \n     protection, especially when these women and children present \n     no harm to us.\n       Thank you for considering our concerns. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact us if you would like to discuss any of \n     these issues further.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wendy Young,\n       Director of External Relations.\n     Joanne Kelsey,\n       Senior Coordinator for Detention and Asylum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11303-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  TRIBUTE TO RETIRED COLONEL FRANK ROHRBOUGH, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I honor a true leader and \nexceptional American. After a long and distinguished career of service \nto our Nation, COL Frank Rohrbough is retiring from his position as \nDeputy Director for Government Relations of the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, MOAA. On this occasion, it is fitting to \nrecognize his 30 years of commissioned service as an Air Force officer \nand 13 years as one of the foremost health benefit advocates for the \nuniformed services community. Colonel Rohrbough's career illustrates a \nlifelong commitment of service to the nation and to preserving the \nwelfare of uniformed members and their families.\n  In 1961, Frank Rohrbough graduated from the Reserve Officer Training \nCorps at Texas A University, earning his commission as a second \nlieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. Appointed to the Medical Service \nCorps, he served with distinction at all levels in the Air Force, from \nsmall community military medical treatment facilities to large regional \nhospitals. His distinguished career culminated with his appointment to \nthe Air Force's top Medical Service Corps position--Chief of the Air \nForce Medical Service Corps and Assistant Surgeon General for \nHealthcare Support.\n  After retiring from the Air Force in 1991, Colonel Rohrbough joined \nthe MOAA staff and served as principal advisor on health issues. In \nthis position, he worked with the Armed Services Committees of both the \nHouse and the Senate, the Department of Defense, and numerous \norganizations and agencies to protect health care benefits for \nuniformed services beneficiaries. His personal efforts contributed \nsignificantly towards important legislation including lifetime health \ncare and pharmacy coverage for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries and \nextending eligibility for the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program \nto the entire military community.\n  Our Nation is grateful to Colonel Rohrbough for supporting members of \nthe Armed Forces and their families, the Military Coalition, and all \nveterans, while serving in uniform and in private life. We offer him a \nsharp salute and wish him continued success and happiness in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11303-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11303-S11304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nAmerican Jobs Creation Act. This bill is known as the ``JOBS'' Act \nbecause it will bring American jobs home, it will protect American jobs \nhere, and it will create more American jobs.\n  I have been fighting for a patriotic tax code that closes tax \nloopholes. This bill is not perfect. I have some yellow flashing lights \nabout provisions that were stripped out in this conference report, \nparticularly those affecting our workers right to overtime and our \nNational Guard and Reservists.\n  Our middle class is hurting. They are worried about keeping their \njobs, paying for health care, and sending their children to college. \nAmerica is hemorrhaging jobs--2.7 million manufacturing jobs have \ndisappeared since 2001. My State of Maryland has lost 21,000 \nmanufacturing jobs since 2001.\n  Where are these jobs going? They are going overseas. They are going \non a slow boat to China or on the fast track to Mexico. These jobs are \nheaded to dial 1-800 anywhere.\n  Why are they going? These jobs are leaving because American companies \nare at a competitive disadvantage. Our American companies pay their \nworkers a livable wage, pay their fair share of taxes, and provide \nhealth care and retirement benefits to their employees.\n  I think it is wrong to give companies incentives to send millions of \njobs to other countries when millions of Americans are losing their \njobs. It is wrong to put companies who stay in America at a competitive \ndisadvantage. They are at a competitive disadvantage because they have \ntheir business here at home, because their workers are here at home, \nbecause they pay their fair share of taxes, and because they provide \nhealth care to their employees.\n  We should be rewarding these companies with good guy bonuses for \nhiring and building their businesses here in America. That is what I am \nfighting for in the U.S. Senate.\n  But, this bill is not perfect which is why I fought to improve this \nbill during the Senate debate. Senator Dorgan and I offered an \namendment to end tax subsidies to U.S. companies that send plants and \nU.S. jobs overseas. Our amendment would have required U.S. companies \nthat open foreign plants or move plants overseas then export those \ngoods made abroad back to the U.S. to pay taxes on the profits from \nthese operations. Our amendment said the U.S.\n\n[[Page S11304]]\n\nTax Code can no longer be used to boost corporate rewards at the \nexpense of American workers.\n  We should be rewarding our American companies who hire and build \ntheir businesses right here in the United States with good guy tax \nbreaks. We should be giving good guy bonuses to American businesses \nthat are providing health care to their workers and to their retirees.\n  I have fought to help make health insurance more affordable for self-\nemployed individuals by allowing self-employed individuals to be able \nto fully deduct their health care premiums.\n  I fought to provide workers and retirees who have lost health \ninsurance due to trade with a tax credit of 65 percent for health care \npremiums, and I am still fighting to provide small businesses with a 50 \npercent tax credit for the cost of health insurance premiums for their \nworkers.\n  I am standing up for America by standing up for a strong economy \nright here at home. This bill would help American jobs in three ways. \nThis bill will help reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector by \ncreating incentives to retain more U.S. manufacturing jobs here in the \nU.S. by lowering the cost of production. Next, this bill helps U.S. \ncompanies compete abroad by putting U.S. companies on a more equal \nfooting with foreign competitors. Lastly, this bill will help put an \nend to the tariffs imposed by EU on U.S. exports by repealing the \nincome tax preferences that have been ruled illegal by the World Trade \nOrganization. If we don't pass this legislation, these tariffs would \ncost American businesses up to $4 billion per year. And that's not \nokay.\n  When I consider any tax proposal, I apply three criteria. Does it \ncreate jobs? Are the tax cuts targeted or temporary? Does the proposal \nincrease structural deficit? The JOBS bill meets all my criteria. This \nbill would provide nearly $137 billion in new business tax cuts. There \nare four major sections of this bill: a new domestic manufacturing tax \nbreak; international tax simplification; small business provisions; \nand, shutting down tax shelters and closing tax shelters.\n  The JOBS bill would reduce taxes for many of our U.S based \nmanufacturers, by reducing their overall tax rate by 3 percent. This \nwould lower the cost of doing business in the U.S. for U.S. \nmanufacturers, and would help U.S. manufacturers compete against low-\ncost manufacturing in other countries. The domestic manufacturing tax \nbreak is based on the amount of U.S.-based manufacturing profits. So \ncompanies can only get the tax break if they manufacture here at home. \nThis bill also includes a very broad definition of manufacturing so it \nwould help a broad range of companies.\n  This bill also helps American companies working abroad to be more \ncompetitive with about $42.6 billion in tax breaks to U.S.-based \nmultinationals. This legislation simplifies international tax rules, \neliminates many redundant and complicated tax provisions, and reduces \nthe double taxation of foreign-earned profits for U.S.-based companies. \nIf our American companies are strong at home and abroad, our American \neconomy will be strong. And that's what I'm fighting for.\n  I know how important small businesses are to the health of the \neconomy and to the communities that they serve. This legislation \nincludes about $7.1 billion in tax breaks for small businesses in two \nimportant ways. First, this bill will provide tax breaks for restaurant \nowners and certain real estate developers so that they can write off \nthe cost of improving their facilities faster, saving thousands of \ndollars. This legislation also extends the small business tax breaks \nfrom 2003 bill which allows small businesses to write off up to \n$100,000 for the purchase of new equipment. If we do not pass this \nlegislation, our small businesses will only be able to write off \n$25,000 for investments in new equipment.\n  This legislation funds tax breaks for our good guys by shutting down \nthe types of tax loopholes used by Enron, cracking down abusive \nshelters, closing tax loopholes for companies and individuals who hide \nassets in tax havens to avoid paying U.S. taxes, and ending certain \nleasing arrangements for public infrastructure projects. I don't \nbelieve that the American taxpayer should be subsidizing the Paris \nmetro. I say let's keep those dollars here at home.\n\n  Though I am supporting today's bill, I also believe there are \nproblems with it. I introduced an amendment with my colleague from \nLouisiana--Senator Mary Landrieu. Though this amendment passed \nunanimously in the Senate, it is nowhere to be found in this conference \nreport. Senator Landrieu and I introduced an amendment that provides \nbenefits to our good guy employers who pay their employees the \ndifference between their National Guard salary and their civilian job. \nThis important provision would have provided a 50 percent tax credit to \nemployers who continue to pay their activated Guard and Reserve \nemployees their civilian wages. This provision would also have provided \na $6,000 tax credit to help small business owners hire temporary \nworkers and provided a $10,000 tax credit for small manufacturers to \nhire temporary workers when their National Guard employees have been \ndeployed. I wish that these provisions were included in the bill that \nwe passed today.\n  Our National Guardsmen are often our first responders. They are our \npolicemen and firemen in times of crisis. They are ``Our Active Duty \nAmericans''--on duty in times of peace and war. When our National \nGuardsmen and women are sent to Iraq, Afghanistan, or called to protect \nour critical military installations here in the U.S., they shouldn't \nhave to worry about paying their bills here at home. It's just wrong \nthat this provision was not included in the final JOBS bill.\n  I am happy that we were able to reach a compromise and pass a bill, \nH.R. 1779, which would provide a 50 percent tax credit to small \nbusinesses who continue to pay their activated Guard and Reserve \nemployees their civilian wages, and provide a $6,000 tax credit to help \nsmall business owners hire temporary workers. But, the bill we passed \ntoday leaves out our First Responders. It also leaves out the extra \nhelp for our manufacturers. Now that we have done our job here in the \nSenate, we have to hope that the House takes action on this bill when \nwe return. Well, we all know what that means. I am going to continue to \nfight for this provision when we come back. I am also going to fight to \ndo the same thing for our federal government employees with the Durbin-\nMikulski Pay Security Act.\n  I have another problem with the legislation we are discussing today. \nI am so disappointed that the amendment to protect overtime pay was \nagain stripped out in conference. Once again, the White House got its \nway even though Congress and the American public are opposed to the new \novertime rules. Millions of Americans depend on overtime pay to pay \ntheir bills and to make ends meet. I thought that in this country the \nbest social program was a job. Yet, up to 6 million workers have lost \novertime protection under the new overtime rules. Workers should \nreceive overtime pay for working overtime. It's just that simple. This \nisn't complicated--it's fair and right.\n  The JOBS bill makes good things happen by helping U.S. companies. The \nJOBS bill also stops bad things from happening by going after tax \ncheats. But, the conference report is not near the bill that was passed \nby the Senate.\n  I will vote for this legislation because I think it helps create a \npatriotic Tax Code, provides good guy bonuses to American manufacturing \ncompanies that keep jobs here, creates a level playing field for U.S. \ncompanies competing abroad, and cracks down on tax cheats and closing \ntax loopholes.\n  I call on my colleagues to think about where America is going in the \n21st century. Where are we going to be? Are we going to create more \nopportunity? Are we going to create more jobs that pay a living wage \nand have a decent benefit structure?\n  I really want to have a patriotic Tax Code that brings our jobs back \nhome, helps us compete overseas, and stands up for America.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11304-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11304-S11305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. STEVENS, from the Committee on Appropriations:\n       Special Report entitled ``Further Revised Allocation To \n     Subcommittees of Budget Totals for Fiscal Year 2005'' (Rept. \n     No. 108-398).\n\n[[Page S11305]]\n\n       By Mr. McCAIN, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, without amendment:\n       S. 480.

A bill to establish the Office of Community Justice Services \nwithin the Department of Justice, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, everyday more than 1,600 prisoners are \nreleased from jail and head back to the streets of America's \nneighborhoods and communities. That is more than 600,000 each year. \nWhen they get out, they are often get sent back to same neighborhoods \nwhere they got into trouble in the first place and more than two-thirds \nof them return to a life of crime.\n  This problem could get worse, if we don't take action. We have the \nlargest prison population than at any other time in our history. Two \nmillion people are behind bars, the result of tougher penalties, \nparticularly for drug offenses, and ``three-strikes and you're out \nlaws'' in many States. While the worst offenders will stay behind bars \nindefinitely, 95 percent of people in jail will get out at some point \nin time, either on parole, or after completing their sentences.\n  The challenge for us and our communities is clear: we must find a way \nto successfully integrate offenders back into society after they get \nout of prison. The task is daunting. Many offenders face a unique set \nof personal challenges, legal restrictions, and social barriers that \nmake the transition to productive citizenship extremely difficult for \nthem.\n  Substance abuse is the most common problem. Eighty percent of all \noffenders abuse drugs and alcohol, or were under the influence of drugs \nand alcohol when they committed their crimes. Only about 13 percent of \nthem receive treatment while they are in prison, according to the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy. Spending for in-prison \nsubstance abuse programs has been cut so that States and localities can \ndevote more funding for housing the increased number of prisoners in \ntheir corrections systems.\n  Drug addicted offenders face even bigger challenges when they get \nout. Corrections agencies are often required to return prisoners to the \nplace where they were convicted. That means released offenders get sent \nback to economically distressed neighborhoods where drugs are \nplentiful, but hope is not. These men and women go back to face the \nsame temptations and demons that led to their addictions and their \ncriminal conduct. Resources for treatment in these communities are \nstretched thin and a lot of former inmates cannot get help.\n  Another important barrier to success as a citizen is poor education. \nOffenders are more than twice as likely to have not graduated from high \nschool than the general population. One study found that one-third of \ninmates could not find an intersection on a map; the same percentage \ncould not explain a billing error or place information on an automobile \nmaintenance form; and only one in 20 could figure out what bus to take \nfrom using a schedule.\n  If you cannot use a map or read a bus schedule, you will not be able \nto find your way to an office in an unfamiliar part of town to \ninterview for a entry level job as a file clerk. If you cannot explain \na billing error to someone, you will not be able to get a job in \ncustomer service. There are basic-skilled jobs that do not require a \ncollege education available for ex-offenders. But too many of our \noffenders lack the basic skills to get these jobs and if people are not \nworking, they are more likely to get into trouble.\n  Studies have shown that unemployment contributes to criminal conduct. \nThe New York State Department of Labor found that 80 percent of \noffenders who violated probation or parole were unemployed.\n  To make matters worse, many States exclude felons from holding \ncertain kinds of jobs and obtaining professional licenses. A felon \nmight not be able to get a cosmetology license or certain kinds of \ndrivers' licenses. They may also be denied housing assistance and \ncertain kinds of welfare benefits; 15 to 27 percent of released inmates \nexpect to go to homeless shelters when they get out.\n  These statistics make it clear why so many of our ex-offenders end up \nback in trouble with the law. Untreated substance abuse problems, poor \neducation and job skills, and homelessness work to sap offenders of \ntheir drive, ambition, and hope. Crime seems like the only option for \nex-offenders and they return to a life of crime 67 percent of the time.\n  Recidivism has its costs. Crime has devastating affects on the \nneighborhoods that see the most criminal activity. Housing an inmate \nfor one year costs State prison systems $21,000 and costs the Federal \nsystem $25,000 per year. But the victims pay the biggest costs in pain, \nsuffering, and fear.\n  I believe that we can do better than a 67 percent recidivism rate and \nwe can reduce the amount of pain inflicted on victims if we invest in \nprograms that help offenders get over the barriers and the personal \ndifficulties that keep them from becoming productive citizens. Research \nshows that these kinds of programs can help prepare offenders for life \noutside of prison. According to one U.S. Department of Education study, \nparticipation in correctional vocational and education programs reduces \nrecidivism by 29 percent in State prisoners and 33 percent for Federal \nprisoners. Substance abuse treatment programs can cut drug use in half \nand reduce recidivism by 20 percent. In fact every dollar invested in \nsubstance abuse programs saves taxpayers $7.46 in other government and \nsocial costs according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n  Today, I am introducing the Protecting Our Communities by Making \nReturning Offenders Better Citizens Act of 2004. This legislation will \nestablish a $1.5 billion grant program at the Department of Justice to \nhelp States and communities develop comprehensive reentry strategies to \nturn felons into productive citizens. Funding would be available to \nState and local corrections and offender supervision agencies to a \nrange of services including substance abuse treatment, basic education \nprograms, job skills training, civic education, mentoring services, and \nfamily counseling services. The bill encourages these governmental \nagencies to partner with local non-profits, community organizations, \nand faith-based organizations to deliver these services to offenders \nboth in and out of jail.\n  This legislation will also help the families of offenders when an \noffender returns home. Some 1.5 million children had a parent in a \nState or Federal prison in 1999 and 7 million children have a parent \nunder some form of correctional supervision. These children are seven \ntimes more likely to end up in the criminal justice system. The return \nof an offender to the home can also produce a great deal of family \nstrife. The adjustment can be very difficult. An unstable home \nenvironment only helps to foster criminal behavior.\n\n  My legislation will help corrections agencies institute family \nprograms to help keep families close while a parent is incarcerated. \nPrisons and jails would be able to improve family visitation \nfacilities, provide reduced cost phone service so that inmates can keep \nin touch with their families, or develop other innovative programs to \nkeep family in the lives of offenders. Parole and probation agencies \ncan work with family support agencies and other government agencies to \nprovide a range of services so that families can successfully adjust to \nhaving an offender back home.\n  The experts are just beginning to examine the important role family \nservices can play in reducing recidivism. One study found that \nprisoners with no visitors were six times more likely to re-enter \nprison within the first year of parole than those with three or more \nvisitors.\n  A variety of family integration programs for offenders have also \nshown great promise. The La Bodega de la Familia program in New York \nCity and the Michigan Department of Corrections's Project SEEK have \nproduced terrific outcomes, reducing drug use and violent behavior by \nchildren. These programs offer an array of services to offenders in \naddition to family counseling. They serve as focal point for offenders \nto get substance abuse counseling, job training, and education. We need \nmore programs like this and my legislation will make that possible.\n  We also need to do more to make offenders understand not only the \nresponsibilities of citizenship, but also its benefits. Certain \noffenders can be denied the right to vote, public housing benefits, \nsome welfare benefits, and they are legally barred from certain kinds \nof employment. What they often\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\ndo not know, however, is that they can get these rights back under \ncertain circumstances. While we make offenders well aware of what civic \nrights and benefits they are denied when they get released, they do not \nreceive information on how they can get those rights back.\n  In order to qualify for a grant, grantees must provide offenders with \ninformation on how they can restore their voting rights and any other \nrights or benefits denied them because of their criminal records. \nStates will not have to change any laws to meet this requirement, they \nare only required to provide information to offenders. I believe that \nthis will send a powerful message to released offenders that we want \nthem to become full participants in our democracy despite their past \nmistakes. I believe providing information on how to restore their \nrights can help motivate offenders to follow a different path and \nunderscores our willingness to give them another chance.\n  Our communities have done a terrific job protecting the public. The \ncrime rate has fallen 55 percent over the last decade, the lowest level \nin 30 years. They have succeeded through hard work and the investment \nof the Federal Government in local law enforcement. We passed tougher \ncriminal penalties, provided funding for equipment and technology, and \nput 100,000 community policing officers on the streets.\n\n  Keeping our streets safe is a constant battle that is far from over. \nThese criminals are coming back. Some will be ready for the challenges \nof citizenship, many will not. The Federal Government can help again by \nproviding the right resources to corrections and our parole and \nprobation agencies. President Bush announced his support for a $300 \nmillion initiative to help offenders with job training, transitional \nhousing, and mentoring with faith-based organizations. The President's \nprogram was an excellent start. The Protecting Our Communities by \nMaking Returning Offenders Better Citizens Act will build on this so \nthat every offender gets a second chance to turn themselves from felons \ninto fellow citizens. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) More than 2,000,000 people are incarcerated in Federal \n     or State prisons and local jails in the United States.\n       (2) Of the individuals now in prison, 97 percent will \n     eventually be released back into American communities. More \n     than 630,000 of these inmates are released into the Nation's \n     communities every year.\n       (3) The Bureau of Justice Statistics has found that 67.5 \n     percent of prisoners released from incarceration in 1994 were \n     rearrested within 3 years.\n       (4) Many of the men and women who will leave prison and \n     jail each year have a variety of substance abuse disorders, \n     low levels of education and job training, face significant \n     barriers to employment, and lack housing upon their release.\n       (5) Felony convictions can also disqualify released \n     offenders from voting and other rights. Under some State \n     laws, these disqualifications can be permanent. While many \n     States allow for the restoration of voting and civic rights \n     to ex-offenders, this information is not routinely given to \n     ex-offenders upon their release.\n       (6) Returning offenders have significant educational needs. \n     Fewer than one-half of released prisoners have a high school \n     education. Studies have found that approximately one-third of \n     prisoners cannot locate an intersection on a street map; one-\n     third cannot explain in writing a billing error; and only 1 \n     in 20 can determine which bus to take from a schedule.\n       (7) State and local governments have not been able to \n     maintain prison education programs in the face of a prison \n     population that has doubled in the past decade. As a result, \n     according to the National Institute for Literacy, the \n     percentage of prisoners participating in correctional \n     education programs is declining.\n       (8) The United States Department of Education found that \n     participation in correctional education programs lowers the \n     likelihood of reincarceration by 29 percent, and the Federal \n     Bureau of Prisons found a 33 percent drop in recidivism among \n     Federal prisoners who participate in vocational and \n     apprenticeship training.\n       (9) According to the National Institute of Justice, 60 \n     percent of formerly incarcerated individuals are unemployed \n     after 1 year of release. Unemployment can contribute to the \n     likelihood of repeating criminal conduct.\n       (10) Formerly incarcerated individuals face unique barriers \n     in the job market. They may be legally disqualified from \n     certain types of employment and barred by law from obtaining \n     professional licenses in fields such as cosmetology, \n     transportation, and home health care.\n       (11) Research has found that job training and placement \n     programs for ex-offenders increase the employment of \n     offenders and reduce recidivism.\n       (12) Drug and alcohol abuse is a persistent concern at \n     every stage of the criminal justice process. Eighty-one \n     percent of State prisoners, 81 percent of Federal prisoners, \n     and 77 percent of local jail inmates have alcohol and drug \n     abuse problems, or were under the influence of alcohol or \n     drugs when they committed their offenses. However, only 13 \n     percent of these inmates receive drug and alcohol treatment \n     while they are incarcerated according to the Office of \n     National Drug Control Policy.\n       (13) Substance abuse treatment has been proven to reduce \n     drug use, recidivism, unemployment, and homelessness, \n     according to several studies, and every dollar invested in \n     substance abuse treatment saves taxpayers $7.46 in other \n     social costs.\n       (14) Many offenders are released back into the community \n     without having a place to call home. Several studies have \n     found that many prisoners expect to go to homeless shelters \n     upon release.\n       (15) A number of barriers exist to offenders getting \n     adequate shelter upon release. Most offenders do not have \n     enough money at the time of release to rent an apartment and \n     landlords typically are reluctant to rent to former \n     offenders. Some ex-offenders are prohibited from living in \n     public housing because of their criminal records.\n       (16) The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that \n     1,500,000 children in the United States had a parent in a \n     Federal or State prison in 1999. In addition, over 7,000,000 \n     children have a parent under some sort of correctional \n     supervision.\n       (17) Children of incarcerated parents face social stigma \n     because of their parents' criminal status. This can cause \n     problems in school, low self-esteem, aggressive behavior, and \n     other emotional dysfunction.\n       (18) The reunification of ex-offenders and their families \n     can cause family stress. In some cases, the ex-offender is \n     not welcome in the home and many ex-offenders have difficulty \n     readjusting to family life.\n       (19) Studies show that ex-offenders adjust better to family \n     life when their families receive comprehensive support \n     services. These services can also reduce juvenile \n     delinquency, antisocial behavior, and recidivism rates.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill relating to State regulation of access to hunting and \nfishing; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nexplicitly reaffirms each State's right to regulate hunting and \nfishing.\n  I am pleased that Senators Ben Nelson, Conrad Burns, and Ted Stevens \nare joining me in sponsoring this important bill.\n  This is a Nevada issue, but it is also a national issue, as a recent \nFederal circuit court ruling undermines traditional hunting and fishing \nlaws.\n  In Conservation Force v. Dennis Manning, the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals ruled that State laws that distinguish between State residents \nand non-residents for the purpose of affording hunting and related \nprivileges are constitutionally suspect.\n  This threatens the conservation of wildlife resources and \nrecreational opportunities.\n  Although the Ninth Circuit found the purposes of such regulation to \nbe sound, the Court questioned the validity of tag limits for non-\nresident hunters.\n  I respect the authority of States to enact laws to protect their \nlegitimate interests in conserving fish and game, as well as providing \nopportunities for State residents to hunt and fish.\n  That's what this legislation says--we respect that State right.\n  Sportsmen are ardent conservationists. They support wildlife \nconservation not only through the payment of State and local taxes and \nother fees, but also through local non-profit conservation efforts and \nby volunteering their time.\n  For example, in Nevada there are great groups such as Nevada Bighorns \nUnlimited and the Fraternity of Desert Bighorn. These are dedicated \nsportsmen who spend countless hours, as well as money, building \n``guzzlers'' in the desert, which help provide a reliable source of \nwater for Desert Bighorn Sheep.\n\n  Without these efforts it would be extremely hard for the Bighorn \nSheep to survive, because many areas of their natural habitat where \nthey used to drink water have been developed.\n  Today, Southern Nevada is in the 5th year of a 500 year drought, and \nthe work of the groups I mentioned is saving the lives of hundreds of \nbighorns.\n  The involvement of local sportsmen in protecting and conserving \nwildlife is one of the facts that justifies traditional resident/non-\nresident distinctions, and provides the motivation for our legislation.\n  The regulation of wildlife is traditionally within a State's purview, \nand\n\n[[Page S11310]]\n\nthis legislation simply affirms the traditional role of States in the \nregulation of fish and game.\n  This bill is time sensitive.\n  This bill needs to pass before next year's hunting season begins.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to expedite passage of \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. \n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2978\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 464\n\n       Whereas, the Senate today passed a free standing measure \n     which is designed to address tax relief issues relating to \n     Reservists and National Guardsmen;\n       Whereas, one of the provisions of the package provides tax \n     relief to employers of Reservists and National Guardsmen;\n       Whereas, the employer provision is targeted to businesses \n     and tax paying entities;\n       Whereas, State and local governments are facing budgetary \n     pressures, particularly with regard to homeland security;\n       Whereas, many local first responders have been called to \n     active duty in the National Guards and Reserves, and many \n     state and local governments have continued to pay their \n     salaries, thus increasing the budgetary pressure on state and \n     local governments;\n       Whereas, the Senate recognized this pressure by including \n     in the FSC-ETI bill a provision to compensate state and local \n     governments for closing the pay gap of first responders who \n     are called to active duty in the National Guards and \n     Reserves: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       1. The Senate should reiterate its support for reimbursing \n     state and local governments for closing the pay gap for first \n     responders who are called to active duty in the National \n     Guard and Reserves by considering expanding the employer tax \n     relief provisions to cover state and local governments; and\n       2.

Res. 466\n\n       Whereas the year 2007 is the 125th anniversary of the first \n     International Polar Year of 1882-1883, the 75th anniversary \n     of the second International Polar Year of 1932-1933, and the \n     50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year of \n     1957-1958;\n       Whereas the first International Polar Year of 1882-1883, \n     which involved 12 nations, and the second International Polar \n     Year of 1932-1933, which involved 40 nations, set the first \n     precedents for internationally coordinated scientific \n     campaigns;\n       Whereas the International Geophysical Year, conceived in \n     and promoted by the United States, was the largest \n     cooperative international scientific endeavor undertaken to \n     that date, involving more than 60,000 scientists from 66 \n     nations;\n       Whereas each of these activities left a legacy of \n     scientific advances, new discoveries, and international \n     goodwill that still benefit us today;\n       Whereas the International Geophysical Year legacy includes \n     the dedication of an entire continent to cooperative \n     scientific study through the Antarctica Treaty and the \n     inauguration of the global space age through the launching of \n     Sputnik and Vanguard;\n       Whereas International Geophysical Year cooperation \n     continues as the model and inspiration for contemporary world \n     science and provides a bridge between peoples of the world \n     that has demonstrated the ability to transcend political \n     differences;\n       Whereas it also would be appropriate to use the \n     international science year format to expand the scope of past \n     years to encompass a broad range of disciplines and to \n     recognize interdisciplinary research that incorporates the \n     physical and social sciences and the humanities in enriching \n     understanding of diverse life on Earth;\n       Whereas the 35th anniversary of the International \n     Geophysical Year was commemorated by the International Space \n     Year, a globally implemented congressional initiative \n     conceived by the late Senator Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii, that \n     was highlighted by globally coordinated environmental \n     monitoring and research whose ongoing legacy continues to \n     benefit humanity;\n       Whereas planning for an International Polar Year in 2007-\n     2008 is underway, under the guidance of strong United States \n     leadership and the National Academy of Sciences and in \n     conjunction with the International Council for Science and \n     the World Meteorological Organization, with this envisioned \n     to be an intense, coordinated campaign of observations, \n     research, and analysis that will be multidisciplinary in \n     scope and international in participation;\n       Whereas an International Polar Year in 2007-2008 will \n     include research on the conditions in both polar regions and \n     recognize the strong links among polar region conditions and \n     the rest of the globe, including the impact on global climate \n     change, as the polar regions have profound significance for \n     the Earth's climate and environments;\n       Whereas other scientific bodies are planning additional \n     internationally coordinated scientific programs to advance \n     scientific knowledge and observations from the core of the \n     Earth to the farthest reaches of the Cosmos's effects on the \n     Earth;\n       Whereas it is entirely fitting that Congress takes the lead \n     again, in the same spirit, in promoting global cooperation \n     through worldwide commemoration of the past International \n     Polar Years and the International Geophysical Year with \n     activities reflecting the unity and diversity of life on \n     Earth: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that the \n     President should--\n       (1) endorse the concept of a worldwide campaign of \n     scientific activity for the 2007-2008 timeframe;\n       (2) direct the Director of the National Science Foundation \n     and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, in association with the National Academy of \n     Sciences and other relevant governmental and nongovernmental \n     organizations, to continue interagency and international \n     inquiries and discussions that ensure a successful worldwide \n     international science year in the 2007-2008 timeframe, \n     emphasizing activities dedicated to global environmental \n     research, education, and protection; and\n       (3) submit to Congress at the earliest practical date, but \n     no later than March 15, 2005, a report detailing the steps \n     taken in carrying out paragraphs (1) and (2), including \n     descriptions of possible activities and organizational \n     structures for an international science year in 2007-2008.\n\n[[Page S11311]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 467--EXTENDING BIRTHDAY GREETINGS TO JOSEPH BARBERA \n  ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY AND DESIGNATING MARCH 2005 AS \n                ``ANIMATED FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT MONTH''\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following \nresolution;

Res. 467\n\n       Whereas Joseph Barbera is one of the pioneers of animated \n     entertainment, having created, with his partner, William \n     Hanna, some of the world's most recognizable and beloved \n     characters, including Tom and Jerry, Huckleberry Hound, The \n     Flintstones, The Jetsons, Scooby-Doo, and Yogi Bear, among \n     many others;\n       Whereas Joseph Barbera is also one of the most honored \n     figures in animated entertainment, his creations Tom and \n     Jerry having received 7 Academy Awards for their antics, \n     including their groundbreaking dancing appearances with Gene \n     Kelly and Esther Williams in live action films, and having \n     won multiple Emmy Awards, and Joseph Barbera himself having \n     been elected to the Television Academy Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas in 1960, the team of Joseph Barbera and William \n     Hanna created television's first animated family sitcom, \n     ``The Flintstones'', a series marked by a number of other \n     firsts--the first animated series to air in primetime, the \n     first animated series to go beyond the 6- or 7-minute cartoon \n     format, and the first animated series to feature human \n     characters;\n       Whereas ``The Flintstones'' ran for 6 years and became the \n     top-ranking animated program in syndication history, with all \n     original 166 episodes currently seen in more than 80 \n     countries worldwide;\n       Whereas Joseph Barbera cocreated a cowardly Great Dane \n     named Scooby-Doo, who eventually made his own place in \n     television history, for the popular series ``Scooby-Doo, \n     Where Are You?'' remained in production for 17 years, still \n     maintains the title of television's longest-running animated \n     series, and serves as the inspiration for a series of current \n     live-action films;\n       Whereas in 1981, Hanna-Barbera developed the phenomenally \n     successful ``The Smurfs'', which won 2 Daytime Emmy Awards in \n     1982 and in 1983 for Outstanding Children's Entertainment \n     Series and a Humanitas Award (an award given to shows that \n     best affirm the dignity of the human person) in 1987;\n       Whereas at the age of 99, Joseph Barbera continues to work \n     actively in the field, reporting to his office daily and \n     continuing to develop new animated entertainment for the \n     people of the United States and the world to enjoy;\n       Whereas March 24, 2005, will be Joseph Barbera's 100th \n     birthday; and\n       Whereas the lives of families across the United States and \n     throughout the world have been enriched by the shared \n     enjoyment of the work of creators like Joseph Barbera: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) on behalf of the American people, extends its birthday \n     greetings and best wishes to Joseph Barbera on the occasion \n     of his 100th birthday; and\n       (2) designates March 2005 as ``Animated Family \n     Entertainment Month'' and encourages the families of the \n     United States to take time to enjoy together the family \n     entertainment created by the Nation's animated storytellers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 468--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 7, 2004, AS ``NATIONAL \nNATIVE AMERICAN VETERANS DAY'' TO HONOR THE SERVICE OF NATIVE AMERICANS \n   IN THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF NATIVE \n             AMERICANS TO THE DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Inouye) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nCampbell and Inouye in submitting a resolution to honor American \nIndian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian veterans for their service \nin the Armed Forces of the United States and to designate November 7, \n2004 as ``National Native American Veterans Day''.\n  This is the second consecutive year that such a resolution has been \nintroduced. November 7, 2003 was designated as National Native American \nVeterans Day in accordance with Senate Resolution 239. I was proud to \njoin with Senator Campbell, our distinguished chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs and Senator Inouye, the distinguished vice \nchairman of the committee, and others of my colleagues in cosponsoring \nthat resolution. As the events of conflict in Iraq continue we all hope \nand pray for the safe return of the men and women who are overseas, far \nfrom home protecting our Nation and others.\n  We continue to honor the memory of Army Private First Class Lori \nPiestewa, a Hopi woman, who fought valiantly and bravely to protect her \nfellow soldiers during the invasion of Iraq. This year we also remember \nother Native people who lost their lives in Iraq over the past year. \nArmy Sergeant Lee Duane Todacheene, Marine Lance Corporal Quinn A. \nKeith, Army Private First Class Harry Shondee, Jr, members of the \nNavajo Nation, and Army Private First Class Sheldon Hawk Eagle, \nCheyenne River Sioux, whose Indian name was Wanbli Ohitika, or Brave \nEagle. I apologize if I have failed to acknowledge a brave Native \nperson who lost his or her life in Iraq.\n  Native people, and especially the Native people of my State of \nAlaska, revere, admire, and respect our veterans and those who continue \nto serve. They pray for ones still in battle, alongside their fellow \nAmericans, so that they can have a safe journey back to their loving \nhomes and families. They pray for the ones who have fought, and now, \ncontinue their journey through life's struggles.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 144--TO CORRECT THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. \n                                  4837\n\n  Mr. HARKIN submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 466, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 466) celebrating the anniversaries of \n     the International Polar Years (1882-1883 and 1932-1933) and \n     International Geophysical Year (1957-1958) and supporting a \n     continuation of this international science year tradition in \n     2007-2008.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support a Senate \nresolution to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the first \nInternational Polar Year, IPY, of 1882-1883, the 75th anniversary of \nthe second IPY of 1932-1933, and the 50th anniversary of the \nInternational Geophysical Year, IGY, 1957-1958, in 2007-2008. The \nresolution would also support the continuation of such international \nscience year traditions, particularly emphasizing activities dedicated \nto global environmental research, education, and protection.\n  Mr. President, IPY and IGY have left a legacy of scientific \nadvancements, new discoveries, and international goodwill that continue \nto benefit societies today. They have made significant contributions to \nenhancing our\n\n[[Page S11324]]\n\nunderstanding of the processes of environmental change and variability. \nIn order to accurately access and monitor changes in the Earth's \nclimate, environments, and ecosystems, it is imperative that we give \nadequate attention and resources to understanding these processes. \nExamining environmental changes in the past will strengthen our \nabilities to make informed decisions for the future.\n  IPY, first launched over 125 years ago, set precedents for \ninternationally coordinated scientific campaigns. Accomplishments from \npast IPY activities include advancements in meterology, atmospheric \nsciences, geomagnetism, and technology. IPY also fueled the \nestablishment of the first year-round research station inland from the \nAntarctic coast by the United States. Planning for an IPY in 2007-2008 \nis currently underway under the United States leadership of the \nNational Academy of Science, in conjunction with the International \nCouncil for Science and the World Meterological Organization.\n  Modeled after IPY, IGY was first launched in 1957-1958 and also has \nbeen a model for international science activities. Accomplishments from \npast IGY activities include the initiation of the global space age and \nexploration of the upper atmosphere through the launching of Sputnik \nand Vanguard, the world's first satellites. IGY led to the \nestablishment of more research stations in the Antarctic, and to the \nratification of the Antarctic Treaty in 1961, which promoted peaceful \ninternational collaboration and scientific exploration in the \nAntarctic. It is my hope that the same research activities will occur \nin the Arctic region.\n  This resolution celebrating the anniversaries of IPY and IGY in 2007-\n2008 would endorse the concept of a worldwide campaign for scientific \nactivity and expand the scope of past international science activities \nto promote interdisciplinary research that incorporates the physical \nand social sciences to enrich the understanding of diversity in life \nand environmental patterns on Earth. The resolution also would require \nthe President of the United States to submit to Congress a report on \nsteps taken by the National Science Foundation and the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, in association with the National \nAcademy of Sciences and other scientific organizations, to ensure a \nsuccessful worldwide international science year in 2007-2008.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this noncontroversial effort to \npromote continued international scientific collaboration.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 466\n\n       Whereas the year 2007 is the 125th anniversary of the first \n     International Polar Year of 1882-1883, the 75th anniversary \n     of the second International Polar Year of 1932-1933, and the \n     50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year of \n     1957-1958;\n       Whereas the first International Polar Year of 1882-1883, \n     which involved 12 nations, and the second International Polar \n     Year of 1932-1933, which involved 40 nations, set the first \n     precedents for internationally coordinated scientific \n     campaigns;\n       Whereas the International Geophysical Year, conceived in \n     and promoted by the United States, was the largest \n     cooperative international scientific endeavor undertaken to \n     that date, involving more than 60,000 scientists from 66 \n     nations;\n       Whereas each of these activities left a legacy of \n     scientific advances, new discoveries, and international \n     goodwill that still benefit us today;\n       Whereas the International Geophysical Year legacy includes \n     the dedication of an entire continent to cooperative \n     scientific study through the Antarctica Treaty and the \n     inauguration of the global space age through the launching of \n     Sputnik and Vanguard;\n       Whereas International Geophysical Year cooperation \n     continues as the model and inspiration for contemporary world \n     science and provides a bridge between peoples of the world \n     that has demonstrated the ability to transcend political \n     differences;\n       Whereas it also would be appropriate to use the \n     international science year format to expand the scope of past \n     years to encompass a broad range of disciplines and to \n     recognize interdisciplinary research that incorporates the \n     physical and social sciences and the humanities in enriching \n     understanding of diverse life on Earth;\n       Whereas the 35th anniversary of the International \n     Geophysical Year was commemorated by the International Space \n     Year, a globally implemented congressional initiative \n     conceived by the late Senator Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii, that \n     was highlighted by globally coordinated environmental \n     monitoring and research whose ongoing legacy continues to \n     benefit humanity;\n       Whereas planning for an International Polar Year in 2007-\n     2008 is underway, under the guidance of strong United States \n     leadership and the National Academy of Sciences and in \n     conjunction with the International Council for Science and \n     the World Meteorological Organization, with this envisioned \n     to be an intense, coordinated campaign of observations, \n     research, and analysis that will be multidisciplinary in \n     scope and international in participation;\n       Whereas an International Polar Year in 2007-2008 will \n     include research on the conditions in both polar regions and \n     recognize the strong links among polar region conditions and \n     the rest of the globe, including the impact on global climate \n     change, as the polar regions have profound significance for \n     the Earth's climate and environments;\n       Whereas other scientific bodies are planning additional \n     internationally coordinated scientific programs to advance \n     scientific knowledge and observations from the core of the \n     Earth to the farthest reaches of the Cosmos's effects on the \n     Earth; and\n       Whereas it is entirely fitting that Congress takes the lead \n     again, in the same spirit, in promoting global cooperation \n     through worldwide commemoration of the past International \n     Polar Years and the International Geophysical Year with \n     activities reflecting the unity and diversity of life on \n     Earth: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that the \n     President should--\n       (1) endorse the concept of a worldwide campaign of \n     scientific activity for the 2007-2008 timeframe;\n       (2) direct the Director of the National Science Foundation \n     and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, in association with the National Academy of \n     Sciences and other relevant governmental and nongovernmental \n     organizations, to continue interagency and international \n     inquiries and discussions that ensure a successful worldwide \n     international science year in the 2007-2008 timeframe, \n     emphasizing activities dedicated to global environmental \n     research, education, and protection; and\n       (3) submit to Congress at the earliest practical date, but \n     no later than March 15, 2005, a report detailing the steps \n     taken in carrying out paragraphs (1) and (2), including \n     descriptions of possible activities and organizational \n     structures for an international science year in 2007-2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11324-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11324-S11325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING AND MEMORIALIZING THE PASSENGERS AND CREW OF UNITED AIRLINES \n                               FLIGHT 93\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2856) to limit the transfer of certain Commodity \n     Credit Corporation funds between conservation programs for \n     technical assistance for other programs.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the passage \nof S. 2856, legislation that will restore the conservation funding \ncommitment Congress and the administration made to farmers and ranchers \nin the 2002 farm bill. I applaud the leadership of Agriculture \nCommittee Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Harkin for their \nleadership to correct the shortfall in conservation technical \nassistance funding. For the last 2 years I have worked to correct this \nproblem and am pleased to join my colleagues in this effort.\n  Despite historic funding conservation levels in the 2002 farm bill, \nfamily farmers and ranchers offering to restore wetlands, or offering \nto change the way they farm to improve air and water quality continue \nto be rejected when they seek USDA conservation assistance. Producers \nare being turned away due to the Department of Agriculture's decision \nto divert over $200 million from working lands conservation programs to \npay for the cost of administering the Conservation Reserve Program, \nCRP, and the Wetlands Reserve Program, WRP, over the last 2 years. In \nparticular, USDA diverted significant funds from the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program, EQIP, the Farmland and Ranchland Protection \nProgram, FRPP, the Grasslands Reserve Program, and the Wildlife Habitat \nIncentives Program, WHIP, to pay for CRP and WRP technical assistance.\n  The 2002 farm bill clearly intended USDA to use mandatory funds from \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, to pay for conservation \ntechnical assistance. The plain language of the statute, the General \nAccounting Office, and every Member of Congress who had a hand in \nwriting the farm bill support this interpretation of the farm bill.\n  Our legislation would override USDA's decision and prevent funds from \nworking lands incentive programs like EQIP and WHIP from being used to \npay for the technical assistance costs of CRP. The House Agriculture \nSubcommittee on Conservation has already approved similar legislation, \nH.R. 1907, requiring each program to pay for its own technical \nassistance needs. Our legislation parallels that effort. Simply put our \namendment would require the administration to honor the 2002 farm bill \nand mandate that technical assistance for each program is derived from \nfunds provided for that program.\n  By providing more than $6.5 billion for working lands programs like \nEQIP and WHIP in the 2002 farm bill, Congress dramatically increased \nfunds to help farmers manage working lands to produce food and fiber \nand simultaneously enhance water quality and wildlife habitat. For \nexample, EQIP helps share the cost of a broad range of land management \npractices that help the environment, include more efficient use of \nfertilizers and pesticides, and innovative technologies to store and \nreuse animal waste. In combination, these working lands programs will \nprovide farmers the tools and incentives they need to help meet our \nmajor environmental challenges.\n  Full funding for working lands incentive programs like EQIP and WHIP \nis vital not only in helping farmers and ranchers improve their farm \nmanagement, but also in meeting America's most pressing environmental \nchallenges. Because 70 percent of the American landscape is private \nland, farming dramatically affects the health of America's rivers, \nlakes and bays and the fate of America's rare species. Most rare \nspecies depend upon private lands for the survival, and many will \nbecome extinct without help from private landowners. When farmers and \nranchers take steps to help improve air and water quality or assist \nrare species, they can face new costs, new risks, or loss of income. \nConservation programs help share these costs, underwrite these risks, \nor offset these losses of income. Unless Congress provides adequate \nresources for these programs, there is little reason to hope that our \nfarmers and ranchers will be able to help to meet these environmental \nchallenges.\n  In addition, USDA conservation programs promote regional equity in \nfarm spending. More than 90 percent of USDA spending flows to a handful \nof large farmers in 15 mid-western and southern States. As a result, \nmany farmers and ranchers who are not eligible for traditional \nsubsidies, including dairy farmers, ranchers, and fruit and vegetable \nfarmers, rely upon conservation programs to boost farm and ranch income \nand to ease the cost of environmental compliance. Unlike commodity \nsubsidies, conservation payments flow to all farmers and all regions. \nBut, the farmers and ranchers who depend upon these programs, farmers, \nand ranchers who already receive a disproportionately small share of \nUSDA funds, have faced a disproportionately large cut in spending.\n  By passing this legislation Congress and the administration will \ncorrect the shortfall in conservation technical assistance funding by \ndirecting USDA to use CCC funds to provide technical assistance to USDA \nconservation program. This legislation restores the clear intent of the \nauthors of the 2002 farm bill relating to the payment of conservation \ntechnical assistance.\n  Mr. FRIST.

I am very \ndisappointed. We have had a hugely successful session. The last 6 weeks \nand the last 3 days have been tremendously productive, but I am very \ndisappointed that we leave here today stranding about, I believe it is \n153 pending nominations that are on the Executive Calendar today. All \nof us have noted the calendar gets thicker and thicker, and it is \nbecause there are 153 nominations that are being held up.\n  For my colleagues, all of them know, but for others listening, these \nnominations have all been received from the President. The President \nhas made the nominations. All of them have gone through the committee \nprocess. All are now available for Senate consideration.\n  That is our responsibility. But now in the last few moments before we \nfinished our business--I am not going to go through the details why, I \nam not going to rehash why. But we find ourselves in a stalled position \nwith 153 nominees right here who are being obstructed. Some on the \nother side of the aisle have said they have nominations which they want \nconsidered and until that happens everybody is going to be held up. \nIndeed, that is what has happened. It is a scorched-earth-type policy \nwhich should not be tolerated. I am troubled by it. I hear such words \nas, Well, if I can't have my person or the White House is not sending \nup the person that I asked for, I am going to punish everybody. That is \nwhat has happened.\n  We have 153 people who are on the calendar who are ready and \navailable to go. Many of them have put their lives on hold. They have \ndedicated themselves to public service. They have gone all the way \nthrough the system and they came to this point--to the floor right \nhere--and they are obstructed.\n  On the calendar, ready and available to go are ambassadorships, \ncritical ambassadorships, for example, to Qatar, Estonia, they are \nrepresentatives to the United Nations who are being held up, \nnominations to the Department of Housing and Urban Development \npositions, various positions at the Environmental Protection Agency, to \nthe Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, to the Department \nof Education nominations, the Veterans Affairs Assistant Secretary \nbeing held up, and nominations to African Development being held up. \nThere are more than 25 pages of nominations being held up.\n  These are real people. These are not just names on the calendar. \nThese are real people. They have subjected themselves to the process. \nThey said, Yes, I am willing to serve, but they are being obstructed. \nMost of these nominations have gone all the way through the system \nwithout any opposition and for most there is absolutely no controversy \nwith their particular nomination. But they are being held hostage. They \nare being held hostage, I believe unreasonably, and it should not be \ntolerated. It is within a Senator's right to do that, but to me it is \njust wrong. These are people committed to public service. There is no \ncontroversy about them as individuals. They are being held hostage.\n  I understand this is not the first time we failed to act on \nnominations or the first time nominations have been held up to \nunrelated issues.\n  But I am disappointed that there are Members in this body who have \ntaken to such an extreme position--25 pages of nominations.\n  This whole concept of putting blanket holds on everybody and holding \neverybody hostage simply is not appropriate and I believe is a \ndisservice to the country. But that is what is happening. To me it is \nnot responsible. It is not legislating responsibly.\n\n[[Page S11333]]\n\n  Senators do have those individual rights, and, boy, we have seen \nindividual rights being used today and yesterday and the day before. \nThose are the rules of the Senate.\n  But again, I plea that people respect this process and be reasonable \nand allow these nominations to be considered and taken up in a way \nwhich allows us to act on these deserving people in a reasonable way--a \nway that would allow us to proceed with our constitutional duties.\n  The Senate has to approve these individuals with advice and consent. \nWe can't give advice and consent if there is this wholesale \nobstruction.\n  Again, I wanted to make sure everybody is heard in the nomination \nprocess. But the obstruction of not being able to consider them is \nunreasonable.\n  With all that said--I said I wasn't going to rehash the why's--I am \nvery disturbed by the process and disappointed by Senate colleagues.\n  With that said, we will return in November. I hope that once past the \nelection--if that is why there is this wholesale hostage holding, if \nthat is why it is, once we get past the election being settled--we will \nbe able to focus our attention on the calendar.\n  I hope we can return to the regular order and allow the Senate to act \non these nominees. These are people who believe in public service. I \nbelieve public service and their consideration of public service is a \nnoble cause. Let's not leave them on hold indefinitely. Many of them \nare listening to the fact that they will not get through to me right \nnow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11333-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              COLUMBUS DAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today is Columbus Day. When we look back on \nthe history of Columbus Day and the history in this body, it was \nOctober 12 of 1492, the sailor onboard the Pinta landed, and the next \nday Christopher Columbus and his three ships landed at the Bahamian \nIsland, ending a nearly 10-week journey across the Atlantic.\n  Today, as we have been working here all day, people have been \ncelebrating Columbus Day all over the United States. It is the day to \nhonor Christopher Columbus's sense of bravery, his curiosity, his dream \nin making that dream come true, all of which are concepts that are \nstill very much alive and well today in the spirit of Americans.\n  The first recorded celebration of Columbus Day took place on October \n12, 1792. That was to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Columbus's \nlanding. A century later, the first official celebration occurred when \nPresident Benjamin Harrison issued a proclamation urging Americans to \nmark the day. And over the next decades, the Knights of Columbus, a \nRoman Catholic fraternal order, lobbied State legislatures to declare \nOctober 12 an official holiday. Colorado was the first to so in 1907, \nfollowed by New York in 1909. The Federal Government declared Columbus \nDay an official holiday in 1971.\n  As we have been working today and as we bring things to a close, we \nsee all of the country marching in parades in our cities and towns, \ncoming together to enjoy families and friends. When I finish, I will \ncelebrate the birthday of my son, which has been put on hold until we \nadjourn, which will be shortly. It causes us to reflect a little bit \nabout dreaming, curiosity, of the bravery that took place over 500 \nyears ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11333-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SPACESHIPONE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, last week, SpaceShipOne completed its third \nsuccessful flight into space. Burt Rutan, Brian Binnie, Michael \nMelvill, and their colleagues on the Tier One Project team deserve a \nplace on the honor roll of our Nation's greatest explorers and \ninnovators. Their bravery, ingenuity, and hard work have launched the \nage of commercial space flight. I also commend the men and women who \nhad the vision to establish the Ansari X Prize. They all had dreams--\nand they, with American spirit, captured their dream.\n  America has always been on the cutting edge of space travel. We \nlanded the first people on the moon, performed the first docking in \nspace, made the first successful soft landings on Mars, and built the \nworld's first fleet of reusable spacecraft. We have explored eight of \nthe nine planets and returned a treasure trove of information about our \nmoon, asteroids, and comets.\n  As I speak, our spacecraft beam back scientific data from Mars, \nSaturn, and the orbit of our own planet. Soon, a spacecraft will begin \nto send data from Mercury and another will return from a close \nencounter with a comet.\n  Through NASA's Discovery Program, universities and research labs work \nin partnership with Washington policy makers to return valuable \ninformation about asteroids and our sun. And last, but not least, we \nhave spearheaded the 16-nation effort to build and crew the \nInternational Space Station.\n  America will continue to push the outer reaches of space exploration. \nWe will return the space shuttle to flight, finish the International \nSpace Station, continue our efforts to explore the Moon, Mars, comets, \nasteroids, and outer planets. We will also send more humans into space. \nIn doing this, we will achieve the President's goal to ``extend human \npresence across the solar system.''\n  The successful launch of SpaceShipOne shows that the private sector \ncan achieve spectacular successes. In the future, entrepreneurs will \nlaunch many of the routine spaceflight activities in low earth orbit.\n  In time, privately financed, privately directed innovators will press \nforward with the exploration of the Moon and Mars. Space offers \nextraordinary potential for commerce and adventure, for new innovations \nand new tests of will. As Americans, we can't help but reach for the \nstars. It's our nature. It's our destiny.\n  The President's Centennial Challenges program encourages the private \nsector's efforts to fulfill this dream. His program is providing \nincentives for inventors and entrepreneurs to develop less expensive \nspacecraft, improve robotic technology, and encourage future \nastronauts.\n  The President supports a vigorous role for government in exploring \nplaces beyond our planet. He believes in the promise of space \nexploration. And he believes, as I do, that, in time, private citizens \nand entrepreneurs will lead humankind to the stars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11333-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES--S. 2845\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in a moment we will be adjourning until \nNovember 16. As always, the adjournment resolution provides for both \nHouses of Congress to be called back into session if the public \ninterest shall warrant it. If it were necessary for the Senate to \nreconvene prior to this November 16 date, certainly Senators would be \ngiven ample time to make arrangements.\n  If not called back, we would reconvene on that Tuesday, November 16. \nDuring that week, the Senate will try\n\n[[Page S11334]]\n\nto finish up any remaining work prior to the official sine die \nadjournment.\n  In addition, both parties will be conducting their respective \nleadership elections in the early part of that week as well as the \norientation program for newly elected Members. Thus, the next rollcall \nvote will occur on Tuesday, November 16, around 5:15, if all debate is \nnecessary, and that vote will be on the nomination to the position of \nSecretary of the Army.\n  Again we have further business that week, including the remaining \nappropriations process. I do wish everyone a safe and hopefully restful \nfew weeks. Many of our colleagues will be campaigning across the \ncountry and most have departed and started that process now. Hopefully, \neveryone in the Chamber will have well-deserved time to spend with \nfamily and with friends. We have had, as I said again and again, a very \nproductive 6 weeks, and an unusual weekend and holiday session in order \nto complete our business.\n  I will not review the bills we passed today, but the long list of \nbills that we passed today, the business we went through very quickly \nover the last 15 or 20 minutes, again, represents substantial work, \nthousands and thousands of person-hours of work with legislation that \nis to the benefit of men and women and families all over America.\n  I thank the staff. Viewers can see us here now, but behind us are \nhundreds of people still here at this late hour. They have been here \nall day today and over the last 2 days, well into each evening. I thank \nthem. I thank the police officers who protect us every day, and I thank \nthe cloakroom staff, the doorkeepers, the legislative clerks, the \nreporters who were here throughout the weekend and today and tonight, \nespecially the pages who are with us from early every morning from the \ntime before we get here and stay until after we leave--really, \neveryone. The list goes on and on around the Capitol complex to keep \nthis place running.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I have been here a lot over the last 2 \nor 3 days and he has been here equal to me. Every time I am here, I see \nhim here as well. I thank the Presiding Officer because we have run on \nprobably about 3 hours after any Members anticipated.\n  Very important comments needed to be made and I know we have \ninconvenienced a lot of people in staying around to allow everyone to \nspeak what they felt to be important.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/11/senate-section/article/S11334-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
