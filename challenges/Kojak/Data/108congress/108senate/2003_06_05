Mr. President, I am aware that the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Carolina is going to make her maiden speech today. I haven't \nhad the opportunity to say to her privately what I will say publicly, \nand that is my fault. But I simply say that we have this big horserace \ncoming up this Saturday--the Belmont Stakes--and we talked about the \npedigree of the horses that are going to be running that race. Rarely \nin the history of the Senate has there been anyone come with a pedigree \nof the Senator from North Carolina. She not only has a distinguished \nhusband with whom we all served here in the Senate who was so direct \nand so full of humor and so full of wisdom, and a person we still miss \ntoday, but being a Senator in her own right, she has a pedigree that is \nbasically unsurpassed: A person who served as a Cabinet officer on at \nleast two separate occasions, who served in other capacities in the \nWhite House, and who was so good in her capacity as head of the \nInternational Red Cross, doing work all over the world that is still \nbeing done as a result of her leadership.\n  The Senate is certainly favored with her presence, and I look \nforward, as does all of the Senate, to hearing her maiden speech today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me also say that had Senator Dole \nnot recruited my wife to come into government, I never would have met \nher. So in addition to all of her substantial accomplishments, she also \nhas made extraordinarily good hiring decisions over the years and \nbrought outstanding\n\n[[Page S7418]]\n\npeople to Washington, and particularly outstanding women.\n  We are here today to listen to her maiden speech. She enters the \nSenate with an extraordinary record, as the Senator from Nevada has \npointed out, that goes far beyond what most of us did when we came \nhere. She has already made an important contribution to this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7418-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I first thank the majority whip, Senator \nMcConnell, and the Democrat whip, Senator Reid, for their very kind \ncomments this morning. Then I thank you, Mr. President, and other \nmembers of the leadership, for your unwavering support of this freshman \nclass.\n  I also recognize Senator Frist for the traditional courtesies of a \nmaiden speech to be extended to the new Senator and express my \nappreciation for his commitment to the rich history of this great \ntradition.\n  Tradition is held that, by waiting a respectful length of time, \nsenior colleagues would appreciate the humility shown by a new Member \nof the Senate who would use the occasion to address an issue of \nconcern.\n  I come in that sense today to share my thoughts on a matter that \nweighs heavily on my mind. Hunger is the silent enemy lurking within \ntoo many American homes. It is a tragedy I have seen firsthand and far \ntoo many times throughout my life in public service. This is not a new \nissue.\n  In 1969, while I was serving as Deputy Assistant to the President for \nConsumer Affairs, I was privileged to assist in planning the White \nHouse Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health. In opening the \nconference, President Nixon said:\n\n       Malnutrition is a national concern because we are a nation \n     that cares about its people, how they feel, how they live. We \n     care whether they are well and whether they are happy.\n\n  This still rings true today.\n  On National Hunger Awareness Day, I want to highlight what has become \na serious problem for too many families, particularly in North \nCarolina.\n  My home State is going through a painful economic transition. Once \nthriving textile mills have been shuttered. Family farms are going out \nof business. Tens of thousands of workers have been laid off from their \njobs. Entire areas of textile and furniture manufacturing are slowly \nphasing out as high-tech manufacturing and service companies become the \ndominant industry of the State. Many of these traditional manufacturing \njobs have been in rural areas where there are fewer jobs and residents \nwho are already struggling to make ends meet.\n  In 1999, North Carolina had the 12th lowest unemployment rate in the \nUnited States. By December 2001, the State had fallen to 46--from 12 to \n46. That same year, according to the Rural Center, North Carolina \ncompanies announced 63,222 layoffs. Our State lost more manufacturing \njobs between 1997 and the year 2000 than any State except New York.\n  Entire communities have been uprooted by this crisis. In the town of \nSpruce Pine in Mitchell County, 30 percent--30 percent--of the town's \nresidents lost their jobs in the year 2001. Ninety percent of those \nlayoffs were in textile and furniture manufacturing. These are real \nnumbers and real lives from a State that is hurting.\n  Our families are struggling to find jobs, to pay their bills, and, as \nwe hear more and more often, to even put food on the table. In fact, \nthe unemployment trend that started in 1999 resulted in 11.1 percent of \nNorth Carolina families not always having enough food to meet their \nbasic needs. That is according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \nAnd North Carolina's rate is higher than the national average. This \nmeans that among North Carolina's 8.2 million residents, nearly 900,000 \nare dealing with hunger. Some are hungry, others are on the verge.\n  My office was blessed recently to meet a young veteran, Michael \nWilliams, and his family. Michael served his country for 8 years in the \nU.S. Army before leaving to work in private industry and use the \ncomputer skills he had gained while serving in the military. He was \nearning a good living, but after September 11 and the terrorist \nattacks, he and his wife Gloria felt it was time to move their two \nchildren closer to family back home in North Carolina. As he said, ``It \nwas time to bring the grandbabies home.''\n  But Michael has found a shortage of jobs since his return. He worked \nwith a temp agency but that job ended. It has been so hard to make ends \nmeet that the family goes to a food bank near their Clayton, NC, home \ntwice a month because with rent, utilities, and other bills, there is \nlittle left to buy food.\n  Their story is not unlike so many others. Hard-working families are \nworrying each day about how to feed their children. As if this were not \nenough, our food banks are having a hard time finding food to feed \nthese families. In some instances, financial donations have dropped off \nor corporations have scaled back on food donations. In other cases, \nthere are just too many people and not enough food.\n  At the Food Bank of the Albemarle in northeast North Carolina, \nexecutive director Gus Smith says more people are visiting this food \nbank even as donations are off by 25 percent. Thus Gus says, ``We just \ncan't help everybody at this point in time.'' To try to cope, they \nrecently moved to a 4-day workweek, meaning the entire staff had to \ntake a 20-percent pay cut just to keep the doors open.\n  America's Second Harvest, a network of 216 food banks across the \ncountry, reports it saw the number of people seeking emergency hunger \nrelief rise by 9 percent in the year 2001 to 23.3 million people. In \nany given week, it is estimated that 7 million people are served at \nemergency feeding sites around the country.\n  These numbers are troubling indeed. No family--in North Carolina or \nanywhere in America--should have to worry about where they will find \nfood to eat. No parent should have to tell their child there is no \nmoney left for groceries. This is simply unacceptable.\n  I spent most of the congressional Easter recess going to different \nsites in North Carolina: homeless and hunger shelters, food \ndistribution sites, soup kitchens, farms, even an office where I went \nthrough the process of applying for Government assistance through the \nWIC Program, the Women, Infants, and Children Program.\n  I was also able to meet, on several occasions, with a group known as \nthe Society of Saint Andrew. This organization, like some others across \nthe country, is doing impressive work in the area of gleaning. That is \nwhen excess crops, that would otherwise be thrown out, are taken from \nfarms, packing houses, and warehouses, and distributed to the needy.\n\n  Gleaning immediately brings to my mind the Book of Ruth in the Old \nTestament. She gleaned in the fields so that her family could eat. You \nsee, Mr. President, in Biblical times farmers were encouraged to leave \ncrops in their fields for the poor and the travelers. Even as far back \nas in Leviticus, Chapter 19, in the Old Testament, we read the words:\n\n       And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou \n     gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shall leave them for \n     the poor and the stranger.\n\n  So gleaning was long a custom in Biblical days, a command by God to \nhelp those in need. It is a practice we should utilize much more \nextensively today. It is astounding that the most recent figures \navailable indicate that approximately 96 billion pounds of good, \nnutritious food, including that at the farm and retail levels, is left \nover or thrown away in this country.\n  It is estimated that only 6 percent of crops are actually gleaned in \nNorth Carolina. A tomato farmer in North Carolina sends 20,000 pounds \nof tomatoes to landfills each day during harvest season.\n\n[[Page S7419]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to present an example of \nproduce on the Senate floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Sometimes the produce cannot be sold. Sometimes it is \nunderweight or not a perfect shape, like this sweet potato I show you \nin my hand. This would be rejected because it is not the exact \nspecification. Other times it is simply surplus food, more than the \ngrocery stores can handle, but it is still perfectly good to eat.\n  Imagine the expense to that farmer in dumping 20,000 pounds of \ntomatoes each day during his harvest season. And this cannot be good \nfor the environment. In fact, food is the single largest component of \nour solid waste stream--more than yard trimmings or even newspapers. \nSome of it does decompose, but it often takes several years. Other food \njust sits in landfills, literally mummified. Putting this food to good \nuse, through gleaning, will reduce the amount of waste going to our \nalready overburdened landfills.\n  I am so appreciative of my friends at the Environmental Defense Fund \nfor working closely with me on this issue. Gleaning also helps the \nfarmer because he does not have to haul off and plow under crops that \ndo not meet exact specifications of grocery chains, and it certainly \nhelps the hungry, by giving them not just any food but food that is \nboth nutritious and fresh.\n  The Society of Saint Andrew is the only comprehensive program in \nNorth Carolina that gleans available produce and then sorts, packages, \nprocesses, transports, and delivers excess food to feed the hungry.\n  In the year 2001, the organization gleaned 9.7 million pounds--almost \n10 million pounds--or 29.1 million servings of food. It only costs a \npenny--1 penny--a serving to glean and deliver this food to those in \nneed. Even more amazing, the Society of Saint Andrew does all this with \na tiny staff and an amazing 9,200 volunteers.\n\n  These are the types of innovative ideas we should be exploring. I \nhave been told by the Society of Saint Andrew that $100,000 would \nprovide at least 10 million servings of food for hungry North \nCarolinians.\n  I set out to raise that money for the Society in the last few weeks, \nand thanks to the compassion of a number of caring individuals, \ncompanies, and organizations, we were able to surpass our goal and \nraise $180,000--enough for over 18 million servings of food. More than \never, I believe this is a worthy effort that can be used as a model \nnationwide.\n  I am passionate about leading an effort to increase gleaning in North \nCarolina and across America. The gleaning system works because of the \ncooperative efforts of so many groups, from the Society of Saint Andrew \nand its volunteers who gather and deliver the food, to the dozens of \nchurches and humanitarian organizations that help distribute this food \nto the hungry. Indeed, gleaning is, at its best, a public-private \npartnership.\n  Private organizations are doing a great job with limited resources. \nBut we must make some changes on the public side to help them leverage \ntheir scarce dollars to feed the hungry. I have heard repeatedly that \nthe single biggest concern for gleaners is transportation. The food is \nthere. The issue is how to transport it in larger volume.\n  I want to change the Tax Code to give transportation companies that \nvolunteer trucks for gleaned food a tax incentive. And there are other \nneeded tax changes. Currently, only large publicly traded corporations \ncan take tax credits for giving food to these gleaning programs. But it \nis not just large corporations that provide this food; it is the family \nfarmers and the small businesses. Why should a farmer who gives up his \nperfectly good produce or the small restaurant owner who gives food to \nthe hungry not receive the same tax benefits? The Senate has already \npassed legislation as part of the CARE Act that would fix this \ninequity. Now the House of Representatives needs to complete work on \nthis bill.\n  However, but the answer to the hunger problem does not stop with \ngleaning. That is just part of the overall effort. There are other ways \nwe can help, too.\n  This year, we will be renewing the National School Lunch Program and \nother important child nutrition programs, and there are some areas I am \ninterested in reviewing.\n  Under School Lunch, children from families with incomes at or below \n130 percent of poverty are eligible for free meals. Children from \nfamilies with incomes between 130 percent and 185 percent of poverty \ncan be charged no more than 40 cents. This may seem to be a nominal \namount, but for a struggling family with several children the costs add \nup. School administrators in North Carolina tell me that they hear from \nparents in tears because they don't know how to pay for their child's \nschool meals.\n  The Federal Government now considers incomes up to 185 percent of \npoverty when deciding if a family is eligible for benefits under the \nWIC program. Should we not use the same standard for School Lunch? \nStandardizing the guidelines would even allow us to immediately certify \nchildren from WIC families for the School Lunch Program. It is time to \nclarify this bureaucratic situation and harmonize our Federal income \nassistance guidelines so we can help those most in need.\n  The School Lunch Program is the final component of our commitment to \nchild nutrition, and we must do everything to maintain and strengthen \nits integrity so that it works for those who need it and isn't viewed \nas a Government giveaway.\n  There are a lot of interesting ideas being discussed such as \nadjusting area eligibility guidelines in the Summer Food Program. But \nthese need to be looked at carefully, and we need to ask important \nquestions such as how many people would be affected and what is the \ncost. I have discussed many of these ideas with groups such as \nAmerica's Second Harvest, Bread for the World, the Food Research and \nAction Center, and the American School Food Service Association. I look \nforward to the opportunity of exploring them further during \nreauthorization of these important programs in the Agriculture \nCommittee, on which I am honored to serve.\n  Our work cannot stop within our own borders. The Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations says hunger affects millions \nworldwide. During my 8 years as president of the American Red Cross, I \nvisited Somalia during the heart-wrenching famine. In Mojada, I came \nacross a little boy under a sack. I thought he was dead. His brother \npulled back that sack and sat him up and he was severely malnourished. \nHe couldn't eat the rice and beans in the bowl beside him; he was too \nmalnourished. I asked for camel's milk to feed him.\n  As I put my arm around his back and lifted that cup to his mouth, it \nwas almost as if little bones were piercing through his flesh. I will \nnever forget that. That is when the horror of starvation becomes real, \nwhen you can touch it.\n  There are many things that will haunt me the rest of my life. When I \nvisited Goma, Zaire, which is now Congo, this was a place where \nmillions of Rwandans had fled the bloodshed in their own country but \nthey stopped at the worst possible place, on volcanic rock. You \ncouldn't drill for latrines so cholera and dysentery were rampant. You \ncouldn't dig for graves, so I was literally stepping over dead bodies \nas I tried to help those refugees. Those bodies were carried to the \nroadside twice a day. They were hauled off to mass graves.\n  Former Senators Bob Dole and George McGovern are the architects of \nthe Global Food Program, which has a goal of ensuring that 300 million \nschoolchildren overseas get at least one nutritious meal a day. The \nDepartment of Agriculture estimates that 120 million schoolage \nchildren around the world are not enrolled in school in part because of \nhunger or malnutrition. The majority of these children are girls. The \nGlobal Food for Education Program is now operating in 38 countries and \nfeeding 9 million schoolchildren.\n\n  I want to see this program expanded. I plan to work on Appropriations \nto advance that goal. Just helping a child get a good meal can make \nsuch a difference in developing countries. Feeding children entices \nthem to come to school which allows them to learn, to have some hope, \nsome future. And improved literacy certainly helps the productivity, \nthereby boosting the economy.\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n\n  This problem deserves national discussion. Hunger affects so many \naspects of our society. In the spirit of that landmark conference held \nby the White House in 1969, I am asking President Bush to convene a \nsecond White House conference so that the best and brightest minds can \nreview these problems together.\n  I am honored to work with leaders of the battle to eradicate hunger: \nFormer Congressman Tony Hall, now the United States Ambassador to the \nU.N. food and agricultural programs, and former Congresswoman Eva \nClayton from my own State of North Carolina, now an assistant director \ngeneral for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. Both \nwere champions on hunger while in Congress. And there are many others. \nFormer Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, a leader on gleaning; \nCatherine Bertini, Under Secretary General of the United Nations who \nwas praised for her leadership to get food aid to those in need \nthroughout the world; Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson, cochair of the \nCongressional Hunger Center who carries on the legacy of her late \nhusband Bill who was a dear friend and leader on this issue.\n  Here in this body, my chairman on the Agriculture Committee, Thad \nCochran, and ranking member Tom Harkin, Dick Lugar, Patrick Leahy, Pat \nRoberts, and Gordon Smith are leaders in addressing hunger issues.\n  Partisan politics has no role in this fight. Hunger does not \ndifferentiate between Democrats and Republicans. Just as it stretches \nacross so many ethnicities, so many areas, so must we.\n  As Washington Post columnist David Broder wrote yesterday: America \nhas some problems that defy solution. This one does not. It just needs \ncaring people and a caring government working together.\n  I get inspiration from the Bible and John, chapter 21, when Jesus \nasked Peter: Do you love me? Peter, astounded that Jesus was asking him \nthis question again, says: Lord, you know everything. You know that I \nlove you. And Jesus replies: Then feed my sheep.\n  One of North Carolina's heroes, the Reverend Billy Graham, has often \nsaid that we are not cisterns made for hoarding; we are vessels made \nfor sharing. I look forward to working with Billy Graham in this \neffort. Indeed every religion, not just Christianity, calls on us to \nfeed the hungry. Jewish tradition promises that feeding the hungry will \nnot go unrewarded. Fasting is one of the pillars of faith of Islam and \nis a way to share the conditions of the hungry poor while purifying the \nspirit and humbling the flesh. Compassion or karuna is one of the key \nvirtues of Buddhism. This issue cuts across religious lines, too.\n  I speak today on behalf of the millions of families who are \nvulnerable, who have no voice, for this little Sudanese girl in this \npicture, stumbling toward a feeding station and so many like her. I saw \nthis picture some years ago in a newspaper. It broke my heart. I went \nback to find that picture today because, as I recall the story, she had \nbeen walking for a long, long way and she had not yet reached that \nfeeding station. That has been emblazoned on my mind since that time.\n\n  Anthropologist Margaret Meade said: Never doubt that a small group of \nthoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the \nonly thing that ever has.\n  One of my heroes is William Wilberforce, a true man of God. An old \nfriend John Newton persuaded him that his political life could be used \nin the service of God. He worked with a dedicated group. They were \ncommitted people of faith. His life and career were centered on two \ngoals: abolishing slavery in England and improving moral values. He \nknew that his commitment might cost him friends and influence but he \nwas determined to stand for what he believed was right. It took 21 \nyears and Wilberforce sacrificed his opportunity to serve as Prime \nMinister. But he was the moving force in abolishing slavery and \nchanging the moral values of England.\n  In my lifetime, I have seen Americans split the atom, abolish Jim \nCrow, eliminate the scourge of polio, win the cold war, plant our flag \non the surface of the Moon, map the human genetic code, and belatedly \nrecognize the talents of women, minorities, the disabled, and others \nonce relegated to the shadows. Already a large group of citizens has \njoined what I believe will become an army of volunteers and advocates.\n  Today I invite all of my colleagues to join me in this endeavor. Let \nus recommit ourselves to the goal of eradicating hunger. Committed \nindividuals can make a world of difference, even, I might say, a \ndifferent world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to President \nBush be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 2003.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The White House Conference on Food, \n     Nutrition and Health, convened by President Richard Nixon on \n     December 2, 1969, may well have been one of the country's \n     most productive and far-reaching White House conferences. At \n     the time, President Nixon said that the conference was \n     ``intended to focus national attention and resources on our \n     country's remaining--and changing--nutrition problems.'' In \n     hindsight, it achieved that and more.\n       So much has been accomplished since that historic White \n     House conference. With bipartisan support in Congress, the \n     food stamp program has been reformed and expanded, school \n     nutrition programs have been improved and now reach over 27 \n     million children each school day, WIC was created, and \n     nutrition labels now appear on most food items.\n       At the same time, however, the mission is not complete. \n     There are children who qualify for reduced price meals in \n     North Carolina, and throughout the country, but their \n     families cannot afford even this nominal fee. And while 16 \n     million children participate in the free and reduced school \n     lunch program, in the summer many children go without. \n     America's Second Harvest, an extraordinary organization, \n     reports that demand often exceeds the supply of food in local \n     communities. Further, the country is challenged by the \n     paradox of hunger and obesity.\n       Mr. President, it is time, I believe, for another White \n     House conference to assess the progress we have made in the \n     fight against hunger and to recommit the country to the \n     remaining challenges. I was pleased to work with President \n     Nixon on the 1969 conference; I would be honored to work with \n     you on a second historic conference.\n       There is a very special tradition in America when it comes \n     to fighting hunger. Perhaps it is a function of our \n     agricultural bounty, the famines in Europe that led to early \n     migration, or the teachings of all major religions, but \n     Americans are intolerant of hunger in our land of plenty.\n       Mr. President, I hope you will convene a second White House \n     conference with the business, civic and charitable \n     organizations, educators and advocates who continue to work \n     tirelessly to address hunger in America and around the world. \n     Hunger is not a partisan issue and I know that we can work \n     together, with our colleagues on both sides of the political \n     aisle, to address the problems and needs that still exist. \n     Thank you very much for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Elizabeth Dole.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 5 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, the President visited with \ntroops overseas to thank them. I want those troops to know we are \npaying attention to their families at home.\n  Last week, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Children and Families, \nI held a hearing at Fort Campbell in\n\n[[Page S7421]]\n\nTennessee and Kentucky to look at the issues faced by military parents \nraising children. Senator Chambliss did the same in Georgia, and \nSenators Dodd and Ben Nelson will do the same in their respective home \nStates of Connecticut and Nebraska.\n  Later this month, we will have a joint hearing in Washington of the \nSubcommittee on Children and Families, which I chair, and the \nSubcommittee on Personnel of the Armed Services Committee, which \nSenator Chambliss chairs. Senators Dodd and Nelson are the ranking \nDemocrats. That joint hearing is to focus on military families raising \nchildren.\n  Our military has dropped from 3 million to 1.4 million, so we have \nfewer people in the Armed Services, but we have more missions; we have \nfewer soldiers; we have more women as a part of the military; we have \nmore military spouses working; we have longer deployments; we have more \nmilitary children. As a result, we need to be thinking about the \nfamilies at home as we think about the warriors overseas. I wanted the \nfull Senate to know that four Senators and two subcommittees are \naddressing these issues.\n  I think that makes it even more important that the leadership on the \nRepublican and Democratic sides find a way to fix the problem that \noccurred with the child tax credit in the recently enacted Tax Bill.\n  President Bush had recommended that we increase from $600 to $1,000 \nthe child tax credit to help parents raising children, including \nfamilies that make $10,500 to $26,625. Refundability for these lower \nincome families is to be increased from 10 to 15 percent in 2005 under \nthe 2001 Tax Bill. The full Senate voted for that to be accelerated to \n2003 and 2004 when it passed its version of the Tax Bill. In the final \nversion of the Tax Bill, those between $10,500 and $26,625 were left \nout. Some of those families left out of the Tax Bill are serving in our \nmilitary.\n  It was not the intention of the Senate to do that, I don't believe. I \ndoubt if most Members of the House want that result. That is why on \nTuesday I cosponsored Senator Grassley's bill to fix the problem, and I \nam prepared to vote for any reasonable proposal in the Senate that the \nleadership can negotiate in the next few days to make it clear that our \nSenate and our Congress put a priority on parents raising children.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7421-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfurther reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To promote the use of cellulosic biomass ethanol derived from \n                         agricultural residue)\n\n       On page 8, strike lines 16 through 19 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(4) Cellulosic biomass ethanol.--For the purpose of \n     paragraph (2), 1 gallon of cellulosic biomass ethanol--\n       ``(A) shall be considered to be the equivalent of 1.5 \n     gallons of renewable fuel; or\n       ``(B) if the cellulosic biomass is derived from \n     agricultural residue, shall be considered to be the \n     equivalent of 2.5 gallons of renewable fuel.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very delighted to offer this \namendment on behalf of myself, Senator Lugar, and Senator Cantwell. I \nthink it is quite a pro-ethanol amendment because what we are trying to \ndo here is encourage the development of ethanol that is produced from \nagricultural residues.\n  This amendment will, in fact, promote the production of agricultural \nresidue ethanol. I want to tell my colleagues why this is important. I \nbelieve that biomass ethanol derived from agricultural residue could be \na significant source of ethanol in California and also throughout the \nUnited States. Every State has agricultural waste, including those \nproducing corn.\n  I hope my colleagues who have the production of corn, wheat, \nsugarcane, rice, barley, beets, or oats in their States will realize \nthis amendment is very important to them. I also believe the use of \nagricultural residue ethanol will make it easier for many of our \nStates--certainly for California--to meet an ethanol mandate without \nprice spikes and gasoline shortages as it increases the flexibility \nthat the country has to meet this mandate.\n  What is agricultural residue ethanol? I am sure if people are \nwatching, they are thinking: This cannot be interesting. To me, it is \nvery interesting because it is fuel made from the fibrous portion of \nplants, as is ethanol, but it differs from conventional ethanol in the \nfollowing significant ways.\n  First, the manufacturing process does not consume fossil fuels but \nrather uses plant byproducts and waste to create the energy to run the \nprocess. So, in a time in our history when we are trying to lessen our \ndependence on fossil fuel, I think this amendment is quite an important \nstatement for us to make. I am very proud that Senator Lugar agrees \nbecause he is someone with much experience in this area.\n  Second, the raw material does not compete as a food source for humans \nand is available today based on existing farm practices.\n  Third, it uses existing waste products, thus decreasing disposal \nneeds.\n  Ethanol made from agricultural residue, such as rice, wheat straw, \nand sugarcane waste, can be locally produced and does not require that \ncorn and other commodities be grown just to make ethanol.\n  What we are talking about is using the residue, not growing food just \nto produce ethanol at a time when we are throwing food away because we \nhave an overabundance in many of these areas. And, then we have been \nvery energy inefficient by using the fossil fuel to develop the \nethanol. What we are saying is the waste of agricultural materials is \ngoing to be put to good use.\n  Is this a pie-in-the-sky idea? No, it is not. In 1999, Sacramento \nValley produced enough rice straw waste--500,000 tons of which is \nburned in the field--to\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\nproduce 100 million gallons of agricultural residue ethanol.\n  By putting these agricultural wastes to good use, converting them \ninto energy resources, agricultural ethanol residue production reduces \nlandfill disposal and open-air burning. We are using the waste we \notherwise would dispose of either by burning, which dirties the air, or \nthrowing it into a landfill. This will improve air quality and water \nquality.\n  Further, agricultural residue ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by \nmore than 90 percent compared to gasoline. I reiterate, agricultural \nresidue ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by more than 90 percent \ncompared to gasoline. And it also creates markets for unused \nagricultural products that are generally expensive to dispose of. \nAgricultural residue ethanol can give our farmers and our rural \ncommunities enhanced economic security.\n  We clearly know that as a new technology, agricultural residue \nethanol faces an uphill struggle to break into the ethanol market.\n  Right now we know, when we look at the marketplace, that there is \nmuch room to grow here if we look at the numbers. We only have a very \nsmall number of gallons that are being derived from anything other than \ncorn. So we have a chance. This, again, is not a pie-in-the-sky idea.\n\n  Currently, the only commercial facility is the Iogen facility in \nCanada which converts wheat straw into fermentable sugar and the sugar \ninto bioethanol. Iogen Corporation's goal is to produce 180,000 gallons \nof ethanol annually. I believe we should promote these types of \nfacilities in the United States of America. Our amendment, I believe, \nwill ensure this.\n  We provide in our amendment more incentives for this type of \nagricultural residue ethanol production in the United States of \nAmerica. As this mandate hits my State of California, and other States, \nwhere they have to spend a lot of money to bring that ethanol into to \nthe State, it is going to be very cost competitive to import this type \nof ethanol from Canada. Why do we want to do that when we have the \nability, if we have wheat, corn, beets, oats, barley, or rice, to name \na few? We can do this in our country, and we can have a whole new \nindustry. We can make ethanol more affordable to those of us who live \nin States far away from the Midwest.\n  In the underlying bill, there is a 1.5-gallon credit for numerous \ntypes of biomass ethanol. This means that a gallon of biomass ethanol \ncounts as 1.5 gallons in meeting the bill's mandate. So there is a \nlittle incentive to use biomass ethanol, and I am very proud of that \nbecause we worked hard on that issue in our committee.\n  What we want to do, it seems to me, is increase that credit to 2.5 \ngallons if the ethanol is made from agricultural residues. The fact is \nthat agricultural residues provide us with an amazing opportunity and a \npromising opportunity to produce ethanol that has the potential of \nproviding many economic and environmental benefits.\n  We are very pleased to offer this amendment. Right now, up to this \npoint, we have seen amendments that people have viewed as anti-ethanol. \nThis is an amendment that should bring us together. It should unite us \nbecause there are so many other crops that could be used--and, by the \nway, are going to be used--but we want to incentivize those \nagricultural crops.\n  That is what our amendment does. Senator Lugar, Senator Cantwell, and \nI are very pleased to offer this amendment. We are very hopeful it will \nbe adopted. We are very hopeful we will not have opposition.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor. \nI also suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada does not control the \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call \nI will call for shortly be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the quorum call will be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from \nCalifornia who has just offered an amendment which expands the \nsubstances that can be used for ethanol conversion. I am willing to \naccept the amendment. I favor the amendment. I understand the \ndistinguished minority manager would like to speak on the subject at \nthis point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nCalifornia on this amendment. It substantially improves this portion of \nthe bill and does provide additional opportunity for developing ethanol \nfrom these other sources. It is good environmental policy. It is good \nenergy policy. I very much support the amendment.\n  As I understand it, most of those people who looked at this agreed to \nit. I agree with my colleague from New Mexico that this is an amendment \nwe should agree to unanimously in the Senate and we should maintain it \nin conference, insisting on it in our discussions with the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I cannot thank enough both of my \ncolleagues, my friends, from New Mexico, Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman.\n  I want to make sure Senators understand exactly what we do. We \nincrease the credit to 2.5 gallons if the ethanol is made from \nagricultural residue. It is giving an incentive to our farmers who \nproduce rice, wheat, barley, oats, sugar beets, and others, an \nincentive to use the waste.\n  I was going to have a rollcall vote on this, but given the assurances \nof Senators Domenici and Bingaman, who have stated very clearly and \nhave told me they will not drop this amendment in conference--can I \nrely on that commitment? I ask both my friends one more time.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I say to the Senator, I will do my very best. I \nindicated that to you and I will do my very best. I make that \ncommitment to you.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You will do your very best?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Meaning you will not drop it in conference, which is what \nyou told me?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And my other friend, my ranking member, has made the same \npledge?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me respond, to the extent I am persuasive in the \nconference, I will commit to keeping this provision in the law.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I see the Democratic leader is on the Senate floor. It \nwould be a wonderful thing if he could speak out on this amendment as \nwell. We have both Senators from New Mexico, and Senator Lugar. I am \ntrying not to put the Senate through a rollcall vote. If I have these \nstrong commitments, it will make me feel a lot better about it. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first let me thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for her efforts to improve upon this legislation. I have \nindicated to her privately that I support the amendment. I would \nsupport it if there were a rollcall vote.\n  The fact that Dick Lugar, the initial cosponsor of this legislation \nwhen we introduced it several years ago, is a proud sponsor of this \namendment is some indication of the degree to which the ethanol \ncommunity and those of us who support this proposal would be supporting \nher amendment.\n  As my colleagues from New Mexico, both the chairman and the ranking \nmember, have noted, there is no reason, when we get into conference, \nthis\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\nshould not remain intact as part of the Energy bill.\n  It is a good amendment. It provides even more opportunities to meet \nthe targets set out in this legislation.\n  So I would do all I could as Democratic leader to ensure that at the \nend of the day, when this legislation comes back in the form of a \nconference report, we will continue to see the Boxer amendment \nintegrally a part of the bill itself and a part of this amendment.\n  Again, let me congratulate her, thank her, and indicate I will be \nvery supportive.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle. I know he is \nworking endless hours to get this amendment finished. I think this \nenhances the amendment, I really do. I am very grateful.\n  Before I ask for a voice vote, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 8 minutes remaining to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 6 minutes to my colleague from Washington, \nSenator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for \nher hard work on this amendment. I am glad to join Senator Lugar and \nSenator Boxer as a cosponsor of this amendment. Senator Boxer has spent \nan invaluable amount of time on the whole ethanol debate, but I think \nthe amendment she offers this morning goes a long way in adding \ndiversity and efficiency to our ethanol plan. It seems my colleagues \nare enthusiastic about supporting this in the overall energy package.\n  I rise to support the Boxer-Lugar-Cantwell amendment. As we have \nheard, this amendment would increase from 1.5 gallons to 2.5 gallons \nthe credit available to refiners who choose to use ethanol derived from \ncertain types of biomass to meet the requirement of our renewable fuels \nstandard. Senator Boxer did an excellent job, giving us all a lesson in \nbiomass 101 as it relates to ethanol and the products that could be \nused as part of this biomass requirement.\n  This amendment ensures that as we strive to reduce our reliance on \nforeign oil, displacing it with home-grown products that provide both \nenvironmental benefits and economic stimulus to our nation's rural \ncommunities, we also develop the renewable fuels diversity that is the \nhallmark of what I think is a good energy policy.\n  My colleagues may have been told this, or they may learn it now for \nthe first time, but it was in 1925 that Henry Ford told the New York \nTimes that ethanol was ``the fuel of the future.'' But while 90 percent \nof the ethanol produced in this Nation today was derived from corn, \nHenry Ford's vision was much broader. He said:\n\n       The fuel of the future is going to come from apples, weeds \n     and sawdust--almost anything. There is fuel in every bit of \n     vegetable matter that can be fermented.\n\n  That is what he told the Times back in that period.\n  This amendment attempts to move forward on that vision. I believe it \nis logical, and I believe Senator Boxer and Senator Lugar are right on \ntarget in providing leadership on this issue.\n  While today the ethanol that is derived from corn more or less \ndominates the renewable fuels market, this is not the circumstance for \nevery State in our country. The State of Washington, for example, is \nmuch more a producer of wheat, which would hold significant promise as \na potential source for the biomass ethanol.\n  Despite the promise of these alternatives, the technology for \nproducing ethanol from these sources such as wheat and straw and other \nagricultural products has lagged behind for a number of reasons. Yet by \nproviding appropriate incentives today with this amendment, and \npromoting research and development, we can move this forward on a cost-\ncompetitive basis.\n  The Boxer-Lugar-Cantwell amendment would increase the renewable fuels \nstandard credit for one specific type of material, the agricultural \nresidues such as wheat or rice or straw, from that 1.5 to 2.5, \nreflecting what is really a recent DOE analysis on what we should \nachieve.\n  So moving forward on these incentives for development of ethanol \nproduction is simply a matter of good public policy. I say this for \nfour or five reasons.\n  We get the environmental benefits from this, we get the potential \nenergy gains, we get the long-term cost impacts of having fuel \ndiversity, and, of course, we get the spread of economic benefits to \nall of our Nation's agricultural communities.\n  In our State of Washington, there is much going on in this area. \nThere are many farmers who have come together in a variety of ways to \njoin in thinking about ethanol production. With the construction of one \n40-million-gallon plant, the State of Washington could become entirely \nethanol self-sufficient. According to a study conducted by our State \nuniversity, such a plan would have a significant economic impact, \nparticularly in our rural communities in the eastern part of \nWashington.\n  A single 40-million-gallon production plant could create 104 direct \njobs and about 300 indirect jobs. Local communities could see an \neconomic benefit, according to the study, of about $19 million per year \nwith a statewide benefit of somewhere between $20 million and $30 \nmillion per year. With the construction of these various plants, \nWashington State could reach self-sufficiency and could, under the \nfuels standard proposal here today, become a supplier to other Western \nStates.\n  The State of Washington and agricultural communities want to help \nmeet the renewable fuels standard. They want to join with Senators \nFrist and Daschle in their proposal. But we don't have the corn or the \nabundance to make that happen. So we want to see this diversity. In \nfact, a recent Washington State University extension program concluded \nthat we could produce 200 million gallons per year in ethanol if we had \nimprovement in technologies and diversification of resources.\n  In conclusion, to help this become reality, a broad coalition of \nWashington agricultural and environmentalist interests have banded \ntogether. They helped pass this package in our State legislature with a \nvariety of tax incentives and broad production of biofuels. These bills \nwere signed by our Governor last month and they have our State moving \nforward on this agenda.\n  The Boxer-Lugar-Cantwell amendment adds a Federal dimension to these \nefforts. This provision reflects good public policy from the Federal \nGovernment and good energy policy, and helps those States that are \nfurther away from ethanol diversity to participate in our national \nenergy goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a couple of minutes remaining. I \nknow we are going to set our amendment aside.\n  I wanted to close this debate again by thanking Senator Lugar for his \nleadership, Senator Cantwell for her leadership, and both Senators from \nNew Mexico as well as Senator Daschle for their help.\n  I think any Senator who has corn in their State, wheat in their \nState, sugarcane in their State, rice, barley, beets, oats, apples, or \nany fructose-rich product is going to be very happy with this \namendment.\n  In order to use the agricultural residue and make it into ethanol, it \nis going to require a little incentive. Although the underlying bill \nhas a slight incentive, experts tell us it is not enough to really move \nforward on this very good way to make ethanol. I think it will really \nhelp those States that are far away from the Midwest.\n  By the way, it does not hurt any State because corn will still be \nused.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues very much.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to setting it aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 856 to Amendment No. 850\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n     Jeffords, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     856 to amendment No. 850.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for equal liability treatment of vehicle fuels and \n                            fuel additives)\n\n       Beginning on page 18, strike line 16 and all that follows \n     through page 19, line 17, and insert the following:\n       ``(p) Renewable Fuels Safe Harbor.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of Federal or State law, a renewable fuel \n     used or intended to be used as a motor vehicle fuel, or any \n     motor vehicle fuel containing renewable fuel, shall be \n     subject to liability standards that are not less protective \n     of human health, welfare, and the environment than any other \n     motor vehicle fuel or fuel additive.''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think for anyone in this Chamber who \ncares about the health and safety of people--I know that is every one \nof us--this amendment is very important.\n  A waiver of liability is in this underlying bill for renewable fuels. \nMy amendment to the renewable fuels portion of this Energy bill will \nensure that all motor vehicle fuels and fuel additives are held to the \nsame liability standards by striking the safe harbor and adding the \nfollowing language. This is the language of my amendment:\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, a \nrenewable fuel used or intended to be used as a motor vehicle fuel, or \nany motor vehicle fuel containing renewable fuel, shall be subject to \nliability standards that are not less protective of human health, \nwelfare, and the environment than any other motor vehicle fuel or fuel \nadditive.\n  Is this not a fair idea? As we go into this whole new production of \nethanol, be it derived from corn or be it derived from agricultural \nresidues or municipal waste or wherever we wind up getting it, \nrenewable fuel should be subject to the same liability standards as any \nother motor vehicle fuel.\n  We have expenses in this area--where we have added MTBE, for example, \nto fuel. We found out later it was very dangerous. It hurt a lot of our \ncommunities. I will get into that later.\n  The safe harbor language in this underlying bill waives all product \nliability design defect claims, including the failure to warn the \npeople. Any claim that has not been filed by the date of enactment of \nthis section will be forever barred.\n  We should not be doing this. We don't know all the impacts of what we \nare doing today. Why would we give a safe harbor to ethanol or various \nrefiners of ethanol?\n  I have to say to those who will oppose me--and there will be many, \nand I know that, and I accept that--if ethanol is so safe--I pray it \nis; maybe it is, by the way--if it is so safe, why have the companies \ninvolved in its production transferred this liability provision in the \nbill? I think anytime someone says my product is 100 percent safe, but \ngive me a waiver from liability, protect me from a lawsuit if something \nhappens--you have to say who wins and who loses in this situation. \nRequests for this kind of special interest free pass require a very \nclose look. And I hope we will take a look.\n  The interests behind this bill have gotten a loophole that eliminates \na big chunk of the liability they would have under the law if they \ndamaged the public health or the environment. The exemption language in \nthe bill raises a red flag right away. It begins:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or state \n     law. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, you and I have been around here long enough to know \nthat when we start off with ``notwithstanding any other provision of \nFederal law,'' the public is going to be losing rights.\n  The bill goes on to say that ``Renewable fuel--ethanol cannot be \nfound to be defectively designed or manufactured.''\n  Imagine, the bill says ``Renewable fuels cannot be found to be \ndefectively designed or manufactured.''\n  Compliance with laws and regulations is not necessary for getting the \nliability waiver. There is only a limited compliance requirement under \nthe Clean Air Act.\n  Again, we all pray and hope that there will be no danger from \nwidespread use of ethanol. The liability exemption, however, is \ndangerous because there are many unanswered questions about ethanol. We \nknow there are real benefits to it, such as fewer carbon monoxide and \ntoxic air emissions, but there are questions about adverse effects.\n  According to EPA's ``1999 Blue Ribbon Panel Report on Oxygenates in \nGasoline,'' ethanol is extremely soluble in water and would spread into \nthe environment. It may further spread plumes of benzene, toluene, \nethyl benzene, and xylene because ethanol may inhibit the breakdown of \nthese toxic materials.\n\n  This isn't Senator Boxer talking. This isn't the people who want this \namendment talking. This isn't environmental groups talking. This isn't \nthe American Lung Association talking or anybody else. This is EPA's \n1999 Blue Ribbon Panel Report on Oxygenates in Gasoline.\n  Studies demonstrate that ethanol increases the size and migration of \nbenzene plumes. Researchers say more ground water wells will experience \ncontamination from MTBE and benzene, a known carcinogen, if ethanol \nleaks into water supplies. There are also questions about the impact of \nethanol on sensitive populations, such as children. We already know we \nhave seen in our children more and more problems lately, more and more \nproblems because they are so much more sensitive to pollutants in the \nenvironment.\n  Questions surrounding ethanol's effect on public health and the \nenvironment should be answered before Congress grants a broad waiver \nfrom liability for its harmful effects. We should err on the side of \ncaution and we should err on the side of protecting the taxpayers.\n  Supporters of this liability exemption argue that immunity from \nproduct liability design defect claims is not so broad. They are going \nto tell you we keep every other claim in place but we only will limit \nproduct liability design defect claims. But this ignores the fact that \nproduct defect claims are the clearest way to hold accountable \nmanufacturers whose products cause injury to public health or the \nenvironment. Litigation in California involving drinking water \ncontaminated by MTBE rests on claims that MTBE was defective in design. \nIn a landmark case, decided in April 2000, a San Francisco jury found \nthat, based on the theory that MTBE is a defective product, several \nmajor oil companies are legally responsible for the environmental harm \nto Lake Tahoe's ground water. The jury found that many of these same \noil companies acted with malice because they were aware of the dangers \nbut withheld information.\n  So here you go, Mr. President. You can see it, a jury of our peers--\nnot Senators, not people behind a microphone--found out that the \nproduct MTBE, which is an additive to gasoline, as is ethanol, was \ndefective in design. The verdict came forward based on the product \nliability issue.\n  In that case, the oil companies knew the risks of MTBE. They did not \nwarn anyone and--guess what--Lake Tahoe could have gotten stuck with a \n$45 million cleanup bill. If it was not able to sue under the defective \nproduct claim, that $45 million would have to come from the taxpayers \nwho live in Lake Tahoe. Let's see what the MTBE cleanup cost would be. \nAccording to recent estimates, it would cost $29 billion to clean up \nMTBE. MTBE, an additive to gasoline--when it was added, everyone stood \nup and said: Oh, it is safe. It is wonderful. It will clean up the air. \nIt did. But it polluted the water. People can't drink the water.\n  If you ever smelled water that is contaminated by MTBE, you would \nknow no one could drink it. It has a foul odor and it is yellow in \ncolor. This is what it is going to cost. If we waive the liability for \nthe companies that make MTBE, guess who gets stuck with the $29 billion \nbill. The taxpayers, instead of the people who made that product. That \nis not right.\n  By the way, in the House version of this bill, they not only give a \nsafe harbor to ethanol, they give it to MTBE, which is a total, \ncomplete outrage. I\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\nhope everyone understands that. It is in the House bill. I am happy it \nisn't in the Senate bill. I hope we can get rid of it in the \nconference.\n\n  Companies are responsible for this, not the taxpayers.\n  Now, this is the issue. Again, people will stand up and say: Oh, we \nare only waiving this very small area in liability law. They say: \nProduct liability design defect is all we are waiving.\n  Well, let's look at what the judge said in the MTBE case. He threw \nout the negligence claim. He said that did not apply. He threw out the \nnuisance claim. He said that did not apply. The only thing that applied \nwas defective product liability--and that is what my colleagues are \ngoing to waive for the makers of renewable fuels.\n  My colleagues, please listen to me. I know you want to have an \nethanol bill. Bless your heart. Go for it. But do not waive liability \nfor the manufacturers of ethanol because someday it could come back to \nhaunt you.\n  If ethanol is so safe, you do not need to do this. It makes no sense.\n  You talk to my colleagues: Ethanol is safe. It has been out there \nsince the 1970s. It is safe, it is safe, it is safe. I guess maybe they \nhave not read the 1999 special EPA Blue Ribbon Report, which says: \nDanger, maybe there is a problem. But for them to waive defective \nproduct liability and to say that is the only thing they are waiving, \nwhen it is the only thing the courts have said is an opportunity, makes \nno sense at all.\n  I had one of my colleagues come up to me yesterday and say: Well, \nSenator Boxer, you voted for a safe harbor in the Y2K bill when the \ncomputer companies had to do a very quick fix on computers. I say to my \nfriends, I did that. That only happens once in 1,000 years, and there \nis no direct impact on health and safety. So let's not confuse one safe \nharbor and another safe harbor.\n  So, clearly, we know this is kind of a shuck and a jive situation: \nOh, we are only going to throw out one little part of liability law. \nBut guess what. It is the only one that works. We do not want \ncommunities to be left holding the bag if there is a problem in the \nfuture because that is a pretty heavy bag for the local community and \nthe local taxpayers to pick up--its cleanup costs, its possible health \nproblems and its water pollution and possible air pollution.\n  I am going to get to the issue that the supporters will raise: That \nthis is a mandate and, therefore, the suppliers deserve this liability \nexemption.\n  Congress regularly mandates that manufacturers meet a variety of \nguidelines and requirements, but we do not exempt all manufacturers \nfrom State and Federal product liability design defect laws.\n  When gasoline leaks today, there is no loophole. The polluter pays, \ndespite the fact that Congress regulates gasoline. Congress mandated \nthe installation of airbags in automobiles, made them mandatory. \nCongress said: You must have airbags. You remember that battle. The \nautomobile companies said: We don't want them. (Of course, now they are \nsaying they are happy to have them.) But, in any case, we mandated \nthem. But if there is a problem with airbags, we did not give a \nliability waiver to the automobile companies. If that product is \ndefective, the product is defective and people have to be held \naccountable and responsible.\n  I thought that was what we stood for in the Senate. We talk about \naccountability. We talk about responsibility. We talk about people \ntaking responsibility for their actions, and yet we are going to give \nsome of the biggest companies in the world a waiver from liability. \nShame on us if we do this. It is not as if we did not have experience \nbefore, doing it with MTBE. It is not as if we do not know that the \ncost to clean up MTBE is in the tens of billions of dollars. If the \ncompanies were off the hook, it would be the local taxpayers who have \nto pay.\n  Again, supporters of this liability loophole claim ethanol is safe so \nno one needs to worry about this liability exemption. So, again, I ask \na question--a rhetorical question--if you are not worried about any \nill-effects from ethanol, why are you fighting me so hard on this? Why \nnot join hands with me and say we are going to treat ethanol like we \ntreat every other product?\n  I, again, want to read the language I have added in this amendment \nwhich I hope will be adopted:\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, a \nrenewable fuel used or intended to be used as a motor vehicle fuel, or \nany motor vehicle fuel containing renewable fuels, shall be subject to \nliability standards that are not less protective of human health, \nwelfare, and the environment than any other motor vehicle fuel or fuel \nadditive.\n  That is all I am saying. I am not holding ethanol to a different \nstandard. I just spoke in support of ethanol made from agricultural \nresidues. I think those folks have to meet safety standards, and one \nway to make sure they do is to not take away their liability. Ethanol \nshould be subject to liability standards as strong as any other fuel \nadditive. No more, no less. We are not making it any harsher. We are \nnot making it any easier on them. We should not shift the burden of \ncleaning up problems caused by ethanol to our local communities, our \nmayors, our city council people, our Governors, and the rest.\n  No public policy is served by immunizing the refiners and chemical \ncompanies from responsibility in the future if it turns out that this \nwas a problem and they knew it, and they didn't tell anyone about it.\n  How much time remains on my side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take another couple minutes. Then I will reserve \nthe remainder and allow my colleagues to argue this case.\n  Let me tell you who is on my side. Who is on the side of making sure \nthat we don't give the safe harbor liability waiver for renewable \nfuels? Many local and State governments, water utilities support my \namendment, public health, consumer and environmental organizations. \nThese include the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies; the \nAmerican Water Works Association, which together represent water \nsystems serving 180 million Americans across the country. Do you know \nwhy they are with me on this? They may be stuck cleaning up the water \nsupply. They can't afford it. This is almost like putting an unfunded \nmandate on local people if, in fact, there are problems with ethanol. \nAnd that is why the American Water Works Association is for my \namendment.\n  Continuing the list of those who oppose the liability waiver: \nAssociation of California Water Agencies; National Association of Water \nCompanies; South Tahoe Public Utility District. Do you know why they \nare for it? Because they know if they didn't have the chance to sue on \nthis, they would have to bear the cleanup responsibility from MTBE \ncontamination. The City of Santa Monica and Orange County Water \nDistrict likewise know the effect that ground water contamination can \nhave. They are with me.\n  How about these groups? American Lung Association is for the \namendment; American Public Health Association; California Clean Water \nAction; Citizens for a Future New Hampshire, Cahaba River Society; \nCitizen's Environmental Coalition; Clean Water Action; the Consumer \nFederation of America; Environmental Defense; Ecology Center; \nEnvironmental Working Group; Friends of the Earth; League of \nConservation Voters; Mono Lake Committee; National Sludge Alliance; the \nNatural Resources Defense Council; the New Jersey Coalition Against \nTonics; the New Jersey Environmental Federation; Physicians for Social \nResponsibility; the Sierra Club; Rivers Unlimited; Spring Lake Park \nGroundwater Guardians; and U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n  That is just a partial list of the folks out there who are saying to \nSenators: Please, if you are going to move ahead with a new product \nlike this--it is not a new product, but it is certainly going to be a \nproduct that is going to now be ubiquitous across the country--if you \nare going to do this, then make sure you take every caution and every \nprotection not to waive the protections the American people now have \nfrom a defective product.\n  And, once more, just let's be clear on this. There are no other ways \nfor communities to recover costs if this turns out to be a mistake. \nNegligence, out the window; nuisance, out the window. It is defective \nproduct liability the courts have said is the only way people can go.\n\n[[Page S7426]]\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has about 10 minutes 4 seconds \nremaining. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, to respond to the question asked by the \ndistinguished Senator from California, why are we fighting it? One of \nthe biggest problems is, you get in this quagmire of lawsuits and \nnothing ever gets done in terms of cleanup. This is something we have \nbeen fighting for a long time.\n  This is going to be a more brief statement than it was going to be \nbefore because right now we have a very significant piece of \nlegislation before the committee I chair on the clear skies \nlegislation, which is the most far-reaching reduction in powerplant \npollutions in the history of clean air. So it is very significant, and \nI do have to get back.\n  I have stated on many occasions my concern about the fact that this \ncountry does not have a comprehensive energy policy. I have also \ncriticized Republicans and Democrats alike. We didn't get a \ncomprehensive energy policy in the Reagan administration or the first \nBush administration or the Clinton administration. We are going to get \none with this. That is why this is so significant.\n  As Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said, it is a serious \nstrategic issue. This is a national security issue.\n  The amendment we are talking about, the underlying bill, the Frist-\nDaschle-Inhofe amendment, represents a compromise on a lot of \ncontentious issues. As with all compromises, there are provisions I \nlike and I don't like. I am afraid there is a lot of misinformation \nbeing circulated about the safe harbor provision. Time and time again, \nwe hear if the safe harbor provision is enacted into law, first, \ncitizens cannot take refiners to court under our tort system; and, \nsecond, any responsible ethanol contamination that happens in the \nfuture would not get cleaned up. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth.\n  First, let me address the statement that any tort claim that has not \nbeen filed by the date of enactment of this section will be forever \nbarred. Even with the enactment of the safe harbor provision, if a \nplaintiff makes a case, here are just a few tort theories that can be \nused in environmental cases: Trespass, trespass is not affected by safe \nharbor; nuisance, not affected by safe harbor; negligence, not \naffected; breach of implied warranty, not affected by safe harbor; a \nbreach of express warranty, not affected by safe harbor. Safe harbor \ndoes not affect any of these tort theories.\n  In fact, ethanol has been approved by the EPA as a fuel additive. Now \nCongress is mandating the use of ethanol. So the Federal Government has \ngiven ethanol its stamp of approval and now Congress is mandating it. \nHow can we now say that refiners and blenders are open to suits for \nclaims that the ``product has design or manufacturing defects''? Design \ndefect claims actually hamper cleanups by interfering with regulatory \nagencies. Regulatory agency oversight--Federal, State, and local--is \nfrustrated by the product liability claims because these agencies lose \ncontrol of the remedy process. These agencies are supposed to be in \ncontrol of the remedy process. That answers the question asked, Why are \nwe concerned about this? We want to get these things cleaned up.\n  When product liability claims are permitted, the plaintiff's motive \nbecomes recovery of a large money judgment rather than a judgment \nmandating a remedy to be performed by the party who released the \ngasoline. Very often, the only thing getting cleaned up are the trial \nlawyers' mansions purchased with the spoils of these settlements. In \nfact, a recent report from the Council of Economic Advisors found that \nusing the tort system in this way ``is extremely inefficient, returning \nonly 20 cents of the tort cost dollar for that purpose.''\n  Now, I would like to address the rumors that sites will not get \ncleaned up or that polluters will not pay. The Safe Harbor provisions--\nin no way--affects liability, and therefore, cleanups under any Federal \nor State environmental law. Any statement to the contrary is false. \nEnforcement of these laws is by the authorized Federal agency and \nStates. If there were a spill, here are some examples of environmental \nlaws that offer cleanup and liability provisions:\n  1. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); 2. Clean Water Act; \n3. Oil Pollution Act (OPA); 4. Superfund. Generally speaking, Congress \nintended that oil spills be cleaned up by the Oil Pollution Act. \nHowever, the Inhofe Amendment to last Congress' Brownfields bill signed \ninto law by the President is taking hug strides in cleaning up nearly \n250,000 petroleum contaminated sites, such as abandon gas stations.\n  No. 5, Natural Resource Damages (NRD), under the Oil Pollution Act, \nSuperfund, and the Clean Water Act.\n  So as you can see, there are enormous protections through the tort \nsystem as well as through environmental laws. Again, I ask my \ncolleagues to oppose the Boxer amendment and support the motion to \ntable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield to me for about 1 minute?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to accommodate my colleague.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator is prepared to speak \nagainst the Boxer amendment, as his colleague just did. I, too, have \ncome to the floor to speak against the Boxer amendment.\n  The underlying Frist-Daschle amendment creates a narrow prospective \nsafe harbor from liability for defect in design or manufacture of a \nrenewable fuel. There is no liability protection for MTBE in the \nunderlying amendment. I oppose the Boxer amendment. Many colleagues in \nthe Senate feel strongly in opposition, I believe, and we will be able \nto defeat this amendment.\n  And, to qualify for the limited protection that is in the underlying \namendment, a renewable fuel must be evaluated by EPA for toxicity, \ncarcinogenicity, air quality impacts, and water quality impacts, and \nmust be used in compliance with any restrictions imposed by EPA.\n  Further, the burden of cleanup for environmental contamination would \nnot be shifted.\n  That is, the safe harbor provision that is in the RFS amendment would \nnot affect liability under Federal and state environmental laws, and \ntherefore would not affect response, remediation and clean-up.\n  Let me make this point clear: the underlying provision would not \naffect in any way a company's legal responsibility to clean up the \ncontamination of any groundwater by gasoline, regardless of whether it \ncontained oxygenates or additives of any kind.\n  In addition, the safe harbor provision for renewable fuels does not \naffect liability under other tort law provisions, including negligence, \ntrespass, and nuisance, and it does not prevent the award of \ncompensatory or punitive damages.\n  Importantly, defective product liability cases only make up 0.002 \npercent of all civil cases filed each year according to the National \nCenter for State Courts.\n  Finally, an amendment to change or strike the safe harbor provision \nwould destroy this long-standing renewable fuels agreement, and result \nin the status quo and no national phaseout of MTBE, which has \ncontaminated some groundwater supplies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his fine statement. \nReally, the fact that we are here today in a bipartisan effort reflects \nthe good work that has gone on. After intense negotiations between the \nethanol and oil industries, agriculture, the environmental community, \nconsumer groups, and the States, we have a historic agreement that is \nembodied in the Frist-Daschle bill which will provide for significant \ngrowth in the renewable fuels industries, including ethanol and \nbiodiesel.\n  Industry has been working for months to implement these \nrecommendations that are protective of the environment, provide \nrefiners with increased flexibility, and provide agriculture with \ncertain growth in market opportunities for ethanol and biodiesel. \nCertainly, the occupant of the chair, who is from Missouri, knows how \ngreat the growth of the ethanol and biodiesel industry is in our State, \nas farmers are\n\n[[Page S7427]]\n\ncoming together in cooperatives to build facilities to meet the need \nfor this clean, renewable fuel. These are tremendous opportunities for \nimproving our environment, reducing our dependence upon foreign oil, \nand providing a strong economic base for rural America.\n  The key provisions of the bipartisan agreement, I think most people \nknow, are:\n  A Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) in which part of our nation's fuel \nsupply, growing to 5 billion gallons by 2012, is provided by renewable, \ndomestic fuels; eliminating the Federal reformulated gasoline, RFG, 2.0 \nwt. percent oxygen requirement; phasing down the use of MTBE in the \nU.S. gasoline market over 4 years; and protecting the air quality gains \nof the reformulated gasoline program.\n  These provisions will increase U.S. fuels supplies, promote more \nU.S.-sourced energy, protect the environment, and stimulate rural \neconomic development through increased production and use of domestic, \nrenewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.\n  The historic fuels agreement contained in the Reliable Fuels Act, S. \n791, provides for a gradual phase-in of the use of renewable fuels, \nbeginning with 2.6 billion gallons in 2005 and growing to 5 billion \ngallons in 2012. Some have expressed concerns regarding the bill's \nrenewable fuels ``safe harbor provision,'' arguing it provides \n``sweeping liability exemptions for damage to public health or the \nenvironment resulting from renewable fuels or their use in conventional \ngasoline.'' This is a clear misrepresentation of the provision.\n  The safe harbor provision is intended to offer some protection to \nrefiners that are required to use renewable fuels under this bill. It \nis aimed at as yet unknown and undeveloped renewable fuels, not \nethanol. Ethanol has been used in the U.S. safely and effectively for \nmore than 20 years. But without some limited safe harbor, refiners may \nbe reluctant to commercialize new fuels that may otherwise qualify for \nthis program.\n  Ethanol has received a clean bill of health. According to a report on \nethanol's health and environmental fate completed by Cambridge \nEnvironmental, Inc., no health threat is expected from increased \nethanol use. The report concludes exposure to ethanol vapors coming \nfrom ethanol-blended gasoline is very unlikely to have adverse health \nconsequences. Importantly, after an exhaustive study of ethanol's \nimpact on health, air quality and water resources, the California \nEnvironmental Policy Council awarded ethanol a clean bill of health.\n  Ethanol is rapidly biodegraded in surface water, groundwater and \nsoil. Ethanol is a safe biodegradable and renewable fuel that does not \nharm drinking water resources. A recent study by Surbec Environmental \nconcluded that ethanol poses no threat to surface water and ground \nwater According to the report, ethanol is a naturally occurring \nsubstance produced during the fermentation of organic matter and can be \nexpected to biodegrade rapidly in essentially all environments.\n  The safe harbor provision is very limited. It applies only to claims \nthat a renewable fuel is defective in design or manufacture. These \nrequirements include both compliance with requests for information \nabout a fuel's public health and environmental effects and compliance \nwith any regulations adopted by the EPA. If these requirements are not \nmet, the safe harbor protection does not apply and liability will be \ndetermined under otherwise applicable law. This provision does not \naffect claims based on the wrongful release of a renewable fuel into \nthe environment. Anyone harmed by a release of that kind would retain \nall the rights he has under current law.\n  Safeguards are provided for in the bill. The legislation requires EPA \nto conduct studies of the long-term health and environmental effects of \nrenewable fuels. Under this bill, the Administrator has the authority \nto control or even prohibit the sale of renewable fuels that may \nadversely affect air or water quality or the public health. There is no \nsafe harbor if the Administrator's rules are violated.\n  A vote for the amendment may disrupt the historic agreement. The \nbipartisan compromise on fuels issues in S. 791 represents a carefully \ncrafted agreement among the oil industry, ethanol producers, \nagriculture groups, and environmental and public health interests, \nincluding the American Lung Association, the Union of Concerned \nScientists and Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, \nNESCAUM, among others. An amendment to change or strike the safe harbor \nprovision would effectively dissolve the agreement, resulting in the \nstatus quo and continued MTBE use.\n  MTBE use is a problem. MTBE has been shown to be harmful, and MTBE \nmust be phased out and replaced by the other renewable, benign \noxygenate--ethanol.\n  I will just say generally, on all of these amendments designed to \nattack ethanol, there are tremendous economic benefits of this \nrenewable fuel standard.\n  Tripling the use of renewable fuels will have a significant positive \nimpact on both the farm and overall economy, while significantly \nreducing our foreign imports.\n  According to an economic analysis of the legislation completed by AUS \nconsultants, over the next decade RFS would reduce the Nation's trade \ndeficit by more than $34 billion in 1996 dollars, increase U.S. gross \ndomestic product by $156 billion by 2012, create more than 214,000 new \njobs throughout the entire economy, expand household income by an \nadditional $51.7 billion, increase net farm income by nearly $6 billion \nper year, create $5.3 billion of new investment in renewable fuel \nproduction capacity, and displace more than 1.6 billion barrels of \nimported oil.\n  One other canard that is often raised against ethanol is that it is \nnot a positive energy balance. Energy balance refers to the energy \ncontact of ethanol minus the fossil energy used to produce it. In 2002, \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture and Argonne National Laboratories \nconcluded that ethanol contains 34 percent more energy than is used in \nthe production process, including the energy used to grow and harvest \nthe grain, process the grain into ethanol, and to transport the ethanol \nto gasoline terminals for distribution.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Energy, ethanol produced from \nbiomass generates 6.8 Btu for every Btu of fossil energy consumed. The \nproduction of reformulated gasoline without ethanol generates only .79 \nBtu for every Btu of fossil energy consumed. Therefore, producing \nethanol produces roughly eight times more Btu than using energy-\nproduced reformulated gasoline. And it achieves a net gain in a more \ndesirable form of energy. It provides clean environmental benefits.\n  With the war we face on terrorism, we have to be more concerned about \nU.S. energy. We need to reduce imported oil. We can develop and supply \nthat oil from our rich farmlands. It will increase the availability of \nU.S. fuel supplies while easing an overburdened refining industry. No \nnew oil refineries have been built in the U.S. since 1976, but 68 \nethanol production facilities have been built during that time.\n  As ethanol and biodiesel are blended with gasoline and diesel after \nthe refining process, they directly increase domestic fuel capacity. \nBlending 10-percent ethanol in a gallon of gas provides an additional \n10-percent volume to the transportation fuel market, easing the oil \nrefinery sector that is operating at capacity.\n  The environmental benefits have already been discussed. It can reduce \nglobal warming. In 2002, ethanol use in the U.S. reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions by 4.3 million tons, the equivalent of removing more than \n636,000 vehicles from the road.\n  There is a long list of organizations that are supporting the fuels \nagreement. Rather than take the time of my colleagues to read those, I \nask unanimous consent that this list of organizations supporting the \nfuel agreement before us today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       American Farm Bureau Federation, American Petroleum \n     Institute, Renewable Fuels Association, National Corn Growers \n     Association, National Farmers Union, Northeast States for \n     Coordinated Air Use Management, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \n     National Biodiesel Board, American Bioenergy Association, \n     American Coalition for Ethanol, American Corn Growers \n     Association, American Lung Association, American Soybean \n     Association, Bluewater Network, California Farmers Union, \n     California Renewable Fuels\n\n[[Page S7428]]\n\n     Partnership, Citizens Committee to Complete the Refuge, Clean \n     Energy Now (Greenpeace), Clean Fuels Development Coalition, \n     Climate Solutions, Cook Inlet Keeper, County of Ventura \n     Public Works Department, Earth Island Journal, Environmental \n     and Energy Study Institute, Ethanol Producers and Consumers, \n     General Biomass Company, Governors' Ethanol Coalition, \n     Illinois Student Environmental Network, Institute for \n     Agriculture & Trade Policy, Institute for Local Self-\n     Reliance, International Marine Mammal Project, Kettle Range \n     Conservation Group, Kinergy Resources, Mangrove Action \n     Project, Masada Resource Group, National Grain Sorghum \n     Producers, New River Foundation, New Uses Council, Northwoods \n     Conservation Association, Oceanic Resource Foundation, Oregon \n     Environmental Council, Pacific Biodiversity Institute, Plumas \n     Corporation, Renewable Energy Action Project, Save Our \n     Shores, Soybean Producers of America, The Brower Fund, The \n     Minnesota Project, Tides Foundation, Union of Concerned \n     Scientists, Waste Action Project, Waterkeeper Alliance, West \n     Coast People's Energy Co-op, and Women Involved in Farm \n     Economics.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment and, just for good measure, I urge them to oppose all of the \nother amendments which seem to be targeted at ethanol. The manager of \nthe bill, Senator Domenici, has pointed out that we see many attacks \ncoming on ethanol. I ask my colleagues to continue to support ethanol \nand reject this and the other amendments.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to yield a couple of minutes to \nmy friend from New Mexico. Before I do, I wish to point out that I \nconsider this an ethanol-friendly amendment because I believe there \nwill be much more confidence in ethanol as an additive to our gasoline \nif people know there are no special waivers of liability, that this \nfuel will have to be subjected to the same rigorous standards in a \ncourt of law should something go wrong.\n  I do not envision this as an unfriendly amendment, although I know \nsome of my colleagues feel otherwise.\n  It is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for \noffering the amendment. I do support the amendment.\n  The general rule which has served us well in this country is that if \nyou design or manufacture a product that proves to be defective and \nthat product then injures someone, you can be held liable. That has \nallowed us to protect the health and safety of the American people. It \nis a substantial protection for all of us.\n  This safe harbor provision that the Senator from California wants to \nstrike says:\n\n       No renewable fuel shall be deemed to be defective in design \n     or in manufacture or no motor vehicle fuel that contains \n     renewable fuel shall be deemed to be defective in design and \n     manufacture.\n\n  To my mind, it is unwise public policy for us to be writing into law \nthis kind of exception to the general tort laws that we operate under \nin the country. We do not know enough, frankly. We do not know what the \nscientific and health experts are going to find when they fully \ninvestigate the impact of tripling the use of ethanol on the air that \nwe breathe and the water we drink.\n  I certainly hope they will find there is no harmful health effect \nfrom it, but to say we are going to prohibit anyone from recovering if \nthey are damaged from the design or manufacture of any of these \nrenewable fuels I think is a big mistake.\n  I compliment the Senator from California. I support her amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment by my \ncolleague from California to strke the so-called ``safe harbor \nprovision'' in the amendment offered by the majority leader that would \nshield ethanol producers and refiners from any liability if the fuel \nadditive harms the environment or public health.\n  Candidly, I find this ``safe harbor provision'' astounding.\n  I believe it is egregious public policy to mandate ethanol into our \nfuel supply in the first place--and even worse to provide complete \nliability protection to the fuel additive before scientific and health \nexperts can fully investigate the impact of tripling ethanol on the air \nwe breathe and the water we drink.\n  This is exactly the mistake we made with MTBE. Over the past several \nyears, we have learned that MTBE has contaminated our water and may be \na human carcinogen.\n  As exemplified by our Nation's experience with MTBE, there can be \nsevere environmental and health repercussions when we mandate the use \nof any one fuel additive.\n  Last fall a California jury found there was ``clear and convincing \nevidence'' that three major oil companies acted ``with malice'' by \npolluting ground water at Lake Tahoe with MTBE because the gasoline \nthey sold was ``defective in design'' and there was failure to warn of \nits pollution hazard. After a 5-month trial, Shell Oil and Lyondell \nChemical Company were found guilty of withholding information on the \ndangers of MTBE. The firms settled with the South Lake Tahoe Water \nDistrict for $69 million.\n  This case demonstrates why we cannot surrender the rights of citizens \nto hold polluters accountable for harm they inflict.\n  How can the Senate favor exempting the ethanol industry from this \nkind of wrongdoing? I urge my colleagues to take a look at the so-\ncalled ``safe harbor'' provision that will give the ethanol industry \nunprecedented protection against consumers and communities that may \nseek legal redress against the harm ethanol may cause.\n  Our amendment would strike this ridiculous exemption.\n  If we do not strike this provision, polluters will receive \nunprecedented protection from damage to public health or the \nenvironment.\n  If we do not strike this provision, what incentive will there be for \nethanol manufacturers and refiners to make their products as safe as \npossible and thoroughly test their long-term effects?\n  If we do not strike this provision, how else can we hold \nmanufacturers accountable when fuel additives cause harm?\n  Mandating ethanol into our fuel supply raises serious health and \nenvironmental concerns. What effect will an ethanol mandate have on our \nenvironment? What are the health risks?\n  Although the scientific opinion is not unanimous, evidence suggests \nthat; one, reformulated gasoline with ethanol produces more smog \npollution than reformulated gas without it; and, two, ethanol enables \nthe toxic chemicals in gasoline to break apart and seep further into \ngroundwater even faster than conventional gasoline.\n  Ethanol is often made out to be an ideal ``renewable fuel'' giving \noff fewer emissions. Yet, on balance, ethanol can be a cause of more \nair pollution because it produces smog in the summer months. Smog is a \npowerful respiratory irritant that affects large segments of the \npopulation. It has an especially pernicious effect on the elderly, \nchildren, and individuals with existing respiratory problems such as \nasthma.\n  Just last week the American Lung Association named California the \nsmoggiest state by listing nine counties and six metropolitan areas in \nCalifornia as having the worst conditions.\n  A 1999 report from the National Academy of Sciences found, ``the use \nof commonly available oxygenates [like ethanol] in [Reformulated \nGasoline] has little impact on improving ozone air quality and has some \ndisadvantages. Moreover, some data suggest that oxygenates can lead to \nhigher Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions.'' Nitrogen Oxides are \nknown to cause smog.\n  The American Lung Association report also noted that half of \nAmericans are living in counties with unhealthy smog levels. Why would \nwe want to take the chance of increasing these unhealthy smog levels by \nmandating billions of unnecessary gallons of ethanol into our fuel \nsupply?\n  Thus, ethanol can be both good and bad for air quality. To me it \nwould make sense to maximize the advantages of ethanol, while \nminimizing the disadvantages. This is exactly why States should have \nflexibility to decide what goes into their gasoline in order to meet \nclean air standards, and ethanol should not be mandated--certainly not \nat this level. And if we are\n\n[[Page S7429]]\n\nmandating it, why exempt manufacturers and refiners from their legal \nresponsibility to provide a safe product?\n  Evidence also suggests that ethanol accelerates the ability of toxins \nfound in gasoline to seep into our groundwater supplies. The EPA Blue \nRibbon Panel on Oxygenates found ethanol ``may retard biodegradation \nand increase movement of benzene and other hydrocarbons around leaking \ntanks.''\n  And according to a report by the State of California entitled \n``Health and Environmental Assessment of the Use of Ethanol as a Fuel \nOxygenate,'' there are valid questions about the impact of ethanol on \nground and surface water. An analysis in the report found there will be \na 20 percent increase in public drinking water wells contaminated with \nbenzene if a significant amount of ethanol is used. Benzene is a known \nhuman carcinogen.\n  At a hearing held on the House side last year, Professor Gordon \nRausser of UC Berkeley commented on the potential harm of ethanol on \ngroundwater. Professor Rausser testified:\n\n     when gasoline that contains ethanol is released into \n     groundwater, the resulting benzene plumes can be longer and \n     more persistent than plumes resulting from releases of \n     conventional gasoline. Research suggests that the presence of \n     ethanol in gasoline will delay the degradation of benzene and \n     will lengthen the benzene plumes by between 25 percent and \n     100 percent.\n\n  This evidence on the potential harm of ethanol is extraordinarily \ntroubling.\n  I am at a loss to understand why the Senate would support sweeping \nliability protection for fuel producers. Taking away the ability of \nfamilies and communities to seek redress for the harm caused by fuel \nadditives is NOT something I believe this Senate should be doing.\n  Let me read part of a letter sent by California Attorney General Bill \nLockyer opposing the ethanol safe harbor provision. Lockyer writes:\n\n       Congress should not enact the current safeharbor \n     provisions, which could be construed as granting oil \n     companies a very broad immunity. As exemplified by MTBE, \n     there can be dire consequences from the use of defective fuel \n     additives.\n\n  Lockyer continues:\n\n       If there is a defect with a particular fuel, the oil \n     companies should be held accountable under the common law \n     principles for using such a fuel. In addition, by including \n     fuels and not just renewable fuels, this section has a \n     extraordinarily broad reach. There is no reason to add \n     immunity for a fuel just because one drop of renewable fuel \n     is added to that fuel. For as long as automobiles have been \n     used, oil companies have been subject to common law product \n     liability rules. There is no need to change these fundamental \n     principles.\n\n  We need to protect the basic rights American families enjoy remain in \nplace to keep our air and water safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to protect our \ncommunities from harm caused by fuel additives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this debate is winding down and my \ncolleagues are here to offer other amendments. I am going to finish \nshortly.\n  At this point in the debate, we ought to get real about what this is. \nThere are certain matters that are right in society and there are \ncertain matters that are wrong. It is not right to give special \nprotection to one particular manufacturing group in this country that \nno one else gets. In a way, it is a subsidy given to those people \nbecause if there is a problem in the future with ethanol, guess who is \ngoing to pick up the tab? Guess who is going to pay the bill? Not the \npeople who caused the problem but the taxpayers. That is wrong.\n  If we had a wonderful history, if we did not have communities in \ntrouble because of MTBE and other additives we thought would be great, \nit would be different.\n  I see my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, is in the Chamber \nfor another amendment. The Citizens for a Future New Hampshire support \nthe Boxer amendment because they do not want to be left holding the bag \nif something happens.\n  There is right and there is wrong. This issue, to me, is very clear: \nIt is right to protect the people; it is wrong to give a special \ninterest waiver to a particular manufacturer.\n  There is private special interest and there is public interest--\ntaxpayers versus those who would pollute.\n  Finally, when my colleagues say they are only banning one type of \noption for citizens who are injured, namely effective product \nliability, that is all they are doing. People can still use the \nnuisance claim and the negligence claim and all of these other claims.\n\n  I hope they know they are forgetting recent history where there was a \ncourt case on MTBE, also an additive to gasoline, and what did the \ncourt say? The nuisance claim, denied; the negligence claim, denied. \nThe only claim that could hold up, the only claim that could save the \ntaxpayers of Lake Tahoe, who had a mess with MTBE, was defective \nproduct liability.\n  My colleagues stand up and say that is the only thing we are doing. \nThey called it a narrow safe harbor. Well, it is an enormous safe \nharbor because it is the only place people can go to get recompense if \nethanol turns out to be a problem.\n  My colleague from Missouri says there is a study in this underlying \nbill. Well, I am glad there is a study, but he is ignoring the fact \nthat there has already been a study in 1999 by EPA's blue ribbon panel, \nand this is what they said: Ethanol is extremely soluble in water and \nwould spread if leaked into the environment. It may further spread \nplumes of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and ethanol may \ninhibit the breakdown of these toxic materials.\n  It says it may inhibit. That means it may be a problem. If my \ncolleagues, in their zeal to have ethanol in every single State in this \ncountry--and, by the way, it will be--and if they are so sure it is \nsafe, then why on Earth are they saying ethanol should get special \ntreatment, and why do they close down the door on the only area where \npeople have found they have a chance to get cleanup money from the \npolluters? The answer is, they do not know if it is safe.\n  We hope it is safe. We hoped MTBE would be safe, and it has poisoned \nhundreds of wells in this country. Hundreds of water systems have shut \ndown because of MTBE. And if it was not for the product liability claim \nbeing open to citizens, who would have to clean up the mess? Not the \ncompanies that caused it but the taxpayers in those areas.\n  So it seems to me, if I might use the word ``disingenuous,'' to say \nthat ethanol is 100 percent safe, but we want a safe harbor so no one \ncan sue if something goes wrong.\n  I was not born yesterday. That is obvious. I know when somebody says \nthey have the safest product in the world but give me special \nprotection so that no one can ever sue me, my antenna goes up, just as \na person with common sense, and I say that is not right.\n  Researchers say that more ground water wells will experience \ncontamination from MTBE and benzene, which is a carcinogen, if ethanol \nleaks into water supply, and there are the questions about the impact \nof ethanol on sensitive populations, our children.\n  Now, there is not one Senator who does not want to protect kids. Come \non. We know that. Most of us are parents. A lot of us are grandparents. \nWe are aunts, we are uncles. We want to protect our children and we \nwant to protect the Nation's children. How can we close our eyes, then, \nto what we are about to do if we do not agree to this Boxer amendment? \nWhat we are doing is saying that the makers of this product do not have \nto worry about a thing in terms of harming our kids.\n  Our kids, because of the developmental stage they are in--they are \ngrowing, they are changing, their hormones are starting--they are very \nsensitive to contaminants. We know that. That is why I wrote the \nChildren's Environmental Protection Act, and parts of it have been \npassed by the Senate. I am so proud of it. Is it not better to say up \nfront to a manufacturer--any manufacturer--if they harm children, we \ncan take them to court and they are going to have to clean up the mess \nand clean up their product?\n\n  Oh, no, not if they are making ethanol. They are going to have \nspecial exemption. It breaks my heart to see us do this. I figure I \nwill lose this amendment only because we tried it once before and we \ndid lose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from California \nher time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for one additional minute, to \nclose.\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So there are unanswered questions surrounding ethanol. \nThere are unanswered questions according to the EPA special panel in \n1999, and all the Senator from California is saying to her colleagues \nis this: Just make sure this product, which is going to be a new \nproduct in several States, that it does not have special advantages so \nthat if something happens, the makers of the product do not get off \nscott-free. That is not right. It is un-American. It is not fair. It is \nan unfunded mandate on our communities.\n  I was happy to hear Senator Bond say he does not support a waiver for \nMTBE--good for him--because we need to strip that out of the House \nbill. But this is a new day. This is a new additive, and we should hold \nit to the same responsibility as we hold all other additives, all other \nproducts. Because if MTBE had this waiver, communities all over this \ncountry would be in trouble.\n  I thank my colleagues very much for listening to me. I feel very \nstrongly about this. I hope we will have a good ``aye'' vote.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, and also ask the amendment be set aside \nfor a vote at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: May I ask the \nmanagers of the bill approximately what time they expect to be voting \non the Boxer amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. At this point it looks as if we are not going to vote \non anything until about 3, and the Boxer amendment would be second or \nthird in line.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is fine. I say to my friend, could I have 1 minute \nat that point, and a minute on the other side, to explain the \namendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Unless the Senator wants to seek that consent at this \npoint, there is no such arrangement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that 2 minutes \nhas already been provided in the unanimous consent agreement, so the \nSenator will have that 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with the consent of the minority, I make \nthe following unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent that--\nI withhold until the minority whip is present, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, now I ask unanimous consent that at 3:30 \ntoday the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Schumer amendment \nNo. 853, to be followed immediately by a vote in relation to the Boxer \namendment No. 856, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Boxer \namendment No. 854; provided further that following those votes the \nSenate proceed immediately to a vote on the adoption of amendment No. \n850, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, also for the information of Senators, I have \nspoken to the two managers of the bill. There are a number of people \nwho are ready to offer amendments. The Republican manager of the bill \nhas an amendment waiting to go. We also have a very important amendment \non which there has been an agreement on the time for that amendment. We \nwould want that set up for early next week. It is one of the most \nimportant amendments in this whole bill.\n  But we are not going to be able to move forward until 3:30 on \nanything, until the two leaders announce to the floor managers that \nthere has been something worked out on the amendment originally offered \nby the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln.\n  It is my understanding that there has been work done to arrive at a \npoint where that matter can be disposed of, but until that is done, we \nare not going to move forward on anything other than these.\n  As I indicated, the two leaders may even be talking as we speak. \nUntil we hear from them, we will be happy to fill in this time, until \n3:30, with the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, or whatever \nthe two managers think is appropriate. But until then, we are not going \nto agree to set it aside to move to anything else.\n  So we have no problem talking about the bill or amendments that may \nbe offered. But until the matter involving the child tax credit is \nworked out with the two leaders, we are not going to move forward on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For the information of the Senate, I might indicate \nthat the second of the Boxer amendments, which had been listed in the \nunanimous consent, is probably not going to require a rollcall vote but \nwill be adopted by voice. Immediately after that, the underlying \nethanol amendment will be voted on, and a rollcall vote is being \nrequired on that.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, the manager of the bill, intends when \nappropriate, when matters have been agreed on between the leadership, \nthat we can proceed to offer an Indian amendment, which I think then \nwould be followed by a second-degree amendment by the Senator from New \nMexico, the minority manager of the bill.\n\n  We are also pursuing with a degree of vigor an effort to see if we \ncannot get Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy to agree to work out the \nLIHEAP portion of this bill. There are two amendments there. If they \nare able to work that out, that will put us in a position where we will \ndispose of that entire matter sometime this afternoon, hopefully. It \nseems they are very close to working that out, if the Senator is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response, let me indicate my best \ninformation is they are still insisting that we not deal with LIHEAP in \nthis legislation, which is of course not my position. I think we should \ndeal with it.\n  Accordingly, I would not agree to just a sense of the Senate on that \nsubject, which is their preference, as I understand it.\n  I hope we can persuade them otherwise. If not, then we will have to \nhave a vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In any event, I am pursuing them so that there will be \na vote. Sooner or later we would like to dispose of it. If they insist, \nthey can have a vote on the first part of theirs. If they win or lose, \nthat leaves you in a position of whether you have the amendment on this \nbill or not, depending upon the disposition of the first, the amendment \nthat precedes it, both of which have been set aside by consent and are \npending action by the Senate.\n  I see my friend Senator Wyden on the floor. I know we had been \ntalking about a proposed agreement with reference to a matter on \nnuclear power. Let me suggest to the Senator, we are in accord as to \nthat. We will enter into it but not at this point. We are examining the \nlanguage carefully. But you have our assurance that at an appropriate \ntime today that agreement will be entered into and then we will be \nready to have a very important vote sometime on the day of Tuesday with \nreference to nuclear power, with you being a proponent of a motion to \nstrike.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if I could just respond, Senator Sununu and \nI will be in the Chamber talking in a bit more detail. I always \nappreciate the graciousness of the chairman of the committee in working \nwith me. I think we are going to get an agreement.\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\nThere are probably a lot more Senators who will want to speak on this \nthan first estimated.\n  So the Senate knows, originally Senator Sununu and I were prepared to \noffer an amendment to strike the $16 billion for nuclear subsidies. The \namendment is supported strongly by the Taxpayers Union, but at the \nrequest of the chairman of the committee, that vote will be put over \nuntil next week.\n  I am very hopeful that we will be able to get a consent agreement \nbefore long to have this debate. This is a significant exposure for \ntaxpayers. It is not a question of whether someone is pro-nuclear or \nanti-nuclear. The Congressional Budget Office has said that there is at \nleast a 50-percent risk of failure with respect to these facilities. \nThe Congressional Research Service has indicated the taxpayers will be \non the hook for in the vicinity of $16 billion.\n  What I worry about is what happened in our part of the country. Four \nout of five facilities were never built. In this case, if the \nCongressional Budget Office is right and you have over a 50-percent \nrisk of failure at these facilities, this will be a huge exposure for \ntaxpayers.\n  I tell Senators there is no other source of energy in this \nlegislation which gets a direct subsidy for building a facility.\n  I am going to try to find a way to reach a procedural accommodation \nwith the chairman of the committee. I am a personal friend, and I want \nto accommodate him. I hope we will be able do that.\n  This is a very significant taxpayer issue for the Senate. It is not a \nquestion of whether someone is pro-nuclear or anti-nuclear. In my own \ninimitable way, I have managed to make both sides mad over my career in \npublic service. But it is a taxpayer issue of enormous importance.\n  I hope Senators will read what the Congressional Budget Office and \nthe Congressional Research Service have had to say about this. The \nCongressional Budget Office reports that there is more than a 50-\npercent risk of failure with respect to these facilities, if \nsubsidized. The Congressional Research Service has talked about a $16 \nbillion subsidy.\n  I would point out that this is even too rich for the blood of the \nother body. The other body has not talked about anything like this.\n  We will work with the chairman of the committee. Senator Sununu and I \nwill be coming to the floor before long as well so that we can begin to \nlay out the bipartisan support we have with Senator Bingaman, the \nranking minority member, Senator Ensign, and others.\n  I would just tell the chairman of the committee that I think there \nare probably more Senators who want to discuss this than we thought. We \nalready have some indication that 90 minutes equally divided with an \nup-or-down vote may not be enough. It is my intention to work with the \nchairman of the committee, the ranking minority member, and others to \ntry to work out this unanimous consent so we can have that done \nexpeditiously.\n  I point out that this Senator and the Senator from New Hampshire were \nasked to come today to have our amendment brought up. We felt pretty \ngood about it. We know there is going to be an awful lot of back and \nforth with Senators between now and the time we vote Tuesday.\n  I ask that Senators look at the Congressional Budget Office report \nand the Congressional Research Service report over the next few days as \nthe discussions go on and off the floor.\n  I look forward to working this out in terms of procedure with the \nchairman of the committee probably over the next hour or so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we will have a great deal of time to \ndiscuss what I believe is the most important issue for America's \nfuture; that is, are we going to have an alternate source of energy for \nelectricity, aside and apart from coal and natural gas?\n  I believe the time has come. We ought to set in motion the \nauthorization--not the approval, not the appropriations, but the \nauthorization--to start down the path that says the United States may \nbe ready to build a nuclear powerplant. The arguments that have just \nbeen made in anticipation of the agreement are not exactly as such. \nThis bill says America should have an opportunity to have a variety of \nenergy sources. We have provided subsidies for coal so that coal can be \nmade clean and delivered to our people as clean as possible. That is \nsubsidized. We have an enormous tax subsidy for wind and energy. In \nfact, it is so big and so current that there will be windmills built \nall over this country, and the amount is a direct tax credit. It is not \nsomething that may happen. Every time one of those windmills is built, \nthe tax credit will apply and money will be used in large quantities.\n  In addition, we are talking about whether nuclear powerplants are \nbeing built today. For instance, General Electric nuclear powerplants \nare being designed and built in Taiwan right now at a cost--believe it \nor not, and which we will show here to the Senate--that belies all of \nthe information that is submitted by the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich we believe is speculative. It will be shown that they are \nconstructing these nuclear powerplants at $1,250 a kilowatt. That means \nthey are perilously close today to producing nuclear powerplants that \nwill be competitive with natural gas in the United States.\n  We are not asking the Senate for any of this to happen. We are saying \nthat, as a matter of policy, we should put in the Energy bill the \nopportunity for this to happen. We will go into great detail as to the \nconditions, how it will happen, how it won't happen, and who has to \napprove and who has to disapprove.\n  We think before we are finished, we will have convinced a majority of \nSenators that the time has come to give a rebirth to this alternative \nsource so that if, as a matter of fact, in the next decade or so the \nneed arises, we will be ready, willing, and able to move ahead.\n  Having said that, I have just indicated nothing else is going to \nhappen in the Senate until sometime around 3 o'clock or 3:30. We will \ntry to get our unanimous consent agreement sometime this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to be very brief. In fact, we are \ngoing to get an agreement with the Senator from New Mexico to work out \nthe process for considering nuclear subsidies.\n  I just want to make sure Senators are clear with respect to what the \nsubsidy is all about. The Senator from New Mexico, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, said wind is going to get vast amounts of \nsubsidies. I wanted to point out to the chairman that if wind farms \nproduce power, they get a tax credit for the energy they produce. But \nwind farms do not get any subsidy to build a facility.\n  What is unique about the $16 billion exposure for taxpayers is only \none energy source, under this legislation, gets a subsidy to build a \nfacility. That has troubled the National Taxpayers Union. That is why \nthey have been a strong supporter of the Wyden-Sununu amendment. This \nis not going to be about whether you are pro-nuclear or anti-nuclear. \nThis is about whether Senators want to put at risk the taxpayers of the \ncountry for the prospect that the Congressional Budget Office has said \nhas a 50-percent or higher failure with respect to constructing these \nfacilities.\n  We will have more to say about the bipartisan Wyden-Sununu amendment \nbefore long, but I wrap up this part of the discussion by simply \nsaying, again, I hope Senators will look at what the Congressional \nBudget Office and the Congressional Research Service have had to say \nabout that. Those are reports that lay out, in a frank and objective \nway, what the risk is for taxpayers. I hope Senators will review it \ncarefully.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak for 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka pertaining to the submission of the \nresolution are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on \nSubmitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently debating S. 14.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the pending question before the Senate, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Frist-Daschle \namendment No. 850.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, is the Senate operating under any time control at the \nmoment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time control. There is no time \nagreement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have one final question. Has the Pastore \nrule expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Pastore rule expired 5 seconds ago.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n\n             Iraq's WMD Intelligence: Where is the Outrage?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with each passing day, the questions \nconcerning and surrounding Iraq's missing weapons of mass destruction \ntake on added urgency. Where are the massive stockpiles of VX, mustard, \nand other nerve agents that we were told Iraq was hoarding? Where are \nthe thousands of liters of botulinim toxin? Wasn't it the looming \nthreat to America posed by these weapons that propelled the United \nStates into war with Iraq? Isn't this the reason American military \npersonnel were called upon to risk their lives in mortal combat?\n  On March 17, in his final speech to the American people before \nordering the invasion of Iraq, President Bush took one last opportunity \nto bolster his case for war. The centerpiece of his argument was the \nsame message he brought to the United Nations months before, and the \nsame message he hammered home at every opportunity in the intervening \nmonths, namely that Saddam Hussein had failed to destroy Iraq's weapons \nof mass destruction and thus presented an imminent danger to the \nAmerican people. ``Intelligence gathered by this and other governments \nleaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal \nsome of the most lethal weapons ever devised,'' the President said.\n  Now, nearly 2 months after the fall of Baghdad, the United States has \nyet to find any physical evidence of those lethal weapons. Could they \nbe buried underground or are they somehow camouflaged in plain sight? \nHave they been shipped outside of the country? Do they actually exist? \nThe questions are mounting. What started weeks ago as a restless murmur \nthroughout Iraq has intensified into a worldwide cacophony of \nconfusion.\n  The fundamental question that is nagging at many is this: How \nreliable were the claims of this President and key members of his \nadministration that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction posed a clear \nand imminent threat to the United States, such a grave threat that \nimmediate war was the only recourse?\n  Lawmakers, who were assured before the war that weapons of mass \ndestruction would be found in Iraq, and many of whom voted--now get \nthis--to give this administration a sweeping grant of authority to wage \nwar based upon those assurances, have now been placed in the \nuncomfortable position of wondering if they were misled. The media is \nratcheting up the demand for answers: Could it be that the intelligence \nwas wrong, or could it be that the facts were manipulated a little \nhere, a little there? These are very serious and grave questions, and \nthey require immediate answers. We cannot--and must not--brush such \nquestions aside. We owe the people of this country an answer. Those \npeople who are listening, who are watching this Chamber, and every \nMember of this body ought to be demanding answers.\n  I am encouraged that the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence \nCommittees are planning to investigate the credibility of the \nintelligence that was used to build the case for war against Iraq. We \nneed a thorough, open, gloves-off investigation of this matter, and we \nneed it quickly. The credibility of the President and his \nadministration hangs in the balance. We must not trifle with the \npeople's trust by foot-dragging.\n  What amazes me is that the President himself is not clamoring for an \ninvestigation. It is his integrity, President Bush's integrity, that is \non the line. It is his truthfulness that is being questioned. It is his \nleadership that has come under scrutiny. And yet he has raised no \nquestion that I have heard. He has expressed no curiosity about the \nstrange turn of events in Iraq. He has expressed no anger at the \npossibility that he might have been misled by people in his own \nadministration. How is it that the President, who was so adamant about \nthe dangers of WMD, has expressed no concern over the whereabouts of \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq?\n  Indeed, instead of leading the charge to uncover the discrepancy \nbetween what we were told before the war and what we have found--or \nfailed to find--since the war, the White House is circling the wagons \nand scoffing at the notion that anyone in the administration \nexaggerated the threat from Iraq.\n  In an interview with Polish television last week, President Bush \nnoted that two trailers were found in Iraq that U.S. intelligence \nofficials believe are mobile biological weapons production labs, \nalthough no trace of chemical or biological material was found in the \ntrailers. ``We found the weapons of mass destruction,'' the President \nwas quoted as saying. But certainly he cannot be satisfied with such \nmeager evidence.\n  At the CIA, Director George Tenet released a terse statement the \nother day defending the intelligence his agency provided on Iraq. ``The \nintegrity of our process was maintained throughout and any suggestion \nto the contrary is simply wrong,'' he said. How can he be so absolutely \nsure?\n  At the Pentagon, Doug Feith, the Undersecretary of Defense for \npolicy, held a rare press conference this week to deny reports that a \nhigh-level intelligence cell in the Defense Department doctored data \nand pressured the CIA to strengthen the case for war. ``I know of no \npressure. I can't rule out what other people may have perceived. Who \nknows what people perceive,'' he said. Is this administration not at \nall concerned about the perception of deception? The perception is \nthere.\n  And Secretary of State Powell, who presented the U.S. case against \nIraq to the United Nations last February, strenuously defended his \npresentation in an interview this week and denied any erosion in the \nadministration's credibility. ``Everybody knows that Iraq had weapons \nof mass destruction,'' he said. Should he not be more concerned than \nthat about U.S. claims before the United Nations?\n  And yet . . . and yet . . . the questions continue to grow, and the \ndoubts are beginning to drown out the assurances. For every insistence \nfrom Washington that the weapons of mass destruction case against Iraq \nis sound comes a counterpoint from the field--another dry hole, another \ndead end.\n  As the top Marine general in Iraq was recently quoted as saying, ``It \nwas a surprise to me then, it remains a surprise to me now, that we \nhave not uncovered weapons, as you say, in some of the forward \ndispersal sites. Again, believe me, it's not for lack of trying. We've \nbeen to virtually every ammunition supply point between the Kuwaiti \nborder and Baghdad, but they're simply not there.''\n  Who are the American people to believe? What are we to think? Even \nthough I opposed the war against Iraq because I believe that the \ndoctrine of preemption is a flawed and dangerous instrument of foreign \npolicy, I did believe that Saddam Hussein possessed some chemical and \nbiological weapons capability. But I did not believe that he presented \nan imminent threat to the United States as indeed he did not.\n  Such weapons may eventually turn up. I said so weeks ago; they may \neventually turn up. But my greater fear is that the belligerent stance \nof the United States may have convinced Saddam Hussein to sell or \ndisperse his weapons to dark forces outside of Iraq. Shouldn't this \nadministration be equally alarmed if they really believed that Saddam \nhad such dangerous capabilities?\n  The administration took steps to protect the oil facilities in Iraq \nfrom being damaged and set on fire. The administration took \nextraordinary steps\n\n[[Page S7433]]\n\nto do that. Why did it not take equally extraordinary steps to protect \nchemical, biological, radiological, nuclear weapons, possibly, from \nbeing looted, from being stolen, from being taken away by those who \nwould sell them, possibly, to terrorists?\n  Saddam Hussein is missing. Osama bin Laden is missing. Iraq's weapons \nof mass destruction are missing. And the President's mild claims that \nwe are ``on the look'' do not comfort me. There ought to be an army of \nUN inspectors combing the countryside in Iraq or searching for evidence \nof disbursement of these weapons right now. Why are we waiting? Is \nthere fear of the unknown or fear of the truth?\n  This nation--and, indeed, the world--was led into war with Iraq on \nthe grounds that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and posed \nan imminent threat to the United States and to the global community. As \nthe President said in his March 17 address to the Nation, ``The danger \nis clear: using chemical, biological or, one day, nuclear weapons, \nobtained with the help of Iraq, the terrorists could fulfill their \nstated ambitions and kill thousands or hundreds of thousands of \ninnocent people in our country, or any other.''\n  That fear may still be valid, but I wonder how the war with Iraq has \nreally mitigated the threat from terrorists. As the recent attack in \nSaudi Arabia proved, terrorism is alive and well and unaffected by the \nsituation in Iraq.\n  Meanwhile, the President seems oblivious to the controversy swirling \nabout the justification for the invasion of Iraq. Our Nation's \ncredibility before the world is at stake. While his administration digs \nin to defend the status quo, Members of Congress are questioning the \ncredibility of the intelligence and the public case made by this \nadministration on which the war with Iraq was based. Members of the \nmedia, Members of the fourth estate, are openly challenging whether \nAmerica's intelligence agencies were simply wrong or were callously \nmanipulated. Vice President Cheney's numerous visits to the CIA are \nbeing portrayed by some intelligence professionals as ``pressure.'' And \nthe American people are wondering, once again, what is going on in the \ndark shadows of Washington.\n  It is time that we had some answers. It is time that the American \npeople were given some answers. It is time that the administration \nstepped up its acts to reassure the American people that the horrific \nweapons that the administration told us threatened the world's safety \nhave not fallen into terrorist hands. It is time that the President \nleveled with the American people. It is time that the President of the \nUnited States demanded that we get to the bottom of this matter and to \nfollow every lead, regardless of where that lead goes.\n  We have waged a costly war against Iraq. American fighting men and \nwomen are still dying in Iraq. We have prevailed. But we are still \nlosing, as I said, still losing American lives in that nation. And the \ntroubled situation there is far from settled. American troops will \nlikely be needed there for months, many months--even years. Billions of \nAmerican tax dollars will continue to be needed to rebuild that \ncountry. I only hope that we have not won the war only to lose the \npeace. Until we have determined the fate of Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction, or determined that they, in fact, did not exist, we cannot \nrest, we cannot claim victory.\n\n  Iraq's weapons of mass destruction remain a mystery, an enigma, a \nconundrum. What are they, where are they, how dangerous are they? Or \nwere they a manufactured excuse by an administration eager to seize a \ncountry? It is time these questions were answered. It is time--past \ntime--for the administration to level with the American people, and it \nis time for the President of the United States to demand an accounting \nfrom his own administration as to exactly how our Nation was led down \nsuch a twisted path to war. His credibility and the credibility of this \nNation is at stake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I understand we are on energy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We need to talk a little bit about energy. I think that \nis what we are on. That is what we are doing this week. I must confess, \nI am a little disappointed that we seem to get off on other things that \nare unrelated when it seems to me that doing something with an energy \npolicy to try and look ahead in this country as to where we need to be \non energy is among the most important things that we could possibly do.\n  I understand there are different views about how you do that, and \nthat it is legitimate to talk about those, but I do feel badly when we \nmove off on something that isn't related when we are trying to get this \ndone. I think it is important that we do it. We are obviously ready to \nmove on to health care and Medicare and pharmaceuticals the week after \nnext. But we have been over this now. Last year we worked very hard \ntrying to do something with energy. We passed it here. I think the \nprocess that was used was not conducive to a successful finish and, \nindeed, we didn't have one. But this year we went through the \ncommittee. We have already discussed all these issues. We have argued \nback and forth.\n  Obviously, not everyone agrees, but I think it is hard not to agree \nthat energy is one of the things that affects most of us more than \nalmost anything else that we can do here. It affects whether we have \nlights. It affects whether we have heat. It affects whether we have an \nopportunity to use our automobile. And, more importantly, it has a \ngreat deal to do with security for this country. So I really feel \nstrongly that we should get on with it. We should come up with an \nenergy policy out of the Senate. We should go into conference committee \nwith the House.\n  Remember, one of the first things that the President and the Vice \nPresident did when they came into office was to outline an energy \npolicy recognizing how important that is. Since that time, we have, of \ncourse, had more and more unrest and more and more war and terrorism in \nthe Middle East. We have allowed ourselves to get into a position where \n60 percent of our oil comes in on imports. We are that dependent, which \nis very risky. We have seen it move up and down and have different \neffects over the country when different things happen with regard to \nenergy. Yet we seem kind of lackadaisical about trying to deal with it \nin terms of policy.\n  Let me emphasize that is what we are talking about here is a policy. \nIn my view, a policy normally indicates that you are trying to look \nahead at what you think the situation ought to be in the future with \nregard to that issue, what it means to your family and to your \ncommunity and to the country, to try and get a vision of where we want \nto be in 10 or 15 years with respect to energy. And having established \na policy of that kind, obviously, then it becomes much easier and more \neffective and more useful to measure the things we do in the interim as \nto how they affect the accomplishment and the realization of that \nvision and policy that we have seen.\n  I must confess that I am a little concerned from time to time that \nvision is not always something that has a very high priority in the \nSenate, and that really ought to be our major concern--seeing what we \ncan do here to accommodate reaching certain goals in the future.\n  So we are talking here about an energy policy that has been drafted, \na rather general, wide energy policy that I think is very important. We \nare talking in this policy about conservation, about ways to save on \nthe amount of energy we have and the needs we have. We are talking \nabout finding alternatives so that we can have access to different \nkinds of energy than we have had in the past. We are talking about \nresearch so that we can do things such as have more clean coal, so we \nhave better air quality with respect to generating electricity. We are \ntalking about the possibility of converting some of our fossil fuels to \nthings such as hydrogen so that we are able to move them about easier, \nable to have a cleaner environment. And we are able to do all of these \nthings.\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\n  Of course, very important among all of these is to increase domestic \nproduction. We have great opportunities for production in this country. \nMuch of it lies in the West. I happen to be from the West. Our State is \n50 percent owned by the Federal Government. Many of these resources are \non those Federal lands. Now, we have to do that carefully so that we \nhave a balance between protecting the environment, on the one hand, and \nusing the resources for energy, or whatever, on the other hand. We can \ndo that. It is our responsibility to be particularly careful. We have \nthe largest resource of fossil fuel for this country in the future, \nwhich is coal. We have an opportunity to do a great deal with coal. We \nmet this morning in the Environment Committee on finding new ways to \nset standards for SO2, and for other air quality standards, including \nmercury. We can do those things.\n  That is what part of this bill is about--moving us forward in being \nable to produce energy and, at the same time, protect the environment, \nwhich all of us want to do. But we need to move forward to be able to \ndo that. We need to have easier access to public lands and multiple-use \nlands, and have all the other uses as well for energy extraction. \nCertainly, we won't want to use some lands for that. We will set them \naside as wilderness and special use. We have more wilderness in Wyoming \nthan in any other State in the country--except perhaps Alaska.\n  In any event, these are the kinds of issues with which we are faced. \nThey are not insurmountable. As a matter of fact, they are problems to \nwhich we have the solution, but we seem hesitant to move forward and \nget this job behind us. So I hope we will.\n  We have to modernize our infrastructure. Many things have changed. It \nis not as if energy production remains the same over the years. In \nyears past, in the matter of electricity, you had a distribution area \nwhere an electric company generated the electricity for everybody. Now \nwe are finding more and more that we generate electricity one place and \nthe market is somewhere else. So you have to have transmission. We can \nfind more efficient ways for transmission with the kind of research \nthat we do and take the same transmission line and make some changes in \nit, and it has much more capacity. But you have to move to do that.\n\n  We find that almost all the generation plants built in the last \nseveral years are oil fueled. The fact is, if you really want to look \nat the future, there are many more uses for oil than for coal. We ought \nto be using coal for the generation of electricity and oil and gas for \nother kinds of functions. That makes a lot of sense. But we fail to set \nthe incentives to cause ourselves to be able to do that.\n  After all of our needs for electricity, we find that absent hydro, \nwhich makes it about 7 percent, the renewables represent only 3 percent \nof our electric supply. People keep talking about renewables. The fact \nis that until we do some more research, making them more efficient, \nthey are not going to be able to have a significant impact. But there \nis a possibility of doing that. That is what this policy is all about. \nThat is what we need to be doing, is moving forward to find some ways \nfor transmission and to do those kinds of things.\n  We really have a lot of opportunities to move forward, and I think we \ncan do that. As I said, I come from a place where we have probably the \nrichest source of coal. We provide about 14 percent of the coal now of \nthe United States. We are seventh in oil production and fifth in gas \nproduction. Those are challenges. And there is really kind of an \nexciting opportunity to do some more with hydrogen. Take coal and \nmanufacturing hydrogen, which can be used for cars and homes and for \nmany things--probably the cleanest energy we have talked about.\n  There are some opportunities to do a better job with nuclear power. \nWe have States in which about 30 percent of the energy is produced by \nnuclear power. We have to be able to do more work and research, \nparticularly on waste--probably the cleanest resource for the \nproduction of electricity.\n  I am simply trying to say that I understand there are different views \nabout how some of these things are done. Obviously, that is legitimate \nand we ought to talk about that. But we ought to move forward and get \nthe idea that this matter of energy policy is one of the most important \nthings we can do. We have done something on taxes, and we are going to \ndo something on health care. If we can do something on energy as well, \nwe will have one of the most productive periods we have had for a long \ntime. We have a great opportunity to do that.\n  So I certainly urge that we take a long look at what we are doing and \nfind a way to move forward. Everyone should be given the opportunity to \nput in their amendments. That is fine. But you cannot keep waiting for \ndays and days to get all the amendments in. We have been talking about \nthis for several weeks, yet we keep hearing, ``We have not drafted our \namendment yet.'' If you are serious about an amendment, get it drafted \nand get it out there. Let's deal with it and move forward in \naccomplishing the goal we have before us, which is a great opportunity \nto move forward in this country economically, to create jobs, and to do \nmore for security and make our life better over a period of time, which \nis something we all seek to do.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments in this \ndebate on the Energy bill to talk about an amendment that my colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden and I will offer next week. He is the lead \nsponsor on the amendment. I certainly hope we can win strong bipartisan \nsupport for what will be an effort to make this Energy bill better, to \nimprove it, and improve it in a way that does justice for the taxpayers \nby eliminating what I think is an inappropriate and unnecessary subsidy \nfor the energy industry in general, and for the nuclear power industry \nin particular.\n  Our amendment will strike one small section of the bill. It is a \nsection that provides federally backed loan guarantees for new nuclear \npowerplant construction.\n  I strongly believe we should have a diversified energy supply in this \ncountry. We should have competitive energy markets, and nuclear power \nis a very important part of that mix. Nuclear power has proven itself \ntime and again. It has been cost effective and environmentally sound. \nWe have worked through tough, but important, legislation to deal with \nthe nuclear waste issue in the last session of Congress. In my own \nState of New Hampshire, we have a powerplant at Seabrook that has had \nan outstanding record, an excellent record for both efficiency and \nsafety, and it continues to generate a very substantial portion of the \nelectricity used not just in New Hampshire but throughout New England.\n  At the same time, nuclear power, like coal-fired electricity or gas-\nfired power, wind, solar, or hydroelectric power ought to be competing \nin the marketplace on a level playing field. However, there is a \nprovision in this Energy bill that provides Federal loan guarantees to \npay for up to half the cost of as many as six new nuclear powerplants. \nThat is a pretty significant financial commitment, and a level of \nsupport will have to be made by the taxpayers of the United States.\n  If we look at the estimated cost of six plants--perhaps $3 billion \nper plant, maybe a little bit less, maybe a little bit more--and take a \nlook at half the cost of the plant in the Federal guarantee, we could \nconceivably be looking at a long-term cost of $10 billion or $15 \nbillion. That is a cost that American taxpayers should not be asked to \nbear. That is one of the reasons Senator Wyden and I are offering our \namendment.\n  A second concern is the simple precedent this would set: providing \nFederal loan guarantees for any private powerplant construction. Again, \nmy concern is not directed at the fact that the loan guarantees are for \nnuclear powerplants, or for large powerplants. It is about private \nplant production. If it were gas-fired plants, coal-fired plants, or \nnew hydroelectric plants for which we were giving Federal guarantees, I \nwould have the same concerns. We are setting a bad precedent in public \npolicy when we offer this kind of tax subsidy.\n\n[[Page S7435]]\n\n  We have to ask time and again, Are we being fair to the taxpayers? \nAre we being fair to the marketplace? I do not believe we are. I think \nthis kind of a program, this kind of a tax subsidy would distort our \nenergy markets and would distort the performance of our capital markets \nwhere private companies go out to borrow week after week, month after \nmonth, and year after year.\n\n  We need an energy policy in this country that promotes a strong \ndiverse supply of energy and promotes competition. Sometimes that means \nmaking sure the Federal Government treads very lightly in the \nmarketplace. This provision in the bill does not do that by any \nstretch.\n  The amendment we will offer is a commonsense amendment, and in the \nlong run, our energy markets and even our nuclear power industry will \nbe better served by striking this unnecessary subsidy. If we are going \nto have a healthy and strong nuclear power industry, what that really \nmeans is we have to have commonsense regulations. We need to work hard \nto streamline and to extend some of the relicensing capabilities so \nthose plants that have performed well can continue to operate for an \nextended period of time. And, of course, we need to deal with the issue \nof nuclear waste, which we have begun to do through our efforts last \nyear, and which I support.\n  The amendment that will be offered by Senator Wyden and me is an \namendment that has support from the National Taxpayers Union, from \nCitizens Against Government Waste, and a number of groups that have \nquite a reputation for looking out for taxpayer interest.\n  It also has support from a number of environmental groups, including \nthe League of Conservation Voters and USPIRG, groups that have tried to \nlook out for environmental interests that raise concerns for them as \nwell.\n  It is a broad coalition of groups coming at this from different \nperspectives, but all recognize this section of the bill is not good \npublic policy, this is not the right kind of approach if we want to \nhave competitive energy markets, and it certainly is not the right kind \nof approach for taxpayers.\n  I thank Senator Wyden for working with me on this amendment. We are \nworking on an agreement that will allow us to bring this amendment \nforward on Tuesday with at least 2 hours of debate and an up-or-down \nvote on the amendment.\n  I thank Chairman Domenici for working with us on that agreement and \nallowing us to get this important amendment to the floor, give us a \nvote, and see if we can save the taxpayers a lot of money and help \nimprove this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, the Senator from New \nHampshire has said it very well. I will offer just a couple of \nadditional remarks. It is clear there is going to be an effort, as this \nis discussed in the Senate, to simply make this an ``Are you for \nnuclear power or are you against nuclear power?'' issue. I think that \nwould be very unfortunate.\n  I said earlier when we began to discuss this, I have inimitable \nabilities that over the years have managed to make both sides of the \nnuclear power debate unhappy with me. In a sense, I hope we can do as \nSenator Sununu has done, which is to keep the focus on the taxpayer \nquestion. I urge Senators, in particular, as they make up their minds \non this issue to look at two important reports. The Congressional \nBudget Office report and the report done by the Congressional Research \nService are particularly illuminating in that the Congressional Budget \nOffice report talks about how, in their judgment, there is a more than \n50-percent probability that these plants will not be successful, that \nthey will fail. And the Congressional Research Service, in their \nanalysis, indicates if that is the case, taxpayers would be on the hook \nfor in the vicinity of $16 billion.\n  In my part of the world, this is not exactly an abstract issue. In \nfact, with the WPPSS debacle, which was the largest municipal bond \nfailure in the country's history, four out of the five facilities were \nnot, in fact, even built, and the people in my region and many \ninvestors, of course, were on the hook.\n  If the scenario of the Congressional Budget Office were to come to \npass, all of our constituents--all of them--would, in effect, be \nexposed to these very significant costs.\n  That is why Senator Sununu and I are going to try our best, between \nnow and the Tuesday vote, to make sure that for us this is first and \nforemost a taxpayers' issue.\n  To try to drive that point home, we had a discussion about how this \naffects other aspects of energy development. If this provision stays in \nthe bill, in other words the amendment that the Senator from New \nHampshire and I are offering is unsuccessful, nuclear energy would be \nthe only part of this field that would get a direct subsidy for \nconstructing a facility.\n  For example, the distinguished chairman of the committee, who has \nbeen very gracious to the two of us in terms of working on process and \nall of the issues towards getting this offered, talked at some length \nabout wind and talked about subsidies for wind. Well, in fact, when \nwind is produced, there are various credits and incentives, which I \nguess are very appropriate, but there is no subsidy for constructing \nany other facility under this legislation other than in the nuclear \narea.\n  In fact, right now there is nothing preventing any utility from going \nforward with a nuclear project simply by going to the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission and getting a license to build the plant.\n  Let me repeat that. Anybody who wants to build a nuclear powerplant \nin this country simply has to go to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nand get the license. They can do that if they satisfy the safety \nstandards.\n  The issue, as propounded by Senator Sununu and myself, is whether or \nnot there should be these very large subsidies; whether or not the \ntaxpayer should be exposed, in the vicinity of $16 billion, with \nrespect to building these plants.\n  I do not think this is an issue about whether one is for or against \nnuclear power, and that is why the National Taxpayers Union and a host \nof other organizations that have been watchdogs for taxpayers have made \nthis a priority item. In their letter to me, they took the position \nthat they are neither for nor against nuclear power. They say that \nexplicitly in the letter. What they and a number of other taxpayer \nwatchdogs are concerned about is the $16 billion exposure for taxpayers \nthat is contained in this provision.\n  So I am very pleased that before long we will be able to enter into a \nconsent agreement for an up-or-down vote on Tuesday on the Wyden-Sununu \nlegislation. I think the chairman of the Energy Committee will be \nleading us in that discussion with respect to a UC before too long.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is still in the Chamber, and I thank \nhim for all of his involvement in this. He has a long record of being a \ntaxpayer watchdog, and that was, in fact, the special reason why I \nthought it was so important for the two of us to try to do this \ntogether.\n  I am sure between now and Tuesday, as this is discussed, to some \nextent some will try to make this into a referendum on whether one is \nfor or against nuclear power. I will be doing my best to try to make \nsure that it is a taxpayers' issue. That is central and critical to me, \nand I look forward to the discussion that we will have on Tuesday. We \nshould have a UC ready to go before long. I thank Chairman Domenici for \nhis willingness to work out the procedure on it, and I am particularly \ngrateful to my cosponsor, Senator Sununu.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am quite sure that before we are \nfinished--if we finish, and I hope we will--the Senate and those who \nare interested in energy policy will hear a lot about the various kinds \nof energy that are provided, as a matter of policy, in this Energy \nbill.\n  I am having a lot of difficulty understanding the Senate these days. \nI regret to say that almost every amendment we talk about some Senator \nis unable to be present. It is either they had to leave early or they \nhad a previous engagement or there is something else they had to do. So \nit seems as if we cannot get the amendments done. But the Democrats are \ngoing to help us try to convince Senators that\n\n[[Page S7436]]\n\nthey ought to start to list their amendments soon so we will have some \nidea, sooner rather than later, the extent of amendments we are going \nto have on this bill.\n  On the issue of nuclear power, before we are finished with this \ndebate, we will lay before the Senate what the Energy Committee, in its \nmarkup of this bill, did so as to make sure the United States had an \narray of energy sources during the next 10, 20, and 30 years.\n  We have tax credits for solar energy. We have tax credits for wind \nenergy. The Senator argues that is different. Well, maybe we ought to \nchange and have just plain tax credits for nuclear power. Maybe there \nwould be no objection to it. Perhaps we could convert what we thought \nwas a better way to do this to some kind of a tax credit, which would \nmean that if they produced, and only if they produced, would they get \nany credit.\n  What we did in the instance of nuclear power was to say if the \nSecretary of Energy, at some time, finds that the United States needs a \nnuclear powerplant because it needs a diversity of energy or it needs \nit because there is some clean air problem, then to a creditworthy \napplicant, a creditworthy builder, of a nuclear powerplant, they may \nsubsidize half the cost with a guaranteed loan.\n  Now, one can talk about that in terms of how much that is going to \ncost. The Senator from New Mexico assumes we look at all of these from \nthe standpoint of the benefits, what are the benefits to America?\n  Twelve years ago, this Senator started looking at nuclear power. With \nthe passage of each year, as I studied it and wrote about it and \nthought about it, I became more embarrassed and more ashamed of what \nthe United States of America had done with this superb technology that \nwe had invented, that was being used in the world and that we had set \non the shelf because a few people frightened us to death.\n  Do people know that today two nuclear powerplants are being built in \nTaiwan? They are building a modern, General Electric design. Guess what \nthey tell us the cost is going to be. In fact, I believe we will \nintroduce a letter next week during the argument. The costs will be \nvery close to the equivalent costs of what we are now paying to build \nnatural gas burned, natural gas fed, powerplants. Who would have \nthought it?\n  What has happened is, since natural gas is the singular source of \nenergy, the cost is skyrocketing because there is no competition. We \nintend there to be competition, not only from nuclear but we have ample \nmoney in this bill for great research in coal, too. We have over $2 \nbillion in research for clean coal. It does not produce any coal. It \njust says do the research to try to make technology work.\n  What we have done overall for the first time in the last 20 years is \nto say, let us develop a nuclear policy for the greatest nation on \nEarth and let us show the world that we have not abandoned the safest \nway to produce energy, electricity for people in the world. Let us show \nthat we are not abandoning that. Let us show that we are going to lead \nagain. And so there is a three-pronged policy. The Price-Anderson Act, \nwhich makes it possible for the private sector to be involved, is made \npermanent.\n\n  This bill says, let's build a demonstration project in the State of \nIdaho, a brandnew concept, so we will build a nuclear powerplant that \nwill be passive. By passive, we mean we will prove it cannot burn. \nThere are people who speculate a nuclear powerplant can burn. They have \nspoken of its burning its way through the earth. This new powerplant \nwill be physically made so it is passive. It will produce high enough \ntemperatures so you can produce hydrogen for the new hydrogen economy \nwe are looking at.\n  America is close to being able to build a nuclear powerplant again, \nlike they are being built in Taiwan, like they have been built year \nafter year in France. France produces 80 percent of its electricity \nfrom nuclear power. They do not run around frightened to death of \ntechnology like the United States. If anyone wants to see France's \nnuclear waste, they will take you to a gymnasium. You can walk into the \ngymnasium, like walking into a school, and walk on a glass floor. One \nmight ask, where is the waste? You are walking on it. It is \nencapsulated for 50 years at least, and nothing can happen to it while \nthey figure out what to do with it.\n  What does the greatest nation on Earth do? We sit paralyzed, waiting \naround for something to happen in Nevada. I am sure we will hear that \nargument before we finish the debate next Tuesday. We know that is an \nengineering issue that will be solved.\n  What we do not know: Will the United States continue to remain \ndependent upon natural gas almost exclusively or will we say it may be \ntime for American companies to build one or two nuclear powerplants? We \nunderstand they are very close. They have experienced litigation and \nother impediments. It is hard to get over the hurdle, over the hump. We \nhave asked, what would it take to start a couple of them? What a day, \nwhen America starts a couple new nuclear powerplants. We would be \nentering an era of cheap electricity, available to everyone, poor \ncountries and rich countries. Guess what. There will be no pollution \nproblem. The ambient air will be affected zero.\n  We knew it was worth the effort to get America going again regarding \nits strength and power as the inventor of the safest energy ever \nproduced by mankind to this point. We could have put in tax credits: If \nyou produce something, we will give you a tax credit. Then our friends \nwould not be making the argument; you are giving them something before \nthey produce. We chose what we thought was most simple and least \nexpensive to the Federal Government, saying, if necessary, you can give \nthem half the costs in a loan guarantee, to get us going again.\n  That is the whole issue. Should we do that or should we not do that? \nBefore we are finished, the Senate will understand, in spite of it \nhaving difficulty with this Energy bill--we cannot seem to get people \nto focus on the Energy bill--but they will understand the significance \nof this issue. They will understand that the fear regarding nuclear \npower and nuclear fuel rods is about nothing but a red herring. They \nare nothing that engineering competence cannot handle.\n  I close this opening argument on nuclear power and whether or not it \nis safe by saying to everyone listening or worrying about nuclear power \nversus the other power in America, there are over 100 American Navy \nvessels on the high seas of the world with engines that are nuclear \npowerplants. Nuclear powerplants run battleships, run aircraft \ncarriers. They have fuel rods in them. They carry them everywhere on \nthe seas. They are at every port in the free world, save one in New \nZealand because New Zealand has an agreement against it. They are so \nsafe, there are boats and ships all around the world that have nuclear \npowerplants on board, with nuclear waste sitting right there in the \nhulls of the ships.\n\n  When you add all that, it is the safest way to produce energy for the \nworld in the future. Our package includes the research facility we will \nbuild in the State of my good friend who is sitting on my right. We say \nto our executive branch, in the event you think it is necessary, you \ncan issue a loan agreement for half the cost of a nuclear powerplant to \nget it going.\n  I understand there are those who will just add up costs under the \nworst of circumstances. I would rather add up all the pluses and take a \nrisk that is worthwhile. If ever there was a risk that was worthwhile, \nit is a plain and simple risk to revive nuclear power in America for \nAmerica and for the world. That is what is at issue in this bill.\n  Those who argue not to gamble any money on this will not raise a \npinky on spending $1.6 billion to research hydrogen, for a new hydrogen \neconomy. It may not work. It may be thrown away. But it is in this bill \nto start the idea of engines that are going to use the new fuel. We are \nspending that money. We are not guaranteeing it. We are spending it. We \nare not guaranteeing General Motors. We are saying, enter into a \npartnership. We will spend some money. We hope it works.\n  This is an issue of risk. When you look at the other kinds of fuels, \nall of which we promote, none of which we shortchange, will we say \nAmerica is a coal country, spend money to make the coal clean so that \nthe ambient air of America is, indeed, clean? And spend plenty of it. \nWe say, build windmills\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\nand give huge credits for them to such an extent that there may be too \nmany of them built in the next decade; we have to pass an national \nordinance so they will not build them too close to some of our cities \nbecause there will be so many of them when this bill is passed with the \nsubsidy included, the tax subsidy that will be attached. Geothermal--\nthere are plenty of subsidies. Every kind of energy you can imagine, we \nhave said: Help it move along. At the same time, we have put into a \npackage that rare opportunity for the United States to face up to the \nfact that, although we invented nuclear power, we hid from it. Others \ndidn't. It is time we come back and revisit it. It is time that, as a \npackage, coupled with all the other policies, we take a little risk in \nterms of its future, for the future of the world.\n\n  Mr. President, I have a series of remarks that I delivered on the \nnuclear subject on October 31, 1977, at Harvard University, which \nsummarizes my views to that point. I ask unanimous consent that they be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         A New Nuclear Paradigm\n\n                     (By Senator Pete V. Domenici)\n\n       Earlier this week, I spent substantial time on the subjects \n     of nuclear non-proliferation, the proposed Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty, nuclear waste policies, and nuclear weapons \n     design issues. The forums for these discussions were open and \n     closed hearings of two major sub-committees of the United \n     States Senate, a breakfast where two Cabinet secretaries \n     joined 10 United States Senators, and private discussions \n     with specialists in these fields.\n       During the week before, I spent time on the question of \n     whether or not a 1,200 foot road should be built in a \n     National Monument, a monument whose enabling legislation I \n     authored almost a decade ago.\n       Without demeaning any person's sense of perspective, I have \n     to not to you today that for every person who attended the \n     nuclear hearings, 50 attended the road hearings. And, for \n     every inch of newspaper coverage the nuclear matters \n     attracted, the road attracted 50 inches.\n       Strategic national issues just don't command a large \n     audience. In no area has this been more evident during these \n     last 25 years than in the critical and interrelated public \n     policy questions involving energy, growth, and the role of \n     nuclear technologies. As we leave the 20th Century, arguably \n     the American Century, and head for a new millennium, we truly \n     need to confront these strategic issues with careful logic \n     and sound science.\n       We live in the dominant economic, military, and cultural \n     entity in the world. Our principles of government and \n     economics are increasingly becoming the principles of the \n     world.\n       There are no secrets to our success, and there is no \n     guarantee that, in the coming century, we will be the \n     principal beneficiary of the seeds we have sown. There is \n     competition in the world and serious strategic issues facing \n     the United States cannot be overlooked.\n       The United States--like the rest of the industrialized \n     world--is aging rapidly as our birth rates decline. Between \n     1995 and the year 2030, the number of people in the United \n     States over age 65 will double from 34 million to 68 million. \n     Just to maintain our standard of living, we need dramatic \n     increases in productivity as a larger fraction of our \n     population drops out of the workforce.\n       By 2030, 30 percent of the population of the industrialized \n     nations will be over 60. The rest of the world--the countries \n     that today are ``unindustrialized''--will have only 16 \n     percent of their population over age 60 and will be ready to \n     boom.\n       As those nations build economies modeled after ours, there \n     will be intense competition for the resources that underpin \n     modern economies.\n       When it comes to energy, we have a serious, strategic \n     problem. The United States currently consumes 25 percent of \n     the world's energy production. However, developing countries \n     are on track to increase their energy consumption by 48 \n     percent between 1992 and 2010.\n       The United States currently produces and imports raw energy \n     resources worth over $150 billion per year. Approximately $50 \n     billion of that is imported oil or natural gas. We then \n     process that material into energy feedstocks such as \n     gasoline. Those feedstocks, the energy we consume in our \n     cars, factories, and electric plants, are worth $505 \n     billion per year.\n       So, while we debate defense policy every year, we don't \n     debate energy policy, even though it already costs us twice \n     as much as our defense, other countries' consumption is \n     growing dramatically, and energy shortages are likely to be a \n     prime driver of future military challenges.\n       When I came to the Senate a quarter of a century ago, we \n     debated our dependence on foreign sources of energy. We \n     discussed energy independence, but we largely decided not to \n     talk about nuclear policy options in public.\n       At the same time, the anti-nuclear movement conducted their \n     campaign in a way that was tremendously appealing to mass \n     media. Scientists, used to the peer-reviewed ways of \n     scientific discourse, were unprepared to counter. They lost \n     the debate.\n       Serious discussion about the role of nuclear energy in \n     world stability, energy independence, and national security \n     retreated into academia or classified sessions.\n       Today, it is extraordinarily difficult to conduct a debate \n     on nuclear issues. Usually, the only thing produced is nasty \n     political fallout.\n       I am going to bring back to the market place of ideas a \n     more forthright discussion of nuclear policy.\n       My objective tonight is not to talk about talking about a \n     policy. I am going to make some policy proposals. Tomorrow \n     there are sessions on energy policy and nuclear \n     proliferation. I'll give them something to talk about.\n       I am going to tell you that we made some bad decisions in \n     the past that we have to change. Then I will tell you about \n     some decisions we need to make now.\n       First, we need to recognize that the premises underpinning \n     some of our nuclear policy decisions are wrong. In 1977, \n     President Carter halted all U.S. efforts to reprocess spent \n     nuclear fuel and develop mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) for our \n     civilian reactors on the grounds that the plutonium could be \n     diverted and eventually transformed into bombs. He argued \n     that the United States should halt its reprocessing program \n     as an example to other countries in the hope that they would \n     follow suit.\n       The premise of the decision was wrong. Other countries do \n     not follow the example of the United States if we make a \n     decision that other countries view as economically or \n     technically unsound. France, Great Britain, Japan, and Russia \n     all now have MOX fuel programs.\n       This failure to address an incorrect premise has harmed our \n     efforts to deal with spent nuclear fuel and the disposition \n     of excess weapons material, as well as our ability to \n     influence international reactor issues.\n       I'll cite another example. We regulate exposure to low \n     levels of radiation using a so-called ``linear no-threshold'' \n     model, the premise of which is that there is no ``safe'' \n     level of exposure.\n       Our model forces us to regulate radiation to levels \n     approaching 1 percent of natural background despite the fact \n     that natural background can vary by 50 percent within the \n     United States.\n       On the other hand, many scientists think that living cells, \n     after millions of years of exposure to naturally occurring \n     radiation, have adapted such that low levels of radiation \n     cause very little if any harm. In fact, there are some \n     studies that suggest exactly the opposite is true--that low \n     doses of radiation may even improve health.\n       The truth is important. We spend over $5 billion each year \n     to clean contaminated DOE sites to levels below 5 percent of \n     background.\n       In this year's Energy and Water Appropriations Act, we \n     initiated a ten year program to understands how radiation \n     affects genomes and cells so that we can really understand \n     how radiation affects living organisms. For the first time, \n     we will develop radiation protection standards that are based \n     on actual risk.\n       Let me cite another bad decision. You may recall that \n     earlier this year, Hudson Foods recalled 25 million pounds of \n     beef, some of which was contaminated by E. Coli. The \n     Administration proposed tougher penalties and mandatory \n     recalls that cost millions.\n       What you may not know is that the E. Coli bacteria can be \n     killed by irradiating beef products. The irradiation has no \n     effect on the beef. The FDA does not allow the process to be \n     used on beef, even though it is allowed for poultry, pork, \n     fruit and vegetables, largely because of opposition from some \n     consumer groups that question its safety.\n       But there is no scientific evidence of danger. In fact, \n     when the decision is left up to scientists, they opt for \n     irradiation--the food that goes into space with our \n     astronauts is irradiated.\n       I've talked about bad past decisions that haunt us today. \n     Now I want to talk about decisions we need to make today.\n       The President has outlined a program to stabilize the U.S. \n     production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases at \n     1990 levels by some time between 2008 and 2012. \n     Unfortunately, the President's goals are not achievable \n     without seriously impacting our economy.\n       Our national laboratories have studied the issue. Their \n     report indicates that to get to the President's goals we \n     would have to impose a $50/ton carbon tax. That would result \n     in an increase of 12.5 cents/gallon for gas and 1.5 cents/\n     kilowatt-hour for electricity--almost a doubling of the \n     current cost of coal or natural gas-generated electricity.\n       What the President should have said is that we need nuclear \n     energy to meet his goal. After all, in 1996, nuclear power \n     plants prevented the emission of 147 million metric tons of \n     carbon, 2.5 million tons of nitrogen oxides, and 5 million \n     tons of sulfur dioxide. Our electric utilities' emissions of \n     those greenhouse gases were 25 percent lower than they would \n     have been if fossil fuels had been used instead of nuclear \n     energy.\n       Ironically, the technology we are relying on to achieve \n     these results is over twenty years old. We have developed the \n     next generation of nuclear power plants--which have\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\n     been certified by the NRC and are now being sold overseas. \n     They are even safer than our current models. Better yet, we \n     have technologies under development like passively safe \n     reactors, lead-bismuth reactors, and advanced liquid metal \n     reactors that generate less waste and are proliferation \n     resistant.\n       An excellent report by Dr. John Holdren for the President's \n     Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, calls for a \n     sharply enhanced national effort. It urges a ``properly \n     focused R effort to see if the problems plaguing fission \n     energy can be overcome--economics, safety, waste, and \n     proliferation.'' I have long urged the conclusion of this \n     report--that we dramatically increase spending in these areas \n     for reasons ranging from reactor safety to non-proliferation.\n       I have not overlooked that nuclear waste issues loom as a \n     roadblock to increased nuclear utilization. I will return to \n     that subject.\n       For now, let me turn from nuclear power to nuclear weapons \n     issues.\n       Our current stockpile is set by bilateral agreements with \n     Russia. Bilateral agreements make sense if we are certain who \n     our future nuclear adversary will be and are useful to force \n     a transparent build-down within Russia. But I will warn you \n     that our next nuclear adversary may not be Russia--we do not \n     want to find ourselves limited by a treaty with Russia in a \n     conflict with another entity.\n       We need to decide what stockpile levels we really need for \n     our own best interests to deal with any future adversary.\n       For that reason, I suggest that, within the limits imposed \n     by START II, the United States move away from further treaty \n     imposed limitations and move to what I call a ``threat-based \n     stockpile.''\n       Based upon the threat I perceive right now, I think our \n     stockpile could be reduced. We need to challenge our military \n     planners to identify the minimum necessary stockpile size.\n       At the same time, as our stockpile is reduced and we are \n     precluded from testing, we have to increase our confidence in \n     the integrity of the remaining stockpile and our ability \n     to reconstitute if the threat changes. Programs like \n     science-based stockpile stewardship must be nurtured and \n     supported carefully.\n       As we seriously review stockpile size, we should also \n     consider stepping back from the nuclear cliff by de-alerting \n     and carefully reexamining the necessity of the ground-based \n     log of the nuclear triad.\n       Costs certainly aren't the primary driver for our stockpile \n     size, but if some of the actions I've discussed were taken, \n     I'b bet that as a bonus we'd see major budget savings. Now we \n     spend about $30 billion each year supporting the triad.\n       Earlier I discussed the need to revisit some incorrect \n     premises that caused us to make bad decisions in the past. I \n     said that one of them, regarding reprocessing and MOX fuel, \n     is ham-stringing our efforts to permanently dismantle nuclear \n     weapons.\n       The dismantlement of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons \n     in Russia and the United States has left both countries with \n     large inventories of perfectly machined classified components \n     that could allow each country to rapidly rebuild its nuclear \n     arsenals.\n       Both countries should set a goal of converting those excess \n     inventories into non-weapon shapes as quickly as possible. \n     The more permanent those transformations and the more \n     verification that can accompany the conversion of that \n     material, the better.\n       Technical solutions exist. Pits can be transformed into \n     non-weapons shapes and weapon material can be burned in \n     reactors as MOX fuel, which by the way is what the National \n     Academy of Sciences has recommended. However, the proposal to \n     dispose of weapons plutonium as MOX runs into that old \n     premise that MOX is bad despite its widespread use by our \n     allies.\n       MOX is the best technical solution. I challenge you to \n     develop a proposal that brings the economics of the MOX fuel \n     cycle together with the need to dispose of weapons grade \n     plutonium. Ideally, incentives can be developed to speed \n     Russians materials conversion while reducing the cost of the \n     U.S. effort. The idea for the U.S. Russian HEU Agreement \n     originated at MIT, and I know that Harvard does not like to \n     be upstaged.\n       I said earlier that I would not advocate increased use of \n     nuclear and ignore the nuclear waste problem. The path we've \n     been following on Yucca Mountain sure isn't leading anywhere \n     very fast. I'm about ready to reexamine the whole premise for \n     Yucca Mountain.\n       We're on a course to bury all our spent nuclear fuel, \n     despite the fact that a spent nuclear fuel rod still has 60-\n     75% of its energy content--and despite the fact that \n     Nevadeans need to be convinced that the material will not \n     create a hazard for over 100,000 years.\n       Our decision to ban reprocessing forced us to a repository \n     solution. Meanwhile, many other nations think it is dumb to \n     just bury the energy-rich spent fuel and are reprocessing.\n       I propose we go somewhere between reprocessing and \n     permanent disposal by using interim storage to keep our \n     options open. Incidentally, 65 Senators agreed with the \n     important of interim storage, but the Administration has only \n     threatened to veto any such progress and has shown no \n     willingness to discuss alternatives.\n       Let me highlight one attractive option. A group from \n     several of our largest companies, using technologies \n     developed at three of our national laboratories and from \n     Russian institutes and their nuclear navy, discussed with me \n     an approach to use that waste for electrical generation. They \n     use an accelerator, not a reactor, so there is never any \n     critical assembly. There is minimal processing, but carefully \n     done so that weapons-grade materials are never separated out \n     and so that international verification can be used. And when \n     they get done, only a little material goes into a \n     repository--but now the half lives are changed so that it's a \n     hazard for perhaps 300 years a far cry from 100,000 years. It \n     sure would be easier to get acceptance of a 300 year, rather \n     than a 100,000 year, hazard, especially when the 300 year \n     case is also providing a source of clean electricity. This \n     approach, called Accelerator Transmutation of Waste, is an \n     area I want to see investigated aggressively.\n       I still haven't touched on all the issues imbedded in \n     maximizing our nation's benefit from nuclear technologies, \n     and I can't do that without a much longer speech.\n       For example, I haven't discussed the increasingly desperate \n     need in the country for low level waste facilities like Ward \n     Valley in California. In California, important medical and \n     research procedures are at risk because the Administration \n     continues to block the State government from fulfilling their \n     responsibilities to care for low level waste.\n       And I haven't touched on the tremendous window of \n     opportunity that we now have in the Former Soviet Union to \n     expand programs that protect fissile material from moving \n     onto the black market or to shift the activities of former \n     Soviet weapons scientists onto commercial projects. Along \n     with Senators Nunn and Lugar, I've led the charge for these \n     programs. Those are programs a foreign aid, I believe they \n     are sadly mistaken.\n       We are realizing some of the benefits of nuclear \n     technologies today, but only a fraction of what we could \n     realize--\n       Nuclear weapons, for all their horror, brought to an end 50 \n     years of world-wide wars in which 60 million people died.\n       Nuclear power is providing about 20% of our electricity \n     needs now and many of our citizens enjoy healthier longer \n     lives through improved medical procedures that depend on \n     nuclear process.\n       But we aren't tapping the full potential of the nucleus for \n     additional benefits. In the process, we are short-changing \n     our citizens.\n       I hope in these remarks that I have succeeded in raising \n     your awareness of the opportunities that our nation should be \n     seizing to secure a better future for our citizens through \n     careful reevaluation of many ill-conceived fears, policies \n     and decisions that have seriously constrained our use of \n     nuclear technologies.\n       Today I announce my intention to lead a new dialogue with \n     serious discussion about the full range of nuclear \n     technologies. I intend to provide national leadership to \n     overcome barriers.\n       While some may continue to lament that the nuclear genie is \n     out of his proverbial bottle, I'm ready to focus on \n     harnessing that genie as effectively and fully as possible, \n     for the largest set of benefits for our citizens.\n       I challenge all of you to join me in this dialogue to help \n     secure these benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers and the two sponsors of the \namendment, the Wyden-Sununu amendment, agreed that I ask for this \nunanimous consent, and I will do so: That on Tuesday, when the Senate \nconsiders the Wyden-Sununu amendment relating to commercial nuclear \nplants, there be 120 minutes equally divided in the usual form; \nprovided further that no amendments to the amendment or the language \nproposed to be stricken be in order prior to the vote in relation to \nthe amendment; and if the amendment is not disposed of, the amendment \nremain debatable and amendable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. We are also very close to working something out on the \nmatter that has been holding up the Energy bill today, and that is the \nchild tax credit. We are within minutes of being able to enter into an \nagreement on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have arrived at a time and a defined \nperiod for debate on the Wyden amendment to subtitle B of this act. I \nthink it is critical that we bring this issue to the forefront and make \na decision on it.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Energy Committee, \nhas done an excellent job in the last 20 minutes outlining the dynamics \nof this major piece of legislation for our country and the kinds of \nissues embodied in it that are so critical to all of us as we debate \nthe general issue of energy and this particular subtitle that relates \nto\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\nthe development of new technology but, more importantly, the deployment \nof the concept of new reactor design into actual producing reactors in \nthe United States. The Senator from New Mexico is so accurate in his \noverall review of where we are as a nation with energy or the absence \nthereof.\n  My colleague from Oregon and I live in the Pacific Northwest, where \nhydro is dominant as a part of our energy-producing capability. Even \nthat marvelous, clean resource today is under attack. Why? Because it \nimpounds rivers to produce hydro, and by impounding rivers, it changes \nthe character of those rivers. Certain interest groups want those \nrivers, in large part, by some estimation, to be freed. So they wanted \nto reshape hydro. In all instances, it has reduced the overall \nproductive capability of hydro facilities.\n  We have frustration in a variety of other areas. The Senator from New \nMexico outlined our problem with burning coal under the Clean Air Act, \nand the ambient air as a result of that, and the cost now being driven \nagainst retrofitting and new coal-burning designs to produce energy.\n  That is in part--not in total but in part--what has developed a \nwillingness on the part of our country, I believe, to renew our nuclear \noption and possibly to renew it under a new design concept, under a \npassive reactor design concept that the Senator from New Mexico has \ntalked about.\n  Passive reactor design means, simply, one that reacts on its own when \ncertain conditions arise. The human factor doesn't necessarily have to \nbe there to start throwing switches and making adjustments because \nthose kinds of things happen automatically. We believe our engineering \ntalent in this country is now capable of that kind of design \ndevelopment. In doing that design, we would couple with it an \nelectrolysis process that would make the reactor itself so much more \nefficient that it would run at peak load at all times, as reactors \nshould in performing best.\n  But power demand isn't always constant. When you can switch that load \nto development of hydrogen fuels, through the electrolysis process, and \nthen convert it back to use within a power grid, you make for \nphenomenal efficiencies and the cost of production goes down \ndramatically.\n  In doing that, in bringing back to this country an abundant source of \nelectrical energy and a reliable supply to our grid system--a system we \nare working to improve today through the development of regional \ntransmission authorities and a variety of other things that tie us \ntogether--we found out a few years ago in the Pacific Northwest that it \nhas certain liabilities. If the energy in the system itself in other \nparts of the grid isn't abundant, and it starts pulling power from us \nand forcing our power rates up, it can be a problem. Where it is \nproduced with an abundance in the system and the system is fully \ninterrelated and interconnected all can generally benefit.\n  As a result of bringing some of these new concepts on line, where we \nare actively subsidizing other areas of production, we thought it was \nreasonable to bring to the floor of the Senate a similar concept, to \ntake some of the risk out of new design development for the commercial \nside, and to do so in a way that our country has always done--to use \npublic resources to advance certain technological causes and, out of \nthose causes and their development, to generate phenomenal consumer \nbenefits.\n  There is no greater consumer benefit in this country today than \nreliable, high-quality electrical energy at reasonable prices. Our \nworld runs on it. Our world's wealth depends on it. This country's \nworkforce depends on it.\n  What we have brought to the floor in this Energy bill is not a hunt \nand a pick. It is not a political decision versus another political \ndecision. That is not the case. It is not green versus nongreen. That \nis not the case.\n  What the chairman of the Energy Committee has said in this bill, and \nwhat the committee itself has said, is that all energy is good energy \nas long as it meets certain standards, and as long as it fits within \nour environmental context, we ought to promote it and we ought to \nadvance it.\n  That is exactly what this bill does. As the Senator from New Mexico \ncharacterized it a few moments ago, we have enough credit in this bill \nto put windmills about anywhere they want to go, or are allowed to go, \nto produce energy.\n  Some would say that is great, we don't need anything else.\n  Oh, yes, we do. The reason we do is you can put a windmill everywhere \nyou can in the air sheds that can produce wind energy, and you can only \nget up to about 2 percent of total demand. That is about it.\n\n  But we ought to do it because it is clean and it is renewable and it \nis the right thing to do. But what we are already finding out in my \nState of Idaho that has a couple of wind sheds that fit, if this bill \npasses, interest groups are stepping up and saying: Oh, I don't think \nwe want that windmill there; that is a spike-tail grouse habitat; there \nare some Indian artifacts there and we certainly don't want them \ndamaged. And we don't.\n  What I am suggesting is in these most desirable of wind sheds for \nwindmills, there is going to be somebody stepping up and saying ``not \nhere.'' And they are right. They probably won't go there.\n  That is public land, by the way, not private land. On some private \nland, the same argument will occur. Simply, they don't want in their \nbackyard a machine that goes whomp, whomp, whomp and produces \nelectricity. Something about the sound disturbs their sleep. As a \nresult, my guess is some city ordinance will soon suggest, ``not in my \nbackyard.''\n  But there are some backyards where we can put wind machines and we \nwill and we already have and we ought to promote it and we ought not to \nbe selective, and we are subsidizing them by a tax credit. You bet we \nare.\n  We are going to pass that provision. That is the right and the \nappropriate thing to do.\n  We have subsidized in most instances, in one form or another, through \na tax credit or through an easing of regulation or through the ability \nto site on Federal lands, energy projects, historically, because our \ncountry, our Government, this Senate for well over 100 years has said: \nThe best thing we can do for this country to make it grow, to make it \nprosper, and to make it abundant to the working men and women of \nAmerica is a reasonable and available energy supply in whatever form \nthe marketplace takes.\n  We also know we can shape the market a bit by a subsidy, by a tax \ncredit, and we also do that.\n  We are going to do some wind. We are going to do some solar in here. \nWe hope we do clean coal technology. Certainly the coal-producing \nStates of our country want to keep producing coal, and they should. We \nshould use it, and we will.\n  There is a provision in here on which Senator Bingaman and I disagree \na little; that is, on the relicensing of hydro. We think it ought to be \nrelicensed and environmentally positive. When we can retrofit it and \nshape it, we ought to do so as we relicense it into the next century. \nBut hydro produces a nice chunk of power in this country today. We are \ngoing to relicense over 200 facilities in the next decade. That \nrepresents about 15 million American homes and 30 million megawatts of \npower. Any reduction in that productive capability means we have to \nproduce that power somewhere else.\n  Some of those old plants, when relicensed and retrofitted, may lose \nsome of their productive capability in the licensing process. We ought \nto have new supplies coming on line.\n  Several years ago, this Senate became involved in a very serious \ndebate over an issue that we call climate change. We became involved as \na nation internationally in this debate because we thought it was the \nright thing to do. We knew our global environment was heating, or \nappeared to be heating, faster than it had in the past, and we didn't \nknow why. Some argued it was the emission of greenhouse gases which \ncreated a greenhouse effect around our globe which was largely a \nproduct of the burning of hydrocarbons and that we ought to do \nsomething about it.\n  Many of us were very concerned that if we didn't have the right \nmodeling and the right measurement and the right facts to make those \ndecisions, we would shape public policy and head it in a direction that \nwas not appropriate and would allocate billions of dollars of\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\nnew resources that might put tens of thousands of people out of work if \nwe did it wrong. At the same time, there has been and there remains a \nnagging concern as to the reality of this particular situation \nglobally, environmentally. Or is it simply the natural characteristic \nof the changing world and evolving changing world?\n  We have known down through geologic time that this world has heated \nand cooled and heated and cooled. Is it the natural cycle? We didn't \nknow that. But out of all of it, we generally grew to believe that the \nless emission into the atmosphere the better off we would be.\n  This bill embodies that general philosophy--that clean energy and \nclean fuels are better, that we ought to advance them, that we ought to \nsubsidize them where necessary, and that we ought to plot them through \nthe public policy which we debate here on the floor today. Out of all \nof that, we knew one thing: Energy generated by nuclear-fueled \ngenerating systems was clean with no emissions. It is the cleanest \nsource in the country other than hydro with no emissions.\n  As a result of that, there was no question that the popularity of \nthat consensus began to grow. Other nations around the world were using \nit. The senior Senator from New Mexico spoke of France and their use of \nit. Japan, a nation once very fearful of the atom, now builds almost a \nreactor a year coming on line to produce--what? Power for its citizens, \npower for its economy, and power for its workforce. We once led the \nworld in that technology. But we fell dramatically behind over the last \nthree decades because there was a public perception fueled by some and \nfeared by some that the nuclear-generating facilities of our country \nwere not safe. Yet they have this phenomenal history of safe operation.\n\n  Through the course of all of this, and as the facilities aged, as \nthey were relicensed and retrofitted, guess what happened over the \ncourse of the last few years. As we spiked in our power demands at the \npeak of the economy in the late 1990s and as electrical prices went \nthrough the roof, the cost of operating reactors was stable; it was \nconstant. They became the least cost producers of electricity of any \ngenerating capacity in the country other than existing hydro. The world \nbegan to react in a favorable way to that.\n  All of that became a part of the production of the legislation before \nus now--to once again get this great country back into the business of \nthe research and development of new reactor systems that not only are \nin every way perceived to be safer and cleaner in the sense of waste \nproduction at end of the game, but would do something else for our \ncountry in a way that we think is the right direction; that is, the \ndevelopment of hydrogen to fuel the next generation of surface \ntransportation and to start growing our economy into an age of \nhydrogen-fueled systems, fuel cells, generating electricity, turning \nthe wheels of automobiles, trucks, and other forms of transportation; \nand, on a case-by-case basis, the potential of a fuel cell to light a \nhome, to fuel and light a given industry by having one of those on \nlocation. We believe all of those things are possible.\n  What I hope is that the Senate will agree with us that it is now time \nto lead in all aspects of energy production in this country instead of \nnibbling around the edges selectively and politically determining what \nought to be and what ought not to be because one individual thinks this \nway is better than another.\n  I have dealt with the energy issue all of my political life. While at \none time I will honestly admit I was selective, I am no longer that. I \nsupport it all. I am voting for wind. I am voting for clean coal. I \nwant to develop a responsible relicensing system for hydro. I am \nsupporting nuclear development and nuclear growth. I am supporting oil \nproduction. Why? I don't want future generations of this country to be \nfuel-starved and victim to the politics of a region of the world which \nis unstable because this Senate didn't have the wisdom to produce when \nit could have and create incentives and maximum energy production for \nour country.\n  That is what this bill is about. The Senator from Oregon chooses to \nbe selective for a moment in time. I wish he wouldn't be. I understand \nwhy he is. I think he is wrong.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would be happy to yield in just a moment.\n  I think the Senator from Oregon is wrong on this issue. I think it is \na form of selectivity as it relates to our willingness as a country to \nuse public resources in the advancement of all forms of energy \nresources as the kind that is offered by the committee to, once a new \nreactor design is developed, allow for loan guarantees to guarantee up \nto about 8,400 megawatts of electrical development through nuclear \nreactor construction.\n  I would be happy to yield to my colleague from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my good friend for yielding. I listened patiently \nto him and to the chairman of the committee raising the concern that in \nsome way the opponents of the subsidies are engaging in scare tactics, \nred herrings, and the like. This is not a red herring. This is a dollar \nand cents issue.\n  I was curious whether the distinguished senior Senator from Idaho was \naware that the Congressional Budget Office ``considers the risk of \ndefault on such a loan guarantee to be very high, well over 50 \npercent.''\n  Is the distinguished senior Senator from Idaho aware of that? I would \nbe curious about his reaction because to me--and as the Senator from \nNew Mexico said--this is about risk. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas given us an objective, nonpartisan assessment of risk here. They \nconsider ``the risk of default on such a loan guarantee to be very \nhigh, well over 50 percent''--coupled with the Congressional Research \nService memo indicating the exposure is $16 billion. Is the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho aware of that? I would be curious what \nthe distinguished Senator's reaction to that is.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for bringing up that \nissue. There are red herrings. Maybe some of them are blue and some of \nthem are green, as we debate these issues. I don't know what a red \nherring really is here.\n  I do know that when you sit a group of economists or accountants down \nand say, project backwards over the last 20 years or 30 years as it \nrelates to the cost of developing nuclear reactors, and/or their \nfailure--and out in the Pacific Northwest we had some that were funded \nand then brought down because the economy and the politics would not \naccept them--if you do that, you might get to a 50-percent risk factor.\n  If you project forward to a new concept design that is under a new \nNuclear Regulatory Commission licensing process that meets the demand \nof the electrical systems, that is a cleaner process, that drives down \nthe cost--and my colleague, the senior Senator from New Mexico talked \nabout the new concepts in Taiwan; one of them may well be built here--\nmy guess is they did not factor that in. Because those are all things \nyou and I, as Senators, will insist upon and do over the next decade, \nand that when we do that, the risk factors come down dramatically.\n  But this is what the Senator from Oregon and I need to look at. You \ncame to the Congress how many years ago?\n  Mr. WYDEN. We were both young; in 1980.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In 1980. In 1980, the United States was about 35-percent \ndependent on foreign hydrocarbons, foreign oil. Now, there were some \nfolks out there saying: Boy, if we don't get busy here, we could \nsomeday be 40-percent dependent.\n  Well, they were right. We did not get busy. In fact, we increasingly \nrestricted the ability to refine and the ability to discover and the \nability to produce, and by 1984 or 1985, we were at 45 percent. And \nthat kept going on.\n  What is the risk factor there? We know what the risk factor is. The \nrisk factor is, we did not do anything and we are now over 50-percent \ndependent, and in some instances as high as 65 percent, give or take, \ndependent on foreign oil sources.\n  You see what has happened at the pump. I don't know what you or I \nwere paying for gas in 1980 but it was well under $1 a gallon. Now we \nare paying $1.55, $1.60 a gallon for regular fuel. The average \nhousehold is spending a great deal more on energy today than it did in \n1980. We did not develop a policy. We did quite the opposite. We began \nto restrict the ability to produce, whether or not it was hydrocarbons.\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\n  We have not brought on line a nuclear reactor, fire-generating system \nfor the purpose of electrical production in the last 10 or 12 years. \nOne got started under construction, and, of course, as we know in the \nPacific Northwest, we actually stopped construction on some.\n  Are there risks? You bet. There is no zero-sum game here. There isn't \nanything you or I could possibly legislate. But there is a reality; the \nreality is that energy prices in Oregon shot through the roof in the \nlast 3 years and the energy prices in Idaho went up dramatically. The \ncost of living in the State of Oregon and the economy of the State of \nOregon reeled under the hit, as is true of the State of Idaho. I am \nnot, anymore, going to stand here and be selective on the production of \nand the future opportunity to produce energy for this country because I \nwant to get your State's economy moving and my State's economy moving.\n  (Mr. CRAPO assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield for yet another question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague.\n  Again, the Senator from Idaho has been critical of the Congressional \nBudget Office report, saying that perhaps they did not look forward; \nthey just looked backward. I would urge my colleagues to look at the \nreport because the report does, in fact, look to 2011 and the future, \nand that is what the Congressional Budget Office did make their \njudgment on, where they said there was a risk of default that was well \nover 50 percent.\n  But my question to my colleague is whether my colleague thinks it is \nrelevant about who assumes risk with respect to energy production. \nBecause he is absolutely right, there are no foolproof guarantees in \nlife. There is no question there is risk. Here, however, I see the \ntaxpayer being at risk. The taxpayer is on the hook for $16 billion.\n  I thought it was interesting that the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee talked about the credits for production.\n  Well, the fact is, when you get a credit for production, the producer \nis largely at risk because in order to get the break, you have to \nproduce something. There is no tax credit, I say to my colleagues, for \nfailing to produce a successful wind venture. You get the credit if \nyour wind venture is successful.\n  My understanding is that here, with the subsidy, the person who \nassumes the risk is the taxpayer, not the producer. I was wondering if \nthe distinguished Senator from Idaho thinks it is relevant with respect \nto who takes the risk. This Senator does because the taxpayer is on the \nhook rather than those who produce. I am curious of the reaction of the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am pleased the Senator brought this issue forward \nbecause you and I live in an environment in the Pacific Northwest that \nwas substantially subsidized by American taxpayers to produce a massive \nelectrical system known as the Bonneville Power Administration--direct \nappropriations of hundreds of millions of dollars to build a hydro \nsystem in the Snake and Columbia watersheds and in other places. These \nwere not loan guarantees. They were just outright expenditures to be \npaid back. They have been paid back over a long period of time, and we \nare continuing to pay them back.\n  So the American taxpayer, to our benefit, has always been on the hook \nin the Pacific Northwest for the production of energy. In fact, you and \nI worked to just get some borrowing capability for Bonneville to expand \nits transmission system--a big chunk of money. We fought for that, and \nwe should have. Why? Because it will generally benefit the Pacific \nNorthwest. It is not a loan guarantee. It is an outright appropriation \nto be paid back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to comment on what the distinguished \nSenator, Mr. Wyden, just raised, and say to my good friend, the \nCongressional Budget Office is wrong almost every way it turns.\n  First, it uses forecast figures on plant costs of $2,300 per \nkilowatt. The right number is $1,250 per kilowatt. How do I know? There \nare two being built in Taiwan right now that General Electric \ndesigned--brand spanking new. They came to our office. I don't know if \nthey had time to come and see you, I say to the Senator, but they \nbrought with them their experts and told us those plants will cost not \n$2,300 per kilowatt but, rather, $1,250 per kilowatt. That is about \nhalf, as this Senator sees it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So they are half wrong right up front in terms of their \nassessment.\n  Furthermore, the bill itself says that if this section that is being \ndebated is ever used, the Secretary will evaluate the creditworthiness \nof any new project under this program. So they are already wrong by \nhalf on the cost.\n  Then I would ask, Does the Congressional Budget Office really believe \nthe Secretary will approve a significant risk? If he approves a \nsignificant risk, he would be in violation--direct conflict--of the law \nthat we are discussing that he would be acting on that the CBO assumes \nwill cost this extraordinary amount and impose this extraordinary risk.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments and his responses. I am quite \nsure the Congressional Budget Office, as this Senator knows--I have \nonly worked with it for the sum total of 26 years on all kinds of \nissues--I believe there is no subject they are more wrong on than their \nestimates of the cost of matters nuclear. First of all, they assume \nthat everything that has gone wrong in the past is going to go wrong \nagain, while the world is out there proving that such is not the case, \nwhile we are saying only under very limited circumstances would you \never use these sections to begin with, which would eliminate part of \ntheir reasoning, which would just leave the scene and would not even be \napplicable as they attempt to make the risk estimate.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the full Energy \nCommittee and the primary author of this legislation for making what \nare extremely important clarifying points in relation to the Wyden \namendment that would strike this provision of subtitle (b) as it \nrelates to the deployment of new nuclear plants.\n  In another life, I once studied real estate and had a real estate \nlicense. I know when you try to assess the value of a piece of \nproperty, you do what is called a comparable appraisal. You find other \nproperties that are comparable in size, productive capability, if it is \na house in square footage, in age, in all of those features. You say \nthat in the marketplace, this house is worth about so much because the \ncomparables, one that has recently sold that is like it or near like \nit, cost about this much.\n  When it comes to our ability to project the cost of a nuclear \npowerplant in construction in 2011, there are no U.S. comparables. We \nare talking about all kinds of new things. We are talking about a new \ndesign, a GEN-IV passive reactor design. What size are we talking \nabout, 600-, 800-, 1,000-megawatt plant? Under what kind of regulatory \nauthority? Has the license been developed and what are the \npeculiarities, the particulars, the specifications within the license? \nWe don't know that. You cannot effectively project.\n  What you can do is exactly what this subtitle does. It gives the \nSecretary of Energy authority to examine, to make a determination based \non fixed criteria that we have placed in the law to protect the public \nresource. We are going to make the assumption in 2011 that the \nSecretary of Energy and his or her staff are bright, talented, clear-\nthinking people who will have to operate under the law. The reason they \nwill have to operate under the law? Because if this is a loan \nguarantee, it becomes a part of their budget, it becomes scored, and \nthe Congress of the United States has to appropriate the money or at \nleast offset it because it is a guarantee in the market.\n  That is how it works. I am not going to be here then, more than \nlikely, and others of my colleagues will not. But we will have written \ninto law the right kind of public policy to protect the citizens' \nresource, his or her tax money. So the ultimate question is, Does this \nportion of the title as it relates to nuclear energy fit for the \nfuture? Is it the way we get this industry started again, obviously \ndealing with the provision in the law that creates a liability shield \nas it relates to Price\n\n[[Page S7442]]\n\nAnderson, as a new design concept that we think is the right design, \nthe safer design, the cleaner design, the more efficient design, and \nthe reality of a future energy source? And have we created the right \nincentive to move us into the production of electricity from nuclear-\nfueled powerplants of the future?\n\n  That is what this subtitle is all about. That is why it is important. \nI don't know that the detail of it has been written, or I should say \nread or understood specifically. It is very clear. It is very short. \nThe requirements are particularly important. Let me read them:\n  Subsection (b), Requirements:\n\n       Approved criteria for financial assistance shall include \n     the creditworthiness of the project--\n\n  that is, the responsibility of the Secretary and his or her team to \nmake those determinations--\n\n     the extent to which financial assistance would encourage \n     public-private partnerships and attract private sector \n     investment, the likelihood that financial assistance would \n     hasten commencement of the project, and any other criteria \n     the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate.\n\n  That is a totally open-ended clause that says the Secretary can, in \nfact, develop more findings if necessary to protect the safety and the \nsecurity of this kind of loan guarantee.\n\n       The Secretary, under the confidentiality provision, shall \n     protect the confidentiality of any information that is \n     certified by the project developer to be commercially \n     sensitive. The full faith and credit of all financial \n     assistance provided by the Secretary under this subtitle \n     shall be a guaranteed obligation of the United States backed \n     by its full faith and credit.\n\n  That is fairly boilerplate language. What that says is very clear. If \nthe Secretary makes that determination, that becomes a part of a \ndecision that the Appropriations Committee and the Budget Committee in \nthe Senate then deal with. This is not locking in the money. This is \nsimply authorizing the ability of the Secretary in the future to move \nin a direction that the Congress can make a decision on. That is what \nthis provision is all about.\n  I believe, we believe, and that is why the Energy Committee in a \nbipartisan way brought this to the floor for the whole Senate's \nconsideration, because we think it is the right thing to do. It is the \nright thing to look forward, not just a year from now or 2 but 30 and \n40 and 50 years from now and say that we have developed a public policy \nthat will produce the kind of energy that a growing, expanding U.S. \neconomy needs, that it is of high quality, and that it fuels our \nfactories, lights our homes, cools our homes, and in the new age of \ntechnology it keeps the Internet humming, by then probably such a \nwireless communication system that it keeps, if you will, cyberspace \nvibrating.\n  A couple of years ago I had the opportunity to visit China, a huge \nnation, a nation that is expanding by leaps and bounds, a nation that \nis pushing all sides of development and technology. My wife and I had \nthe opportunity to stay in a beautiful hotel in Shanghai, a state-of-\nthe-art hotel. In this city of Washington, DC, it would probably be \ncalled at least a four-star hotel, absolutely a marvelous facility. \nWhen we got to our room, the finest of facilities, there were all kinds \nof places to plug in your computer. It was wired for the state of the \nart. But it had a problem. The power kept going out. The lights kept \nblinking. The air-conditioning kept shutting off and turning on.\n  The problem that beautiful, new, state-of-the-art hotel had that made \nit nearly impossible to plug your computer in and go online and, with \nyour e-mail, talk to the United States is that China doesn't have a \npower grid.\n  China doesn't have adequate electrical power. China has developed its \nelectrical resources on a city-by-city, county-by-county basis. They \nare now striving ahead at a phenomenal cost to create a national power \ngrid to tie themselves together because they know that to compete with \nus, to put their people to work, and to hopefully some day generate a \nlifestyle comparable to ours, and an economy comparable to ours, they \nhave to have a power system that is reliable, stable, productive, and \nthat is connected.\n  No matter how beautiful the building, no matter how high-tech the \nfacility, if it is not turned on, if it is not wired in, if it is not \nlit up, it doesn't work. Boy, have we learned that in this country. \nCalifornia has learned that in the last couple of years.\n  If all goes well, I am going to be in the heart of the Silicon Valley \non Saturday. I will tell you what the conversation is going to be about \nwith some of the high-tech producers down there: Is the Energy bill \ngoing to pass? Are you going to get us back into the business of \nproducing energy? We are large consumers of it and we need a high-\nquality, stable supply of energy that doesn't blink, shut off, or put \nour production at risk. If you are building chips in a high-tech \nfactory today, known as a FAB, and the power blinks, you lose the whole \nproduction. You may lose millions of dollars in a blink of the power \nconnection. So high-quality, stable power is extremely valuable, and if \nit is not priced right, if it is not competitive, and somewhere else in \nthe world they can provide that high-quality power that is priced \ndifferently and in the competitive market, the great tragedy of our \neconomy today in a world environment is that the chips will go \nelsewhere.\n  That is one of many examples that can be used. That is why, finally, \nwhen President George W. Bush was elected and came to town, his first \npriority, among so many, was to assign the Vice President to assemble \nas many bright thinkers in the energy field as he could and to produce \nfor us, the Congress, a challenge--a national energy policy and a list \nof criteria that we ought to develop in the form of public policy for \nthis country. There were well over a hundred points in that proposal. \nTwo-thirds of them have already been implemented by rule and regulation \nby the Secretary of Energy and other agencies of our Government to get \nthis country back on line and producing energy. But about 30 percent of \nthem, or 30-plus, are not. They have to be legislated. It requires new \npublic policy to fully implement what our President envisions as a \nnational priority, what America envisions as a national priority, and \nwhat I trust the Senate of the United States clearly understands to be \na national priority.\n  We tried mightily in the last year or so. The politics, for a variety \nof reasons, would not allow us to get there. There are factors not in \nthis bill today that were in the bill of a year ago that are highly \ncontroversial. There are some changes in this bill. But it was crafted \nin the committee of authorization. It was voted on piece by piece. It \ndoes have a new bipartisan base of support, and we believe it is the \nkind of energy policy on which we can work out our differences with the \nHouse and put on the President's desk and two decades from now look \nback and say we did the right thing for our country, the right thing \nfor young people today who will be in that labor force 10, 15 years \nfrom now, who will demand and require an abundant supply of high-\nquality energy that is environmentally sound and at a reasonable price \nfor their homes, for their recreation, but, most importantly, for their \nwork site, for the job they are going to seek. That is why this \nlegislation is so important.\n\n  We may differ and we are going to have more amendments to come, but I \nhope our leader and the minority leader recognize the high priority we \nhave here and give us the time to debate this thoroughly and \nresponsibly and deal with all of the amendments that are necessary to \nget us to that point where we can vote up or down and let the American \npeople clearly understand that the Senate of the United States does \nsupport a national energy policy, and that the one we have, in the form \nof S. 14, is a quantum leap forward into America's future of an \nabundant energy and a robust economy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from California have 90 \nseconds to speak on the next amendment and the opposition have 90 \nseconds, an extra 30 seconds on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate will be in order. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate is still not in order. It is a \ncomplicated amendment. I would like to be able to explain it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please be in order.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in 90 seconds I want to tell you why this \namendment is so important. I offer it on behalf of myself and Senator \nDurbin, a strong supporter of ethanol, Senators Leahy, Feinstein, \nClinton, Jeffords, and Lautenberg.\n  My amendment simply removes the safe harbor provision in the bill, \nwhich treats ethanol like no other fuel, giving consumers and \ncommunities no legal recourse if it turns out that the water is \npolluted or the air is polluted or people get sick from this increased \namount of ethanol. Believe me, I hope ethanol is totally safe. But no \none is sure. Just read the 1999 blue ribbon EPA panel. They raise some \nserious questions. Of course, the ethanol manufacturers say ethanol is \n100 percent completely safe. Then I ask why they demand this safe \nharbor provision. Look at what happened to the last gasoline additive \nwe promoted, MTBE. This is the cost to our people because of MTBE \npollution: $29 billion. My friends, if we had had the same safe harbor \nfor MTBE as some of us are seeking for ethanol, this would not have \nfallen completely on your taxpayers and your communities. I call this \nan unfunded mandate.\n\n  People who oppose this say they only are putting forward a very \nnarrow safe harbor. They say everyone will have a lot of ways to go. \nBut the truth is that defective product liability is the only remedy. \nThe courts have said no to negligence and no to nuisance. The only \nclaim they have is defective product liability.\n  All we do is say treat ethanol as we do any other additive.\n  I urge an aye vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, what we are doing here is not giving our \nstamp of approval on ethanol. We are not mandating. The vast majority \nof Members here feel more strongly about this than I do.\n  I know the Senator from California would not deliberately mislead \nyou. What she is saying is just flat wrong.\n  I keep hearing it over and over again: If a safe harbor provision is \nenacted into law, No. 1, citizens will not be able to take refiners to \ncourt under our court system; and, No. 2, any possible ethanol \ncontamination that happens in the future wouldn't get cleaned up.\n  It just isn't true. Even with the enactment of the safe harbor \nprovisions, if a plaintiff makes his case--that is a very significant \npart of this--there are just a few court theories that could be used in \nenvironmental cases: Trespass, not affected by safe harbor; nuisance, \nnot affected by safe harbor; negligence, not affected by safe harbor; \nbreach of implied warrant, not affected by safe harbor; breach of \nexpress warranty, not affected by safe harbor.\n  As far as cleanups are concerned, if there were a spill, here are \nsome examples of environmental laws that are on the books right now \nthat would take care of the problem and are not affected by safe \nharbor: No. 1, Resource Conservation Recovery; No. 2, Clean Water Act; \nNo. 3, Oil Pollution Act; No. 4, Superfund; and it goes on and on.\n  Neither of these assertions is true. They would be able to have their \nday in court, and at the same time we have adequate laws in the court \nsystem and environmental laws to accommodate any cleanup that would \ntake place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays were \npreviously ordered on the amendment, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 854\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes evenly divided before \na vote on the second Boxer amendment.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to say that the Boxer-Lugar-\nCantwell amendment, which encourages production of agricultural residue \nethanol, is going to be accepted by a voice vote with a promise to \nfight for it in conference.\n  Our amendment says that if you produce ethanol from the residue of \nagricultural crops, you get a special incentive. So if your State grows \ncorn, rice, sugar, apples, wheat, oats, barley, and other crops high in \nfructose, this amendment would help your farmers, your rural \ncommunities, and your States meet the ethanol mandate. Again, it simply \ngives an incentive to produce ethanol from agricultural residue.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \naccepting the amendment. I am happy to take it by voice vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 854) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered \nby the majority and minority leaders, Mr. Frist and Mr. Daschle, on \nrenewable motor fuels. Others may support this amendment for different \nreasons, but I support the amendment because of its potential to \nincrease motor fuels supply, especially in the Federal reformulated \nfuels, or RFG, program. This amendment includes provisions that I, and \nmy Wisconsin House colleagues, Congressman Paul Ryan and Mark Green, \nhave long advocated to address supply shortages that the Midwest has \nexperienced in recent years.\n  This amendment makes significant changes to the Clean Air Act motor \nfuels programs that will increase the supply of cleaner fuels \nnationwide. It bans methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, which is no \nlonger used in my home State of Wisconsin. MTBE, as others will likely \ndiscuss in detail, is a reformulated gasoline additive that has \ncontaminated drinking water supplies nationwide.\n  The amendment also contains a mandate to increase the supply of \nethanol to 5 billion barrels by 2012 both to replace MTBE as an \noxygenate in reformulated gasoline and to reduce our dependence upon \nforeign oil. It also would allow Governors the ability to increase \nreformulated gasoline supply by opting their entire State into the \nreformulated fuels program, and increasing the market demand for RFG in \ntheir State.\n  The amendment also has a provision to increase the amount of \nreformulated gasoline by reducing the number of boutique fuel blends. \nThe bill reduces the number of Federal reformulated fuel blends by \ncreating a single set of standards. This would broaden the supply from \nwhich Wisconsin could draw in times of tight supply.\n  If enacted, this amendment would improve fungibility of RFG \nnationwide, by standardizing volatile organic compound, VOC, reduction \nrequirements. In practice, when combined with the renewable fuels \nmandate, this would enable States like Wisconsin that use Federal RFG \nto draw on supplies of Federal RFG from other areas, such as St. Louis \nand Detroit, if necessary. The ability to rely on other sources of RFG \nis especially important when sudden supply shortages arise due to \nunexpected events such as refinery fires or breakdowns which the \nMidwest has also experienced in recent years.\n  This amendment is important because, at present, southeastern \nWisconsin cannot draw on RFG from other areas because the Chicago/\nWisconsin RFG formula is not used elsewhere in the country. This \namendment would help address this boutique fuel problem by bringing \nother areas that use Federal RFG in line and standardizing VOC \nreduction requirements and requirements for the production of renewable \nfuels such as ethanol--the Chicago/Wisconsin area is the only part of \nthe country that uses solely ethanol in its blend of RFG.\n  As the use of ethanol blended RFG becomes more widespread, supply \nproblems will become easier to address. This benefits Wisconsin drivers \nbecause easing supply shortages will help put an end to severe price \nspikes, and drivers nationwide by continuing to supply them with RFG \nthat meets Federal Clean Air Act standards in light of State bans on \nMTBE.\n  So far, Mr. President, in light of military conflict in the Middle \nEast, we have been lucky that we have avoided significant increases in \ngas prices so far this year. But, for folks in Wisconsin, the thought \nof another approaching summer unfortunately dredges up memories of the \nhigh gas prices that have plagued our families in recent years. The \nSenate must take preventative action today to make sure gas prices stay \nunder control, and our this amendment will help do that. By scrapping \nthe multiple Federal fuel blend requirements and replacing them with a \nmore simplified, streamlined system, this measure will work to make gas \nsupplies more stable and keep prices at the pump within reason. This is \na good amendment, and it deserves the support of the Senate.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \naddress the Frist-Daschle amendment and the Energy bill in general.\n  Now, do I think there is a way to soundly and responsibly increase \nour use of alternative fuels? Sure. Do I think that we should increase \nour use of alternative fuels? You bet. I am just not convinced that the \nprovision we are considering today is the best way to make that happen. \nAnd I am not convinced that it is the best way to make that happen for \na State such as New York.\n  I think that an Energy bill has the potential to be a win for us not \njust on energy and the environment but also on economic development and \njob creation. An Energy bill could truly be an engine for developing \nnew technologies, manufacturing new products, building new facilities, \nand with all of that--creating new jobs, while at the same time \nincreasing our energy security and improving the quality of our \nenvironment.\n  I commend my colleagues Senators Domenici and Bingaman, for their \nefforts in bringing this bill to the floor. They have worked arduously \nto tackle many complicated and controversial issues.\n  But with all due respect to my colleagues, in many cases, I am afraid \nthat this bill unfortunately still falls far short--in terms of energy \npolicy, environmental policy, and economic policy. We need a \ncomprehensive and balanced energy policy that strengthens our energy \nsecurity, safeguards consumers, protects the environment, spurs \neconomic development, and create jobs.\n  Yet this bill does not truly harness our potential for greater energy \nefficiency and for newer, cleaner sources of energy. It too often looks \nto the past to try to solve the energy challenges of the present and \nturns a blind eye to all that our energy future could be.\n  For example, it looks to possible oil and gas resources on the Outer \nContinental Shelf--areas of the ocean that have been under drilling \nmoratoria for years in an effort to preserve precious ocean and coastal \nresources and the coastal tourism economies of a number of our States.\n  It also apparently requires an inventory of oil and gas resources on \nFederal lands, as well as an inventory of restrictions or impediments \nto development of those resources. Now my colleagues in New York and I \nhave been fighting for years to protect the Finger Lakes National \nForest from drilling, and so I have a difficult time with provisions \nlike this.\n  The bill permanently extends the authority of the Nuclear Regulatory\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\nCommission to indemnify nuclear powerplants against liability for \nnuclear accidents under the Price-Anderson Act, and provides other \nsubstantial subsidies to the nuclear power industry. Yet the bill does \nnot do enough to increase the diversity of our energy supply, which \nwould also create new business and economic growth opportunities.\n  I am pleased that the bill contains provisions related to the \nincreased use of fuel cells and hydrogen fuel because this is a key \nexample of how we can be working to increase our energy security, while \nalso improving the environment and creating jobs. And it is places like \nUpstate New York, where we have many companies and universities doing \nexciting work in this area, which will emerge as world leaders in his \ntechnology. That is why I have joined with Senator Dorgan, Senator \nLieberman, and others in supporting legislation that would go even \nfurther than the bill we are currently debating in supporting fuel \ncells. And that is in part why, when we debated the renewable fuel \nprovisions in the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, \nSenator Boxer and I fought to include provisions that would provide \nFederal support for the construction of waste-to-ethanol plants and \nother cellulosic biomass ethanol production facilities.\n  Because these projects would help States such as ours produce more \nrenewable fuel--produce fuel from waste products, which would therefore \nalso help the environment--and at the same time produce more jobs as \nwell.\n  We are grateful for the committee's support for our amendments, and \nwe are pleased that these provisions remain in the amendment that is \nbefore us today.\n  But many of my colleagues and I still have reservations with respect \nto this amendment. That is why some have pushed to have their States \nexempted entirely from the renewable fuels requirements in this \namendment, while many others have voted to require States to \nproactively opt-in to the renewable fuels program.\n  Despite the many outstanding questions regarding the renewable fuels \nrequirements in this amendment--whether it is transportation or storage \nor other infrastructure issues, market concentration concerns, impacts \non gasoline prices for consumers at the pump, air quality impacts, you \nname it--there is a seeming unwillingness to consider even the \nslightest changes to the provisions before us--at least for some \nStates.\n  While certain States are exempted all together, other States that \nhave special considerations, such as my State of New York which has a \nState ban of MTBE that goes into effect in just a few months, which has \ncertain air quality issues, and very little existing ability to produce \nsignificant quantities of renewable fuel--our special needs go unmet.\n  With all of the concerns I have regarding the amendment before us, I \nhave even more concerns about the provisions passed by the House, which \nI believe in many respects are greatly inferior to the provisions we \nare considering here today. So that gives me even further pause in \ntaking up this issue.\n  For example, whereas the amendment before us contains a welcome and \nlong-awaited Federal phase-out of the use of MTBE over the next 4 \nyears, the House bill does not phase out MTBE at all. Even more \ndisturbing, it includes a liability safe harbor for MTBE.\n  Now, there is no question that the time has come to take action at \nthe Federal level on MTBE. New York is on the front lines of this \nbattle. We have banned MTBE use in the State as of January 1, 2004.\n  There are a number of other States that have taken action to phase \nout or limit the use of MTBE as well, including: California, Colorado, \nConnecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, \nMichigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and \nWashington. Now, those are the States that have actually passed State \nlaws. But here are a number of other States that have tried to pass \nlaws and are still trying to pass laws to phase out or ban MTBE.\n  In the absence of any Federal action, States have been forced to take \naction on their own to limit MTBE use in motor vehicle fuel because it \nhas wreaked havoc on the environment--in particular, on drinking water \nsources. Unfortunately, those State actions are now being challenged in \ncourt.\n  Yet the States are acting for good reason. New York has experienced \nfirst-hand the impact of MTBE contamination on our drinking water--\nparticularly on Long Island.\n  According to testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee offered recently by Mr. Paul Granger, superintendent of the \nPlainview Water District on Long Island, ``New York has identified some \n1970 MTBE spill sites with 430 of them on Long Island alone.''\n  That is why New York, once again out in front on the issue of MTBE, \nhas probably the toughest standard in the Nation for the amount of MTBE \nallowed in surface and ground water--10 parts per billion.\n  But according to Mr. Granger's testimony, ``At least 21 states have \nreported well closures due to MTBE groundwater contamination.'' It is \nestimated that more than 500 public drinking water wells and 45,000 \nprivate wells throughout the country are contaminated by MTBE.\n  According to testimony recently offered by the American Lung \nAssociation before the Environment and Public Works Committee, millions \nof Americans are being served by drinking water sources contaminated by \nMTBE.\n  As we are far too familiar now, the cost of cleaning up this MTBE \ncontamination are significant. According to the testimony of Mr. Craig \nPerkins, director of Environment and Public Works for the city of Santa \nMonica, CA, ``Current estimates for the total cost of nationwide MTBE \nclean-up are $30 billion and counting.'' That is why we have lawsuits \npending in New York regarding MTBE contamination of ground water, \nbecause these communities, these water suppliers, and ultimately their \ncustomers, cannot meet the financial burden of these cleanups.\n  So while having clean air to breathe is important, so is having clean \nwater to drink. We should not have to trade one for the other.\n  Phasing out the use of MTBE as a fuel additive is the right thing to \ndo from a drinking water perspective, from an overall environmental and \npublic health perspective, and from a fuels perspective. That is why \nsuch a phase-out of MTBE was recommended over 3 years ago by the EPA \nBlue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline.\n  The State-by-State approach to MTBE that we are currently operating \nunder does not work. It does not work for the markets, the refiners, or \nthe distributors to have this patchwork of States that do or do not \nallow the addition of MTBE to gasoline.\n  I am very pleased that the Frist-Daschle amendment includes such a \nphase-out but I am concerned about other provisions of this amendment \npertaining to renewable fuels, including the safe harbor provisions. I \nam deeply concerned that the House bill does not include a phase-out of \nMTBE but does provide a liability safe harbor for MTBE.\n  The reality is that we can phase out MTBE and repeal the existing 2 \npercent oxygenate requirement under the Clean Air Act while still \nensuring that we meet current clean air standards. And I support \nlegislation that will do these three things.\n  After banning MTBE and removing the oxygenate requirement, there \nwould still be an increase in the use of ethanol in this country--with \nor without the mandate we are contemplating here today.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \namendment 850, an amendment to add a renewable fuels package to the \nenergy bill.\n  This language establishes a nationwide renewable fuels standard of 5 \nbillion gallons by 2012, repeals the Clean Air Act's oxygenate \nrequirement for reformulated gasoline and phases down the use of MTBE \nover 4 years.\n  This language has strong bipartisan support and is the result of long \nnegotiations between the Renewable Fuels Association, the National Corn \nGrowers Association, the Farm Bureau Federation, the American Petroleum \nInstitute, the Northeast states for Coordinated Air Use Management, \nNESCAUM, and the American Lung Association.\n  Passage of this ethanol language will protect our national security, \neconomy, and environment.\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\n  The amendment that the majority leader has introduced--a compromise \nthat will triple the amount of domestically-produced ethanol used in \nAmerica--is one essential tool in reducing our dependence on imported \noil.\n  President Bush has stated repeatedly that energy security is a \ncornerstone for national security. I agree. It is crucial that we \nbecome less dependent on foreign sources of oil and look more to \ndomestic sources to meet our energy needs. Ethanol is an excellent \ndomestic source--it is a clean burning, homegrown renewable fuel that \nwe can rely on for generations to come.\n  Ethanol is also good for our Nation's economy. Tripling the use of \nrenewable fuels over the next decade will:\n  Reduce our National Trade Deficit by more than $34 billion;\n  Increase U.S. GDP by $156 billion by 2012;\n  Create more than 214,000 new jobs;\n  Expand household income by an additional $51.7 billion;\n  Save taxpayers $3 billion annually in reduced government subsidies \ndue to the creation of new markets for corn.\n  The benefits for the farm economy are even more pronounced. Ohio is \n6th in the Nation in terms of corn production and is among the highest \nin the nation in putting ethanol into gas tanks, over 40 percent of all \ngasoline sold in Ohio contains ethanol. An increase in the use of \nethanol across the Nation means an economic boost to thousands of farm \nfamilies across my State:\n  Currently, ethanol production provides 192,000 jobs and $4.5 billion \nto net farm income nationwide;\n  Passage of this amendment will increase net farm income by nearly $6 \nbillion annually;\n  Passage of this amendment will create $5.3 billion of new investment \nin renewable fuel production capacity.\n  Phasing out MTBE on a national basis will be good for our fuel \nsupply. Because refiners are under tremendous strain from having to \nmake several different gasoline blends to meet various State clean air \nrequirements--and no new refineries have been built in the last 25 \nyears--the effects of various State responses to the threat of MTBE \ncontamination--including bans and phase-outs on different schedules--\nwill add a significant burden to existing refineries. The MTBE phase-\nout provisions in this package will ensure that refiners will have less \nstress on their system and that gasoline will be more fungible \nnationwide.\n  Expanding the use of ethanol will also protect our environment by \nreducing auto emissions, which will mean cleaner air and improved \npublic health.\n  Use of ethanol reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons \nby 20 percent;\n  Ethanol also reduces emissions of particulates by 40 percent;\n  Use of ethanol RFG helped move Chicago into attainment of the federal \nozone standard, the only RFG area to see such improvement;\n  In 2002, ethanol use in the United States reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions by 4.3 million tons--the equivalent of removing more than \n630,000 vehicles from the road.\n  Our farmers can meet the ethanol standard. For 2003, the ethanol \nindustry is on pace to produce more than 2.7 billion gallons. The \namount of ethanol required under the FRS begins at 2.6 billion gallons \nin 2005. Adequate ethanol supply is simply not an issue.\n  Currently, 73 ethanol plants nationwide have the capacity to produce \nover 2.9 billion gallons annually. Further, there are ten ethanol \nplants under construction, which when completed will bring the total \ncapacity to more than 3.3 billion gallons.\n  California has been cited as a major problem area; however, all but \ntwo small refiners have already transitioned from MTBE into ethanol. \nCalifornia will use close to 700 million gallons of ethanol in 2003 \nafter consuming roughly 100 million gallons last year. The California \nEnergy Commission has concluded the transition to ethanol ``is \nprogressing without any major problems.'' The U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration found the transition went ``remarkably well.''\n  Individual States are banning the use of MTBE, but they cannot change \nthe federal RFG oxygen content requirement. The collision of these two \nelements under current law will likely lead to higher costs.\n  Under current law, California's required ethanol use in 2005 would be \n895 million gallons. Under this amendment, fuel providers supplying \nCalifornia will be required to use far less ethanol in 2005--291 \nmillion gallons. And more importantly, they will benefit from the \nbill's credit banking and trading provisions.\n  With the State MTBE ban set for January 2004, New York faces a \nsimilar situation. Under the status quo, fuel providers will be \nrequired to use 197 million gallons of ethanol in New York in 2005. \nHowever, if this amendment is enacted, refiners, blenders and importers \nwould be required to use or purchase credits for even less--111 million \ngallons of ethanol in 2005.\n  A study conducted by Mathpro, a prominent economic analysis firm, \nfound that, compared to a situation where States are banning MTBE and \nthe federal RFG oxygen content requirement is left in place, this \namendment will lower the average gasoline production cost: by about \ntwo-tenths of a cent per gallon.\n\n  In addition, this language provide safeguards. In the event that the \nRFS would severely harm the economy or the environment or would lead to \npotential supply and distribution problems, the RFS requirement could \nbe reduced or eliminated.\n  Ethanol is already blended from Alaska to Florida and from California \nto New York. Ethanol is already transported via barge, railcar, and \noceangoing vessel to markets throughout the country. The U.S. \nDepartment of Energy studied the feasibility of a 5 billion gallon per \nyear national ethanol market and found that ``no major infrastructure \nbarriers exist'' and that needed investments on an amortized, per-\ngallon basis are ``modest'' and ``present no major obstacle.''\n  Both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Congressional Budget \nOffice have recognized the benefit of the investment of the ethanol \nprogram on the overall health to the nation's economy. Recently, the \nUSDA stated the ethanol program would decrease farm program payments by \n$3 billion per year. In its analysis of this amendment, CBO stated the \nprovision would reduce direct spending by $2 billion during 2005-2013.\n  The RFS agreement includes strong anti-backsliding provisions that \nprohibit refiners from producing gasoline that increases emissions once \nthe oxygenate requirement is removed. A Governor can also petition EPA \nfor a waiver of the ethanol requirement based on supporting \ndocumentation that the ethanol waiver will increase emissions that \ncontribute to air pollution in any area of the state.\n  The fuels agreement would benefit the environment in a number of \nways:\n  reduces tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide, VOCs, and fine \nparticulates,\n  phases down MTBE over 4 years to address groundwater contamination, \nand since ethanol biodegrades quickly, it will not have the same \nproblem,\n  provides for one grade of summertime Federal RFG, which is more \nstringent,\n  increases the benefits from the Federal RFG program on air toxic \nreductions,\n  provides states in the Ozone Transport Region and enhanced \nopportunity to participate in the RFG program because of unique air \nquality problems,\n  includes provisions that require EPA to conduct a study on the \neffects on public health, air quality, and water resources of increased \nuse of potential MTBE substitutes, including ethanol.\n  The use of ethanol-blended fuels also reduces so-called greenhouse \ngas emissions by 12-19 percent compared with conventional gasoline, \naccording to Argonne National Laboratory. In fact, Argonne states \nethanol use last year in the U.S. reduced the so-called greenhouse gas \nemissions by approximately 4.3 million tons, equivalent to removing the \nannual emissions of more than 636,000 cars.\n  I also want to point out that the California Environmental Policy \nCouncil recently gave ethanol a clean bill of health and approved its \nuse as a replacement for MTBE in California gasoline.\n  A similar provision has already passed the House of Representatives \nthis year. Virtually the same agreement passed the Senate in April 2002 \nwith 69 votes.\n  The fuels agreement is supported by the American Petroleum Institute; \nthe\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\nRenewable Fuels Association; the Northeast States for Coordinated Air \nUse Management (NESCAUM); U.S. Chamber of Commerce; US Action; the \nUnion of Concerned Scientists; the Environmental and Energy Studies \nInstitute; the Governor's Ethanol Coalition; General Motors; the \nGovernors of California and New York; and all of the major agricultural \norganizations in the United States.\n  It is time to pass an ethanol bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nyes for America's farmers and this amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is important that Congress make \navailable all possible options for refiners to ensure compliance with \nthe renewable fuels standard and decrease chances for gasoline price \nand supply volatility. One such option for meeting the renewable fuels \nstandard that has shown promise is ethyl tertiary butyl ether ETBE.\n  ETBE is a High-octane, low-vapor pressure, gasoline-blending \ncomponent produced from a combination of ethanol and butane. Because \nboth of these raw materials are produced in abundance domestically, \nETBE will help expand US gasoline supplies, moderating possible \ngasoline price volatility.\n  ETBE is fully fungible with gasoline. This allows ETBE to be blended \ninto gasoline at any point in the gasoline logistical chain and \ntransported in gasoline pipelines to regions of the country where it is \nmore costly to transport and blend ethanol into gasoline. Moreover, \nETBE does not have a negative impact on gasoline vapor pressure, making \nit easier and more cost-effective to blend ETBE into gasoline--\nespecially during the summertime ozone control season when gasoline \nvapor pressure is restricted.\n  ETBE reduces more gasoline evaporative and tailpipe emissions, lowers \nair toxics and carbon monoxide, and provides 20-percent more carbon \ndioxide emission reduction than other gasoline-blending components.\n  ETBE is 75 percent less water soluble than MTBE. This means use of \nETBE substantially reduces the risks to ground water resources should \ngasoline leak from an underground storage tank. ETBE also has other \nphysical properties which make it migrate slower and shorter \ndistances--and easier to remediate--should a gasoline spill or leak \noccur.\n  I support the development of ETBE because of the benefits it provides \nfor cleaner air, enhanced gasoline supply, and the ability to transport \nthe fuel in the current infrastructure. Congress, in enacting a RFS, \nshould not do anything to preclude its use. The marketplace should be \nallowed to determine how it will meet the requirements of the RFS.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 850\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n850 as amended. There are to be 2 minutes evenly divided on the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we yield back our time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the \noutcome.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FRIST. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 1308\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 52, H.R. 1308; that \nimmediately upon the reporting of the bill, Senator Grassley be \nrecognized to offer a substitute amendment on behalf of himself, \nSenators Lincoln, Snowe, Baucus, and Voinovich; provided further that \nthere be 30 minutes for debate equally divided between Senators \nGrassley and Baucus or their designees prior to a vote in relation to \nthe amendment, and that no other amendments be in order; provided \nfurther that if the amendment is agreed to, the bill be read a third \ntime, and the Senate proceed to a vote on final passage of the bill as \namended.\n  Further, I ask that if the amendment is not agreed to, then H.R. 1308 \nbe placed back on the calendar and that no points of order be waived by \nthis agreement. I further ask consent that following that vote, the \nSenate then insist on its amendment, request a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair then be authorized to appoint conferees on the \npart of the Senate with a ratio of 3 to 2.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following passage of the bill, \nthe amendment to the title be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, we will \nhave further announcements later in this evening. We would expect to \nhave a final rollcall vote for the week approximately 30 or 40 minutes \nfrom now. Although we will have no more rollcall votes after that, we \nwill stay and be available to debate amendments tonight, and we will be \nin session tomorrow. We expect not to have rollcall votes tomorrow. We \nwill have further announcements later tonight with regard to the \nschedule tomorrow, as well as Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first let me compliment the distinguished \nmajority leader for the effort he has made to bring us to this \npoint. Were it not for his effort, we would not have accomplished what \nwe have with this unanimous consent agreement. I appreciate his \nefforts.\n\n  Let me also single out in particular the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas. Without her persistence and her effort, now weeks long, we \nwould not be here. She has spoken out with courage and conviction and \nempathy on behalf of 12 million children, 8 million families who \notherwise would be left out of tax relief. The argument that she has \nmade from the beginning has been without this legislation those \nmillions of children and those working families would get no tax relief \non July 1. The passage of this legislation today will accommodate that \nconcern, that need.\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n\n  This will give us an opportunity to send the recommendation to the \nHouse. It will send a clear message to working families that we are \nserious about providing the kind of tax relief that is so necessary for \nthese families if we are going to provide it to others; that it will be \navailable. The refundable child credit assistance can be made available \nin time for tax relief provided to others as well.\n  I commend the Senator. I commend the majority leader. I thank my \ncolleagues for this agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the majority leader, would it be appropriate to \ndispose of the pending LIHEAP amendment to clear the record for the \nevening in spite of the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I assume it has been cleared by the \ndistinguished leader. I have no objection.\n  Mr. FRIST. We will proceed with that. It makes the most efficient use \nof everyone's time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have a Senator who still wants to speak on the \npending bill. I assume after the time just provided has expired, we \nwill be back for the distinguished Senator from Colorado to speak to an \namendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 841 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For the record, under the bill, I withdraw amendment \nNo. 841.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 841) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 860 To Amendment No. 840\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I send a new second-degree amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. DOMENICI], for Mr. \n     Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 860 to amendment No. \n     840.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee. I am pleased, colleagues, that we have \nbeen able to reach consensus on the need to include in this bill an \nincrease in the authorization level for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance (LIHEAP) program from $2 billion to $3.4 billion. With power \ncosts on the rise around this nation, it is imperative that the Senate \nact now to respond to the needs of the 85 percent of eligible families \nthat today do not receive the help they so desperately need, due to the \nperennially under-funded nature of the LIHEAP program.\n  There is another issue relevant to the LIHEAP program, however, that \nI hope the Senate will soon consider. I believe that we must address \nthe manner in which the Department of Health and Human Services--and, \nof course, the Office of Management and Budget--have traditionally \nadministered the ``contingency'' portion of the LIHEAP program. While \nthe bulk of LIHEAP dollars are distributed to states via block grants \nand in accordance with a statutory formula, Congress has also \nauthorized--and appropriated funds to--a contingency fund, designed to \n``meet the additional home energy assistance needs of one or more \nStates arising from a natural disaster or other emergency.'' This money \nis not released according to formula--but solely at the discretion of \nthe HHS Secretary.\n  Unfortunately, recent history suggests that there are problems with \nthe way the ``contingency'' portion of LIHEAP is administered. In \nessence, there seem to be widely varying eligibility rules applied to \nthe release of these contingency funds--leading to instances in which \nHHS has overlooked very real energy emergencies, including the recent \npower crisis in my home state of Washington.\n  I believe that clear rules for the release of these dollars will \nensure that, in the unfortunate event of an energy emergency, low-\nincome families will receive much-needed assistance in keeping the \nlights and the heat turned on--which is precisely what Congress intends \nwhen it appropriates money to the LIHEAP contingency fund. During mark-\nup on this bill in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Sen. \nSmith and I added language--adopted unanimously-seeking to put \nguidelines around the release of these emergency LIHEAP funds.\n  However, I understand that the distinguished Chairman, Senator Gregg, \nand Ranking Member, Senator Kennedy, intend to reauthorize the LIHEAP \nprogram in their Committee this year and examine very closely the \nadministration of these contingency funds. I believe the language that \nSenator Smith and I authored would go a long way toward adding clarity \nto the process, and I would be exceptionally pleased to work with the \nChairman on this and other proposals to reform the LIHEAP emergency \nprogram to ensure it is as responsive as possible to the very real \nneeds of low-income Americans.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Washington for her comments. I \nagree that the manner in which LIHEAP contingency funds are distributed \nshould be examined. I would be happy to work with the Senator on this \nimportant matter as the H.E.L.P. Committee works towards \nreauthorization of this program in the coming months.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I also believe the Senator from Washington makes a very \ngood point about the administration of LIHEAP emergency funds. I too \nwould be happy to work with the Senator on including language to \naddress her concerns when the Committee debates LIHEAP reauthorization \nlater this year.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the second-degree \namendment be adopted and the underlying first-degree amendment No. 840, \nas amended, be agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask consent following the disposition of \nthe unanimous consent agreement dealing with the child tax credit, the \nSenator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, be recognized to speak on LIHEAP. \nShe\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\nwanted to speak before the vote but this would be fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Five minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Probably 10 minutes. I am sure she can complete a statement \nin 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Campbell has been waiting for a long time. He \nhas an amendment on the underlying bill.\n  Mr. REID. She can speak after he offers his amendment. He will not \nspeak that long.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That is all right.\n  Mr. REID. How long will you speak?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I am going to speak for 15 or 18 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. She has waited around here all day to speak on LIHEAP. Why \nnot limit her time to 5 minutes; that should be adequate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 860) was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 841), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7449-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7449-S7459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TAX RELIEF, SIMPLIFICATION, AND EQUITY ACT OF 2003\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport H.R. 1308.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1308) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to end certain abusive tax practices, to provide tax \n     relief and simplification, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 862\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Grassley], for himself, Mrs. \n     Lincoln, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Voinovich, Ms. Murkowski, \n     Mr. Warner, Mr. Stevens, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 862.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am pleased to join my distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Baucus, in the agreement we have reached on the child tax \ncredit. I wish to take a minute to fill in my colleagues on how we are \nat this place at this time on another tax bill.\n  In the Finance Committee in the year 2001, Senator Snowe and Senator \nLincoln added a refundable formula to enhance the child tax credit. \nThis provision lasted through conference. The formula was increased to \n15 percent in 2005. President Bush proposed to accelerate the $1,000 \ntax credit amount but did not accelerate the refundability formula.\n  In the Finance Committee, we accelerated the refundability formula. \nUnfortunately, that provision was dropped in conference. At that \ndisappointing moment and at times since, I have indicated that I would \nlike to revive that formula. I was joined by several Finance Committee \nmembers and both leaders in attempting to resolve this problem.\n  I am pleased to say this agreement moves the ball on the marriage \npenalty and the child tax credit. The relief is small but a start in \naddressing yet another marriage penalty.\n  I applaud Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for her steadfast interest in \nresolving this other marriage penalty provision.\n  Finally, our agreement is offset with an extension of customs fees, \nuser fees. I urge the House to respond on our action today.\n  I would like to get the bill to the President. This will ensure that \nlow-income families get the checks we expect to get out in the next few \nmonths that are related to the tax bill that the President signed last \nweek. Without this additional provision we are working on now, we would \nhave families who get an increase in the child credit of $400 per child \nget a check this summer, but we would not get checks to people who are \nentitled to the usual refundability because it was not extended.\n  I would like to do a lot more on the child tax credit. Families \nshould be able to rely on permanent tax relief. That is what the bill I \nintroduced did--not this compromise before the Senate. That is close to \nwhat the Senate growth bill did. That is what we should do in the \nupcoming process on this legislation.\n  I hope we resolve the refundability formula. We address the marriage \npenalty and the child tax credit and we make progress on the longer \nterm child tax credit. We simplify the definition of a child. This last \nmeasure is the principal recommended simplification of the Tax Code for \nindividuals. This recommendation comes from the Joint Committee on \nTaxation and the Treasury Department and is something that should have \nbeen done a long time ago.\n  Today we make some major progress on simplifying the Tax Code. Of \ncourse, we need to do a lot more. This is what we do as we try to move \nforward on various pieces of legislation from the Finance Committee.\n  In this bill we are also going to help those serving in the Armed \nForces overseas. Because some of their remuneration is not considered \nincome, they would not benefit from the child tax refund the same way \nas other people who are not in a war zone. We ought to change that and \ndo change it so everybody is treated fairly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, is it correct that the order provides for \n30 minutes equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas. I might \nadd, she is the prime mover of this bill. She is the one who made that \nhappen. We are deeply indebted to her.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I give special thanks to my colleague \nfrom Montana. There are many people to thank today for moving forward \nin the right direction, recognizing the working families of this \ncountry. I thank Chairman Grassley, who worked tirelessly with us, as \nwell as the ranking member, Senator Baucus; certainly the leadership on \nboth sides, Senator Frist and Senator Daschle, who have both been \nwilling to work with all of us to come together on this agreement.\n  I would also like to say a very special thanks to my colleague, \nSenator Olympia Snowe from Maine, who has been a wonderful colleague \nand certainly someone who has worked equally as hard as I have on this \nissue. I am very pleased to have worked with her, both now as well as \nin the past.\n  If people can go back as far as 2001, they will remember in that 2001 \ntax bill Senator Snowe and I worked hard to bring about the \nrefundability of the child tax credit, recognizing and understanding \nworking Americans all across this country, trying to raise their \nfamilies, were in need of the kind of assistance that refundable child \ntax credit would bring to them. I am very pleased and honored to have \nworked with her in the great work she has done in this effort.\n  I am certainly pleased that we have reached this agreement to restore \nthe advanced refundability for the child credit, for the hard work \nSenator Grassley has done in bringing about the uniform definition of a \n``child'' in the Tax Code. To bring about those kinds of reforms are \nnot easy steps. I think it is one of our first monumental moves in the \nright direction in which Senator Grassley will lead us in other reforms \nin the Tax Code.\n  Certainly this agreement is the culmination of years of effort. I \nwould like to recognize, however, and emphasize particularly the fact \nthat we are helping working parents and working families. I know there \nare some critics out there who have referred to these provisions as \nwelfare. I just find that description so disheartening, since we are \ntalking about 200,000 military families, hundreds of firefighters, and \nteachers, and other hard-working Americans. I don't think of them, or \nview them, as welfare recipients. I don't think they think of \nthemselves that way.\n  These are taxpayers. They are hard-working families who pay sales \ntax, both State and local. They have payroll taxes that come out of \ntheir checks. They pay excise tax, and in\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\nmany of our rural States that is an awful lot when they travel for \nmiles to get from their homes to their jobs.\n  It is so important for all of us to recognize that these taxes these \nindividuals are paying are in equal proportion, many times, to many of \nthe other people in different income and tax brackets, but these are \ntaxes that never see cuts. Rarely do we see a cut in a sales tax or in \nthe payroll tax, certainly, or in the State and local sales tax. In the \nexcise taxes? We don't see cuts in these areas.\n  Therefore, it is so important that we provide the kind of assistance \nwe can for these working families, to make sure they are going to be \nable to help stimulate this economy and certainly to help strengthen \nour country.\n\n  The news reports that followed the passage of the tax bill noted that \nfamilies do receive a check of $400 in July. But they did neglect to \nmention those 12 million children who would not get those checks. I am \nso pleased that today we are recognizing it is not only an important \nissue to deal with, providing these 12 million children the kind of \nresources they need in their families to grow strong, to learn the \nvalues we want them to learn, to become good citizens and leaders and \nworkers in this great Nation, but we are also recognizing the fairness \nof this issue in a timely way.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the House in that they have that same \nopportunity to recognize this is a timely issue. If we want these \nworking families to have that same benefit, to be able to receive that \ntax credit, that child benefit credit in the same timely way that other \nindividuals will receive that tax relief, then we have to do it \nimmediately. We do have to move forward quickly.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the House to really take to heart the \nimmediacy of this issue and help us move it forward quickly. The \npassage of this provision today is the first step in ensuring those 12 \nmillion children will also get that $400 check, or whatever check they \nare entitled to--and it might be more--in July, at the same time others \ndo. Time is definitely of the essence. I call on the Members of the \nother body to act quickly on this bill and ensure that all of our \nworking families will benefit.\n  The uniform definition of the child, as I mentioned, through Chairman \nGrassley's efforts and certainly those of many others, Senator Hatch \nand Senator Baucus, is a great inclusion in this measure.\n  In short, this is a targeted tax provision to help working families. \nIt is what I have argued since we began this round of tax discussions \nin January, and I hope we can continue in that vein.\n  People ask, why is it so important? For me, that question is a very \neasy one to answer. Nearly half of the taxpayers in Arkansas have \nadjusted gross incomes of less than $20,000. Arkansas families were \namong some of the hardest hit when the refundable portion of the child \ncredit was stripped from the bill. That is why it is important to me. \nIt was important enough to bring up this issue and certainly to \nreaddress something that did not happen in that original tax bill.\n  Mr. President, 76,000 Arkansas families, 132,000 Arkansas children, \nwere left behind in that final tax bill when it was signed. If that is \nnot reason enough for me to cause a ruckus or to be persistent, I don't \nknow what is. I appreciate the accolades from my colleagues, but really \nwhat is more important--I think it is essential that we recognize, when \nwe take actions such as the recent tax bill, there is a lot of \nimportance in the details. We have to recognize that when we do not pay \nattention to the details, there are many individuals who get left \nbehind, who are not going to receive those benefits. This is one of \nthose cases.\n  I say to my colleagues, this is not about trying to create more debt \nfor these children who will also inherit that debt later on; this is \nabout taking something we could have done and we didn't, taking \nsomething we could do better, acknowledging it, and moving forward with \nthe actions that will create that better circumstance for working \nfamilies.\n\n  That is why I have been working so hard these past few weeks--and for \nthe last 3 years--recognizing what it means to the families in \nArkansas.\n  It is also important for all of us in the Senate, and in the \nCongress, as we move forward on very important legislation, such as the \ntax bill that was just signed into law, to put ourselves in the shoes \nof these families. We talk about raising our families. We talk about \nraising our children. We talk about what it takes to create a family \natmosphere that is focused on values, that is focused on good manners, \nis focused on compassion and being part of a community, reaching out to \none another. It means, too, that each of us has to recognize all of our \nfamilies are faced with different circumstances, whether it is military \npersonnel stationed in Iraq and leaving a wife and two children at \nhome; whether it is a schoolteacher or a firefighter; whether it is a \npolice officer, many of whom fall into this category that was left \nout--these who make $10,500 to $26,625. That doesn't seem to be a \ncategory that would include that many, but it does. These are essential \npeople in our communities, those who are protecting us from fire and \nfrom criminal activity, those who are teaching our children, those who \nare stationed abroad and protecting our very freedoms. So it is so \ncritical we put ourselves in their shoes and better understand what it \nis they are doing for their families.\n  I have to say I have a good opportunity because when I take care of \nmy family, I try to stop and think: Are there other mothers out there \ndoing the same thing I am? Is it any different for a mother who is in \nthe Senate than it is for a mother who is making $20,000, when you go \nto the store and you have to spend that week's paycheck on blue jeans \nand tennis shoes, a set of tires to make your automobile safe to get \nyour children to and from school or yourself to and from work? There is \nnot a lot of difference, regardless of who you are. Giving these \nindividuals the ability to take care of those family needs is critical.\n  We have not even talked about the aspect of how this can be a \nstimulative partner in what this overall tax bill was meant to do. It \nwas meant to stimulate the economy. Why do we want to stimulate the \neconomy anyway? We want to stimulate the economy because we want to \nstrengthen our country, because we believe in this country and we \nbelieve in what makes up this country. There is no better place to \nlook, in order to do that, than the American family.\n  So I praise my colleagues today for recognizing that there are a \nworld of families out there we can help today--mothers and fathers, \nworking hard, playing by the rules at their jobs. They are not eligible \nfor these credits unless they are working, unless they are bringing \nhome earnings, and unless they have children.\n  There is a whole group of individuals we could help here by giving \nthem the opportunity to give something back to their country in \nstrengthening this economy. Who else is going to be there to purchase \nthe majority of items that will spur our economy and spur those \ncompanies that need to be driven?\n  In conclusion, I applaud all of my colleagues. This has been a \nunified effort among many people to try to do the right thing. I think, \nafter all, that is what we are here in the Senate to do--the right \nthing on behalf of the working families of this great Nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Oklahoma 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to vote against this \namendment.\n  I want to state a few things. I would like to correct the Record and \nstate a few facts. I have heard some people say this provision was \nstripped out of a provision in the tax bill and it therefore left low-\nincome people without any benefits from President Bush's tax cut. That \nis factually inaccurate. The fact is that in the year 2001 we passed a \ntax bill, and many of the people who complained mostly about this \nprovision voted against the 2001 bill and the 2003 bill. Now they come \nback and say: You didn't do enough in this one category.\n  We did a lot for low-income people. We reduced the tax rate from 15 \npercent to 10 percent. And we did it retroactively, well after we \npassed the bill.\n\n[[Page S7451]]\n\nWe reduced that rate by a third--15 percent to 10 percent--and did it \nretroactively. We reduced every other rate on the books by 1 percentage \npoint. I just mention that. We did a lot.\n  We increased the standard deduction by 20 percent. We increased the \nchild tax credit from $500 to $1,000. It was $600. In the 2003 bill \nwhich the President just signed, we made it $1,000. That benefits \nfamilies. It disproportionally benefits low-income people. We took \nmillions of people off the tax rolls. They didn't have to pay taxes as \na result of the fact that we reduced rates. And we passed tax credits. \nAfter we passed tax credits, millions of people who were taxpayers were \nno longer taxpayers.\n\n  Then we get into the issue of refundability. We already have an \nunearned income tax credit, which is one of the most plagued, \ninaccurate programs we have in the Federal Government. It is about a \n$30 billion-a-year program. Its error rate is in the 20-some-odd \npercent range. About a fourth of it is in error. There is a lot of \nfraud. There are a lot of inaccuracies. People claim children they \ndon't have so they can get a bigger refund. Maybe some of it was \ninaccurate and maybe some if it was on purpose.\n  Some people say the Bush tax cut didn't benefit low-income families. \nThat is factually incorrect. Let me give you an example. Before the \nBush tax cut, if you had a low-income couple and both made minimum wage \nwith a combined income of $21,000, they had personal exemptions--\ntalking about, let us say, a family of four--$12,200; a standard \ndeduction of $7,900; their taxable income is $850 at 15 percent tax; \ntheir income tax was $128; and for their earned income credit, we would \nwrite a check for $2,888. They received a net income tax refund of \n$2,761. Somebody said they pay payroll taxes. Yes, they could. That is \na total of $1,607. So they received $1,154 after they paid income taxes \nand payroll taxes.\n  That was before President Bush's 2001 or 2003 tax bill passed. After \nthe bills we just passed, they will receive a net refund in excess of \nincome taxes and Social Security taxes of $2,332. That is a 102-percent \nincrease. That is what the Government is writing them a check for. That \nis the amount left over after they paid income taxes and payroll taxes.\n  The question we are now really debating is, Do we want to have the \nFederal Government write bigger checks, and have bigger negative income \ntaxes? Do we want to try to make the Income Tax Code more progressive? \nUsually when they say that, they mean lower income people pay a greater \npercentage.\n  Under present law, the upper 5 percent of the income tax bracket pay \n50 percent of the tax; the lower 50 percent of the income tax bracket \npay 5 percent of the tax. Yet some people say that is not progressive \nenough; that we need to have Uncle Sam write bigger checks to people \neven in multiples of their payroll taxes and income taxes combined--not \nequal to, not balancing out payroll taxes, but we want to write them in \nmultiples.\n  Part of this amendment says let us increase the refundability far in \nexcess of payroll and income taxes. I don't support that theory. That \nwas in fact in the 2001 bill. Part of the tax bill we agreed to said we \nwould have a percentage. The child tax credit would be refundable--10 \npercent. And, oh yes, in the year 2005, we would make that 15 percent.\n  The amendment on which we are going to vote would accelerate that \nreduction to 15 percent immediately. That would probably happen. It \ncould have happened. It actually passed the Finance Committee and \npassed the floor of the Senate. Had we had greater support for the \nbill, it could have been in the conference report.\n  I hope before final passage, we can make the child credit permanent. \nI hope when the bill comes back from conference, we will make permanent \na $1,000 tax credit for all individuals. Then we can make this change \nin addition.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the information titled ``Family of Four \nWith Two Minimum Wage Workers'' be printed in the Record, along with \nthe ``Child Credit/EIC Effect on Tax Burden'' information.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              FAMILY OF FOUR WITH TWO MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          PRE-2001 BUSH TAX CUT\n \nWages.......................................................    $21,000\nPersonal exemptions.........................................

Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator from Texas 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am certainly going to support this \nbill and this vehicle. But I did hold it up for a few hours because I \nam concerned that we are not able to put marriage penalty relief in a \npermanent position on this bill. However, I have an agreement with the \nmajority leader that he will bring it up this year. Working with the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, and hopefully with the ranking \nmember, we must fix the marriage penalty.\n  What we have today is a situation in which we relieve the marriage \npenalty for 2 years, then for 4 years it comes back, then 2 years later \nit goes away, and then it comes back for good. This is outrageous. Our \nmarried couples do not need a rubber band; they need a Band-Aid. They \nneed to be able to know that when they get married, it is not going to \ncost them $1,200 a year.\n  Two Navy lieutenants will lose more than $1,500 a year if the \nmarriage penalty goes away in 2 years; two Army warrant officers will \nlose $852 a year. This is not right. I have the commitment from \nleadership that we will take up a bill this year that fixes this \ninequity, and I hope there will be a bipartisan effort. We cannot let \npeople be unsure about their marriage penalty relief.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee and ask \nhim if he will work with me to ensure that we take this up this year so \nwe can get on and fix the child tax credit. Next on the agenda I hope \nwill be marriage penalty relief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I was a party to the conversation with \nthe majority leader and the Senator from Texas. She has accurately \nstated what was discussed at that meeting. I will try my darnedest to \nfulfill it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate it very much. \nWe will have marriage penalty relief permanent this year. And we will \nhave child tax credit relief permanent, I hope, in the very near \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Maine 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Grassley for all of his \nefforts and endeavors to move quickly to address this omission in the \ngrowth package that passed the U.S. Congress recently. I appreciate the \nfact that he has worked hard to assist us in reaching an agreement on \nthis vital issue.\n  I also express my appreciation to the Senator from Montana, Mr. \nBaucus, in making the difference in bridging all of the efforts to \nreach this decision today in passing this legislation.\n  I especially thank my colleague, Senator Lincoln, who has been a \nchampion in this fight, both in the Senate Finance Committee on this \nissue and also on the refundability issue back in the 2001 tax cut, in \nwhich we included a refundable provision for the child tax credit. She \ncertainly has been a strong ally and supporter, and I appreciate all of \nthe efforts she has been involved in to make sure this accelerated \nrefundability is a reality.\n  I am pleased to have worked with all of my colleagues on this issue. \nI know it was not easy. There are differences on both sides with \nrespect to some of these issues. But I think in the final analysis we \nare addressing an inequity that existed in the tax package that we \npassed in the Congress a few weeks ago. I think this agreement \nultimately closes the fairness gap in economic relief for working \nAmerican families. It ensures that 6.5 million families who were left \nout of the jobs and growth package enacted this year will now benefit \nfrom the child tax credit. And by acting so quickly, it will also \nensure that these families will share in the rebate checks that \nqualifying families will receive in August under the growth package as \nwell.\n  This means 12 million children in low-income families will have the \nbenefit of tax relief under the growth package. I think this is vitally \nimportant in redressing this wrong, in making sure we provide the kind \nof tax relief they deserve.\n  Now, I heard here that working families don't shoulder the burden in \nthe Federal Tax Code, but that isn't true. They do pay taxes. They pay \npayroll taxes. In fact, payroll taxes have become an inordinate burden \non working families.\n  The agreement ensures that 6.5 million low-income families who would \nhave been left out of the jobs and growth packages enacted this month \nwill now benefit from the child tax credit. And by acting quickly, it \nensures these families will also share in the rebate checks qualifying \nfamilies will receive in August under the growth package.\n  This agreement would not have been possible without the tenacious \nleadership of Senate Majority Leader Frist, and Minority Leader \nDaschle, who kept negotiations on track so the Senate could complete \nwork this week. So I deeply appreciate their efforts.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Lincoln, who has been a tireless \nchampion in this fight. From the time I first offered the refundable \nchild tax credit to the 2001 tax bill, Sentor Lincoln has been a strong \nally and supporter, and we worked together again this year to include \nrefundability in the Finance Committee-passed growth package. Over the \npast week I have been proud to work with her once again to ensure \nfamilies omitted from the child credit would receive the refundable \ncredit they deserve.\n  I thank Finance Chairman Grassley, who quickly stepped forward last \nweek to address this omission from the jobs and growth package, and has \nworked so graciously with Senator Lincoln and me to achieve this \nagreement. He and Ranking Member Baucus have made the difference in \nbridging differences over this legislation, and we appreciate their \nsincere efforts.\n  Today we join to finish the job that Senator Lincoln and I started in \n2001. At the signing of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001, which included the newly created partially \nrefundable child tax credit, I wholeheartedly agreed with the President \nwhen he remarked that:\n\n       Tax relief is a great achievement for the American people . \n     . . tax relief is an achievement for families struggling to \n     enter the middle class . . . (and) tax relief is \n     compassionate and it is now on the way.\n\n  Those are the same reasons we introduced a bill along with Senators \nJohn Warner, Jack Reed, Jim Jeffords, and others to ensure that we are \nas\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\ncompassionate today about our tax relief as we were then. This bill is \nresponsible because it is fully offset, and it makes sense because it \nbrings relief to working families while helping our economy.\n  The Lincoln-Snowe bill incorporated in this package makes the child \ntax credit refundable for families earing between $10,500 and $26,625, \nhelping 12 million children--6.5 million families--and almost 73,000 \nchildren in my home State of Maine from nearly 44,000 families, who \nwould not have received the full benefit under the original bill.\n  But that is not all--in addition to helping working families we are \nalso talking about military families, and this legislation will treat \nmembers of the military and their families more fairly as well. I know \nthat as chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner \nwas deeply concerned about omitting the one million children living in \nactive duty military and military veteran families. With this \nlegislation, those families--including 900 in Maine--will now benefit \nfrom refundability. The bottom line is, these men and women have \nsacrificed for us, they deserve the credit--the child tax credit.\n\n  Our legislation would accelerate the refundable portion of the child \ntax credit under law from 10 to 15 percent retroactive beginning \nJanuary 1 of this year. This would ensure the hardworking mothers and \nfathers of America, including members of the Armed Forces who earn less \nthan $26,000 per year, will be able to benefit from the increase in the \nchild tax credit that has just become law. It will also ensure the \nprovision of the 2001 law that directly benefits them will also be \naccelerated as the law enacted last week accelerates all of the other \nchild tax credit provisions.\n  I know some have said, this is tax relief for people who don't pay \ntaxes. To that argument, I would point out two factors. First, the \nFederal income tax--while a large share of the tax burden facing \nAmericans, are not the only taxes people pay. In fact, a larger tax \nburden on low-income workers is the payroll tax. The extent of this \nburden is exacerbated when one realizes that fully 33 percent of all \njobs in my home State, for example, do not pay a livable wage.\n  Secondly, while I believe that all families could use a helping hand \nwhen it comes to paying for the rising costs of raising a family, once \nagain, the children who would benefit from the enactment of this bill \nare children in working families--families that do pay taxes and, just \nlike everyone else in these trying economic times, these people are \nstruggling to get by.\n  Consider that, in order to be eligible for the partially refundable \ncredit, a parent needs to surpass an income threshold that is currently \nat $10,500 per year. That means that a parent needs to work more than \njust a full-time minimum wage job. However, this provision benefits \nmore than just minimum wage workers. This provision assists some of our \nyounger families. For instance, the base pay for a first-year soldier \nis $16,000 and it affects workers in our health care and social service \nsectors, where, for instance, in Maine paramedics in 2001 were only \nmaking an average of $22,000, or where our home health aides were \nmaking only an average of $18,500 per year. These people are a critical \npart of our infrastructure and they deserve tax relief too.\n  That is why I was disappointed the conferees chose to remove this \nprovision from the jobs and growth package--a provision which was \nincluded in the bill both as it passed the Finance Committee, and when \nit was passed by the Senate. Today, we have the opportunity to take a \nstep to correct this inequity.\n  This bill also addresses provisions included in Chairman Grassley's \nproposal addressing the definition of a child in the Tax Code, and in \naddressing a marriage penalty under the original bill. The ``uniform \ndefinition of a child'' consolidates five separate definitions of a \nchild in the Federal Tax Code, simplifying and clarifying the law. As a \nresult, more families will more easily qualify for the benefits they \nneed and deserve.\n  Finally, the agreement will provide relief for married couples with \nchildren by addressing a marriage penalty under the existing child \ncredit. Our agreement increases the threshold of the child tax credit \nfor couples with children to $150,000.\n  Importantly--and in keeping with the principles that have guided me \nthroughout the budget and tax process this year--our bill pays for this \ntax relief by extending customs user fees that will expire this year \nand would need to be extended anyway. And in doing so we are not \ngrowing our already ballooning national deficit. This is critical in \nensuring we do not add the debt burden on the very children that will \nbenefit from this bill.\n  Mr. President, Senate action today sends the message that relief for \nhardworking families won't take a back seat in America's tax code. It \nrepresents sound policy that Congress has already considered and \nadopted. It has the support of the White House, and I hope our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives will take up and pass this \nagreement promptly so it can be signed into law.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor the Lincoln-Snowe amendment to H.R. 1308 to reinstate the child tax \ncredit for low-income working Americans.\n  The House and the Senate went to conference on the reconciliation \nbill. For the public at large, when we talk about a reconciliation \nbill, it is kind of arcane. The House and the Senate confer to get a \nbill together, with each side presenting the views of its Members. I am \nnot sure I am making it more clear, but I want to make sure this is \nunderstood. When those conferees got together, they stripped out this \ntax credit for low-income working people. I thought that was a most \noutrageous act.\n  The Bush tax cut bill was already a handout to wealthy elites. It \nthrew token benefits to some others and virtually nothing to working \npeople. Taking out the tax credit for families earning between $10,500 \na year and $26,625 a year added outrage to an insult.\n  When the President was forced, as a result of the agreements in the \nCongress, to reduce the tax cut to $350 billion, he and the House \nRepublicans had to search for about $30 billion in ``fat'' to cut out \nof the bill to meet that target. Why didn't they slow down the \nreduction in the top rate? It is a pretty easy thing to do. What did \nthey do instead? They went after low-income working families.\n  These are people who are working at or just above minimum wage. These \nare Americans who are feeding their families by laboring in cafeterias, \ncleaning offices, working late at night, working in the factories \npacking food or making clothing, working in retail chains and small \nstores across the country--jobs that are traditionally at the low end \nof the pay scale. These people work hard and are a significant part of \nour labor force.\n  I know there are those in the administration who do not have any idea \nwhat it is like to work for low wages and try to raise a family on \nthem. I learned what it was like from my parents, who were brought here \nas child immigrants. They knew what it was like and I knew what it was \nlike because my parents were poor. They worked hard and tried to give \ntheir children an example of respect for hard work, and to hold out \nideals, even though there was little money.\n  The Lincoln-Snowe amendment is about restoring the American dream. It \nis about knowing that this country is a fair and honest place, where \nsomeone willing to work can still make a living. It is about knowing \nthat this Government and this Congress respect hard work and loyalty to \nfamilies. The Bush tax bill telegraphed a terrible shift in the message \nour Government is sending to the country. Despite the once revered view \nthat hard work pays off and breeds respect, President Bush and the \nHouse Republicans failed to support that contention to millions of \nhard-working Americans.\n  Why did they do it? Why did they drop a tax benefit that would have \nhelped almost 12 million children who have low-income working parents? \nWhy? The tax credit for hard-working minimum wage families was thrown \noverboard to make room for even more tax cuts for the highest income \nearners in our country. The cost of the tax credit to low-income \nfamilies was $3.5 billion--not an insignificant sum by any means. But \nwe could have found\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\nmore than that by nicking the reduction to the top income tax rate by \njust a little bit.\n  This is the rate the people at the top of the income scale will pay. \nWe are talking about people who make over $1 million a year. We are \ntalking about the top 1 percent of the country, households with average \nincomes over $350,000 or so. These are the people who are going to \nprofit most from the President's tax cut. We are going to reduce the \nrate, the income tax rate that they will have to pay.\n  If we only reduced that top rate to 35.3 percent instead of a flat 35 \npercent for the years 2003 through 2005, we would have saved $3.9 \nbillion, and the cost of the tax credit for low-income families is $3.5 \nbillion. That is a lot of money. But not in the context of a $350 \nbillion tax cut package; it is only 1 percent. There would have been \nmore than enough to save the child tax credit.\n  White House spokesmen repeatedly claimed that President Bush's tax \nbill would provide a tax cut for every American taxpayer. But that was \nnot true. The final bill left out 8 million working Americans and \nalmost 12 million children. The wealthy certainly got their tax cut. It \nwas approximately $90 billion in tax cuts over 10 years that will go to \n200,000 households nationwide with annual incomes of $1 million or \nmore. That is about $450,000 per household.\n  President Kennedy said, ``To govern is to choose.'' To give massive \ntax cuts to people who are already well off, and then tell hard-\nworking, low-income families, ``Sorry, there is nothing left for you,'' \nis awful. That is not a choice I want America to make.\n  Fortunately, after some gentle pressure from the media and outraged \nconstituents, the Republican majority has seen how egregious that plan \nwas and they now support the Lincoln-Snowe amendment. It is about time \nwe did something to help families who are struggling, and not just the \nfortunate few who are coasting. We have the opportunity to repair some \nof the harm caused by the President's unfair tax plan with this \namendment. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \namendment offered today by Chairman Grassley, and to add my voice to \nthose of my colleagues who have risen today in support of it. I have \nlong been a supporter of the refundable child credit. I was a leading \nproponent of the increase in the child tax credit for low-income \nfamilies that was enacted as part of the 2001 tax bill, and I strongly \nsupported this provision when it was added to the Senate version of the \nTax Act passed last month.\n  The economic growth package the President signed into law last week \ngives tax relief to all working Americans, including low-income \nfamilies, many of whom will see a substantial reduction in their taxes. \nBut some low-income families could not receive the benefit of the \nincreased child tax credit that the package provides because the 10 \npercent earned-income threshold was not accelerated to 15 percent as \nthe Senate version of the package provided. This amendment restores the \nacceleration of that threshold as this Chamber originally provided.\n  More than 119,000 Mainers will benefit from the increase in the child \ntax credit that we approved as part of economic growth package. The \naction we take today expands the reach of this assistance to thousands \nmore hard-working Maine families. As a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I was keenly aware that nearly 200,000 enlisted men \nand women could claim this credit for their children if we expanded the \nguidelines. Doing so sends exactly the right message of appreciation as \nmany of them return home from fighting for the cause of freedom in \nIraq.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to support Senator \nLincoln's legislation to make the recent increase in the child tax \ncredit available to more families. I thank the Senator from Arkansas \nfor her tenacious fight on behalf of America's working families. I was \ndisappointed that the tax cuts passed by this Congress last month left \nout eight million children whose parents are working everyday and \nstruggling to make ends meet. Today we will begin to correct that \ninjustice.\n  In West Virginia, there are about 57,000 children whose parents earn \nbetween $10,500 and $26,625. While these parents currently receive some \nbenefit from the child tax credit, they do not stand to get any \nadditional benefit based on last month's tax cut. For average families, \nwho don't make money from dividends or capital gains, the child tax \ncredit was the most valuable provision included in the recent tax cut \npackage. The families of 57,000 West Virginia children should not be \nleft out. Let's be clear that these families pay taxes. Payroll tax, \nsales tax, excise tax, property tax--these families are struggling to \nmake ends meet, and they are paying their fair share in tax.\n  It seems to me that families who are working hard but earning low \nwages are just the sort of families we ought to be seeking to help. \nThese parents play by the rules, but struggle to provide the same \nthings that all parents want to provide: enough food, a good home, \nschoolbooks, new shoes, perhaps a soccer uniform. In addition, we know \nthat providing additional tax relief to these families will stimulate \nthe economy, because these families are likely to immediately spend any \nadditional cash.\n  During the recent tax cut debate, the Senate was right to increase \nthe amount of the child tax credit that low-income working families \ncould receive. But during partisan negotiations to finalize that tax \nbill, these families were abandoned in order to provide more tax cuts \nto wealthy investors. One of the reasons that I opposed the recent tax \ncut package was that I could not condone a deal that provided $150 \nbillion in tax cuts to wealthy investors but dropped a provision to \nhelp our neediest working families that would cost just $3.5 billion. \nThere are a lot of pieces of that deal that I wish we would undo. I \nrealize that we won't. But at least today, by passing Senator Lincoln's \nlegislation, we will take one important step toward making those tax \ncuts more fair for America's working families.\n  The legislation before us today has a number of other important \nprovisions. It will ensure that two single parents would not lose their \nchild tax credit if they got married. The bill also simplifies the tax \ncode, something we should seek to do with every new tax law. I am \nespecially pleased that the bill includes a provision to offset the \ncost of these new tax cuts. I have serious concerns about the record \ndeficits we face, especially in light of the enormous tax cuts recently \nenacted. This bill will not add a penny to our national debt.\n  In short, this is a balanced, responsible, and fair piece of \nlegislation. While this bill does not do everything that I would like \nto do to improve the child tax credit and truly make it available to \nall low-income working families, it is still a major improvement on the \ntax cuts enacted last month. I hope that all of my colleagues will \nsupport this bill and send the message to hard working families that \nare struggling to make ends meet that we are on their side. And I ask \nall of my colleagues to encourage the House of Representatives to act \nquickly on this bill so that the President can sign it into law as soon \nas possible. Refund checks for the child tax credit increase are \nscheduled to be mailed this summer. If we act quickly we can ensure \nthat an additional 8 million families will receive checks.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Blanche \nLincoln, D-AR, and Senator Olympia Snowe, R-ME, in proposing important \nbipartisan legislation to accelerate the refundable portion of the \nchild tax credit to low-income families. As chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, I have a special obligation to look after the \nwelfare of the young men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, up to \n200,000 of whom could be eligible for and deserve this tax credit.\n  Over the past few weeks, we in Congress, have worked hard to pass the \neconomic stimulus package to promote long-term economic stability, and \nto stimulate investment and new job creation. While these provisions \nwill provide substantial relief to America's families, our work is not \nyet complete.\n  Included in the tax package were provisions to immediately increase \nthe Child Tax Credit from $600 to $1,000 an important tax reform that \nwe all support. However, the new law did not\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\nmake the necessary technical changes in the refundability component \nwhich is necessary for certain low-income individuals to take advantage \nof the increase. I believe in providing fair and equitable tax relief \nto all Americans, especially to those raising children, our Nation's \nfuture.\n  Providing tax relief is an important bipartisan achievement. Now we \nmust build on this accomplishment by correcting this oversight and \nensure that these hard working families are not ineligible for this \nneeded benefit. The legislation I am cosponsoring will correct the \ninequity and provide low-income families, those who need it the most, \nthe full tax credit.\n  The bill accelerates the refundable part of the new $1,000 child tax \ncredit provision from 10 to 15 percent, so American families in the \n$10,500 to $26,625 income bracket, who were not included in the new tax \nlaw, would receive the same benefits as those families with children in \nother brackets.\n  The costs attributed to accelerating the child tax credit would be \noffset by closing corporate tax shelters. However, the important task \nbefore the Senate is to correct this oversight and provide these low-\nincome families with fairness and the ability to take advantage of the \nincrease in the child tax credit.\n  I am also cosponsoring related legislation introduced in the Senate \nby Finance Chairman Grassley to correct this issue and also to make the \nchild tax credit and the refundable portion of the tax credit permanent \nlaw.\n  It is my hope that we can pass either of these legislative proposals, \nor any other similar approach, to correct this inequity. We have a \nresponsibility to American families trying to care for their children, \nusing their resources as best they can, to provide fair and equal \ntreatment under the Tax Code.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 42 seconds credited to the \nSenator from Montana; 28 seconds to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the bill offered by my \ngood friend, the senior Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, and my \ngood friend from Maine, Senator Snowe. Their legislation ensures that \nour military and low- and middle-income parents will receive a check \nfrom the child tax credit.\n  The legislation repairs the damage done by the majority in the tax \nbill conference. Senator Lincoln was successful in getting this \nprovision included in the $350 billion tax bill that passed the Finance \nCommittee and the Senate. But the provision was specifically stripped \nout before passage of the final version of the $350 billion tax bill.\n  Let me give you some examples of who does not benefit from the tax \nbill that was signed into law by President Bush last week.\n  First, a 24-year-old single mom with one child. She works hard every \nday to put food on the table, buy clothes for her daughter, and ensure \nadequate childcare for her daughter while she is at work.\n  She makes $15,000 a year. She pays $1,150 per year in payroll taxes. \nShe pays $1,150 in Federal taxes yet gets zero benefit from the \nrecently enacted tax bill. She will not see any check this summer.\n  Taxes are taxes. I would like to see someone tell her that her \npayroll taxes are less of a burden to her than an equal amount of \nincome taxes paid by Bill gates.\n  Senators Lincoln and Snowe fixed that problem. The fix means $225 in \nher pocket this summer.\n  She sees a big chunk of her paycheck every week getting paid to the \nGovernment. She also pays a lot of other taxes--including sales taxes, \nexcise taxes, and property taxes. She deserves equal treatment.\n  My second example illustrates the impact for military families. The \nDepartment of Defense has estimated that there are approximately \n192,000 military families who earn between $10,000 and $25,000. And \nmost of those 192,000 military families will not receive any tax relief \nfrom the $350 billion tax bill.\n  To make matters worse, the families of military personnel who are \nstationed in combat zones are really left out of the big tax cut.\n  In my second example, a Marine gunnery sergeant with 8 years service \nis stationed in Afghanistan for the last 6 months of 2002, and in Iraq \nfrom January through March of 2003. She has two children.\n  She receives an annual salary of $32,015 and hazardous duty pay of \n$150 per month. Because the income earned by our military while they \nare stationed in a combat zone is not included in taxable income, only \n$24,000 of her income is subject to tax. Under the bill that was passed \nlast week, the check she gets this summer will only be $150.\n  I am pleased that at least she will see something. But if the Lincoln \nchild tax credit had been preserved in the $350 billion tax bill, this \nMarine gunnery sergeant and her family would receive a check for $800 \nthis summer just like the President has promised to other middle-income \nfamilies. Unless we fix the problem, she will not see a dime of this.\n  The Lincoln/Snowe legislation ensures that we count a soldier's \ncombat zone compensation for purposes of the child tax credit, even \nthough that income is excluded for purposes of the income tax.\n  These examples illustrate just how unfair the tax bill was.\n  The big tax bill was not fair to working Americans or our military \npersonnel. Clearly, the benefits were skewed heavily to the elites of \nthis country.\n  One of the beauties of America is that we work to treat people \nequally. But the $350 billion tax bill did not come close to treating \nall Americans equally. Simply put, it was not fair.\n  Instead, the choice was made to lower the tax for dividend and \ncapital gain income, rather than extend the child tax credit to hard-\nworking, low-income taxpayers.\n  The bill that returned from conference--the one that was signed into \nlaw--also stripped out other provisions to provide tax relief to those \nserving our country in the armed services--those serving in Iraq, in \nAfghanistan, and all across the globe.\n  It is disturbing that we can pass this tax bill with all these \nbenefits for the elite of our country. But the conferees specifically \nstripped out a provision that would exempt $6,000 of death benefit \npayments from income for our military families.\n  And, they specifically stripped out the child tax credit provision \nthat put money into the hands of our military and lower and middle-\nincome families.\n  There is no way around it. The big tax bill was simply unfair.\n  Senators Lincoln and Snowe are giving us the chance to right one of \nthe wrongs--without increasing the deficit. Enactment of their \nlegislation ensures that 12 million children are helped.\n  Without their legislation, the families of 8 million children will \nsee absolutely no benefit from the increased child credit that was \nsigned into law last week. These families will not receive any check \nthis summer.\n  And, millions more families will see a check much smaller than the \n$400 promised.\n  In Montana, 54,000 kids--fully one-quarter of the children in \nMontana--will not benefit from the $350 billion tax bill. But the \nLincoln/Snowe legislation would get a check out--this summer--to the \nworking parents of thousands of Montana children.\n  Their legislation gets the child tax credit to millions of parents--\nwithout saddling their children with huge Government deficits--and \nwithout robbing the Social Security trust fund. They fix a $3.5 billion \nproblem, and pay for it.\n  Unfortunately, some in the Republican leadership considered using \nthis as an opportunity to spend another $130 billion in tax cuts. That \nwas their idea of a ``fix.''\n  Moreover, they did not intend to pay for these extra tax cuts. \nInstead they wanted our children and grandchildren and our Nation's \nseniors to shoulder more of the burden.\n  In the past couple of days, we have been able to reach an agreement \nto correct the wrong created with the passage of the recent tax bill. I \nstrongly support the Lincoln/Snowe child tax credit legislation. I urge \nmy colleagues to stand united to get this legislation enacted into law \nthis week. These families should not be asked to wait any longer.\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\n  They deserve to get their check this summer--just like all of the \nparents who were taken care of under the $350 billion tax bill.\n  This is the right thing to do. This is the fair thing to do. This is \nthe moral thing to do.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln. She has done \na terrific job highlighting this issue and the need for this child tax \ncredit provision.\n  Second, Senator Snowe, as I have mentioned several times, has been \ntremendous in championing this cause. And I might say, with regard to \nthe 2001 tax bill, she deserves the lion's share of the credit for the \nchild tax credit provisions that are in that bill.\n  The chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, has been, as usual, \njust his terrific self in working with the various Senators to try to \nfind an accommodation that makes sense.\n  I also thank Senator Warner who focused on the impact of this bill on \nmilitary families. In that respect, the bill will permit thousands of \nmilitary families, especially those serving in combat zones, to benefit \nfrom the child credit. Without this provision in this pending measure, \nthose military families would not get the benefit of the credit.\n  Finally--I know time is of the essence here--it is imperative that \nthe House act on this matter within 2 weeks so that the checks can get \nto the millions of families covered by this bill. Otherwise, two sets \nof checks would have to be sent out, and I think that would be the \nheight of inefficiency and a waste on the part of Uncle Sam. That would \nbe the consequence of the failure of the other body to act within 2 \nweeks. So I call on the House to act.\n  I see the Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee. I yield the rest of any time I have to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, I am not here to in any way suggest what went right, \nwhat went wrong. My understanding is there is a reconciliation of \nviewpoints now. We have before us the opportunity to provide for this \nchild tax credit for a category of individuals who, for reasons that I \nam certain the record explains, were preempted from the legislation.\n  Upon learning this, as others did--largely through press accounts--I \nimmediately called my distinguished chairman, Mr. Grassley; I called my \ndistinguished friend from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles; I called Mrs. \nLincoln and could not get a phone through to Montana, but I made an \neffort to try to reach you.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I beg your pardon.\n  Mr. WARNER. Rural electrification.\n  But anyway, Mr. President, I feel very strongly that the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces--some 200,000-plus families--very much need \nthis benefit. They are the ones who have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand who are all throughout the world taking risks, basically, the \nenlisted ranks.\n  I feel strongly that this great institution--the Senate--wants to be \non record that one of the reasons to go forward, hopefully, and adopt \nthe measure now pending before us is on behalf of the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces of the United States.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield back such time as I might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa yield back his \nremaining time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remaining amount of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n862.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], for himself and \n     Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 864.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, it is an indisputable fact that Indian \ncountry contains some of the richest energy resources in the America.\n  Indian lands comprise approximately 5 percent of the land area of the \nUnited States, but contains an estimated 10 percent of all energy \nreserves in the United States, including: 30 percent of known coal \ndeposits located in the western portion of the United States; 5 percent \nof known onshore oil deposits of the United States; and 10 percent of \nknown onshore natural gas deposits of the United States.\n  Coal, oil, natural gas, and other energy minerals produced from \nIndian land represent more than 10 percent of total nationwide onshore \nproduction of energy minerals.\n  Even though in one year alone over 9.3 million barrels of oil, 299 \nbillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 21 million tons of coal were \nproduced from Indian land, representing $700 million in Indian energy \nrevenue, the Department of the Interior estimates that only 25 percent \nof the oil and less than 20 percent of all natural gas reserves on \nIndian land have been fully developed.\n  It is ironic that many Indian people were forced on to the most arid, \nbarren, and least productive lands in the 1800s and now they find \nthemselves resource rich.\n  Despite what we may read in the Washington Post or the New York Times \nabout the so-called rich Indians and Indian gambling, it is also \nindisputable that Indians are the most economically deprived ethnic \ngroup in the United States. Unemployment levels are far above the \nnational average, in some cases as high as 70 percent. Per capita \nincomes are well below the national average. They have substandard \nhousing, poor health, alcohol and drug abuse, diabetes, amputations, \nand a general malaise and hopelessness, even suicide among Indian \nyoungsters.\n  In fact, in some reservations it is not uncommon to find one out of \nevery two teenage girls and one out of every three boys who attempt \nsuicide driven by despair and a dead end future. In that context, this \namendment I am offering today tries to give them some help.\n  Given the extent of the economic deprivation in Indian country and \nthe vast potential wealth residing in energy resources which could \nameliorate this deprivation, it has long been a puzzle why these \nresources have not been more fully developed.\n  The answer lies partly in the fact that energy resource development \nis by its very nature capital intensive. Most tribes do not have the \nfinancial resources to fund extensive energy projects on their own and \nso must partner with private industry, or other outside entities, by \nleasing out their energy resources for development in return for \nroyalty payments.\n  The unique legal and political relationship between the United States \nand Indian tribes sometimes makes this leasing process cumbersome.\n  As with most Indian law and policy, history plays an important part. \nTowards the end of the 19th Century, Indian tribes were forcibly \nremoved to isolated areas and reservations where it was believed they \nwould not hinder the westward expansion of a new and growing country.\n  The natural resources contained on these lands were taken into trust \nby the Federal Government to be administered for the benefit of Indian \ntribes. The ostensible reason for the trust was the belief that Indians \nwere incapable and incompetent of administering such resources, and \nwould be susceptible to land and resource predators.\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\n  By the way, that belief was prevalent with a lot of people in \nAmerican Government and led the Surgeon General at the time to issue a \nrequest to the U.S. Army that Indian skulls be sent to DC to study and \nfind out if Indians had the intelligence to own their own land. That, \nin turn, gave rise to the saying among modern Indian people that there \nare more dead Indians in Washington, DC, than live ones, because until \nthe last couple of years there were over 16,000 remains, primarily \nskulls and upper body bones, warehoused in the Smithsonian. Just a few \nyears ago, we passed a Museum of the American Indian bill, and one \nprovision of that required that the Smithsonian and other Federal \nagencies start returning those bones.\n  A legal and bureaucratic apparatus was formed to administer this \ntrust, and over a century later this apparatus remains in place in the \nInterior Department.\n  In her capacity as trustee of Indian resources, the Secretary of the \nInterior is required to examine all leases of Indian trust resources, \nto ensure that the terms of the lease benefit the tribe, and to ensure \nthat the trust asset is not wasted.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs has been informed over the year that \nthe Secretarial approval process is often so lengthy that outside \nparties, who otherwise would like to partner with Indian tribes to \ndevelop their energy resources, are reluctant to become entangled in \nthe bureaucratic red tape that inevitably accompanies the leasing of \nTribal resources.\n  Hence, the framework that was originally designed to protect tribes \nhas become an obstacle to development of Tribal resources, in that the \nbureaucratic impediments of trust administration are now a disincentive \nto outside investors.\n  To help remedy these problems, earlier this year I, along with \nSenator Domenici, introduced the Indian Tribal Energy Development and \nSelf Determination Act of 2003 to provide assistance and encouragement \nto Indian tribes to develop their energy resources.\n  This was based really on last year's amendment to the Energy \nconference report, much of the same language. That report, of course, \ndid not emerge from the conference committee and died with the end of \nthe last Congress.\n  This assistance included:\n  The establishment of an Indian Energy Office; grants, loans, and \ntechnical assistance; capacity building; and regulatory changes to the \nrules governing the leasing of Indian lands for energy purposes.\n  At the same time, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, \nintroduced his own Indian energy bill that somewhat mirrored ours.\n  After the hearing and much debate the best of these two bills were \nmelded together into a composite bill that made up title III of the \nbill before us now.\n  The amendment I am offering today contains refinements but not major \nchanges of title III and I would like to walk through these provisions \nfor the benefit of the Members who will be reviewing the Record \ntomorrow.\n  Section 2601 contains definitions. Its standard definitions section \nprovides definitions for a number of terms including the following:\n  Director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy; Indian Tribe; and \nVertical Integration.\n  Section 2602, the Indian Tribal Energy Resource Development, \nauthorizes the Interior Secretary to provide assistance to Indian \ntribes in the form of development grants and grants for obtaining or \ndeveloping managerial capacity needed for energy purposes.\n  It provides low-interest loans to Indian tribes and tribal energy \ndevelopment organizations to promote Indian energy development.\n  Section 2602 also provides assistance to Indian Tribes for purposes \nof energy efficiency and energy conservation; as well as planning, \nconstruction, operation, maintenance of electrical generation \nfacilities on tribal lands.\n  Section 2603, the Indian Tribal Energy Resource Regulation authorizes \nthe Secretary of Interior to make grants to Indian tribes and tribal \nenergy development organizations to use, develop, administer, and \nenforce tribal laws governing the development and management of energy \nresources on their own lands.\n  This section helps tribes build the capacity, if they do not already \nhave it, to develop their resources in an effective and safe way.\n  For instance, a tribe could use these funds to develop a tribal \nenergy resource inventory; to carry out feasibility studies necessary \nto the development of energy resources; to develop and implement tribal \nlaws and technical infrastructure to protect the environment; to train \nemployees engaged in energy development and environmental protection; \nand other functions related to scientific and technical data \ndevelopment and collection.\n  Section 2604 establishes a voluntary process for those tribes that \nchoose it to help develop their energy resources.\n  Under the process, an Indian tribe must first demonstrate to the \nSecretary of Interior that it has the technical and financial capacity \nto develop and manage its own resources.\n  Once it meets this burden, the tribe can negotiate energy resource \ndevelopment leases, agreements and rights-of-way with third parties \nwithout first obtaining the Secretary's approval. This will provide \nstreamlining to the leasing process that is now burdened by an \nextensive Federal regulation I mentioned earlier.\n\n  Whether a tribe decides to avail itself of the new procedure in the \nsection or continue under the current system will be entirely at the \noption and discretion of each tribe. None is required to do so. It is \ntotally voluntary, tribe by tribe.\n  Under current law, in order to be valid, all leases, business \nagreements, and rights-of-way involving restricted land must be \nsubmitted to and approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Section \n2604 of the Campbell amendment provides tribes with the obligation of \nsubmitting to the Secretary a proposed government-to-government \nagreement, a tribal energy resources agreement, sometimes called a \nTERA--and I will continue using that word for simplicity--that will set \nforth mandatory provisions for future leases, business agreements, and \nrights-of-way involving energy development on tribal lands.\n  Along with the proposed TERA, the tribe will have to make a \ndemonstration to the Secretary that it has the experience and \nmanagerial and financial capacity to regulate and develop its own \nenergy resources. If the Secretary approves the TERA, that TERA will \ngovern future development of the tribe's energy resources. The TERA, by \nvirtue of this section, will require tribal leases and agreements to \nhave certain terms, require compliance with all applicable \nenvironmental laws, notice to the public, and consultation with the \nStates as to potential off-reservation impacts. The TERA will provide \nfor an environmental review process that will identify all significant \nimpacts, inform the public, and allow the public to comment on the \npotential environmental impacts before any lease agreement or right-of-\nway is approved.\n  The Secretary will be required to review any direct effects of an \napproval of the TERA itself under NEPA. The subsequent tribal approval \nof leases, business agreements, and rights-of-way under TERA will not \nbe subject to another review under NEPA. In other words, tribes will \nnot be exempt from NEPA. It will be front-loaded so that the \nrequirements are at the secretarial level, but if that agreement goes \nthrough, they will not have to go through the NEPA process two times.\n  The TERA will also require the Secretary to do an annual trust asset \nevaluation to modernize the tribe's energy development activities and \nallow her to reassume the responsibility over those activities if she \nfinds an imminent jeopardy of trust assets. This section gives third \nparties who have or may sustain a significant adverse environmental \nimpact as a result of the tribe's failure to comply with its TERA the \nstanding to petition the Secretary to review the tribe's activities. \nThis process both protects the tribe's status and certainly does not \nallow them to circumvent NEPA. If she finds the tribe in violation of \nTERA, she may suspend the leases or rights-of-way or suspend TERA \naltogether.\n  Section 2604 also discusses the Secretary's trust responsibility. It \nexpressly states that the section does not absolve the United States \nfrom that responsibility and expressly states that the Secretary will \ncontinue to have a trust obligation to protect a tribe when another \nparty to a lease agreement or right-of-way is in breach. It does not \naffect trust responsibility at all.\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\n  Section 2604 provides that the United States will not be liable to \nany party, including a tribe, for losses resulting in the terms of any \nlease agreements or right-of-way executed by the tribe pursuant to the \napproved TERA, which makes sense; Liability follows responsibility. If \na tribe makes the leasing decisions, it should certainly be held \nresponsible. If the United States continues to make the leasing \ndecisions, it will continue to be held responsible. If Indian self-\ndetermination means anything, it means the right of tribes to make \ntheir own decisions and their responsibility to the tribes to live with \nthose decisions.\n\n  Section 2605 deals with the Federal Power Marketing Administration. \nThis section authorizes the Bonneville Power Administration and the \nWestern Area Power Administration to encourage Indian energy \ndevelopment through a variety of means. It authorizes the power \nadministrations to purchase power from Indian tribal generators to meet \ntheir own needs or energy needs on Indian lands, and it requires that \nany such power purchase must not cost more than the prevailing market \nprice.\n  This section also authorizes the Energy Secretary to undertake a \npower allocation study with a report due within 2 years of the \nenactment of the title.\n  Section 2606 deals with Indian mineral development review. This \nsection authorizes the Interior Secretary to undertake a review of all \nactivities conducted under the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982 \nand to report the results of that review to Congress. Included in the \nstudy would be recommendations for overcoming the barriers to greater \nmineral development on Indian lands, such as legal barriers, physical \nbarriers, market barriers, and others.\n  Section 2607 authorizes the Energy Secretary, in tandem with the \nInterior Secretary and the Army Corps of Engineers, to undertake a \nfeasibility study of developing a demonstration project that uses wind \nenergy generated by tribes and hydropower generated by the Army Corps \nof Engineers on the Missouri River to supply area to the Western Area \nPower Administration. A report of this study is due within 1 year of \nenactment.\n  That is the substance of this amendment. It is very important that \nthe choice of the tribes is upheld, and it certainly is whether you \nwant to participate or not.\n  For the record, I ask unanimous consent to have letters of support \nprinted in the Record, including from the National Congress of American \nIndians which has over 300 tribal members, and the Council of Energy \nResource Tribes with over 50 Members, and several letters from \nindividual tribes, including the Chickasaw and the Cherokee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                              National Congress of\n\n\n                                             American Indians,\n\n                                                     June 2, 2003.\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Chairman,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart Office \n       Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: This letter is to offer general \n     support for the Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-\n     Determination Act of 2003 (Title III). Since the release of \n     your mark in April, NCAI has been working feverishly to offer \n     a solution to the concerns expressed by tribal \n     representatives. NCAI engaged in this effort so that we could \n     provide general support for this significant piece of \n     legislation once these concerns were addressed. Through this \n     collaborative process, we believe this legislation has the \n     potential to enhance economic development initiatives and \n     will be of great benefit to economic development in Indian \n     country.\n       As you may be aware, concerns were raised by a number of \n     tribes and tribal advocates regarding some provisions of the \n     Chairman's mark for this measure. We shared in their concern \n     regarding provisions that significantly limit the United \n     State's liability and release the Secretary of Interior from \n     any accountability to Indian tribes for actions that she is \n     required to undertake pursuant to the legislation. \n     Additionally, we were concerned about the definition of \n     ``tribal consortium'' which differed greatly from the \n     definition that is traditionally employed in legislation \n     affecting Indian tribes and offers federal money to non-\n     tribal entities that should be going to Indian tribes. In \n     addition to these two central concerns, we were not satisfied \n     with provisions pertaining to environmental review and we had \n     some general drafting-related issues.\n       Given these concerns, NCAI has convened several conference \n     calls with tribal representatives including the Navajo \n     Nation. Council of Energy Resources Tribes, and the \n     International Council on Utility Policy, and developed a \n     series of tribal recommendations for modifying Title III. We \n     also convened with your staff and Senate Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee staff to discuss the tribal \n     recommendations. Thereafter, your staff held a conference \n     call for those same representatives and staffers from the \n     Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee. Although we are \n     pleased that we were able to craft better language for the \n     trust responsibility provisions, we are still concerned with \n     some of the limitations.\n       Nonetheless, we realize that in this political climate, the \n     language as currently revised is likely the best compromise \n     that can be reached. We appreciate the effort of your staff \n     and other committee staffers to negotiate language that \n     attempts to address the tribal concerns in light of the \n     current political environment. Again, I want to underscore \n     that the tribal support comes from working with a group of \n     tribal representatives and organizations from diverse \n     perspectives, but not all perspectives. Because of this, our \n     revised version of your mark may not reflect the needs and \n     desires of all tribes who wish to utilize this legislation to \n     develop their energy resources.\n       We would like to thank you and your staff for all of their \n     hard work on this very important issue. I cannot stress \n     enough how grateful we are to your commitment to developing \n     legislative solutions to age-old problems in Indian country. \n     Title III is just one more example of how Indian tribes \n     benefit from your championship.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Jacqueline Johnson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Council of Energy Resource Tribes,\n\n                                         Denver, CO, June 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: On behalf of the 53 CERT member \n     Tribes, I am writing to express CERT's support for the Title \n     III Indian Energy provisions of S. 14.\n       As you know, there are some provisions in section 2604 of \n     the Title III of the bill as reported that has caused concern \n     among CERT member Tribes. Fortunately, we believe those \n     concerns have largely been addressed by language agreed to \n     between Committee staff and representatives of CERT and \n     several member Tribes. At this time, we believe we have \n     reached agreement that addresses the concerns of CERT and the \n     Southern Ute Indian Tribe, the Navajo Nation and the \n     Jicarilla Apache Nation. We expect you will hear from each of \n     those tribes as well.\n       CERT has agreed to language that insures that the Tribal \n     Energy Resource Agreements (TERA) process is a voluntary, \n     opt-in program for development of Tribal energy resources. We \n     have also agreed to language to be certain that the public \n     comment opportunities go to the environmental and other \n     impacts of the development and not to the terms of the \n     business agreements themselves. CERT accepts the revised \n     language that better describes the Secretary's trust duties \n     under this section. Finally, the scope of the Secretary's \n     NEPA review of the TERA is settled.\n       While drafting final language for this section has been \n     somewhat difficult, we compliment the staff of both the \n     Senate Energy Comittee and the Senate Indian Affairs \n     Committee for their dedication to resolving the remaining \n     differences between us on language relating to trust \n     protections and enviroinmental issues.\n       Again, we are pleased to support Title III with these \n     changes to section 2604 and appreciate your steadfast support \n     of the right of Indian Tribes to gain a better measure of \n     control over the development of energy resources on their own \n     lands.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  A. David Lester,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council,\n\n                                        Ignacio, CO, May 27, 2003.\n     Re: Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination \n       Act of 2003; S. 14, Title III\n     Chairman Pete V. Domenici,\n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici: Approximately one month ago, the \n     Southern Ute Indian Tribe submitted a statement of \n     conceptual, but qualified, support for the Indian Tribal \n     Energy Development and Self-Determination Act of 2003. Our \n     Tribe's activities have shown that tribal energy development \n     can provide tremendous economic development opportunities for \n     tribes while simultaneously assisting the Nation in meeting \n     its energy demands. For tribes that have demonstrated the \n     capability to represent themselves effectively in energy \n     development activities, we have long-advocated legislation \n     that would provide the option of bypassing the stifling \n     effects of the Bureau of Indian Affairs approval requirements \n     applicable to tribal leases, business agreements and rights-\n     of-way. The referenced legislation addresses this very \n     matter; however, as Section 2604 of Title III emerged from \n     the Senate Committee of Indian Affairs and the Senate \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, it contained a \n     number of provisions that were objectionable to the Indian \n     community.\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\n       Over the last month, committee staff members and \n     representatives of tribes and Indian organizations have \n     engaged in an intense dialogue about the problems in the \n     draft legislation, and, as a result of their tireless \n     efforts, proposed amendments have been developed that would \n     eliminate the problems previously identified. A list of those \n     proposed amendments is attached for references purposes. \n     Among the different matters resolved to our satisfaction have \n     been the following: (i) confirmation that Section 2604 is a \n     voluntary program available to Tribes on an opt-in/opt-out \n     basis; (ii) inclusion of pre-approval public notice and \n     comment opportunities regarding the environmental impacts of \n     a proposed tribal mineral lease, business agreement or right-\n     of-way, but preservation of the confidentiality of the \n     business terms of such documents; (iii) acceptable balancing \n     of the limitations on and ongoing responsibility of the \n     Secretary to perform trust duties associated with a \n     participating tribe's activities undertaken pursuant to this \n     legislation; and (iv) confirmation of the appropriate scope \n     of NEPA review that would be associated with the Secretary's \n     decision to approve a Tribal Energy Resource Agreement \n     (``TERA''), which is the enabling document permitting a tribe \n     to proceed with independent development of mineral leases, \n     business agreements, or rights-of-way. Again, we helped \n     develop and wholly support these amendments.\n       During the course of debate on this legislation, some have \n     suggested that Section 2604 will eliminate effective \n     environmental protection on affected tribal lands. We want to \n     assure the members of the Senate that this is not the case. \n     Energy resource development by a tribe generally carries with \n     it a deep commitment to preserving one's backyard. Tribal \n     leaders are directly accountable to their members for \n     preserving environmental resources. In the Four Corners \n     Region, it is not unusual for private landowners or BLM \n     lessees to comment enviously on the environmental diligence \n     employed by our Tribe in the development of our energy \n     resources. We renew our invitation to members of the Senate \n     to visit our Reservation and see first-hand our energy \n     resource projects.\n       In conclusion, with the referenced amendments, we strongly \n     support S. 14, Title III. We urge other members of the Senate \n     to also support this legislation, and we commend those who \n     have worked toward its development and passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Howard D. Richards, Sr.,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Native American Energy Group, LLC,\n\n                                    Ft. Washakie, WY, May 7, 2003.\n     Senator Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: Native American Energy Group (NAEG) \n     is an Indian owned company working with tribes and allottees \n     throughout the country to determine how best to develop oil \n     and gas reserves and help provide for the energy security of \n     this country while also protecting the interests of mineral \n     owners. The recent Indian provisions of the Energy Bill are a \n     big step in the right direction to accomplish positive \n     results for the Indian people of this country.\n       One of the areas of contention is the environmental area \n     with many people stating that these provisions will gut the \n     NEPA process. While this is a legitimate concern, nowhere \n     have I read or heard that this is the intent of these \n     provisions. In fact recent language in the Bill clearly \n     denotes compliance with all applicable tribal and federal \n     environmental laws. Even without this new language though my \n     understanding was always that the intent was not to gut \n     environmental laws. Tribal governments with energy resources \n     are pro-development but by the same token they are also pro-\n     environment. This may seem a dichotomy of sorts but my read \n     on this bill is that the language will strengthen tribal \n     sovereignty, develop tribal capacities and make tribal and \n     allotted oil and gas operations more accountable with less \n     impacts. In addition, the federal trust oversight will not be \n     diminished which is always a concern of tribal governments.\n       NAEG appreciates the work and coordination that goes into \n     an effort of this magnitude and you and your staff are to be \n     commended for the recent provisions as presented in the bill. \n     The history and discussions surrounding this bill recognize \n     the importance of bringing tribes into the mainstream of the \n     energy picture of this country and providing the mechanisms \n     for the technical, administrative and legislative efforts to \n     occur.\n       The research your staff has undertaken in support of this \n     bill very well explains the amounts of energy resources \n     situated on tribal and allotted lands. This largely untapped \n     resource can be a boost for this country as we seek to \n     provide jobs and diversify our economy, while helping America \n     meet its energy needs. Please share with the rest of the \n     Senate Indian Committee our support for these endeavors and \n     if there is any information we can provide to assist you in \n     your work please do not hesitate to call me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Wes Martel,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Cherokee Nation,\n\n                                      Tahlequah, OK, June 2, 2003.\n     Hon.

Inouye,\n     Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman: It has come to my \n     attention that several changes have been made to Title III of \n     the Senate Energy bill. I understand that these changes will \n     reduce any risk to Tribes, and wish to offer the Cherokee \n     Nation's continued support of S. 14, the Energy Policy Act of \n     2003.\n       I thank the Committee for its hard work on this issue and \n     for incorporating tribal recommendations into the bill. Your \n     leadership is greatly appreciated.\n       Please feel free to contact my office if you have any \n     questions or comments. I may be reached at (918) 456-0671.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Chad Smith,\n     Principal Chief.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                         The Chickasaw Nation,\n\n                                            Ada, OK, June 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We support the inclusion of Title III, \n     as it is, in Senate Bill 14. Thoughtful development of our \n     tribal natural resources serves all Americans.\n       We are grateful for the opportunities and support Title III \n     provide to the Chickasaw Nation, and for all of Indian \n     Country, as we explore and develop our natural resources. The \n     language allows us to exercise our own progressive style in \n     development and regulation; yet, it provides for those tribes \n     which prefer the more traditional approach.\n       Having a voice in the U.S. Department of Energy will \n     highlight and expedite tribal energy issues. This is an \n     opportunity for every tribe to enter into the nation's \n     economic mainstream with the support of the federal \n     government.\n       Your help, and that of Senators Bingaman and Domenici, is \n     appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Bill Anoatubby,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            The Mohegan Tribe,\n\n                                     Uncasville, CT, June 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Mohegan Tribe supports the inclusion \n     of Title III in S. 14, the Energy Policy Act of 2003. \n     Offering flexibility and support in developing natural \n     resources throughout Indian Country, Title III creates \n     opportunities in which all Indian nations can benefit. We \n     also appreciate the hard work of Senators Domenici and \n     Bingaman in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mark F.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to take two literary allusions \nand put them together as the background for the points I wish to make. \nThe first one is a novel that has become a worldwide classic called \n``1984,'' written by George Orwell. You may recall that in this \nparticular novel, George Orwell describes a terrifying future. And the \nprincipal character in his novel, Winston Smith, works at the Ministry \nof Truth.\n  His job at the Ministry of Truth is to go back over old newspapers \nand clip out things that contradict the current party line and send \nthose down the memory hole; in other words, destroy them, so that if \nsomeone comes along and tries to determine whether there is any past \nsupport for the present position, the past has been scrubbed to the \npoint where everything there agrees with the present position. Anything \nthat was said previously that disagrees with the present position of \nBig Brother, the figure that controls the world in the novel, has been \nsent down the memory hole. It has been destroyed.\n  Keep that in mind as I take another literary allusion. This is an \nexact quote from Ben Bradlee, formerly editor of the Washington Post \nand one of\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\nthe great journalists of our time who said:\n\n       Journalism is the first rough draft of history.\n\n  I cite those two because I want to put them together in the debate \nthat has occurred on the floor and even more so that is going on out in \nthe world of the media--the debate about whether we had proper \njustification for going into Iraq. We are being told over and over \nagain that the world was lied to, the American people were lied to, the \nCongress was lied to because we were told that Saddam Hussein had \nweapons of mass destruction. And since we haven't found any, that means \nwe were deceived at the very beginning when the justification was given \nto us by the Bush administration to move ahead with respect to the \noperation in Iraq.\n  I submit to you, those who make that argument have tried to \nreconstruct their own memory holes. They have tried to take past \ninformation and scrub it from the record and pretend it was never \nthere. In other words, to go back to Ben Bradlee's comment that \n``journalism is the first rough draft of history,'' they are prepared, \neven this quickly after the journalists have reported what was said, to \ntry to change the first draft of history and create, virtually \novernight, a new history that never existed.\n  Well, my memory hole has not been used. I have not scrubbed from my \nmemory a series of statements and comments that have been made prior to \nIraq. And I intend to go through those comments here tonight to make it \nclear that those who claim that the President misled the Congress, the \npeople, and the rest of the world with respect to his reasons for going \ninto Iraq are, in fact, trying to rewrite history.\n  The record is very clear. It is very firm. And unless Winston Smith \nis suddenly somehow materialized to change history, the record stands \nin firm denunciation of those who are now attacking the President on \nthis issue.\n  Let's go back to the question of weapons of mass destruction. I \nremember going to S-407 in this building, the room on the fourth floor \nwhere we go to receive confidential, highly classified briefings from \nadministration officials. I remember sitting there and listening to \nMadeleine Albright, Secretary of State, outline for us in detail the \nreasons we had to attack Iraq. President Clinton, who appointed her \nSecretary of State, was even more pointed in his public statements of \nthe fact that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. In the \nPresident's phrase, ``Saddam Hussein will surely use them.'' We needed, \naccording to the President and the Secretary of State, to move ahead \nmilitarily in Iraq.\n  I remember walking out of that meeting in S-407 convinced that the \nbombs would start falling within days. As it turned out, the \nadministration changed its mind and moved away from that particular \ndecision. They backed off. But they never backed off their statement \nthat weapons of mass destruction were there, that weapons of mass \ndestruction would be used, and that Saddam Hussein could not be trusted \nlong term with weapons of mass destruction.\n  Vice President Gore--however much he has attacked this administration \nand its positions--has nonetheless stated on the record his firm belief \nthat there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. I think it is \nclear that if President Bush were involved in some kind of sleight of \nhand to pretend that weapons were there when they were not, and create \nsome sort of conspiracy among the members of his administration to \npeddle this false notion, former Vice President Gore would not be part \nof that conspiracy. As Vice President, he saw the intelligence \nbriefings. He was in a position to evaluate how accurate they were, and \nVice President Gore has said publicly on the record, speaking of Saddam \nHussein on September 23:\n\n       We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological \n     and chemical weapons throughout his country.\n\n  One of the men in Iraq who worked with Saddam Hussein in creating \nthose weapons had a piece in the Wall Street Journal where he made this \nstatement: ``Inspectors will never find them.'' Also, he pointed out \nthat the artillery shells that had been found by the inspectors that \nwere hollow were, in fact, a demonstration of the fact that there were \nweapons of mass destruction--that is, chemical and biological weapons--\nbecause when the inspectors said, oh, there is no problem here, the \nwarheads are hollow and there is nothing there, this man who worked in \nIraq to create these weapons said, of course, they are hollow; the \nweapons are not put into the artillery shells until just before they \nare to be used. The artillery shells are prepared for weapons of mass \ndestruction--for chemical or biological weapons--and then stored \nhollow.\n  So instead of saying that the discovery of these weapons proves they \ndon't have chemical or biological capability, in fact, the reverse is \nactually true. We do not have a storehouse in the American military of \nhollow artillery shells because we don't use chemical weapons. The \nIraqis have hollow shells because they expect to put chemical agents in \nthose shells. All of this is part of the record and was available prior \nto the current debate of those who just want to look back and find it.\n  Senator Bob Graham, who used to be chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee when all of this intelligence was being developed, and is \nstill the ranking member of that committee, had this to say when Colin \nPowell went before the United Nations and laid out the case:\n\n       I applaud Secretary Powell for finally making available to \n     the world the information on which this administration will \n     base its actions in Iraq. . . . In my judgment, the most \n     significant information was the confirmation of a linkage \n     between the shadowy networks of international terrorists and \n     Saddam Hussein, the true coalition of evil.\n\n  All of this information was available to all these individuals prior \nto the time we went into Iraq, and all of them were satisfied that it \nwas sound information. All of them were satisfied that it was real. And \nnow the press is pretending that nobody--nobody--believed there were \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq except the Bush administration, and \nthat everybody simply took the Bush administration at its word and now \nis being betrayed by the facts because we have not found enough of it \nto satisfy them; we have only found hollow artillery shells; we have \nonly found chemicals that could be used for pesticides.\n  I wonder if anyone has done an analysis of just how many pesticides \nIraqi agriculture requires. Looking at the stores of chemicals they \nhave found, chemicals that have dual use--yes, they could be pesticides \nor they could be a component part of a chemical weapon. Look at the \nquantities we have found and ask yourself: Do the Iraqis really need \nthis much for pesticides? Or do they have another purpose?\n  We have not yet found Saddam Hussein. As Kit Bond said today at \nlunch, if we don't ever find Saddam Hussein, is that proof of the fact \nthat he doesn't exist? If we don't find him, will that be evidence that \nthe Bush administration made him up? If we don't find him, is that \nproof that he never was in Iraq? That same kind of reasoning is being \napplied here. We have not found all of the weapons of mass destruction \nthat all of the critics would like to have as proof of their position, \nso our failure to have done that so far is, in their logic, proof that \nthese weapons never existed or proof that they were never in Iraq.\n  I think Senator Bond's question is a legitimate one. If we don't find \nSaddam Hussein, does that mean he never existed or he was never in \nIraq? Of course not. It means something happened. Either we killed him \nthe first night with that first strike and his remains have been \nremoved by the SSO--his central group of key supporters--so that his \nbody will never be found or he has left the country or he was killed \nsomewhere else. But we know he was there. Everybody knew he was there, \nand our failure to find him now does not mean he was not there when the \nattack began. Quite the contrary. Everybody is satisfied he was there.\n  The same thing applies to the weapons of mass destruction. As I have \ndemonstrated, starting with President Clinton, we have known they were \nthere, we have known they had them. If we cannot find them all, that \nmeans either they were destroyed by us or by the Iraqis or they have \nbeen moved somewhere. It doesn't mean they never existed. The evidence \nthat they existed cannot go down the memory hole just to make the \npresent arguments sound more convincing.\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\n  I read a commentator who quoted Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, in what \nthe commentator thought was a damning admission on this story, when he \nsaid:\n\n       Yes, we had other reasons for going into Iraq, but we \n     stressed weapons of mass destruction because that was the one \n     everybody was focused on.\n\n  According to the commentator, that is a damning admission on the part \nof the Secretary that we had other motives, and that is part of the \nattack that is being mounted on the floor, that the Bush administration \nwas duplicitous: They told us they were going after weapons of mass \ndestruction, but they had other motives. And here, Secretary Wolfowitz \nhas admitted it; a smoking gun.\n\n  Back to my memory. I remember very clearly that the Bush \nadministration openly and directly said they had other motives. Let me \ngo down them as I remember them.\n  Weapons of mass destruction--there are many countries that have \nweapons of mass destruction. If we were to go after the country in the \nworld, other than ourselves, that has the highest stock of weapons of \nmass destruction, we would go after Russia. Why don't we? Because \nweapons of mass destruction alone are by no means justification for \nattacking another nation. They must be tied to other motives. This is \nwhat I am sure Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was talking about.\n  Right now President Putin and President Bush have a good \nrelationship. Russia and the United States have a trusting \nrelationship. Why should we attack Russia just because it has weapons \nof mass destruction when that relationship exists?\n  Iraq was ruled by a tyrant, and not just your everyday tyrant but a \nbrutal, bloody tyrant who had demonstrated that he not only possessed \nweapons of mass destruction, he was willing to use weapons of mass \ndestruction and has done so--the only person in the world whose \ngovernment has employed weapons of mass destruction against anyone \nelse--in this case it was his own people--in the last half century. So, \nyes, there are other motives besides possessing weapons of mass \ndestruction. They are the man's personality and his history.\n  We are not just interested in nations that have WMD. We are \ninterested in brutal tyrants who will use weapons of mass destruction.\n  Next, Iraq was clearly a crossroads of terrorist activity. That is \nwhat Senator Graham referred to, not just al-Qaida. Iraq was one of the \nprincipal financial supporters of the terrorist suicide bombings in \nPalestine. They offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who would kill \nhimself as long as he took a few Jews with him. How many tyrants around \nthe world are willing to harbor terrorists and support terrorists? The \nlist gets a little smaller.\n  North Korea has weapons of mass destruction. North Korea is ruled by \na brutal tyrant. But North Korea has not invaded any of its neighbors \nfor half a century, and North Korea is not a haven for al-Qaida, Hamas, \nHezbollah, and the other terrorist organizations. We are closing down \nhere on the other motives.\n  Attacking your neighbors. Saddam Hussein has attacked his neighbors \ntwice in the last dozen years, set off two major wars, and is \nresponsible for killing more Muslims than any other person on the \nplanet.\n  The other motives that the Bush administration had in dealing with \nIraq were the totality of the situation. Yes, they wanted to deal with \nWMD. Yes, they wanted to deal with a tyrant who was brutalizing his own \npeople. Yes, they wanted to deal with terrorism. And, yes, they wanted \nto deal with somebody who was threatening his neighbors. If you take \nthat criteria and apply it to all the countries in the world, you come \nup with only one that qualifies on every count.\n  It was not the single issue that current commentators and candidates, \npundits and pollsters are talking about that prompted President Bush to \ngive the order to go ahead in Iraq. It is a distortion of history to \nhammer again and again on the fraud that says only weapons of mass \ndestruction drove us to go into Iraq, and it is our failure to find \nweapons of mass destruction in this time period in Iraq that \ndemonstrates we were wrong.\n\n  Nobody has gone to the last part of that sentence. Nobody has said \nyet that we were wrong to have taken out Saddam Hussein. They come \nclose to that in their attack on the President. They say he lied. They \nsay he manipulated. They say he distorted. But they cannot quite bring \nthemselves to say we were wrong to have done it, and no one will say \nthe world would have been a better place if we had not. Why? Because we \nhave discovered some other things we did not know.\n  If you are going to talk about intelligence failures, our \nintelligence community did not know until we got into Iraq about the \nmass graves. We did not know about the prisons holding children who \nwere put in there as young as 4 and 5 years of age and have been there \nfor 5 years or more.\n  We did not know the details of the brutality of this man. We did not \nknow that he treated his own population, those who were hostile to him \nor, indeed, simply suspect in his eyes, as brutally as Adolf Hitler \ntreated the Jews in World War II in Germany. We did not know that. We \nhave discovered that now. So no one will quite go to the point of \nsaying we made a mistake, that Bush did the wrong thing.\n  One commentator closed his attack on the Bush administration with \nthis interesting quibble, in my view. He said: It was the right war but \nit was fought for the wrong reason. I find it very difficult to \nreconcile those two. If it was the right war and has achieved the right \nresult, it was the right thing to have done, and it was the right thing \nto have done for all of the reasons that people who hate this \nadministration are now conveniently forgetting all of the historical \nbuildup to this that has gone down the memory hole that people are now \nconveniently saying never happened.\n  This is a historic Chamber, and it has seen all kinds of debates, \nhigh and low. It has seen all standards of rhetoric, good and bad, and, \nyes, if I may, true and false. There has been a call for the rafters \nhere to be ringing in a discussion of the Iraqi war and America's \nactivity. I wanted to answer that call and do what I can to see that \nthe rafters are ringing with the truth; that the rafters are ringing \nwith real history, not invented history; that the rafters are ringing \nwith a recognition that what the Bush administration has done in Iraq \nwas the right thing to have done; it was based on sound and careful \nanalysis that ran over two administrations; that was vetted thoroughly \nwith our allies abroad, bringing Great Britain, Australia, Poland, and \nothers, into the fight, and the result has demonstrated that the world \nis a safer place.\n  The Iraqi people live in a safer society, and the prospects for the \nfuture are better than would have been the case if we had gone to the \nbrink, as President Clinton did, and then changed our minds. President \nClinton thought the evidence was overwhelming but decided not to act. \nPresident Bush thought the evidence was overwhelming and did act, and \nthe rafters should ring with at least one speech that applauds that \ndecision and that level of leadership.\n  I say to my colleagues, I say to the country, I say to my \nconstituents, I believe the history is there that justifies the \ndecision, and I believe the evidence is there after the fact that more \nthan justifies the decision.\n  In this case, America and her President can stand proud before the \nworld as having done the right thing for the right reason.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Thursday marked an important--and\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\nextraordinary--milestone in the lives of two very special members of \nour Senate family.\n  On May 29, 1937--66 years and one week ago today--Robert Carlyle Byrd \nand Erma Ora James were married.\n  The Senate was not in session on their actual anniversary, so I come \nto the floor today--one week later--to congratulate Senator and Mrs. \nByrd on their remarkable achievement.\n  Robert and Erma Byrd both grew up in the hardscrabble coal country of \nWest Virginia. They were high school sweethearts.\n  Of all of Senator Byrd's tremendous achievements--and there are \nmany--I suspect the two that mean the most to him are convincing Erma \nJames to marry him in the first place--and staying married to her all \nthese years.\n  I have heard Senator Byrd say often that he could not do this job \nwere it not for his wife's love and support. In his words: ``She is not \nonly my wife, but also my best counselor. She has been a strong pillar \nof support in all my endeavors.''\n  The Byrds' marriage has brought them two wonderful daughters: Mona \nByrd Fatemi and Marjorie Byrd Moore.\n  They have also been blessed with six grandchildren and three great-\ngranddaughters.\n  After Mrs. Byrd and their family, the Senate and the Constitution, \none of the things that Senator Byrd loves best--as we all know--is \nhistory--especially ancient history. So I think he may appreciate this \nthought from Homer:\n\n       There is nothing more admirable than two people who see \n     eye-to-eye keeping house as man and wife, confounding their \n     enemies, and delighting their friends.\n\n  For 66 years, Robert and Erma Byrd have done for more than delight \ntheir friends.\n  Together, they have created a full and rich life. They have raised a \nfamily. And they have served the people of West Virginia, and America, \nwell. We wish them many more years of happiness together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7465-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on March 21, \n2003. In Burbank, IL, an explosion caused by a powerful fireworks-type \ndevice damaged the 1989 Ford Econoline van of a Palestinian Muslim \nfamily and shook doors and windows of neighboring homes. The blast \nshattered the vehicle's windows and blew open the vehicle's door. The \nman who committed the crime is being held on bond and is being charged \nwith arson, criminal property damage, and committing a hate crime.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7465-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL HUNGER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the only problem I have with National \nHunger Awareness Day is that it should be every day. Across the Nation, \n33 million of our fellow citizens are living in poverty and they \ndeserve our help.\n  In recent weeks, Congress has been focused on giving hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in new tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, yet \nwe leave the cupboard bare for millions of parents and low-income \nfamilies. This week, as we debate the energy bill, we are listening \ncarefully to the concerns of big corporations like Halliburton, Exxon, \nand Entergy, but not nearly carefully enough to the concerns of all \nthose who need our help the most.\n  It is a national scandal and disgrace that for so many millions of \nAmericans, hunger is an issue today and every day. Since the year 2000, \npoverty and unemployment have been on the rise, while wages and income \ncontinue to fall. Hardworking parents have been forced to make \nimpossible choices between feeding their children and paying the rent \nand medical expenses. These are choices no parent should have to make.\n  No child should go hungry. But every night, 13 million children go to \nsleep not knowing where or when they will get their next meal. As \nhunger and malnutrition continue, children are more likely to be absent \nfrom school to have behavioral problems, and to have trouble learning \nto read or do math. They are less likely to be friends with other \nchildren or learn from their surroundings, and more likely to miss \nschool because of illness.\n  Clearly, we have to move to end child hunger. This year, Congress \nwill reauthorize the Child Nutrition Act. The Act includes important \ninitiatives, such as school breakfasts and school lunches, and food \nprograms for summer school, after school, and childcare.\n  Studies demonstrate that at-risk, school-age children depend on \nschool-based breakfasts and lunches for more than half of their daily \nmeals. In the reauthorization, we must work to see that every child \neligible for subsidized programs actually receives these important \nmeals. Schools must be reimbursed for the actual costs of providing \nnutritionally balanced meals. We also need these programs to provide \nadditional resources, encourage nutrition education, and to pay school \nemployees a living wage.\n  We have a choice. Congress can continue to lavish more and more tax \nbreaks on the wealthiest individuals and companies in the Nation, or we \ncan invest in food for hungry children. The answer should be obvious to \nus all. We can and must ensure that no child is allowed to go hungry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7465-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7465-S7466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OKLAHOMA LOSS IN OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, over the past few months we've seen the \nfall of Saddam Hussein's brutal regime coupled with the dawning of a \nnew day for the Iraqi people.\n  With major military combat operations in Iraq over and the security \nof our homeland bolstered, America and her allies are turning our \nefforts toward helping the Iraqi people build a free society.\n  Like many Americans, I was thrilled and heartened by the dramatic \nimages of U.S. troops helping Iraqi citizens tear down statues and \npaintings of Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi people needed our help, our \ntanks, our troops, and our commitment to topple Saddam Hussein.\n  For the first time in their lives, many Iraqis are tasting freedom, \nand like people everywhere, they think it's wonderful. I'm proud of our \nmilitary and America's commitment to make the people of the Middle East \nmore free and secure.\n  Our military men and women surely face more difficult days in Iraq, \nand the Iraqi people will be tested by the responsibilities that come \nwith freedom. The thugs who propped up the previous regime and outside \nforces with goals of their own will seek to cause problems, stir up \ntrouble and initiate violence. Freedom is messy--nowhere more so than \nin a country that has just shaken off a brutal dictatorship.\n  But the journey towards a democratic Iraq has now been embarked upon. \nLike so many nations before it, Iraq now endures the growing pains \ncommon to a fledgling democracy. The uncertainty of today's Iraq, I am \nhopeful, will soon give way to the promise of a better future for the \nIraqi people. And as we move closer to this goal, we must remember \nthose who sacrificed for this noble cause.\n  Today, I rise to honor a man who made the ultimate sacrifice one can \nmake for his country and the cause of freedom.\n  Specialist Jose A. Perez III was killed last week when his convoy was \nambushed near Baghdad. Perez's convoy received fire from a rocket-\npropelled grenade while on a main supply route.\n  This San Diego, TX, native was stationed in Fort Sill. He came from a \nfamily with a proud military tradition who knows all to well the pain \nof losing a loved one. His uncle, Baldemar\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\n``Billy'' Benavides, Jr. died in the Persian Gulf in 1992.\n  My heart breaks for this family that has given so much to our great \nNation. Of his older brother, 9-year-old Joshua said, ``He was a very \ngood hero, and he died for our freedom. I will never forget him.''\n  A good hero indeed.\n  As we watch the dawn of a new day in Iraq, let us never forget that \nthe freedom we enjoy every day in America is bought at a price.\n  Specialist Perez did not die in vain. He died so that many others \ncould live in security and freedom. And for that sacrifice, we are \nforever indebted. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family \ntoday and with the troops who are putting their lives on the line in \nIraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7466-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FBI BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation released a report on the efficiency and effectiveness of \nthe National Instant Criminal Background Check System, also known as \nNICS. According to the report, the FBI has improved its ability to \nrespond quickly to gun dealer requests for criminal background checks, \nwith only nine percent of the transactions delayed. These improvements \nhave increased the immediate response rate from an average of 71 \npercent in early 2001 to 91 percent in 2002.\n  According to the report, in 2001 the NICS system processed 8.9 \nmillion background checks, with approximately 125,000 denials of \npermission to purchase a gun. While, in 2002, the system performed over \n8.4 million checks and denied approximately 121,000 of these purchases. \nI commend the FBI for its hard work and commitment to improving this \nimportant law enforcement tool.\n  Despite the success of the NICS System and the FBI's hard work, many \nguns are still being purchased without any background checks being \nperformed. Under current Federal law, criminal background checks on gun \npurchasers are only required for sales by licensed firearm dealers. \nConsequently, criminals, fugitives, and terrorists are able to purchase \nfirearms without any background check. They do this by purchasing guns \nat gun shows. I believe we should require a background check on every \ngun sale and close the loopholes in Federal law that criminals \nmanipulate to buy and sell guns.\n  During the last Congress, I cosponsored the Gun Show Background Check \nAct introduced by Senator Jack Reed. I believe this legislation would \nbe a vital tool in preventing guns from getting into the hands of \ncriminals and other ineligible buyers. This bill would simply apply \nexisting law governing background checks to individuals buying firearms \nat gun shows. This bill is commonsense gun safety legislation that is \nsupported by a number of major law enforcement organizations including \nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National \nTroopers Coalition, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, \nthe Police Executive Research Forum, the Major Cities Chiefs, the \nNational Association of School Resource Officers, the National Black \nPolice Association, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \nExecutives, and the Hispanic American Police Command Officers \nAssociation.\n  I believe closing the gun show loophole is an important tool in \nreducing gun violence and preventing guns from getting into the hands \nof criminals and foreign terrorists. Since its inception, the National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System has prevented over 563,000 \nineligible buyers from gaining access to guns, but many continue to \nslip through the gun show loophole. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important piece of gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7466-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FUNDING THE GLOBAL AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

The B-2 is a critical asset of our U.S. military and \nmust be supported in the future. The B-2 can carry up to 40,000 pounds \nof munitions and can strike up to 16 targets in a single pass. The \nfirst night of the bombing in Baghdad, 6 B-2s destroyed 92 targets on \nthe first night. B-2s flew nonstop, 36-hour missions from Whiteman AFB \nin Missouri to Iraq, unscathed. The B-2s targeted everything from \nairfields to surface-to-air missiles, sometimes changing targets while \nairborne enroute to Iraq. No other military has this capability with \nsuch accuracy and survivability. It is essential we fund the Global Air \nTraffic Management, GATM, system, the Secure Nuclear Communications and \nBroadband Connectivity capabililty, and the repair of the Aft Deck \nDurability issue for the B-2. We must ensure the B-2 is maintained and \nmodified to keep its lethal edge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7466-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7466-S7467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INDICTMENT OF CHARLES TAYLOR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday I wanted to give a statement on \nthe indictment of Charles Taylor by the Special Court in Sierra Leone, \nbut due to the rapidly changing events in West Africa and the lack of \nfloor time because of extensive debates on the Defense Authorization \nand Energy bills, I did not get an opportunity. What follows is the \nstatement that I sent to the State Department, Special Court, and \nUnited Nations officials, yesterday, expressing my views on this \nserious issue.\n\n       I rise today to voice my strong support for the decision of \n     the Special Court for Sierra Leone to indict Charles Taylor \n     for ``bearing the greatest responsibility for war crimes, \n     crimes against humanity, and serious violations of \n     international humanitarian law in Sierra Leone.'' I commend \n     the Court's prosecutor, David Crane, for taking this decisive \n     action.\n       Since its inception, the Special Court has moved swiftly to \n     indict key figures allegedly involved in some of the worst \n     atrocities that occurred during the brutal civil war in \n     Sierra Leone during the late 1990s. The Court has also made \n     it a priority to emphasize outreach programs to further the \n     reconciliation process and promote the rule of law throughout \n     the country.\n       Despite important progress, we all know that the Court's \n     work would be grossly deficient if those most responsible for \n     these crimes were not brought to justice because they were \n     too hard to catch, were high officials of a foreign \n     government, or no longer resided inside of Sierra Leone. It \n     would be like the United States deciding against pursuing the \n     perpetrator of an act of terrorism on American soil, that \n     killed or maimed thousands of individuals, because he left \n     the country or was a high-ranking official in a foreign \n     government. That would be unacceptable.\n       That is precisely why Congress expressed its clear intent \n     that the Special Court for Sierra Leone should pursue those \n     most responsible, irrespective of where they currently \n     reside.\n       In the report that accompanied the Senate version of the \n     Fiscal Year 2002 Foreign Operations bill, Report 107-58, \n     Congress stated in unambiguous terms: ``To build a lasting \n     peace, the Committee believes that it is imperative for the \n     international community to support a tribunal in order to \n     bring to justice those responsible for war crimes and other \n     atrocities in Sierra Leone, irrespective of where they \n     currently reside.''\n\n  This statement was later endorsed by the Conference Report to the \nFiscal Year 2002 Foreign Operations bill, Report 107-345, which put the \nHouse of Representatives on record on this issue as well.\n  Even before these reports were issued, Senators Feingold, Frist, \nMcConnell and I wrote a letter to Secretary Powell, dated June 20, \n2001, which stated: ``Because some of the individuals most responsible \nfor the atrocities in Sierra Leone are no longer in the country, we \nbelieve it is imperative that the tribunal has the authority to \nprosecute culpable individuals--including senior Liberian officials--\nregardless of where they reside. This will prevent such persons from \nescaping justice simply by leaving the country.''\n  I can safely say that we had one individual especially in mind when \nwe drafted that text: Charles Taylor. I was the principal author of the \nletter and two Congressional reports referenced above.\n  The involvement of Charles Taylor in the conflict in Sierra Leone is \nwell documented and I will not go into great detail here. I will simply \nsay that there is no doubt in my mind that he deserves to be brought to \njustice before the Special Court.\n  To its credit, the State Department took the advice of Congress. The \nState Department successfully negotiated an agreement that established \nthe Special Court for Sierra Leone and which did\n\n[[Page S7467]]\n\nnot contain geographic restrictions on the Prosecutor, allowing him to \ngo after Charles Taylor.\n  Perhaps the Prosecutor for the Court, David Crane, best described the \nSpecial Court's mandate: ``My office was given an international mandate \nby the United Nations and the Republic of Sierra Leone to follow the \nevidence impartially wherever it leads.''\n  Today, acting on information that Charles Taylor was traveling to \nGhana, the Special Court unsealed an indictment for Charles Taylor, \noriginally approved March 7, 2003, and served the outstanding warrant \nfor his arrest on Ghanaian authorities and transmitted the arrest \nwarrant to INTERPOL.\n  Again, I commend the prosecutor for taking this step. While I \nunderstand there are some, including in the Administration, who are \nconcerned about the impact that this may have on the peace process now \nunderway in West Africa, I agree with Mr. Crane's comments on this \nsensitive issue:\n\n       To ensure the legitimacy of these negotiations, it is \n     imperative that the attendees know they are dealing with an \n     indicted war criminal. These negotiations can still move \n     forward, but they must do so without the involvement of this \n     indictee. The evidence upon which this indictment was \n     approved raises serious questions about Taylor's suitability \n     to be a guarantor of any deal, let alone a peace agreement.\n\n  The Ghanaian Government needs to act immediately. It needs to uphold \nthe basic tenants of international law, apprehend Charles Taylor and \nhold him until arrangements can be made to transfer him to the Court. \nIn addition, the State Department needs to send an unequivocal message \nto Accra that action on this issue is urgently needed.\n  This may be the only chance that we get for years to bring Charles \nTaylor to justice. It is imperative that, in its most important moment \nthus far, the United States and Ghana do everything in their power to \napprehend Charles Taylor. If this does not occur, the world will have \nmissed a golden opportunity to bring to justice one of the world's most \nheinous war criminals and advance the cause of international justice.\n  In closing, I would like to read into the Record Mr. Crane's \nstatement issued today that describes the situation concerning Charles \nTaylor:\n\n       Today, on behalf of the people of Sierra Leone and the \n     international community, I announce the indictment of Charles \n     Ghankay Taylor, also known as Charles Ghankay Macarthur \n     Dapkpana Taylor.\n       The indictment accuses Taylor of ``bearing the greatest \n     responsibility'' for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and \n     serious violations of international humanitarian law within \n     the territory of Sierra Leone since 30 November 1996. The \n     indictment was judicially approved on March 7th and until \n     today, was sealed on my request to the Court.\n       My office was given an international mandate by the United \n     Nations and the Republic of Sierra Leone to follow the \n     evidence impartially wherever it leads. It has led us \n     unequivocally to Taylor.\n       Upon learning that Taylor was travelling to Ghana, the \n     Registrar of the Special Court served the outstanding warrant \n     for his arrest on Ghanaian authorities and transmitted the \n     arrest warrant to INTERPOL. This is the first time that his \n     presence outside of Liberia has been publicly confirmed. The \n     Registrar was doing his duty by carrying out the order of the \n     Court.\n       Furthermore, the timing of this announcement was carefully \n     considered in light of the important peace process begun this \n     week. To ensure the legitimacy of these negotiations, it is \n     imperative that the attendees know they are dealing with an \n     indicted war criminal. These negotiations can still move \n     forward, but they must do so without the involvement of this \n     indictee. The evidence upon which this indictment was \n     approved raises serious questions about Taylor's suitability \n     to be a guarantor of any deal, let alone a peace agreement.\n       I am aware that many members of the international community \n     have invested a great deal of energy in the current peace \n     talks. I want to make it clear that in reaching my decision \n     to make the indictment public. I have not consulted with any \n     state. I am acting as an independent prosecutor and this \n     decision was based solely on the law.\n       I also want to send a clear message to all factions \n     fighting in Liberia that they must respect international \n     humanitarian law. Commanders are under international legal \n     obligation to prevent their members from violating the laws \n     of war and committing crimes against humanity.\n       In accordance with Security Council resolutions 1315, 1470, \n     and 1478, now is the time for all nations to reinforce their \n     commitments to international peace and security. West Africa \n     will not know true peace until those behind the violence \n     answer for their actions. This office now calls upon the \n     international community to take decisive action to ensure \n     that Taylor is brought to justice.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, yesterday the Special Court for Sierra \nLeone unsealed an indictment of President Charles Taylor of Liberia. \nTaylor is accused of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and serious \nviolations of international humanitarian law. I commend the Court for \ntaking its mandate seriously and for following the evidence where it \nled--directly to a sitting head of state.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of accountability mechanisms in \nSierra Leone--both the Special Court and the Truth and Reconciliation \nthat will address the horrible crimes committed by the foot soldiers in \nthe field--soldiers who were, all too often, children. I have worked to \nensure that the United States provides appropriate financial support to \nthese mechanisms, and I have raised the importance of our political \nsupport at the highest levels. West Africa must break the cycle of \nviolence and impunity, and all of us in the international community \nhave a role to play in that effort.\n  The Special Court is charged with prosecuting those who bear the \ngreatest responsibility for serious violations of international \nhumanitarian law committed in Sierra Leone since November 1996. For \nover a decade, Sierra Leone was one of the most insecure places on \nEarth. Civilians not only suffered from deprivation and displacement, \nthey also had to contend with the forced recruitment of child soldiers, \nwidespread and brutal sexual violence, and horrifying murders and \nmutilations. Those responsible for these crimes abandoned all human \ndecency in their simple quest for power and wealth.\n  The indictment announced yesterday had been sealed for months, but \nfor years there has been no secret about one basic fact--Charles Taylor \nis a war criminal. I said so years ago, and it remains true today. He \nshould be brought before the Court and held accountable for his \nactions.\n  I also strongly support continued American efforts to isolate and \npressure the Taylor regime. But at the same time, the situation of the \nLiberian people cannot be overlooked. Pressuring and condemning Taylor \nis not a complete policy toward this troubled and volatile country. The \narmed rebel groups currently fighting for dominance in Liberia have \nproven all to willing to prey on Liberian civilians in their own lust \nfor power. We must ask ourselves, what will Liberia look like in 10 \nyears, and what will that mean for the Liberian people, for the West \nAfrican region, and for international criminal networks? What steps can \nbe taken today to influence that outcome? And then we must muster the \nwill and the means to act before the trend most recently exemplified by \ncrisis in Cote d'Ivoire dominates the region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7467-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7467-S7468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OKLAHOMA LOSS IN OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, over the past few months, we've seen the \nfall of Saddam Hussein's brutal regime coupled with the dawning of a \nnew day for the Iraqi people.\n  With major military combat operations in Iraq over and the security \nof our homeland bolstered, America and her allies are turning our \nefforts toward helping the Iraqi people build a free society.\n  Like many Americans, I was thrilled and heartened by the dramatic \nimages of U.S. troops helping Iraqi citizens tear down statues and \npaintings of Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi people needed our help, our \ntanks, our troops, and our commitment to topple Saddam Hussein.\n  For the first time in their lives, many Iraqis are tasting freedom, \nand like people everywhere, they think it's wonderful. I'm proud of our \nmilitary and America's commitment to make the people of the Middle East \nmore free and secure.\n  Our military men and women surely face more difficult days in Iraq, \nand the Iraqi people will be tested by the responsibilities that come \nwith freedom. The thugs who propped up the previous regime and outside \nforces with goals of their own will seek to cause problems, stir up \ntrouble and initiate violence. Freedom is messy--nowhere more so than \nin a country that has just shaken off a brutal dictatorship.\n\n[[Page S7468]]\n\n  But the journey towards a domestic Iraq has now been embarked upon. \nLike so many nations before it, Iraq now endures the growing pains \ncommon to a fledgling democracy. The uncertainty of today's Iraq, I am \nhopeful, will soon give way to the promise of a better future for the \nIraqi people. And as we move closer to this goal, we must remember \nthose who sacrificed for this noble cause.\n  Today, I rise to honor a man who made the ultimate sacrifice one can \nmake for his country and the cause of freedom.\n  Staff Sergeant Aaron Dean White, 27, died May 19 when the CH-46 \ntransport helicopter he was in crashed into a canal in central Iraq.\n  White was an Oklahoma native. He grew up in Seminole County where he \nattended school until his junior year in high school. He then graduated \nfrom Shawnee High School in 1994 and immediately began his military \ncareer.\n  If you ask his mother, she will tell you that he had a ``calling to \nserve people.'' That call to service was put to good use in our Armed \nForces.\n  White was trained in helicopter maintenance, but he could not get \nenough of flying. His pastor, Reverend Wesley Martin, explained his \npassion for flight: ``After he got his pilot's license, all he did was \nfly. He couldn't get enough of it. He loved to fly and he loved life.''\n  As a result, he volunteered for the gunner position on the helicopter \nthat crashed. ``What a flight that must have been,'' said Martin. ``No \nequipment necessary--as he flew immediately into the heavens.''\n  As we watch the dawn of a new day in Iraq, let us never forget that \nthe freedom we enjoy every day in America is bought at a price.\n  Staff Sergeant White did not die in vain. He died so that many others \ncould live in security and freedom. And for that sacrifice, we are \nforever indebted. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family \ntoday and with the troops who are putting their lives on the line in \nIraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7468-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7468-S7471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE NATIONAL SECURITY ASPECTS OF THE GLOBAL MIGRATION OF THE U.S. \n                         SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern \nabout the loss to the U.S. economy of most of our high-end \nsemiconductor chip manufacturing sector, the threat of the subsequent \nloss of the semiconductor research and design sectors, and the \nresulting serious national security implications.\n  The composition of the global semiconductor industry has changed \ndramatically in recent years. East Asian countries are leveraging these \nchanging market forces through their national trade and industrial \npolicies to drive a migration of semiconductor manufacturing to that \nregion, particularly China, through a large array of direct and \nindirect subsidies to their domestic semiconductor industry. If this \naccelerating shift in manufacturing overseas continues, the U.S. will \nlose the ability over time to reliably obtain high-end semiconductor \nintegrated circuits from trusted sources, at a time when these advanced \nprocessing components are becoming a crucial defense technology \nadvantage to the U.S. Experts in the military and intelligence sectors \nhave made clear that relying on semiconductor integrated circuits \nfabricated outside the U.S., e.g. in China, Taiwan and Singapore, is \nnot an acceptable national security option. The economic impact in the \nU.S. of the loss of manufacturing, research and design has equally \nserious implications.\n  I would like to direct my colleagues' attention to a White Paper, \nthat I am asking to be included in the Congressional Record, which \noutlines the fact that this off-shore migration of high-end \nsemiconductor chip manufacturing is a result of concerted foreign \ngovernment action, through an effective combination of government trade \nand industrial policies which have taken advantage of opportunities \nresulting from market forces and changes in the semiconductor industry. \nThis White Paper lists a number of possible actions the defense and \nintelligence communities should consider to prevent this serious loss \nof U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and design capability. I have also \nrequested that the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency, \nand the National Reconnaissance Office submit reports and plans of \naction to respond to this impending national security threat. I have \nasked that these reports provide an analysis of the semiconductor \nmanufacturing issues that relate to defense and national security, as \nwell as an analysis of the potential solutions that are discussed in \nthe White Paper. I hope these reports will detail the steps that will \nbe taken to counteract this loss of critical components for U.S. \ndefense needs, as well as a timetable for the implementation of such \nsteps. I note that the Armed Services Committee report on the bill we \npassed yesterday requests similar information.\n  I hope we can act promptly to avoid a potential national security \ncrisis in terms of reliable access to cutting-edge technology necessary \nto the critical defense needs of our country. The loss goes beyond \neconomics and security. What is at stake here is our ability to be \npreeminent in the world of ideas on which the semiconductor industry is \nbased. A prompt, concerted effort by the defense and intelligence \ncommunity in cooperation with industry can reverse this trend of off-\nshore migration of manufacturing, research and design that is now under \nway and that will become essentially irreversible if no action is taken \nin the next few months.\n  I ask consent that my ``White Paper on National Security Aspects of \nthe Global Migration of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n White Paper: National Security Aspects of the Global Migration of the \n                      U.S. Semiconductor Industry\n\n       The U.S. is facing an imminent threat to national security \n     as a result of foreign government actions that have \n     capitalized on the changing composition of the semiconductor \n     industry. Our concern is the loss to the U.S. economy of the \n     high-end semiconductor manufacturing sector, the potential \n     subsequent loss of the semiconductor research and design \n     sectors, and the grave national security implications that \n     this would entail. East Asian countries are leveraging market \n     forces through their national trade and industrial policies \n     to drive a migration of semiconductor manufacturing to that \n     region, particularly China. If this accelerating shift in \n     manufacturing overseas continues, the U.S. will lose the \n     ability to reliably obtain high-end semiconductor integrated \n     circuits from trusted sources. This will pose serious \n     national security concerns to our defense and intelligence \n     communities. Historically, shifts in manufacturing result \n     over time in the migration of research and design \n     capabilities. This is especially true of leading-edge \n     industries such as advanced semiconductor manufacturing, \n     which requires a tight linkage and geographic proximity for \n     research, development, engineering and manufacturing \n     activities. The economic impact in the U.S. of the loss of \n     manufacturing, research and design has equally serious \n     implications.\n       The Pentagon's Advisory Group on Electron Devices (AGED) \n     has warned that the Department of Defense (DoD) faces \n     shrinking advantages across all technology areas due to the \n     rapid decline of the U.S. semiconductor industry, and that \n     the off-shore movement of intellectual capital and industrial \n     capability, particularly in microelectronics, has impacted \n     the ability of the U.S. to research and produce the best \n     technologies and products for the nation and the war-fighter. \n     This global migration has also been discussed in a recently \n     released National Research Council/National Academy of \n     Sciences report on the U.S. semiconductor industry, which \n     details the significant growth in foreign programs that \n     support national and regional semiconductor industries. This \n     support is fueling the structural changes in the global \n     industry, and encouraging a shift of U.S. industry abroad.\n\n\n                critical national security applications\n\n       Studies have shown that numerous advanced defense \n     applications now under consideration will require high-end \n     components with performance levels beyond that which is \n     currently available. These cutting-edge devices will be \n     required for critical defense capabilities in areas such as \n     synthetic aperture radar, electronic warfare, and image \n     compression and processing. Defense needs in the near future \n     will also be focused on very high performance for missile \n     guidance (``fire and forget''), signal processing, and \n     radiation-hardened chips to withstand the extreme \n     environments of space-based communications and tactical \n     environments. There are profound needs for much more advanced \n     onboard processing capabilities for unmanned aerial vehicles \n     undertaking both reconnaissance and attack missions, for \n     cruise missiles and ballistic missile defense, and for\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\n     the infrastructure that connects these systems. As the \n     military transforms to a ``network-centric'' force in the \n     future, the DoD's Global Information Grid will demand \n     extremely high-performance computation to overcome the \n     technical barriers to a seamless communication network \n     between terrestrial 24 and 48 color optical fiber and \n     satellite platforms transmitting in 100+Mbps wireless. Such \n     performance will also be necessary for ``last-mile'' \n     extremely high-speed connectivity to platforms and to the \n     soldier in the field, as well as for the high-speed \n     encryption requirements for a secure communication system. \n     Intelligence agencies will increasingly need the most \n     advanced chips for very high-speed signal processing and data \n     analysis, for real-time data evaluation, for sensor input and \n     analysis, and for encryption and decryption.\n       As studies for DARPA have indicated, the next several \n     generations of integrated circuits, which emerge at roughly \n     eighteen-month intervals as predicted by Moore's Law, offer \n     the potential for exponential gains in defense war-fighting \n     capability. It is erroneous to believe that future U.S. war-\n     fighting capability will be derived from chips one or two \n     generations behind current state-of-the-art technology. Many \n     of the integrated circuits and processing platforms that are \n     coming in to use, and which are at the heart of DoD defense \n     strategies, are clearly at the cutting edge in their \n     capabilities.\n       With the dramatic new capabilities enabled by rapidly \n     evolving chip technologies, DoD and the intelligence agencies \n     will need to be first adopters of the most advanced \n     integrated circuits, and will be increasingly dependent on \n     such chips for a defense and intelligence edge. If the \n     ongoing migration of the chip manufacturing sector continues \n     to East Asia, DoD and our intelligence services will lose \n     both first access and assured access to secure advanced chip-\n     making capability, at the same time that these components are \n     becoming a crucial defense technology advantage. Informed \n     elements of the intelligence community therefore have made \n     clear that relying on integrated circuits fabricated outside \n     the U.S. (e.g. in China, Taiwan and Singapore) is not an \n     acceptable national security option.\n\n\n     economic importance and changes in the semiconductor industry\n\n       The influence of the semiconductor industry to the U.S. \n     economy in the last decade is difficult to overstate. The \n     U.S. semiconductor sector currently employs 240,000 people in \n     high-wage manufacturing jobs, and had sales totaling $102 \n     billion in the global market in 2000 (50 percent of total \n     worldwide sales). In 1999, this sector was the largest value-\n     added industry in manufacturing in the U.S.--larger than the \n     iron, steel and motor vehicle industries combined. The \n     productivity growth in the U.S. in the 1990s was due in \n     significant part to the computer production and advances in \n     information technology that depended on the semiconductor \n     industry. The economic implications of the potential \n     migration of high-end semiconductor chip research, design and \n     manufacturing to off-shore facilities has the potential to \n     cause (and, it could be argued, is already causing) long-term \n     damage to the economic growth of this country, with \n     corresponding national security ramifications.\n       A fundamental change in the semiconductor industry has \n     been, in very simplified form, that the price to performance \n     curve has reduced revenue in the industry dramatically over \n     the last decade. During the early 1960's, and continuing \n     until about 1994, the compound annual growth rate in revenue \n     of the industry was 16 percent. From 1994 to the present, the \n     growth rate has been approximately 8 percent. This situation \n     is combined with the very large costs associated with the \n     development of new 300 mm fabrication facilities (``fabs''), \n     as well as the increasing complexity and cost of research and \n     design as the industry must develop methods other than the \n     traditional scaling methods (making all aspects of the chips \n     smaller and smaller) in order to increase performance. These \n     factors, and the current recession, are driving the industry \n     to consolidations. As those consolidations take place, new \n     business models, such as fabless companies and consortia, \n     come into play.\n\n\n   a process driven by government policy in reaction to market forces\n\n       The principal reason that China is becoming a center of \n     semiconductor manufacturing is the effective combination of \n     government trade and industrial policies which have taken \n     advantage of opportunities resulting from market forces and \n     changes in the semiconductor industry. In a sector \n     characterized by rapidly increasing capital costs and the \n     need to have access to large, rapidly growing markets, such \n     as China's, Chinese government policies and subsidies can \n     decisively change the terms of international competition. The \n     impact of these incentives is accentuated as a result of the \n     multi-year recession, which has sharply reduced revenue and \n     increased the competition for markets to absorb the \n     industry's characteristic high fixed costs. Government \n     policies in Taiwan were already drawing new manufacturing \n     capability, as well as tool and equipment makers, to its \n     science and technology park complex. However, in the last two \n     years, Chinese policy has resulted in a sharp upsurge in \n     construction of fabrication facilities in that country, with \n     plans for a great many more.\n       The U.S. high-tech industry has been in a recession the \n     last two years, with sharply reduced sales and severe losses. \n     The number of state-of-the-art U.S. chip manufacturing \n     facilities is expected to sharply decrease in the next 3-5 \n     years to as few as 1-2 firms that now have the revenue base \n     to own a 300 mm wafer production fab, and likely less than a \n     handful of firms. Although the U.S. currently leads the world \n     semiconductor industry with a 50 percent world market share, \n     the Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that the \n     U.S. share of 300 mm wafer production capacity will be only \n     approximately 20 percent in 2005, while Asian share will \n     reach 65 percent (only 10 percent of this from Japan). The \n     remaining state-of-the-art U.S. chip-making firms face great \n     difficulty in attaining the huge amounts of capital required \n     to construct next-generation fabs. This situation stands in \n     contrast to that in China. To ensure that they develop the \n     ability to build the next-generation fabrication facilities, \n     the Chinese central government, in cooperation with regional \n     and local authorities, has undertaken a large array of direct \n     and indirect subsidies to support their domestic \n     semiconductor industry. They have also developed a number of \n     partnerships with U.S. and European companies that are cost-\n     advantageous to the companies in the short-term. The Chinese \n     government is successfully using tax subsidies (see below) to \n     attract foreign capital from semiconductor firms seeking \n     access to what is expected to be one of the world's largest \n     markets. This strategy, which is similar to that employed by \n     the European Union in early 1990s, is a means of inducing \n     substantial inflows of direct investment by private firms. \n     Indeed, much of the funding is Taiwanese, driven by the tax \n     incentives and their need for market access, especially for \n     commodity products such as DRAMs. The strategy does not \n     rely on cheaper labor, as that is a small element in \n     semiconductor production.\n       The Chinese are, however, able to increasingly draw on \n     substantially larger pools of technically trained labor as \n     compared to the U.S., from the large cohorts of domestic \n     engineering graduates. Importantly, the output of Chinese \n     universities is supplemented by large numbers of engineers \n     trained at U.S. universities and mid-career professionals who \n     are offered substantial incentives to return to work in \n     China. These incentives for scientists and engineers, which \n     include substantial tax benefits, world-class living \n     facilities, extensive stock options taxed at par value, and \n     other amenities, are proving effective in attracting \n     expatriate labor. They also represent an important new \n     dimension in an accelerating global competition for highly \n     skilled IT labor.\n       The immediate and most powerful incentives for a highly \n     leveraged industry are the direct and indirect subsidies, \n     including infrastructure needed for state-of-the-art fabs, \n     offered by the government. For example, the Chinese central \n     government has undertaken indirect subsidies in the form of a \n     substantial rebate on the value-added tax (VAT) charged on \n     Chinese-made chips. While many believe this is an illegal \n     subsidy under GATT trade rules, the impact of the subsidy on \n     the growth of the industry may well be irreversible before--\n     and if--any trade action is taken. There are a variety of \n     other documented measures adopted by the Chinese government. \n     The development of special government funded industrial \n     parks, the low costs of building construction in China as \n     compared to the U.S., and their apparent disinterest in the \n     expensive pollution controls required of fabrication \n     facilities in the U.S. all represent further hidden \n     subsidies. The aggregate effect of these individual \n     ``subsidies'' may be only a few tens of percentage points of \n     decrease (literally, only 20-30 percent in the manufacturing \n     costs of the chips, but in such a cost-driven industry, this \n     difference appears to play an important role in driving the \n     entire offshore migration process for these critical \n     components. Essentially, these actions reflect a strategic \n     decision and represent a concerted effort by the Chinese \n     government to capture the benefits of this enabling, high-\n     tech industry, and thereby threatening to be a monopoly \n     supplier and thus in control of pricing and supply.\n       It is therefore important to understand that the current \n     shift in manufacturing capacity to China is not entirely the \n     result of market forces. It is equally important to recognize \n     that even if some residual U.S. manufacturing capacity \n     remains after this large-scale migration takes place, the \n     shift of the bulk of semiconductor manufacturing will \n     severely constrain the ability of the U.S. to maintain high-\n     end research and development capabilities. Such directed \n     government support has proven itself to be a severe threat to \n     U.S. industry. For a variety of reasons, the U.S. government \n     has never been able to provide such coordinated support. The \n     results of this deficit have been devastating. The idea that \n     national governments cannot contribute to the health and \n     direction of such a ``consumer based'' industry is unfounded, \n     particularly given the national security implications.\n\n\n                            A Plan of Action\n\n       The stakes are real. The time for the country to react \n     effectively is limited. There are things that can be done. If \n     these steps are taken in a timely fashion, the collective \n     impact of the measures will be more powerful in maintaining \n     reliable first access to high-end semiconductor chip design \n     and manufacturing in the U.S. These could include:\n       Active Enforcement of GATT trade rules. Currently the \n     Chinese government is providing a 14 percent rebate on VAT to \n     customers who buy Chinese-made semiconductor chips, \n     essentially providing a large\n\n[[Page S7470]]\n\n     subsidy of their domestic industry in clear violation of GATT \n     rules. Thus, U.S.-made chips would pay a 17 percent VAT, and \n     Chinese-made chips would pay a 3 percent VAT. Given the tight \n     price competition of chips and the growing importance of the \n     Chinese chip market, this is a very significant step towards \n     ending U.S. production. It is important to ensure that GATT \n     rules are properly enforced in this instance, and not allow \n     government imposed advantages for foreign competitors to \n     damage U.S. manufacturers. DoD should insist that the U.S. \n     Trade Representative undertake prompt bilateral negotiations \n     to remove these measures.\n       Joint production agreements. With the current downturn in \n     the high-tech sector, it is probable that many chip \n     manufacturing companies will be unable to acquire the \n     necessary capital to invest in the $3+ billion required for \n     new 12-inch water advanced chip fabrication facilities, which \n     are radically increasing in cost. Title 15 of the U.S. code \n     (sections 4301 through 4305) gives private technology \n     companies facing global competition the ability to enter into \n     joint production ventures with a waiver of certain anti-trust \n     laws. Under this provision, a group of companies could \n     consolidate assets into a small number of chip fabrication \n     plants, which could be jointly run by a cooperative of two to \n     five companies. This cooperative investment in a fab could \n     sharply reduce the risk and cost to each participating firm, \n     and their agreements to purchase chips from the new fab could \n     be the basis to obtain financing. The Department could \n     encourage this kind of venture and offer contracting \n     opportunities to meet DoD's own chip-making needs, thus being \n     an additional guarantor of demand.\n       Business models. A variety of creative business models \n     exist which can help the Department and intelligence agencies \n     obtain improved access to advanced manufacturing lines. The \n     Department and intelligence agencies can enter into \n     agreements with a number of U.S.-based chip manufacturers \n     within the context of one of these models to the mutual \n     benefit of all parties. DoD should contract with selected \n     U.S. fabs for long-term access, using any one or more types \n     of contractual vehicles (such as ``take or pay''). DoD should \n     also direct its aerospace end-users to employ the services of \n     these domestic fabs. While DoD, NSA and NRO are only a very \n     small piece of the semiconductor market, they can still use \n     their residual contracting power to encourage retention of \n     U.S. advanced chip manufacturing in a coordinated way. DoD \n     and the intelligence agencies must pursue this avenue of \n     creative government-industry cooperation, and must do so \n     soon, as time is not on the side of the U.S. industrial base \n     or the U.S. Government. It is important to note, however, \n     that even a much stronger and better coordinated effort in \n     this area alone will not resolve DoD's problems because over \n     time without a strong domestic commercial semiconductor \n     industrial base it will become very difficult for DoD to \n     retain access to state of the art chips. DoD requires an \n     industry with technology leadership, not just its own \n     short term supply fix.\n       Encourage tax incentives for U.S. investment. As the next \n     generation of chip fabrication facilities can cost at least \n     $3 billion per plant, the manufacturing sector will require \n     assistance in acquiring the investment capital necessary to \n     develop the manufacturing capabilities for cutting edge \n     semiconductor chips. DoD and the intelligence agencies should \n     work with industry and propose targeted tax incentives, \n     possibly in coordination with state and local government \n     financing, to assist in meeting these investment costs. As \n     noted above, these efforts cannot be delayed into the out-\n     years, as time is of the essence.\n       Increase Science and Engineering Graduates. The \n     unprecedented technical challenges faced by the industry will \n     require technically trained talent to provide solutions to \n     these problems. In order to effectively compete against the \n     concerted effort by the Chinese to capture the semiconductor \n     industry, it will be necessary to counter the growing \n     disparity of trained talent in both physical sciences and \n     engineering between East Asia and the U.S. Incentives need to \n     be created for increasing university student training in \n     these fields, in particular, of students who are U.S. \n     citizens. The training over the past two decades of East \n     Asian students in American universities, who increasingly \n     return to their country of origin, is a partial cause of the \n     present situation. Additionally, efforts need to be \n     undertaken to encourage their retention in the U.S. Overall, \n     DoD should focus on programs that increase the number of \n     science and engineering graduates at the B.S. and M.S. level \n     needed to provide the technical capabilities for the \n     semiconductor industry.\n       Increases in Federal Funds for Research and Development \n     (R). Levels of federal funding in the U.S. for research on \n     microelectronics have been steadily decreasing, while at the \n     same time, competitors in Asia and Europe have dramatically \n     expanded public support for semiconductor R This decline \n     in U.S. research support is of particular concern because the \n     industry is increasingly addressing extremely complex \n     technical challenges for which no solution is readily \n     apparent. The following points highlight this need for \n     restoration of funding and describe possible steps that could \n     be taken:\n       a. DARPA's annual funding of microelectronics research and \n     development--the principle channel of direct federal \n     financial support in this area--has declined since 1999, and \n     is projected to decline further. DoD should consider \n     restoring this funding.\n       b. SEMATECH, the private industry partnership with \n     government which was created to help revive the weakened U.S. \n     industry in 1987 through collaborative research and pooled \n     manufacturing knowledge, was provided with government funds \n     of $100 million per year, fully matched by industry funds. \n     Since 1996, SEMATECH has no longer received any government \n     fundings. Originally an entirely U.S. endeavor, SEMATECH has \n     now had to become ``international'' to remain in operation, \n     thereby destroying its original U.S.-centric focus. DoD \n     should consider alternative mechanisms for cooperative R \n     efforts with industry in critical research areas.\n       c. In the current harsh financial climate of the U.S. high-\n     tech industry, the private sector will not be able to \n     continue an adequate investment in research and development--\n     there have in fact been widespread anecdotal report of major \n     decreases in R efforts in the U.S. commercial electronics \n     industry. The need is developing for processors based on the \n     next generation of silicon chip technology (referred to as \n     the ``90 nanometer'' generation), and the U.S. could find \n     itself without a domestic manufacturing base, as the research \n     for that technology generation should be under way now. The \n     area of non-silicon semiconductors, which offer a level of \n     speed performance exceeding that of silicon components, is \n     clearly under-funded. For example, research is needed on \n     nano-electronics, such as alternatives to silicon CMOS \n     through nanotubes and nanowires. This technology will be \n     important for next-generation military communications and \n     radar systems (operating in consort with advanced silicon \n     processor chips). Here too, the DoD must find ways to assist \n     the U.S. non-silicon semiconductor manufacturing based by \n     further encouraging R appropriate to DoD requirements.\n       d. I urge the Department and intelligence agencies to \n     support increased government funding for R of advanced chip \n     technologies and also to support the development of new DoD-\n     specfic chip designs within the aerospace industry, which, \n     like the fabs, are losing their capabilities as the chip \n     designs themselves are increasingly conducted overseas. DoD's \n     decades-long role in the support of such research has \n     diminished in recent years. Rejuvenation of this long-\n     standing DoD role in advanced R would help to assure that \n     U.S. industry, to the extent that it can be retained, will \n     lead the future shifts to the most advanced chip technology \n     which DoD will need.\n       Cooperative Research Programs. Programs such as the Focus \n     Research Center Program (FRCP) under the Microelectronics \n     Advanced Research Corporation (MARCO) seek to overcome the \n     growing challenges companies face in advancing \n     microelectronics technologies through government-industry \n     partnerships that focus on cutting-edge research deemed \n     critical to the continued growth of the industry. The \n     government's share of funding (25 percent) of this \n     cooperative program has been supported through the \n     Government-Industry Co-sponsoring of University Research \n     (GICUR) program within the Office of Secretary of Defense. \n     The funding targets for this program as outlined in the \n     original ramp-up plan have not been met. In fact, this \n     program has been zeroed out of the administration's FY 2004 \n     budget. DoD should ensure that funding levels for this vital \n     area of government-industry collaborative research be \n     properly supported, and that when U.S. universities are the \n     recipients of such funding, the training of U.S. citizens (in \n     contrast to foreign students) is strongly emphasized.\n       Survey of Trade Practices. DoD should survey all possible \n     technologies that the Chinese government may be targeting for \n     subsidies that would assist in the transfer of U.S. chip-\n     making and related fields to China, and then develop a list \n     of those subsidies that are in violation of GATT trade rules \n     and seek USTR action For those that are not in violation but \n     nonetheless create a competitive ``edge'' for China, the \n     Department and the intelligence agencies will need to develop \n     counter strategies. The focus should aid to strengthen the \n     entire electronics and IT ``food chain''--from semiconductor \n     manufacturing equipment to semiconductors to computers and \n     systems. This will require broad interagency coordination and \n     cooperation. It would probably be necessary to form such a \n     ``tiger team'' immediately, and to provide that team with the \n     authority and resources to act to stem the deterioration of \n     our defense-critical on-shore infrastructure.\n       The Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Industry. Over \n     the last decade a fair fraction of U.S. semiconductor tooling \n     and equipments capability has migrated off shore. This has \n     been particularly true of the ``high technology'' end of the \n     business--advanced lithography. The migration has had a \n     significant impact on our ability to guide and direct \n     development in the chip economy as a whole. For example, when \n     ASML (a Dutch firm) tool over SVG-L (our last cutting edge \n     lithography stepper supplier) the personnel base at the \n     former SVG-L site, in part because of the recession, was \n     reduced, and some advanced product development shifted to \n     Europe. Along with the sale of SVG-L, Tinsley, an SVG-L \n     subsidiary, which is the world's premier supplier of aspheric \n     optical components widely used in defense surveillance \n     systems, was also conveyed to ASML. Lithography patent \n     battles that could affect sales and services to U.S. chip\n\n[[Page S7471]]\n\n     makers using equipment from either of these companies are \n     continuing. As another example, it is generally accepted \n     throughout the industry that the photomask is a key gating \n     element in semiconductor development today, and that mask \n     development is one of the largest challenges currently facing \n     the industry. The cost of photomask infrastructure \n     development is currently outstripping available R resources \n     by a factor of 4 to 5. A recent SEMATECH study indicated the \n     shortfall at approximately $750 million. Outside the U.S., \n     this shortfall is being met with Government sponsored \n     development activities in hopes of taking over the market. A \n     small number of U.S. merchant mask companies are currently \n     spearheading an effort to establish a pre-competitive R \n     activity focused on U.S. mask infrastructure development. The \n     need, supported by SEMATECH, includes advanced tool \n     evaluation and development, along with materials, metrology, \n     and standards activities to improve future photomask \n     manufacturing capability. The goal is to accelerate leading \n     edge photomask infrastructure capability on-shore by building \n     on prior and current mask industry investments. DoD should \n     give full consideration to supporting this effort for a U.S. \n     mask consortium. Overall, the ``tiger team'' should survey \n     and make recommendations on what can be done to stimulate and \n     grow what is left of the on-shore semiconductor equipment \n     industry, including masks and lithography.\n\n\n                   necessity of comprehensive action\n\n       If DoD and the intelligence agencies lose commercial \n     advanced chip production capability, off of which they have \n     sharply leveraged over the past two decades to greatly reduce \n     their costs and to improve war-fighting capability, the \n     ability to benefit from such cost-saving relationships will \n     be permanently lost. DoD can attempt to achieve temporary \n     solutions, such as building its own next generation \n     government-owned chip fabrication facility, but this is \n     likely to be both expensive and ineffective. If the best \n     research and design capability shifts to China along with \n     manufacturing, this approach will not work past the next \n     generation or two of semiconductor chip production. In \n     addition, such temporary solutions are not only unworkable \n     over time if the U.S. wishes to retain the best capability \n     that is required for defense and intelligence needs, but will \n     be far more expensive than the solutions proposed above. This \n     is because the opportunity to leverage off the commercial \n     sector (an approach which the DoD and intelligence community \n     rely upon at present) for new advances and cost savings will \n     be lost. The U.S. policy goal should not be to seek to \n     prevent China from obtaining significant chip-making \n     capability in the very near future. That will happen. The \n     issue is whether the U.S. can improve its competitive \n     position and remove unfair distortions in order to retain \n     significant on-shore manufacturing capacity.\n\n\n                     conclusions and further action\n\n       A prompt, concerted effort by the defense and intelligence \n     community can reverse this trend of off-shore migration of \n     manufacturing, research and design that is now underway and \n     that will become essentially irreversible if no action is \n     taken in the next few months. I am requesting a report and \n     plan of action from DoD and the intelligence community, based \n     on the steps enumerated above, on how they will act to \n     prevent the national security damage that the loss of the \n     U.S. semiconductor industry will entail.\n       The loss goes beyond economics and security. What is at \n     stake here is our ability to be preeminent in the world of \n     ideas on which the semiconductor industry is based. Much of \n     applied physical science--optics, materials, science, \n     computer science, to name a few--will be practiced at foreign \n     centers of excellence. This stunning loss of intellectual \n     capability will impede our efforts in all areas of our \n     society.\n       I hope that by bringing attention to this matter, we can \n     avoid a potential national security crisis in terms of \n     reliable access to cutting edge technology necessary to the \n     critical defense needs of our country. We are being \n     confronted by one of the greatest transfers of critical \n     defense technologies ever organized by another government and \n     the time for action is overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7471-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AUNG SAN SUU KYI: RELEASE HER UNHARMED\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Burma's brutal and illegitimate military \ngovernment committed yet another vicious atrocity last week when Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and many members of her democracy movement were suddenly \nassaulted by a paramilitary group. Some of her supporters were killed \nand many others were wounded. She herself was taken into so-called \n``protective custody'' by the regime but little more is known of her \nwhereabouts, her health, or the safety of the 20 or so people arrested \nwith her.\n  The violent repression of these democracy activists is another sad \nand infuriating example of the continuing efforts by the Burmese \ngovernment to block any genuine political reform in the country.\n  Only a year ago Suu Kyi was released from one of her numerous \noccasions of house arrest in Burma, this one lasting 19 months. Her \nrelease last spring came with the promise to release political \nprisoners and begin a new discussion with her party. That party, the \nNational League of Democracy, legitimately won power in a 1990 \nelection, but was denied the opportunity to take office in the \ngovernment crackdown that followed.\n  This cruel attack is another example of a corrupt government that \ncontinues to commit flagrant human rights violations against its \ncitizens, uses rape as a weapon of intimidation and torture against \nwomen, and forcibly enslaves child soldiers to fight their own people.\n  This new atrocity has outraged the world, and many governments have \ndenounced it. Stronger action by the international community is long \noverdue, and we must act as well. Under S. 1182, the Burmese Freedom \nand Democracy Act, we call on the Burmese government to release Suu Kyi \nand her supporters immediately and with no additional harm. Our \nlegislation will impose a total ban on import from Burma. It will \nfreeze the Burmese government's assets in the United States. It will \ntighten the visa ban on their government officials. It will oppose any \nnew international loans to its government.\n  I am very encouraged by the swift decision of President Bush and \nSecretary Powell to express their outrage and concern. Congress must do \nall it can to support the courageous struggle for democracy led by the \nheroic Aung San Suu Kyi. We pray that she will be released unharmed. \nShe won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1991 for her courageous \nleadership, and again and again she continues to show us why.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7471-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7471-S7472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE HOLOCAUST VICTIMS' ASSETS, RESTITUTION POLICY, AND REMEMBRANCE ACT\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in support of \nthe Holocaust Victims' Assets, Restitution Policy, and Remembrance Act.\n  We are motivated by a desire to achieve justice for Holocaust victims \nand their families, and we recognize that if such justice is to be \nattained, the United States must continue to lead the world by example.\n  The United States has provided leadership in this area ever since \nAmerican troops liberated the death camps. Most recently, the United \nStates has been the driving force behind international settlements with \nforeign governments, the Swiss banks, the European insurance companies, \nand German corporations that benefited from slave labor. This \nlegislation recognizes that the struggle for justice requires continued \nAmerican leadership and that the foundation is the appropriate \nmechanism for that leadership.\n  Justice is timeless, and it is time for us to take the necessary \nsteps and help Holocaust survivors reunite with their assets and \nbelongings. For many survivors and family members, a painting, a piece \nof furniture, or a family heirloom is the only remaining connection \nbetween them and their loved ones who died in the Holocaust. This \nlegislation is long overdue. I hope that it reunites many victims and \nfamilies with those items that have been missing for too many years, \nand a reunion like that would be a bittersweet kind of justice.\n  The purpose of this act is to create a public/private foundation to \nintegrate research that has been conducted by 23 international \ncommissions in the area of Holocaust-era assets, to complete the \nresearch agenda that arises from that synthesis, and stimulate the \ntransition to a contemporary restitution policy.\n  The foundation will be the single most effective facilitator of the \nidentification and return of Holocaust-era asserts to their rightful \nowners and heirs ever supported by the U.S. Government.\n  If the nations of the world are to be convinced of our lasting \ncommitment to justice for Holocaust victims and if continued work on \nHolocaust assets issues is to be truly effective, the foundation must \nhave the stamp of the Federal Government. But the Federal Government \ncannot, and should not, perform these tasks by itself.\n  It will coordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, State \ngovernments, the private sector, and individuals here, and abroad, to \nhelp people locate and identify assets who would\n\n[[Page S7472]]\n\notherwise have no ability to do so. It will encourage policymakers to \ndeal with contemporary restitution issues, including how best to treat \nunclaimed assets.\n  The foundation is authorized for 10 years, after which it will sunset \nand ``spin off'' its research results and materials to other \nappropriate public and private entities. It is able to accept private \nfunds as well as public dollars.\n  The commission identified a number of policy initiatives that require \nU.S. leadership. These initiatives included, but are not limited to the \nneed to: compile a report that integrates, synthesizes, and supplements \nthe research on Holocaust-era assets that has been conducted around the \nworld; review the degree to which other nations have implemented the \nprinciples adopted at various international conferences; work with \norganizations to provide for the coordinated and centralized \ndissemination of information about restitution programs; encourage the \ncreation and expansion of mechanisms, including Alternative Dispute \nResolution options, to assist claimants in obtaining the speedy \nresolution of their claims; and, support the establishment and \nmaintenance of a computerized and searchable database of Holocaust \nvictims' claims for the restitution of personal property.\n  The foundation will also encourage, and support, the efforts of State \ngovernments to facilitate the cross match of unclaimed property records \nwith lists of Holocaust victims. It will work with the museum community \nto further stimulate provenance research into European paintings and \nJudaica. It will promote and monitor the implementation by major \nbanking institutions of the agreement developed in conjunction with the \nNew York Bankers Association. Finally, it will work with the private \nsector to develop and promote common standards and best practices for \nresearch on Holocaust-era assets.\n  The impetus for the foundation comes from the work of the \nPresidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United \nStates chaired by Edgar M. Bronfman, Sr. The commission report, \n``Plunder and Restitution: The U.S. and Holocaust Victims' Assets,'' \nwas the most comprehensive examination ever conducted into how the \nFederal Government handled the assets of Holocaust victims that came \ninto its possession or control.\n  The Congress has dealt with Holocaust issues on a nonpartisan basis, \nand I am confident it will consider this bill in the same spirit.

It is the only agency in Marin County that \nprovides alcohol and drug treatment programs designed to meet the \nspecific needs of women and their families.\n  MSW works tirelessly to ensure the physical and emotional health of \nBay Area women by working one-on-one with individuals and providing \nthem with specialized treatment. MSW's treatment philosophy is a \ncomprehensive, gender-specific, culturally responsible approach to \nalcohol and drug recovery. MSW respects and encourages each client's \nstrengths and provides social, economic and political empowerment.\n  Throughout its 25 years of service, MSW has successfully provided a \nsafe haven for women seeking recovery by providing female staff role \nmodels who reflect the diversity of the client population; residential \nand outpatient services that address the addiction patterns of women; \nand intensive case management to assist with employment status, access \nto housing, and use of outside health and social services. MSW's \nsuccess in advancing community recovery by providing specialized \ntreatment tailored to each individual woman has set a standard for care \nin the Bay Area.\n  For 25 years, Marin Services for Women has served as a beacon for \nwomen who have nowhere else to turn. Their dedication to the community \nis inspiring and impressive. I congratulate Marin Services for Women on \ntheir 25th anniversary and wish them another 25 years of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7472-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN RECOGNITION OF OFFICER MICHAEL SIEBERT, RECIPIENT OF THE CALIFORNIA \n       AMERICAN LEGION LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE YEAR AWARD.\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nSenate's attention the exemplary achievements and outstanding service \nof Officer Michael Siebert of the San Francisco Police Department.\n  The American Legion, Department of California has chosen Officer \nMichael Siebert as its Law Enforcement Officer of the Year. Officer \nSiebert is receiving this award for his dedication to the betterment of \nhis community and to law enforcement.\n  Officer Michael Siebert has dedicated himself to raising funds for \nchildren with catastrophic childhood diseases. In 1998, Officer Siebert \nvolunteered to travel to Sydney, Australia, to take part in its ``Crop-\nA-Cop'' fundraising event. This event featured officers who raise \ncharity funds earmarked for children with cancer. As part of the event, \nofficers would shave their heads to demonstrate to children going \nthrough the horrors of chemotherapy that it was okay to have no hair. \nNot only did Officer Siebert shave his head, but he also returned to \n``Crop-A-Cop'' in Australia the following year.\n  Through his efforts, in 1999, this event debuted in the United \nStates. Not only did he succeed in having the San Francisco Police \nDepartment and the Sheriff's Department participate, but Officer \nSiebert enlisted agencies all over the State of California to take \npart. This year marked the fourth year of Officer Siebert's ``Buzz the \nFuzz'' fundraiser.\n  Officer Siebert is an inspiration to all. Californians are extremely \nproud of Officer Siebert's dedication to his police work, the \ncommunity, and to children who bravely face the devastation of cancer. \nHe is most deserving of this award and the outpouring of admiration he \nreceives from colleagues and friends. I am honored to pay tribute to \nhim, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in wishing Officer \nMichael Siebert much continued success in his law enforcement \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7472-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7472-S7473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMEMORATING JOE CENOZ ON 50 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE AMERICAN LEGION \n                         CALIFORNIA BOYS STATE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes \nto recognize a constituent, Joe Cenoz, who will, at the end of the \nmonth, mark his 50th year of exemplary service to the American Legion \nCalifornia Boys State program.\n  Since 1935, the Boys State program has brought together high school \nboys from across their States to immerse them in a week of education \nabout, and simulation of, their State government. The California \nprogram began in 1938, and Mr. Cenoz is the first counselor in the \nhistory of the California Boys State program to reach 50 years of \nservice. His work has touched the lives of nearly 50,000 young \nCalifornians and 3,000 staff members who have served with and under his \nguidance.\n  Mr. Cenoz began his 50 years of service with the California Boys \nState program in 1951 as a city counselor. In 1955, he also assumed the \nrole of political party counselor, helping to guide the Boys State \ndelegates through the process of partisan politics. In 1961, Mr. Cenoz \nwas elevated to the role of county counselor. In this role, he worked \nwith the delegates of the three cities that made up the county, while \ncontinuing his role as political party counselor.\n  In 1974, Mr. Cenoz moved to the role of assistant chief counselor, \nguiding the California Boys State counseling staff and delegates \nthrough the week-long program. He became the chief\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\ncounselor in 1981, assuming overall responsibility for the activities \nthat make up the California Boys State program. The 2003 California \nBoys State session will be Mr. Cenoz's 23rd serving as chief counselor.\n  In 1980, Mr. Cenoz was invited to join the staff of Boys Nation. Boys \nNation is an extension of the Boys State program. Annually, two boys \nfrom each Boys State program around the country are selected to \nrepresent their home States at the 10-day Boys Nation program in \nWashington, DC.\n  Mr. Cenoz has been a leader outside of the California Boys State \nprogram as well, serving in the U.S. Navy and the Navy Reserve as a \nsubmariner from 1941 to 1953. He served in both World War II and the \nKorean war. Additionally, Mr. Cenoz served as a police officer with the \ncity of Pomona, beginning in 1951, and retiring at the rank of \nlieutenant in 1980.\n  Mr. Cenoz's actions demonstrate his dedication to serving his country \nand the State of California, and I offer my hearty congratulations to \nhim for his 50 years of service to the California Boys State \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7473-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING OFFICER CLAYTON HARMSTON, RECIPIENT OF THE CALIFORNIA \n  AMERICAN LEGION LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE YEAR FOR VALOR AWARD\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nSenate's attention the exemplary achievements and outstanding service \nof Officer Clayton Harmston of the San Francisco Police Department.\n  The American Legion, Department of California has chosen Officer \nClayton Harmston as its Law Enforcement Officer of the Year for Valor. \nOfficer Harmston is receiving this award for the extraordinary heroism \nhe displayed in the line of duty on July 7, 2002.\n  On that day, Officer Harmston and his partner stopped a vehicle that \nwas operating in a suspicious manner. During the vehicle stop, Officer \nHarmston approached the passenger, who was just paroled from State \nprison. The passenger refused to submit to a search and immediately \nattacked Officer Harmston. A struggle ensued, Officer Harmston was \nknocked to the ground face-first, and then the parolee drew his loaded \nweapon on Officer Harmston. Although injured and dazed, Officer \nHarmston demonstrated great presence of mind and warned his partner of \nthe gun. When Harmston's partner distracted the parolee, Officer \nHarmston displayed remarkable courage by attempting to pull the gun \naway from the parolee. During the struggle, the parolee shot Officer \nHarmston who was able to roll away to cover, where a gun battle began. \nThe gunman was struck and fell to the ground, refusing to release his \nweapon until it was taken from his grip.\n  Officer Clayton Harmston, despite his injuries, used all his \nabilities and resources to protect his partner and ultimately end this \ndangerous situation. Officer Harmston is an inspiration to all. It is \nbecause of the courage and valor of police officers such as Clayton \nHarmston that our streets are safer.\n  Californians are extremely proud of Officer Harmston. He is most \ndeserving of the American Legion, Department of California's Law \nEnforcement Officer of the Year for Valor award and of the admiration \nthat he receives from colleagues and friends. I am honored to pay \ntribute to him, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in wishing \nOfficer Harmston much continued success in his law enforcement \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7473-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN CHARLES A. BUSH\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to an outstanding officer, CPT Charles A. Bush, on the occasion \nof his retirement from the Department of the Navy. It is a great honor \nfor me to take this opportunity to thank Captain Bush and his family \nfor his 27 years of distinguished and dedicated service to our Nation. \nOver the last quarter of a century, he has proudly and selflessly \nserved his Nation in defense of freedom.\n  Few of us can appreciate the true awe of the U.S. aircraft carrier as \nwell as Captain Bush can. During his career he served the aircraft \ncarrier community in many facets: naval aviator, engineer officer, \nmaintenance coordinator, and most recently as program manager for in-\nservice aircraft carriers.\n  During his tenure as program manager, Captain Bush oversaw the \nconstruction of the USS Harry S Truman, CVN 75, and Ronald Reagan, CVN \n76, the complete refueling and complex overhaul of the first Nimitz-\nclass carrier, USS Nimitz, CVN 68, the commencement of the second \nNimitz-class carrier to undergo a refueling and overhaul--the USS \nDwight D. Eisenhower, CVN 69, as well as the maintenance planning for \nthe in-service carrier force at the highest possible level of \nreadiness.\n  His innovative concepts, motivational leadership, and personal energy \nhave produced exactly what was required to support these national \nassets--dramatic streamlining of processes and organizations, reduced \nmaintenance cost and cycle time, and a government and commercial \nworkforce trained for and ready to take these concepts forward. The \nculmination of his efforts can be no better illustrated than by the \nsuccessful surge of carriers in support of both Operation Enduring \nFreedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Captain Bush's son, Nicholas, now \nhas the distinct honor to continue the family's great service to our \nNation onboard the USS Nimitz. Nicholas is a naval flight officer \nassigned to VAQ-135, NAS Whidbey Island, WA, and was recently deployed \nin support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  It is my honor to recognize Captain Bush for his distinguished \nservice to our Nation. As a veteran of World War II and Korea, I have \nthe highest respect for those who serve in uniform, and I appreciate \nand honor all the men and women who have served, and continue to serve, \nin defense of freedom. Recalling our national anthem, to our veterans \nand Armed Forces, I say, we would not be ``the land of the free'' were \nwe not also the ``home of the brave.'' My colleagues and I wish Captain \nBush and his family continued success and the traditional naval wish of \n``Fair winds and Following seas'' as he closes out his military \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7473-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7473-S7474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO COMPANY C 5TH BATTALION 112TH ARMOR\n\n Mr. PRYOR.

A bill to expand and enhance postbaccalaureate opportunities \nat Hispanic-serving institutions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN: Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nTexas, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, to introduce the Next Generation \nHispanic-Serving Institution Act. This bill will strengthen provisions \nin Title V of the Higher Education Act, HEA, by providing our Hispanic-\nServing Institutions with both graduate opportunities and reductions in \nregulatory barriers.\n  According to the 2000 census Hispanics make up 12.5 percent of the \nAmerican population. Currently Hispanics constitute 10 percent of the \ncollege enrollment. By 2050 the Hispanic population will grow to 25 \npercent. It is in our national interest to ensure that this population \nis well educated so that they will be ready to take their place as \nprofessionals, scientists, inventors, and well-informed citizens.\n  Hispanic-Serving Institutions, HSIs, serve students of all \nbackgrounds and ethnicities in 13 States. Colleges and universities \nbecome eligible for HSI status if at least 50 percent of their student \npopulation receives need-based financial assistance, 25 percent is \nHispanic, and 50 percent of their Hispanic population is low-income. It \nis at these HSIs that the largest growth in advanced degrees awarded to \nHispanics is occurring. Between 1991 and 2000 the number of Hispanic \nstudents earning master's degrees at HSIs grew 136 percent and the \nnumber of receiving doctoral degrees grew by 85 percent. Currently over \n25 percent of the Hispanics who obtained these degrees did so at HSIs. \nAs a nation, we need to expand the capacity of Hispanic-Serving \nInstitutions, support their undergraduate programs, and encourage them \nto offer quality graduate and professional degree programs.\n  The Next Generation Hispanic-Serving Institution Act will strengthen \nour Hispanic-Serving Institutions by: Establishing a competitive grant \nprogram for HSIs to support their masters and doctoral degree programs. \nEliminating the current requirement for HSIs to show that 50 percent of \ntheir Hispanic population is low-income. This requirement is difficult \nfor the institutions to meet because they cannot collect the necessary \nstudent data. Eliminating the 2-year wait-out period between HSI grants \nallowing continuous funding of existing programs. Adding, as an \nauthorized activity, programs that support student transfers from 2-\nyear to 4-year institutions. Raising the funding for the Title V HSI \ngrant program to $175,000,000. Allocating $125,000,000 for a new grant \nprogram to support HSI masters and doctoral programs.\n  The State of New Mexico houses 19 HSIs within its border. The New \nMexico HSIs serve the entire State and their student populations are \nvery diverse. Over the years these 19 institutions have worked \ndiligently to educate and support all students. They have graduated \noutstanding teachers, scientists, and other professionals.

A bill to restore Federal remedies for infringements of \nintellectual property by States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in June 1999, the United States Supreme \nCourt issued a pair of decisions that altered the legal landscape with \nrespect to intellectual property. I am referring to Florida Prepaid v. \nCollege Savings Bank and its companion case, College Savings Bank v. \nFlorida Prepaid. The Court ruled in these cases that States and their \ninstitutions cannot be held liable for damages for patent infringement \nand other violations of the Federal intellectual property laws, even \nthough they can and do enjoy the full protection of those laws for \nthemselves.\n  Both Florida Prepaid and College Savings Bank were decided by the \nsame five-to-four majority of the justices. This slim majority of the \nCourt threw out three Federal statutes that Congress passed, \nunanimously, in the early 1990s, to reaffirm that the Federal patent, \ncopyright, and trademark laws apply to everyone, including the States.\n  I believe that there is an urgent need for Congress to respond to the \nFlorida Prepaid decisions, for two reasons.\n  First, the decisions opened up a huge loophole in our Federal \nintellectual property laws. If we truly believe in fairness, we cannot \ntolerate a situation in which some participants in the intellectual \nproperty system get legal\n\n[[Page S7480]]\n\nprotection but need not adhere to the law themselves. If we truly \nbelieve in the free market, we cannot tolerate a situation where one \nclass of market participants have to play by the rules and others do \nnot. As Senator Specter said in August 1999, in a floor statement that \nwas highly critical of the Florida Prepaid decisions, they ``leave us \nwith an absurd and untenable state of affairs,'' where ``States will \nenjoy an enormous advantage over their private sector competitors.''\n  The second reason why Congress should respond to the Florida Prepaid \ndecisions is that they raise broader concerns about the roles of \nCongress and the Court. Over the past decade, in a series of five-to-\nfour decisions that might be called examples of ``judicial activism,'' \nthe current Supreme Court majority has overturned Federal legislation \nwith a frequency unprecedented in American constitutional history. In \ndoing so, the Court has more often than not relied on notions of State \nsovereign immunity that have little if anything to do with the text of \nthe Constitution.\n  Some of us have liked some of the results; others have liked others; \nbut that is not the point. This activist Court has been whittling away \nat the legitimate constitutional authority of the federal government. \nAt the risk of sounding alarmist, this is the fact of the matter: We \nare faced with a choice. We can respond--in a careful and measured \nway--by reinstating our democratic policy choices in legislation that \nis crafted to meet the Court's stated objections. Or we can run away, \nabdicate our democratic policy-making duties to the unelected Court, \nand go down in history as the incredible shrinking Congress.\n  About four months after the Florida Prepaid decisions issued, I \nintroduced a bill that responded to those decisions. The Intellectual \nProperty Protection Restoration Act of 1999 was designed to restore \nFederal remedies for violations of intellectual property rights by \nstates. I have continued to refine this legislation over the years, and \nin February 2002, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held the \nCommittee's first hearing on the issue of sovereign immunity and the \nprotection of intellectual property.\n\n  Today, I am pleased to be introducing the Intellectual Property \nProtection Restoration Act of 2003, which builds on my earlier \nproposals and on the helpful comments I have received on those \nproposals from legal experts across the country. I am proud to have the \nHouse leaders on intellectual property issues, Representatives Smith \nand Berman, as the principal sponsors of the House companion bill.\n  This bill has the same common-sense goal as the three statutes that \nthe Supreme Court's decisions invalidated: To protect intellectual \nproperty rights fully and fairly. But the legislation has been re-\nengineered, after extensive consultation with constitutional and \nintellectual property experts, to ensure full compliance with the \nCourt's new jurisprudential requirements. As a result, the bill has \nearned the strong support of the U.S. Copyright Office and the \nendorsements of a broad range of organizations including the American \nBar Association, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, \nthe Business Software Alliance, the Intellectual Property Owners \nAssociation, the International Trademark Association, the Motion \nPicture Association of America, the Professional Photographers of \nAmerica Association, and the Chamber of Commerce.\n  In essence, our bill presents States with a choice. It creates \nreasonable incentives for States to waive their immunity in \nintellectual property cases, but it does not oblige them to do so. \nStates that choose not to waive their immunity within two years after \nenactment of the bill would continue to enjoy many of the benefits of \nthe Federal intellectual property system; however, like private parties \nthat sue States for infringement, States that sue private parties for \ninfringement could not recover any money damages unless they had waived \ntheir immunity from liability in intellectual property cases.\n  This arrangement is clearly constitutional. Congress may attach \nconditions to a State's receipt of Federal intellectual property \nprotection under its Article I intellectual property power just as \nCongress may attach conditions on a State's receipt of federal funds \nunder its Article I spending power. Either way, the power to attach \nconditions to the federal benefit is part of the greater power to deny \nthe benefit altogether. And no condition could be more reasonable or \nproportionate than the condition that in order to obtain full \nprotection for your federal intellectual property rights, you must \nrespect those of others.\n  I am encouraged by the Supreme Court's recent decision in Nevada \nDepartment of Human Resources v. Hibbs, which, although very narrow, \nsuggests that certain Justices may be starting to realize that the \nCourt has gone too far in sacrificing ordinary people's rights at the \naltar of sovereign immunity. By upholding the Family and Medical Leave \nAct as applied to the States, the Hibbs case also suggests that a very \ncarefully crafted law, which simply does what is necessary to protect \nimportant rights, will be upheld.\n  I hope we can all agree on the need to protect the rights of \nintellectual property owners. A recent GAO study confirmed that, as the \nlaw now stands, owners of intellectual property have few or no \nalternatives or remedies available against State infringers--just a \nseries of dead ends.\n  We need to assure American inventors and investors, and our foreign \ntrading partners, that as State involvement in intellectual property \nbecomes ever greater in the new information economy, U.S. intellectual \nproperty rights are backed by legal remedies. I want to emphasize the \ninternational ramifications here. American trading interests have been \nwell served by our strong and consistent advocacy of effective \nintellectual property protections in treaty negotiations and other \ninternational fora. Those efforts could be jeopardized by the loophole \nin U.S. intellectual property enforcement that the Supreme Court has \ncreated.\n  Senator Brownback made this point at a Judiciary Committee hearing on \nFebruary 27, 2002. He said, ``When states assert sovereign immunity for \nthe purpose of infringing upon intellectual property rights, it damages \nthe credibility of the United States internationally, and could \npossibly even lead to violations of our treaty obligations. Any \ndecrease in the level of enforcement of intellectual property rights \naround the world is likely to harm American businesses, because of our \nposition as international leaders in industries like pharmaceuticals, \ninformation technology, and biotechnology.''\n  The Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act restores \nprotection for violations of intellectual property rights that may, \nunder current law, go unremedied. We unanimously passed more sweeping \nlegislation in the early 1990s, but were thwarted by the Supreme \nCourt's shifting jurisprudence. We should enact this legislation \nwithout further delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows.\n\n                                S. 1191\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Consumer and Small Business Energy \nCommission to assess and provide recommendations regarding recent \nenergy price spikes from the perspective of consumers and small \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Consumer and \nSmall Business Energy Commission Act. I am pleased to have the support \nof the Senator from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, in introducing this \nlegislation. This legislation will allow us to better understand the \ncauses of energy price spikes from the consumer and small business \nperspectives, and better address this pressing issue.\n  The Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act would establish \na Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission. The members would be \nappointed on a bipartisan basis by the Speaker and Minority Leader of \nthe House and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, as well \nas the President. The Commission would be comprised of representatives \nof consumer groups, the energy industry, small businesses, and the \nAdministration. The Commission will study the causes of energy price \nspikes and issue recommendations on how to avert price spikes in the \nfuture.\n  Sine 1990, residential heating oil, residential natural gas, \ncommercial natural gas, industrial natural gas, and gasoline have all \nhad significantly fluctuating prices. Gasoline price spikes have become \ncommonplace in the Midwest. Escalating home heating and cooling bills \nhave crippled family budgets in the Midwest and Northeast. Farmers and \nindustries dependent on natural gas for the production of fertilizer \nand other chemical products have also suffered economically. Most \nrecently, natural gas prices have skyrocketed and gasoline prices have \nshown little sign of falling from the historic highs of the past few \nmonths.\n  We need a comprehensive study of these problems. Some past studies \nhave assessed the long-range supply and demand for energy product. The \nFederal Trade Commission studied gasoline price spikes in the Midwest, \nand Senator Levin has embarked on a series of hearings exploring \ngasoline pricing issues. Other studies have investigated narrow or \nspecific abuses of market power in the energy industry, such as in \nCalifornia. The Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission will look \nat the entire picture, focusing on price fluctuations of all consumer \nenergy products. The list of potential causes that need to be studied \nincludes: insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, refinery \ncapacity limits, insufficient infrastructure, possible regulation \nproblems, flawed deregulation, excessive consumption, over-reliance on \nforeign supplies, insufficient investment in research and development \nof alternative sources, opportunistic behavior by energy companies, and \nabuse of market power.\n  We need to give consumers and small businesses a voice. When \nconsumers go to pay their grocery bills, or their tuition bills, or \neven their residential electricity bills in most states, and when small \nbusinesses go to pay for raw materials, prices are fairly predictable. \nBut when they go to pay for their heating and cooling, natural gas, or \ngasoline, families and businesses face the frustrating reality of wild \nprice swings.\n  We need to bring consumers and small businesses to the table together \nwith representatives of the energy industry and government. We need \nthese groups to work collectively, and to consider the range of \npossible causes of energy price spikes.\n\n  A measure very similar to this bill enjoyed strong, bipartisan \nsupport last year, and passed as an amendment to the Senate energy bill \nby a vote of 69-30. The minor changes to this bill include adding \ndirect representation of small businesses to the Commission, expanding \nthe participation of Administration representatives in the study phase, \nand establishing an Executive Committee to expedite the issuance of the \nfinal report, which will include recommendations.\n  By enacting the Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act, we \nwill be able to better understand the causes of energy price spikes and \nhopefully avert them in the future. I urge my colleagues to join me as \na cosponsor of this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer and Small Business \n     Energy Commission Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there have been several sharp increases since 1990 in \n     the price of electricity, gasoline, home heating oil, natural \n     gas, and propane in the United States;\n       (2) recent examples of such increases include--\n       (A) unusually high gasoline prices that are at least partly \n     attributable to global politics;\n       (B) electricity price spikes during the California energy \n     crisis of 2001; and\n       (C) the Midwest gasoline price spikes in spring 2001;\n       (3) shifts in energy regulation, including the allowance of \n     greater flexibility in competition and trading, have affected \n     price stability and consumers in ways that are not fully \n     understood;\n       (4) price spikes undermine the ability of low-income \n     families, the elderly, and small businesses (including \n     farmers and other agricultural producers) to afford essential \n     energy services and products;\n       (5) energy price spikes can exacerbate a weak economy by \n     creating uncertainties that discourage investment, growth, \n     and other activities that contribute to a strong economy;\n       (6) the Department of Energy has determined that the \n     economy would be likely to perform better with stable or \n     predictable energy prices;\n       (7) price spikes can be caused by many factors, including \n     insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, refinery \n     capacity limits, insufficient infrastructure, over-regulation \n     or under-regulation, flawed deregulation, excessive \n     consumption, over-reliance on foreign supplies, insufficient \n     research and development of alternative energy sources, \n     opportunistic behavior by energy companies, and abuses of \n     market power;\n       (8) consumers and small businesses have few options other \n     than to pay higher energy costs when prices spike, resulting \n     in reduced investment and slower economic growth and job \n     creation;\n       (9) the effect of price spikes, and possible responses to \n     price spikes, on consumers and small businesses should be \n     examined; and\n       (10) studies have examined price spikes of specific energy \n     products in specific contexts or for specific reasons, but no \n     study has examined price spikes comprehensively with a focus \n     on the impacts on consumers and small businesses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for qualified withdrawals from the Capital \nConstruction Fund for fishermen leaving the industry and for the \nrollover of Capital Construction Funds to individual retirement plans, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Capital \nConstruction Fund Qualified Withdrawal Act of 2003. My friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Smith and Senator Murray, join me in introducing \nthis important bill.\n  In January of 2000, a fishery disaster was declared by the Secretary \nof Commerce for the West Coast groundfish fishery. Due to major \ndeclines in fish population, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council \ndecreased groundfish catch quotas by 90 percent. Today, the groundfish \nfishery in Oregon and adjoining States in the Pacific Northwest \ncontinues to face daunting challenges as a result of this disaster. \nFishery income has dropped 55 percent and over a thousand fishers face \nbankruptcy. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has called for a 50 \npercent reduction in fishing capacity as part of their strategic plan \nfor the recovery of the fishery. This legislation supports this effort \nby reforming the Capital Construction Fund in a way that will ease the \ngroundfish fishers' transition away from fishing.\n  The Capital Construction Fund, CCF, Merchant Marine Act of 1936, \namended 1969, 46 U.S.C. 1177, has been a way for fishers to accumulate \nfunds, free from taxes, for the purpose of buying or refitting fishing \nvessels. It was conceived at a time when the federal government wanted \nto help capitalize and expand American fishing fleets. The program was \na success: it led to a larger U.S. fishing fleet. However, fish \npopulations declined and the U.S. commercial fishing fleet is now over-\ncapitalized. The CCF's usefulness has not kept up with the times, and \nnow it exacerbates problems facing U.S. fisheries, including the West \nCoast groundfish fishery.\n  Now is the time to help fishers, who wish to do so, to leave the \nfleet.\n  In Oregon, the amounts in CCF accounts range from $10,000 to over \n$200,000. This legislation changes current law to allow fishers to \nremove money from their CCF for purposes other than buying new vessels \nor upgrading current vessels, without losing up to 70 percent of their \nCCF funds in taxes and penalties. This legislation changes the CCF so \nfishers who want to opt out of fishing are not penalized for doing so.\n  This bill takes a significant step towards helping fishermen and \nmaking the West Coast groundfish fishery and the commercial fishing \nindustry sustainable by amending the CCF to allow non-fishing uses of \ninvestments. This bill amends the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 and the \nInternal Revenue Code to allow funds currently in the CCF to be rolled \nover into an IRA or other types of retirement accounts, or to be used \nfor the payment of an industry fee authorized by the fishery capacity \nreduction program, without adverse tax consequences to the account \nholders. This bill will also encourage innovation and conservation by \nallowing fishers to use funds deposited in a CCF to develop or purchase \nnew gear that reduces bycatch.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Ms. \n        Cantwell, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1194. A bill to foster local collaborations which will ensure that \nresources are effectively and efficiently used within the criminal and \njuvenile justice systems; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators \nDomenici, Leahy, Grassley, and Cantwell, to introduce the ``Mentally \nIll Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003.'' This \nbipartisan measure would, among other things, create a program of \nplanning and implementation grants for communities so they may offer \nmore treatment and other services to mentally ill offenders. Under this \nbill, programs receiving grant funds would be operated collaboratively \nby both a criminal justice agency and a mental health agency.\n  The mentally ill population poses a particularly difficult challenge \nfor our criminal justice system. People afflicted with mental illness \nare incarcerated at significantly higher rates than the general \npopulation. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, while only \nabout five percent of the American population has a mental illness, \nabout 16 percent of the State prison population has such an illness. \nThe Los Angeles County Jail, for example,\n\n[[Page S7484]]\n\ntypically has more mentally ill inmates than any hospital in the \ncountry.\n  Unfortunately, however, the reality of our criminal justice system is \nthat jails and prisons do not provide a therapeutic environment for the \nmentally ill and are unlikely to do so any time soon. Indeed, the \nmentally ill inmate often is preyed upon by other inmates or becomes \neven sicker in jail. Once released from jail or prison, many mentally \nill people end up on the streets. With limited personal resources and \nlittle or no ability to handle their illness alone, they often commit \nfurther offenses resulting in their re-arrest and re-incarceration. \nThis ``revolving door'' is costly and disruptive for all involved.\n  Although these problems tend to manifest themselves primarily within \nthe prison system, the root cause of our current situation is found in \nthe mental health system and its failure to provide sufficient \ncommunity-based treatment solutions. Accordingly, the solution will \nnecessarily involve collaboration between the mental health system and \ncriminal justice system. In fact, it also will require greater \ncollaboration between the substance abuse treatment and mental health \ntreatment communities, because many mentally ill offenders have a drug \nor alcohol problem in addition to their mental illness.\n  The purpose of the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime \nReduction Act'' is to foster exactly this type of collaboration at the \nFederal, State, and local levels. The bill provides incentives for the \ncriminal justice, juvenile justice, mental health, and substance abuse \ntreatment systems to work together at each level of government to \nestablish a network of services for offenders with mental illness. The \nbill's approach is unique, in that it not only would promote public \nsafety by helping curb the incidence of repeat offenders, but it also \nwould promote public health, by ensuring that those with a serious \nmental illness are treated as soon as possible and as efficiently and \neffectively as possible.\n  Among its major provisions, this legislation calls for the \nestablishment of a new competitive grant program, which would be housed \nat the U.S. Department of Justice, but administered by the Attorney \nGeneral with the active involvement of the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. To ensure that collaboration occurs at the local level, \nthe bill would require that two entities jointly submit a single grant \napplication on behalf of a community.\n  Applications demonstrating the greatest commitment to collaboration \nwould receive priority for grant funds. If applicants can show that \ngrant funds would be used to promote public health, as well as public \nsafety, and if the program they propose would have the active \nparticipation of each joint applicant, and if their grant application \nhas the support of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, then it would receive priority for funding.\n  Additionally, the bill would permit grant funds to be used for a \nvariety of purposes, each of which embodies the goal of collaboration. \nFirst, grant funds may be used to provide courts with more options, \nsuch as specialized dockets, for dealing with the non-violent offender \nwho has a serious mental illness or a co-occurring mental illness and \ndrug or alcohol problem. Second, grant funds could be used to enhance \ntraining of mental health and criminal justice system personnel, who \nmust know how to deal appropriately with the mentally ill offender. \nThird, grant funds could be devoted to programs that divert the \ncriminal justice system into treatment those non-violent offenders with \nsevere and persistent mental illness. Finally, correctional facilities \nmay use grant funds to promote the treatment of inmates and ease their \ntransition back into the community upon release from jail or prison.\n  In specifically authorizing grant funds to be used to promote more \noptions for courts to deal with mentally ill offenders, this bill \nbuilds on legislation that I introduced two years ago with my colleague \nfrom Ohio, Congressman Ted Strickland. That measure, which became law, \nauthorized $10 million per year for the establishment of more mental \nhealth courts. I have long supported mental health courts, which enable \nthe criminal justice system to provide an individualized treatment \nsolution for a mentally ill offender, while also requiring \naccountability of the offender. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday would make possible the creation or expansion of more mental \nhealth courts, and it also would promote the funding of treatment \nservices that support such courts.\n  In addition to making planning and implementation grants available to \ncommunities, the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction \nAct'' also calls for an Interagency Task Force to be established at the \nfederal level. This Task Force would include the Attorney General and \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, as well as the Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of \nEducation, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Commissioner of \nSocial Security. The Task Force would be charged with identifying new \nways that federal departments can work together to reduce recidivism \namong mentally ill adults and juveniles.\n  Finally, the bill would direct the Attorney General and Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to develop a list of ``best practices'' for \ncriminal justice personnel to use when diverting mentally ill offenders \nfrom the criminal justice system.\n  Ultimately, this is a good bill and one that is long overdue. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this important legislative measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1194\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mentally Ill Offender \n     Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over 16 \n     percent of adults incarcerated in United States jails and \n     prisons have a mental illness.\n       (2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, approximately 20 percent of youth in \n     the juvenile justice system have serious mental health \n     problems, and a significant number have co-occurring mental \n     health and substance abuse disorders.\n       (3) According to the National Alliance for the Mentally \n     Ill, up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious \n     mental illness will come into contact with the American \n     criminal justice system at some point in their lives.\n       (4) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, over 150,000 juveniles who come into \n     contact with the juvenile justice system each year meet the \n     diagnostic criteria for at least 1 mental or emotional \n     disorder.\n       (5) A significant proportion of adults with a serious \n     mental illness who are involved with the criminal justice \n     system are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness; and \n     many of these individuals are arrested and jailed for minor, \n     nonviolent offenses.\n       (6) The majority of individuals with a mental illness or \n     emotional disorder who are involved in the criminal or \n     juvenile justice systems are responsive to medical and \n     psychological interventions that integrate treatment, \n     rehabilitation, and support services.\n       (7) Collaborative programs between mental health, substance \n     abuse, and criminal or juvenile justice systems that ensure \n     the provision of services for those with mental illness or \n     co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders can \n     reduce the number of such individuals in adult and juvenile \n     corrections facilities, while providing improved public \n     safety.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to increase public safety by \n     facilitating collaboration among the criminal justice, \n     juvenile justice, mental health treatment, and substance \n     abuse systems. Such collaboration is needed to--\n       (1) reduce rearrests among adult and juvenile offenders \n     with mental illness, or co-occurring mental illness and \n     substance abuse disorders;\n       (2) provide courts, including existing and new mental \n     health courts, with appropriate mental health and substance \n     abuse treatment options;\n       (3) maximize the use of alternatives to prosecution through \n     diversion in appropriate cases involving non-violent \n     offenders with mental illness;\n       (4) promote adequate training for criminal justice system \n     personnel about mental illness and substance abuse disorders \n     and the appropriate responses to people with such illnesses;\n       (5) promote adequate training for mental health treatment \n     personnel about criminal\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\n     offenders with mental illness and the appropriate response to \n     such offenders in the criminal justice system;\n       (6) promote communication between criminal justice or \n     juvenile justice personnel, mental health treatment \n     personnel, nonviolent offenders with mental illness, and \n     other support services such as housing, job placement, \n     community, and faith-based organizations; and\n       (7) promote communication, collaboration, and \n     intergovernmental partnerships among municipal, county, and \n     State elected officials with respect to mentally ill \n     offenders.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I have joined today with Senators DeWine, \nGrassley, Cantwell, and Domenici to introduce legislation that will \nhelp State and local governments reduce crime by providing more \neffective treatment for the mentally ill. All too often, people with \nmental illness rotate repeatedly between the criminal justice system \nand the streets of our communities, committing a series of minor \noffenses. Law enforcement officers' ever scarcer time is being occupied \nby these offenders, who divert them from their more urgent \nresponsibilities. Meanwhile, offenders find themselves in prisons or \njails, where little or no appropriate medical care is available for \nthem. This bill give State and local governments the tools to break \nthis cycle, for the good of law enforcement, corrections officers, the \npublic's safety, and mentally ill offenders.\n  I held a Judiciary Committee hearing last June on the criminal \njustice system and mentally ill offenders. At that\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\nhearing, we heard from State mental health officials, law enforcement \nofficers, corrections officials, and the representative of counties \naround our Nation. All agreed that people with untreated mental illness \nare more likely to commit crimes, and that our State mental health \nsystems, prisons and jails do not have the resources they need to treat \nthe mentally ill, and prevent crime and recidivism. As this \nlegislation's findings detail, more than 16 percent of adults \nincarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons have a mental illness, about 20 \npercent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental \nhealth problems, and up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a \nserious mental illness will come into contact with the American \ncriminal justice system at some point in their lives. This is a serious \nproblem that I hear about often when I talk with law enforcement \nofficials and others in Vermont.\n  Under this bill, State and local governments can apply for funding to \na. create or expand mental health courts or other court-based programs, \nwhich can divert qualified offenders from prison to receive treatment; \nb. create or expand programs to provide specialized training for \ncriminal justice and mental health system personnel; c. create or \nexpand local treatment programs that serve individuals with mental \nillness or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders; \nand d. promote and provide mental health treatment for those \nincarcerated in or released from a penal or correctional institution.\n  This legislation brings together law enforcement, corrections, and \nmental health professionals--indeed, officials from each of these \nfields in Vermont have offered their advice and support in drafting \nthis bill. They know that the States have been dealing with the unique \nproblems created by mentally ill offenders for many years, and that a \nFederal response is overdue. I look forward to working with them, and \nwith Senator DeWine, Representative Ted Strickland, and other Members, \nto see this bill enacted this Congress.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be once again \nintroducing with Senator DeWine the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and \nCrime Reduction Act of 2003. This bipartisan bill authorizes the \nAttorney General to administer a grant program to assist communities in \nplanning and implementing services for mentally ill offenders. These \ngrants will increase public safety by fostering collaborative efforts \nby criminal justice, mental health, and substance abuse agencies. I \nhave seen these types of collaborative programs work in Iowa and I know \nthat they can work elsewhere.\n  We have an obligation to ensure that the public is protected from \nthese offenders who suffer from mental illness. The Bureau of Justice \nStatistics has reported that over 16 percent of adults incarcerated in \nU.S. jails and prison have a mental illness. In addition, the Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has reported that over 20 \npercent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental \nhealth problems. This grant program will help increase public safety, \nas well as reduce the number of mentally ill adults and juveniles \nincarcerated in correctional facilities.\n  These grant dollars may be used by States and localities to establish \nmental health courts or other diversion programs, create or expand \ncommunity-based treatment programs, provide in-jail treatment and \ntransitional services, and for training of criminal justice and mental \nhealth system employees. The state of Iowa and a number of its counties \nare already leading the way in finding creative and collaborative \nprograms to address the problems presented by these mentally ill \ncriminals. Working together, the criminal justice, mental health, and \nsubstance abuse professionals can make a difference in the lives of \nthis special class of offenders and also increase the safety of the \npublic.\n  I want to thank Senator DeWine for his leadership on this important \nissue. He has drafted a bill that reflects a common sense approach to a \nserious public safety issue. I also want to encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this important piece of legislation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator DeWine \nand Senator Patrick Leahy along with Senators Grassley and Domenici in \ncosponsoring this important legislation. This bill will take steps to \nreduce the prevalence of the mentally ill in the criminal justice \nsystem by providing more effective treatment. Forty percent of the \nmentally ill in this country come in contact with the criminal justice \nsystem, many for minor but repeated offenses. This wastes tremendous \nlaw enforcement resources that can be better focused on more urgent \nresponsibilities and results in many of the mentally ill sitting in \njail cells where little treatment is available to them. My State has \nalready taken some forward looking action in this area, and this \nlegislation is an important next step.\n  The Mentally Ill Crime Reduction Act of 2003 funds new grants that \nwill give States the tools they need to work collaboratively to break \nthe cycle of mentally ill people repeatedly moving through the \ncorrections system. This legislation will allow more jurisdictions to \nfollow Seattle's lead in creating mental health courts that monitor \nindividuals to keep them in treatment and out of jail. It will provide \nmuch needed funding to mental health and substance abuse programs, and \nit will provide critical dollars for treatment of those incarcerated in \nor released from prisons. The legislation has the support of Washington \nState Corrections Director Joe Lehman and the Washington Department of \nSocial and Health Services as well as the National Alliance for the \nMentally Ill and the Council of State Governments. I'd like to \nespecially thank the Bazelon Center for its work in this area.\n  Last year, the Council on State Governments Criminal Justice/Mental \nHealth Consensus Project issued a report that detailed the imbalance of \nthe mentally ill in the criminal justice system. The Project found \nthat, while those suffering from serious mental illness represent \napproximately five percent of the population of this country, they \nrepresent over 16 percent of the prison population. Of that 16 percent, \nnearly three-quarters also have a substance abuse problem, and nearly \nhalf were incarcerated for committing a nonviolent crime. In some \njurisdictions recidivism rates for mentally ill inmates can reach over \n70 percent. Police, judges and prosecutors are usually without options \nof what to do with mentally ill patients, given the lack of health \nservices, and thus many end up in jail for minor crimes. The Los \nAngeles County Jail alone holds as many as 3,300 individuals with \nmental illness, more than any state hospital or mental health \ninstitution in the United States.\n  Each time a mentally ill individual is incarcerated, his or her \nmental condition will likely worsen. Once incarcerated, people with \nmental illness are particularly susceptible to harming themselves or \nothers. This environment exacerbates their mental illness, yet access \nto effective counseling or medication is severely limited. This in turn \nbrings on depression or delusions that immobilize them; many have spent \nyears trying to mask torments or hallucinations with alcohol or drugs \nand on average spend more time in prisons.\n  This problem is particularly acute in the area of juvenile offenders. \nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention reports that \nover 20 percent of children in the juvenile justice system, over \n155,000, have serious mental health problems. This bill creates \nspecialized training programs for juvenile and criminal justice agency \npersonnel in identifying symptoms of mentally ill individuals that will \nhelp identify and treat juveniles at an earlier stage.\n\n  The prevalence of people with mentally illness in the criminal \njustice system comes at a high price to taxpayers. In King County, WA, \nofficials identified 20 people who had been repeatedly hospitalized, \njailed or admitted to detoxification centers. These emergency services \ncost the county approximately $1.1 million in a single year. In \ncontrast, an Illinois Cooperative Program which brought criminal \njustice and mental health service personnel together to provide \nservices to those mentally ill patients released from jail calculated \nthat the 30 individuals in the study spend approximately 2,200 days \nless in jail, and 2,100 fewer days, in hospitals than they had the \nprevious year, for a savings of $1.2 million dollars.\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\n  In 1997, Seattle Fire Department Captain Stanley Stevenson was \nmurdered by an individual who had been found incompetent by the local \nmunicipal court but was released because of the lack of alternative \noptions. This murder was the impetus for the creation of a Task Force \nthat led directly to the formation of the King County Mental Health \nCourt in 1999. The primary reason why this Court has been growing more \neffective in dealing with mentally ill offenders is that it has \nincreased cooperation between the mental health and criminal justice \nsystems, institutions that have traditionally not worked closely \ntogether. Building on the model of the drug court, the mental health \ncourt closely monitors compliance with treatment regimens by assembling \na team proficient in dealing with the mentally ill and at using the \nstick of the criminal justice system to make that treatment work. The \nvast majority of these mentally ill individuals are responsive to \ntreatment.\n  This program has progressed well and is becoming an effective means \nof helping mentally ill offenders, assuring public safety, and running \na more cost efficient system. Yet to allow this system to continue to \nexpand in Seattle and other communities in Washington State, as well as \nto allow other States to begin using these types of programs, federal \ngrant funding is critical. That is what this bill provides.\n  Collaboration between mental health, substance abuse, law \nenforcement, judicial, and other criminal justice personnel is also \ncritical to the success of our mental health court program in Seattle. \nIt is only through full coordination between the criminal justice and \nthe mental health treatment community at the Federal and the local \nlevel that these efforts will be successful.\n  Similarly, only through full coordination at the Federal and local \nlevel will this bill be able to make a critical difference. I believe \nthat some additional improvements can be made to strengthen that \ncritical coordination and I look forward to working with Senator DeWine \nand Senator Leahy to accomplish that goal. I welcome the introduction \nof this legislation and look forward to working with my cosponsors to \nmake this bill law in the next Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL  (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        McCain, Mr. Frist, Mr. Alexander, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Bunning, \n        Mr. Smith, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Kennedy, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1195. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nclarify that inpatient drug prices charged to certain public hospitals \nare included in the best price exemptions for the medicaid drug rebate \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Bingaman, \nRockefeller, McCain, Frist, Alexander, Lincoln, Bunning, Smith, Bob \nGraham, Santorum, Kerry, Kennedy and Hatch to introduce a modest but \nimportant piece of legislation, the Safety Net Hospital Pharmacy Access \nAct. This legislation would correct a small error in current law that \nprohibits safety-net hospitals from being able to negotiate with \npharmaceutical companies for the lowest prices they can get.\n  Let me provide some background on this problem. In 1990, Congress \nestablished the Medicaid drug-rebate program to ensure that the \nMedicaid program pays no more than a pharmaceutical manufacturer's \n``best price'' for a covered outpatient drug. So whatever was the \nlowest price the manufacturer offered to anyone, this becomes the price \nMedicaid pays under this ``best price'' rule.\n  Unfortunately, this rule provides an incentive for pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers not to offer deep discounts to anyone, given that these \nprices may become the new price that Medicaid pays. Given this, in 1992 \nCongress exempted some organizations from the Medicaid best price \ncalculations so that pharmaceutical manufacturers would offer them \nlower drug prices. These organizations include the VA, the Department \nof Defense, and section 340B covered entities. These 340B hospitals are \nso called because they fall under section 340B of the Public Health \nServices Act, which defines 12 categories of publicly funded safety net \nproviders. There are approximately 160 hospitals in the country that \nfall under the 340B program. These hospitals often bear the burden of \nproviding a substantial amount of uncompensated care in dealing with \nthe indigent or the uninsured.\n  Unfortunately, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services \ninterpreted the 1992 law as only applying to outpatient drugs purchased \nby these entities. Therefore, drugs purchased for inpatient use at the \n340B hospitals are covered by the Medicaid best price rule. This means \nthese hospitals actually pay more for these drugs than for drugs that \nthey can negotiate their own prices for in the outpatient setting. The \nlegislation I am introducing today corrects this problem by allowing \nthe 340B hospitals to also negotiate for lower drug prices in the \ninpatient setting.\n  This is an important correction since these hospitals are often \nproviding free care to the indigent and the uninsured. And let me be \nclear that this legislation would not require pharmaceutical companies \nto provide discounts to these hospitals. All this legislation would do \nis allow the hospitals to negotiate for lower prices. However, in my \ndiscussion with representatives of hospitals that would be affected by \nthis law, they believe they would be able to save money.\n  For instance, the Maricopa County hospital, which is the public \nhospital for the city of Phoenix, believes that it could save up to $1 \nmillion a year. Since this hospital constantly runs in the red because \nof the massive amount of uncompensated care it is required under \nfederal law to provide, such savings would be very helpful.\n  I want to thank the bill's cosponsors. I also want to urge my \ncolleagues to take a close look at this important legislation. I am \ngoing to work to see that it is passed this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1196. A bill to eliminate the marriage penalty permanently in \n2003; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \nprovide permanent tax relief from one of the most egregious, anti-\nfamily aspects of the tax code--the marriage penalty. Relieving \nAmerican taxpayers of this burden has been one of my highest priorities \nas a U.S. Senator.\n  Last week President Bush signed into law a $350 billion jobs and \neconomic growth package to put Americans back to work and stimulate the \neconomy. The bill provides immediate marriage penalty relief by \nenlarging the standard deduction and the 15 percent tax bracket for \nmarried couples filing jointly to twice that as for single filers. This \nprovision will save 34 million married couples an average of $589 this \nyear alone.\n  Enacting marriage penalty relief is a giant step for tax fairness, \nbut it may be fleeting. The Jobs and Growth Act was just signed, but \neven as the ink dries a tax increase on married couples looms in the \nnear future. Since the bill was restricted by artificial limitations to \n$350 billion, the marriage penalty provisions will only be in effect \nfor two years. In 2005, marriage will again be a taxable event for \nmillions of Americans. Similar restrictions were placed on the 2001 tax \ncut, so, while relief will be phased in by 2009, it will disappear for \ngood in 2011 unless we act decisively.\n  Millions of couples across America will be penalized once more by our \ntax code simply because they are married. Without marriage penalty \nrelief, 48 percent of married couples will again pay the government an \naverage $1,400 more in taxes.\n  Given the state of the economy and the difficulty many families face \nin making ends meet, we must make sure we do not backtrack on this \nimportant reform.\n  Without marriage penalty relief, the tax code provides a significant \ndisincentive for people to walk down the aisle, and the benefits of \nmarriage are well established. Marriage is a fundamental institution in \nour society and should not be discouraged by the IRS. Children living \nin a married household are far less likely to live in poverty or\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\nto suffer from child abuse. Research indicates they are less likely to \nbe depressed or have developmental problems. Scourges such as \nadolescent drug use are less common in married families, and married \nmothers are less likely to be victims of domestic violence.\n  The bill I am offering would make the marriage penalty relief in the \nJobs and Growth Act permanent. It also will accelerate changes to the \nearned income tax credit that were passed in the 2001 tax reform bill. \nThis will reduce the marriage penalty on lower income couples.\n  We cannot be satisfied until couples never again must decide between \nlove and money. Marriage should not be a taxable event.\n  I call on the Senate to finish the job we started and say ``I do'' to \nproviding permanent marriage penalty relief today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure the \nsafety and accuracy of medical imaging examinations and radiation \ntherapy treatments; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, imagine for a moment you have gone to the \ndoctor to have a medical condition evaluated. Uncertain as to what your \ninjury may be, your doctor sends you to a specialist for a medical \nimaging examination to determine the extent of your injury and the \nproper course of treatment for it.\n  Or, imagine, having heard the dreaded diagnosis of cancer, going to \nthe same facility for radiation therapy.\n  In either case, our sense of concern and anxiety about our medical \ncondition will serve to focus our attention on ourselves, and not on \nthe caregivers providing us with the treatment we need to recover, or \nin the case of cancer, to survive.\n  But, what would you say if you knew that the individual helping to \ndirect your diagnosis or the one providing your course of treatment is \nsomeone who has done nothing more to earn his credentials than spend a \nfew weeks getting some on the job training.\n  Imagine how you would feel and the level of trust you would have in a \nsystem that allowed such a thing to happen.\n  Unfortunately, that's an all too common occurrence with the present \nstate of our health care system.\n  But, it is a problem that we can solve with the passage of \nlegislation I am introducing today.\n  The Consumer Assurance of Radiological Excellence, RadCARE, Act will \nensure that there are coherent standards in place for those who plan \nand deliver radiation therapy treatments. I am pleased to be joined by \nmy distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, as well \nas Senators Daschle, Lautenberg, and Dorgan, in this effort, which will \nbring peace of mind and restore the confidence of the health consumer \nin the treatment they receive from those who perform radiologic \nprocedures. It will also increase awareness of the skills of these \nhealth care professionals and raise the level of visibility their \nprofession enjoys in the public eye.\n  It is important that we establish standards for personnel who perform \nradiologic procedures because physicians depend upon medical imaging \nexaminations to diagnose disease and identify and treat injuries of all \nkinds. The quality of a radiologic procedure hinges upon the expertise \nof the professionals who assist in administering them.\n  Currently, 15 States as well as the District of Columbia do not \nregulate or register radiologic personnel.\n  To address that lack of attention, the RadCARE Act will strengthen \nthe Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981. The \ncurrent law calls for States to establish voluntarily a set of \neducational and credentialing standards for radiologic and medical \nimaging personnel. Yet many States still do not have licensing laws in \nplace that meet the standards recommended by the Federal Government. \nThe RadCARE Act will require that radiologic and medical imaging \npersonnel meet a minimum credentialing standard.\n  The RadCARE Act will not affect states that have a suitable licensing \nsystem or those that have mandated higher standards than required by \nFederal law. If a state has no meaningful\n\n[[Page S7490]]\n\nregulations or licensing system, however, then the Federal standards \nwill apply. The RadCARE Act also has a provision to ensure access to \nquality healthcare in rural regions where a one-size-fits all approach \nmay not be applicable. Enforcement of the RadCARE Act would be achieved \nby restricting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement to facilities that \nemploy personnel who meet the minimal federal standards.\n  The RedCARE Act will improve the safety of radiological procedures by \nreducing the risk of harmful overexposure to radiation. Healthcare \ncosts will also be lowered by decreasing the number of repeated \nprocedures due to personnel error. Additionally, the RadCARE Act will \nenable radiologists and other healthcare professionals to have access \nto quality information so that patients receive the best health care \npossible.\n  This legislation is supported by a variety of organizations concerned \nwith the quality of these procedures, including the American Society of \nRadiologic Technologists, the Society of Nuclear Medicine Technologist \nSection, the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists, the Nuclear \nMedicine Technology Certification Board, the Association of Vascular \nand Interventional Radiographers, and the other members of the Alliance \nfor Quality Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy, which represents the \nmore than 275,000 medical imaging and radiation therapy professionals \nin the United States.\n  When it comes right down to it, it's a big enough battle to fight the \ncancers or the injuries to our bodies that require such invasive \ntreatments or diagnosis. We shouldn't have to worry about the level of \ncompetence of those who are providing us with the services we so \ndesperately require for the maintenance of our health.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and passing this much \nneeded legislation. It respects the power of the states who have \naddressed this problem as it provides minimum standards for those who \nhave not.\n  More importantly, its enactment into law will do a great deal to \nincrease the level of confidence of the American health consumer in our \nhealthcare system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Assurance of \n     Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 300,000,000 medical imaging examinations and \n     radiation therapy treatments are administered annually in the \n     United States.\n       (2) Seven out of every 10 Americans undergo a medical \n     imaging examination or radiation therapy treatment every year \n     in the United States.\n       (3) The administration of medical imaging examinations and \n     radiation therapy treatments and the effect on individuals of \n     such procedures have a substantial and direct effect upon \n     public health and safety and upon interstate commerce.\n       (4) It is in the interest of public health and safety to \n     minimize unnecessary or inappropriate exposure to radiation \n     due to the performance of medical imaging and radiation \n     therapy procedures by personnel lacking appropriate education \n     and credentials.\n       (5) It is in the interest of public health and safety to \n     have a continuing supply of adequately educated persons and \n     appropriate accreditation and certification programs \n     administered by State governments.\n       (6) Persons who perform or plan medical imaging or \n     radiation therapy, including those employed at Federal \n     facilities or reimbursed by Federal health programs, should \n     be required to demonstrate competence by reason of education, \n     training, and experience.\n       (7) The protection of public health and safety from \n     unnecessary or inappropriate medical imaging and radiation \n     therapy procedures and the assurance of efficacious \n     procedures are the responsibilities of both the State and the \n     Federal Governments.\n       (8) Facilities that conduct medical imaging or radiation \n     therapy engage in and affect interstate commerce. Patients \n     travel regularly across State lines to receive medical \n     imaging services or radiation therapy. Facilities that \n     conduct medical imaging or radiation therapy engage \n     technicians, physicians, and other staff in an interstate \n     market, and purchase medical and other supplies in an \n     interstate market.\n       (9) In 1981, Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient \n     Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35) \n     which established minimum Federal standards for the \n     accreditation of education programs for persons who perform \n     or plan medical imaging examinations and radiation therapy \n     treatments and for the certification of such persons. The Act \n     also provided the States with a model State law for the \n     licensing of such persons.\n       (10) Twenty-two years after the enactment of the Consumer-\n     Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981--\n       (A) 13 States do not require licensure of any kind for \n     persons who perform or plan medical imaging examinations and \n     radiation therapy treatments;\n       (B) 37 States license, regulate, or register radiographers;\n       (C) 28 States license radiation therapists;\n       (D) 22 States license nuclear medicine technologists;\n       (E) 8 States license or require board certification of \n     medical physicists; and\n       (F) no States regulate or license medical dosimetrists.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure the accreditation of education programs for, \n     and the licensure or certification of, persons who perform, \n     plan, evaluate, or verify patient dose for medical imaging \n     examinations and radiation therapy treatments; and\n       (2) to ensure the safety and accuracy of medical imaging \n     examinations and radiation therapy treatments.\n\n     SEC. 3. QUALITY OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION THERAPY.\n\n       Part F of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 262 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n           ``Subpart 4--Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy\n\n     ``SEC. 355.

A bill to establish the Child Care Provider Development and \nRetention Grant Program, the Child Care Provider Scholarship Program, \nand a program of child care provider health benefits coverage, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Focus on \nCommitted and Underpaid Staff for Children's Sake Act. I am pleased \nthat Senators Kennedy, Murray, and Bingaman are joining me as original \ncosponsors and that companion legislation is being introduced in the \nHouse today by Representatives George Miller and Patrick Kennedy.\n  The need for child care has become a daily fact of life for millions \nof parents nationwide. Sixty-five percent of mothers with children \nunder age six and 78 percent of mothers with children ages 6 to 13 are \nin the labor force. Each day, 13 million preschool children, including \n6 million infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day in child \ncare.\n  The quality of that care has a tremendous impact on the critical \nearly years of children's development. And, the most powerful \ndeterminant of the quality of child care is the training, education, \nand pay of those who spend 8-10 hours a day caring for our children.\n  Yet, what we know about the child care field is alarming. Despite the \nfact that continuity of care is critical for the emotional development \nof children, staff turnover at child care centers averages 30 percent \nper year--four times greater than the turnover rate for elementary \nschool teachers.\n  We as a society say there is no more important task than helping to \nraise a child. Yet, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we pay \nthe average child care worker about $16,500 a year--barely above the \npoverty level for a family of three. Few child care providers have \nbasic benefits like health coverage or paid leave. Only a small \nfraction of child care workers have graduated from college.\n  We pay people millions of dollars a year to throw baseballs, to shoot \nbasketballs and to swing golf clubs. What does that say about our \npriorities when at the same time we pay those who care for our most \nprecious resource--our children--poverty-level wages?\n  A report by the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for \nChild Care Workforce on child care providers' pay, training and \neducation highlighted the current crisis in the child care field. In a \nsurvey of child care centers in three California communities, the study \nfound that three-quarters of all child care staff employed in 1996 were \nno longer on the job in 2000. Some centers reported 100 percent \nturnover. Additionally, nearly half of the child care providers who had \nleft had a Bachelor's degree, compared to only one-third of the new \nteachers. Some 49 percent, nearly half, of those who had left their \njob, left the child care field entirely.\n  It's clear that if we want to attract quality teachers to the child \ncare field, the pay has to better reflect the value we place on their \nwork. We can't attract them and we can't keep them if we don't pay them \na living wage.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide states with funds \nto increase child care worker pay based on the level of education--the \ngreater the level of education, the greater the increase in pay. In \naddition, the legislation will provide scholarships of up to $1,500 for \nchild care workers who want to further their early childhood education \ntraining by getting a college degree, an Associate's degree, or a child \ndevelopment associate credential.\n  The legislation also includes a separate allotment to states to \naddress access to health care coverage by child care workers. States \nwould be free to develop their own creative methods to improve access \nto health care, but the intent is to ensure that an industry that works \nwith children--who as many parents know, often come down with a variety \nof illnesses, particularly preschool age children--would have greater \naccess to comprehensive and affordable health care coverage.\n  We will never make significant strides in improving the quality of \nchild care in this Nation if we fail to address one of the leading \nproblems--attracting and retaining a quality child care workforce. It \nis time to invest in our children by investing in those who dedicate \ntheir lives to caring for our children.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a short summary of the bill \nfollowing my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  the focus act: focus on committed and underpaid staff or children's \n                                sake act\n\n       Background: According to the Department of Labor, the \n     average wage for a child care provider is $8.16 an hour--\n     $16,980 per year. Despite the important role child care \n     providers play in early childhood development and learning, \n     child care providers earn less than bus drivers ($29,430), \n     barbers ($21,190), and janitors ($19,800). The turnover rate \n     in the child care field is high--30 percent. But, to offer \n     compensation to attract and retain high quality staff, child \n     care programs would be required to charge fees that many \n     parents would not be able to afford. Current law \n     reimbursement rates, which are woefully inadequate for \n     center-based and family day care homes already shut out too \n     many parents from the child care market.\n       The FOCUS Act: The purpose of the FOCUS Act is to establish \n     a Child care Provider Retention and development Grant \n     Program, a Child Care Provider Scholarship Program, and to \n     improve access to health coverage by child care workers and \n     their dependents in order to reward and promote retention of \n     committee, quality child care providers.\n       Child Care Provider Retention and Development Grant \n     Program: The FOCUS Act provides grants to states to \n     supplement the\n\n[[Page S7492]]\n\n     wages of full-time child care workers who have a child \n     development associate (CDA) credential by at least $1,000. A \n     child care worker who has a Bachelors Degree in child \n     development or early child education shall receive a grant of \n     at least twice as much as grants made to providers who have \n     an Associates degree in the area of child development or \n     early child education. Grants to providers with an AA degree \n     shall be at least 150 percent of grants made to those with a \n     CDA. States shall provide grants in progressively larger \n     dollar amounts to child care providers to reflect the number \n     of years worked as a child care provider.\n       Child Care Provider Scholarships: The FOCUS Act provides \n     grants to states for child care providers who have been \n     employed for at least a year in the child care field--maximum \n     grant is $1,500, to further staff education and training. \n     FOCUS Act scholarships are not counted against other federal \n     education aid.\n       Health Care Coverage for Child Care Providers: The FOCUS \n     Act provides grants to states to provide better access to \n     health coverage for child care workers. States retain a great \n     deal of flexibility in determining how they will improve \n     access to health care and health coverage by child care \n     providers.\n       Funding: For FY 2004, the FOCUS Act authorizes $500 million \n     for wage and scholarship initiatives and $200 million for \n     health care initiatives. Such sums are authorized for fiscal \n     years 2005-2008.\n       Of the $500 million for wage and scholarship initiatives, \n     67.5 percent is for grants to attract and retain a quality \n     child care workforce and 22.5 percent is for scholarships to \n     promote a child care workforce better educated on childhood \n     development.\n       Set-aside: 3 percent for Indian Tribes and tribal \n     organizations.\n       Funding formula: based on the number of children under age \n     5 and the percentage of children receiving free or reduced \n     price lunches. 90/10 funding 1st year; 85/15 funding 2nd \n     year; 80/20 funding 3rd year; 75/25 funding fourth and \n     subsequent years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1199. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \noutreach activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill help to ensure that all of our veterans know about Federal \nbenefits to which they may be entitled by improving outreach programs \nconducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  I am please to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Arkansas, \nMrs. Lincoln, and the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Three years ago, the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, WDVA, \nlaunched a statewide program called ``I Owe You.'' Under the direction \nof Secretary Ray Boland, the program encourages veterans to apply, or \nto re-apply, for benefits that they earned from their service in the \nUnited States military.\n  As part of this program, WDVA has sponsored six events around \nWisconsin called ``Supermarkets of Veterans Benefits'' at which \nveterans can begin the process of learning whether they qualify for \nFederal benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. These \nevents, which are based on a similar program in Georgia, supplement the \nwork of Wisconsin's County Veterans Service Officers and veterans \nservice organizations by helping our veterans to reconnect with the VA \nand to learn more about services and benefits for which they may be \neligible. More than 11,000 veterans and their families have attended \nthe supermarkets, which include information booths with representatives \nfrom WDVA, VA, and veterans service organizations, as well as a variety \nof Federal, State, and local agencies. I was proud to have members of \nmy staff speak with veterans and their families at a number of these \nevents. These events have helped veterans and their families to learn \nabout numerous topics, including health care, how to file a disability \nclaim, and pre-registration for internment in veterans cemeteries.\n  The Institute for Government Innovation at Harvard University's \nKennedy School of Government recognized the ``I Owe You'' program by \nnaming it a semi-finalist for the 2002 Innovations in American \nGovernment Award. The program was also featured in the March/April 2003 \nissue of Disabled American Veterans Magazine.\n  The State of Wisconsin is performing a service that is clearly the \nobligation of the VA. These are Federal benefits that we owe to our \nveterans and it is the Federal Government's responsibility to make sure \nthat they receive them. The VA has a statutory obligation to perform \noutreach, and current budget pressures should not be used as an excuse \nto halt or reduce these efforts.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today was spurred by the \noverwhelming response to the WDVA's ``I Owe You'' program and the \nsupermarkets of veterans benefits. If more than 11,000 Wisconsin \nveterans are unaware of benefits that may be owed to them, it is \ntroubling to think how many veterans around our country are also \nunaware of them. We can and should do better for our veterans, who \nselflessly served our country and protected the freedoms that we all \ncherish. And it is important to address gaps in the VA's outreach \nprogram as we welcome home and prepare to enroll into the VA system the \ntens of thousands of dedicated military personnel who are serving in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and other places around the globe.\n  In order to help to facilitate consistent implementation of VA's \noutreach responsibilities around the country, my bill would create a \nstatutory definition of the term ``outreach.''\n  My bill also would help to improve outreach activities performed by \nthe VA in three ways. First, it would create separate funding line \nitems for outreach activities within the budgets of the VA and its \nagencies, the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration, and the National Cemetery Administration. Currently \nfunding for outreach is taken from the general operating expenses for \nthese agencies. These important programs should have a dedicated \nfunding source instead of being forced to compete for scarce funding \nwith other crucial VA programs.\n  I have long supported efforts adequately fund VA programs. We can and \nshould do more to provide the funding necessary to ensure that our \nbrave veterans are getting the health care and other benefits that they \nhave earned in a timely manner and without having to travel long \ndistances or wait more than a year to see a doctor or to have a claim \nprocessed.\n  Secondly, the bill would create an intra-agency structure to require \nthe Office of the Secretary, the Office of Public Affairs, the VBA, the \nVHA, and the NCA to coordinate outreach activities. By working more \nclosely together, the VA components would be able to consolidate their \nefforts, share proven outreach mechanisms, and avoid duplication of \neffort that could waste scarce funding.\n  Finally, the bill would ensure that the VA can enter into cooperative \nagreements with State Departments of Veterans Affairs regarding \noutreach activities and would give the VA grant-making authority to \naward funds to State Departments of Veterans Affairs for outreach \nactivities such as the WDVA's ``I Owe You Program.'' Grants that are \nawarded to State departments under this program could be used to \nenhance outreach activities and to improve activities relating to \nveterans claims processing, which is a key component of the VA benefits \nprocess. State departments that receive grants under this program may \nchoose to award portions of their grants to local governments, other \npublic entities, or private or non-profit organizations that engage in \nveterans outreach activities.\n  I am pleased that this bill has the support of a number of national \nand Wisconsin organizations that are committed to improving the lives \nof our Nation's veterans, including: Disabled American Veterans; \nParalyzed Veterans of America; Vietnam Veterans of America; the \nNational Association of County Veterans Service Officers; the National \nAssociation of State Directors of Veterans Affairs; the Wisconsin \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs; the Wisconsin Association of County \nVeterans Service Officers; the Wisconsin Department of Disabled \nAmerican Veterans; the Wisconsin Department of Veterans of Foreign \nWars; the Wisconsin Paralyzed Veterans Association; and the Wisconsin \nState Council, Vietnam Veterans of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7493]]\n\n                                S. 1199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote healthy lifestyles and prevent unhealthy, \nrisky behaviors among teenage youth; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am happy to be joining my \ncolleague Senator Lindsey Graham in introducing the YMCA Healthy Teen \nAct. Senator Graham and I are introducing this bill along with Senators \nBunning, Corzine, Daschle, DeWine, Durbin, Landrieu, Lincoln, Murray, \nRoberts, and Smith. This bipartisan legislation will address a critical \nissue for our Nation's future: the health of our children.\n  Unfortunately, there has been an alarming trend in recent years \ntowards increased obesity in our Nation's youth. On average, America's \nyoung people spend 4 hours a day watching television, 1 and \\1/2\\ hours \na day listening to music, 30 minutes watching videos, and 20 minutes \nplaying video games. Only 13 percent of students walk or bike to \nschool. Only one State, Illinois, requires daily physical education in \nschools. The Surgeon General has reported that 13 percent of children \nand adolescents are overweight, more than double the number who were \noverweight in 1970.\n  We are rapidly becoming a country of the unfit, the inactive, and the \nunhealthy--and our young people are suffering the consequences of a \nsedentary lifestyle. If ignored, obesity in children leads to obesity \nin adulthood--and the numerous health problems that come with it \nincluding diabetes, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease, and cancer. These five diseases alone account for \nmore than two-thirds of all deaths in the United States, and caring for \nthem comes at a tremendous cost to society--close to $117 billion \nannually.\n  On top of the need for increased physical activity and healthier \nlifestyles, the evidence is all around us that our young people today \nalso need some extra care and support. Kids today face challenges and \nobstacles that I never dreamed about when I was growing up in Regent. \nAlthough recent promising evidence show that rates of smoking, drinking \nand the use of illegal drugs among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders fell \nsimultaneously in 2002, still half of all high school seniors have \nreported using illicit drugs at least once in their lifetime.\n  These challenges arise in part from the temptations kids face when \nthey have too much idle time on their own. Every day, millions of \nAmerican teens are left unsupervised after school. Studies have shown \nthat teens left unsupervised during those hours are more likely to \nsmoke, drink alcohol, engage in sexual activity, and become involved in \ndelinquent behavior than teens who participate in structured, \nsupervised afterschool activities. Also, nearly 80 percent of teens who \nare involved in afterschool activities are A or B students, while only \nhalf of those who are not involved earn those grades.\n  To address these crucial issues facing America's youth, I propose we \nturn to an exemplary organization dedicated to improving kids' lives, \nthe YMCA. Nearly 2.4 million teenagers--1 out of every 10--are involved \nin a program offered by their local YMCA. In 2001, total membership \nrolls reached their highest level in history, with 18.3 million men, \nwomen, and children--half of them under 18--receiving a vast range of \nservices from their local YMCAs.\n\n  In the past year and a half, I visited three of the six YMCAs that \nserve\n\n[[Page S7494]]\n\nNorth Dakota teens. Through programs focused on education, healthy \nlifestyles, physical activity, leadership, and service learning, these \nNorth Dakota YMCAs helped 12,500 teens in my State develop character, \nbuild confidence, and become healthier within the last year alone.\n  I have seen firsthand what a difference a safe, structured, and \nhealthy afterschool environment can make for our youth. In those \ncommunities in North Dakota and across the country, the YMCA is a place \nto learn, a place to play sports, a place to meet friends, and a place \nto simply shed the problems that youths face every day in school and at \nhome and just have some fun. North Dakota teens embrace the countless \nopportunities presented to them at their YMCAs with enthusiasm, and I \nhave no doubt they are not alone.\n  While the YMCA is national in scope, they are local in control and \nevery program is designed and evaluated to meet the communities' unique \nneeds. I am confident that this bill will help the YMCA to reach more \nteens and continue to provide successful solutions for our Nation's \nteens and families.\n  To serve more teens in need of healthier lifestyles and safe and \nstructured afterschool programs, the YMCA has set the goal of doubling \nthe number of teens served to one in five teens by 2005. This ambitious \ncampaign is called the Teen Action Agenda.\n  The bill that Senator Graham and I offer today provides funding to \nhelp the YMCA reach teens who need safe and structured activities that \nwill promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles. This piece of \nlegislation authorizes Federal appropriations of $20 million per year \nfor fiscal years 2004 through 2008 for the YMCA to implement its Teen \nAction Agenda. This funding would in turn be distributed to local YMCAs \nthat are located in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. Similar \nlegislation was passed in the 105th Congress for the Boys and Girls \nClub and in the 106th Congress for the Police Athletic League to aid in \ntheir efforts to reach out to youth.\n  Each program funded through this initiative would include physical \nactivity and nutritional education components, and could also focus on \nother health risks faced by teenage youths, such as tobacco, drugs, and \nrisky behaviors that lead to injury and violence.\n  This bill will encourage public-private partnerships and leverage \nadditional funding for teen programs. It contains a matching component \nthat will be met by the YMCA through local and private support. The \nYMCA in 2001 raised $777 million in public contributions, double the \nannual contribution levels of a decade ago, and continues to grow and \ngain support from communities for its work. The matching component, \nalong with the support the YMCA programs receive from national \ncorporate sponsors, will turn $20 million in Federal funds into $50 \nmillion that will be invested in proven programs that serve teens who \nare most in need.\n  Adolescence is an opportune time to instill in children positive \neating habits and exercise routines that will carry over into \nadulthood. The YMCA is an established and proven organization that is \nin the position to reach out and influence thousands of teenagers. This \nlegislation is an opportunity for us to do something for the health of \nour Nation's teenagers, when they now face greater risks and challenges \nthan ever before. Again, for the sake of our children's future, I urge \nmy Senate colleagues to join Senator Graham and me in cosponsoring this \npiece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 1203. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding \ndistance education, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, one of the great benefits of the revolution \nin information technology has been its effect on education. With the \ninformation superhighway and the number of online research and \ninformation sources it has made available, modern technology and higher \neducation have become inseparable.\n  The notion of distance learning and the access it provides to \nstudents--especially those in rural areas--could use a little more \nsupport, however, so that is why I am introducing the Distance Learning \nand Online Education Act of 2003.\n  This legislation builds on principles already found in the Higher \nEducation Act to help reach populations that have traditionally been \nexcluded from attending institutions of higher education.\n  Wyoming is a very rural State. There is only one four year school in \nthe entire State, and there are only seven community colleges. If you \ninclude the University of Wyoming's satellite campuses, that adds up to \nnine institutions of higher education in an area of nearly one hundred \nthousand square miles. By contrast, there are one hundred twenty nine \ninstitutions of higher education in the State of Massachusetts, which \nmakes up an area roughly one tenth the size of Wyoming. In fact, the \nonly State that has fewer institutions of higher education is Alaska.\n  Expanding access to higher education for our rural communities has \nbeen a challenge for many years. Now, the Internet has made it possible \nfor prospective students in rural communities, far removed from the \nuniversity campus, to attend college online. They may now spend their \ntime studying, rather than commuting back and forth between school.\n  At present, the most significant barriers that distance learners and \nonline education programs must face are those that were created by the \nHigher Education Act. Under current law, students attending \ninstitutions that enroll more than half of their students in distance \nprograms are ineligible for Federal student financial assistance. As a \nresult, many of the communities that this assistance is designed to \nreach have been excluded from sharing in its benefits, including \nstudents from rural communities, single mothers, working professionals, \nand a range of others who are interested in attending college but who \ncannot afford to do so.\n  The legislation that I introduce today corrects this problem by \ncreating an avenue for online and distance educators to reach out to \nrural communities and non-traditional students by making them eligible \nfor federal student assistance. It creates an eligibility standard for \nthese institutions that helps to ensure they will provide high quality \neducation programs, while it also protects Federal funding from fraud \nand abuse.\n  The Distance Learning and Online Education Act ensures students will \nreceive a high quality education by requiring online educators to \nbecome accredited by an agency that has an appropriate focus on \ndistance education. As provided under current law, the accrediting body \nmust also be recognized by the Secretary of Education as an agency that \ncan determine the institution's eligibility under Title IV of the \nHigher Education Act. This is a slightly higher standard than is \nexpected of the brick and mortar institutions that have been entrusted \nwith Title IV funding since the Higher Education Act was originally \npassed.\n  My bill will also protect against any fraud and abuse of Title VI \nfunds by requiring distance educators to demonstrate their financial \nresponsibility. In addition to meeting the default rates already \nestablished in current law, institutions interested in becoming \neligible must also have a record free from audit findings or program \nreview findings resulting in significant penalties for a period of at \nleast two years. Distance learning institutions must also show that \nthey have not had their participation in Title IV limited, suspended or \nterminated during the previous five years, and they must create a \nsystem of assurances that the student participating in the program is \nthe individual completing the work.\n  It is clear that the shape of higher education in this country is \nchanging and it will never be the same again. We have an opportunity, \nthrough technology, to reach student populations that have been \nexcluded from participation in higher education because they cannot \nafford to attend or travel to classrooms or campuses located many miles \nfrom their homes. We can change part of the equation by changing the \nway we view those programs that hold the greatest promise for non-\ntraditional students. Making them eligible for federal student \nassistance will go a long way toward making a higher education \navailable to everyone with\n\n[[Page S7495]]\n\nthe interest in learning and the determination to get the job done. The \nDistance Learning and Online Education Act of 2003 will provide a hand \nup--not a hand out--to those whose interest in a higher education is \nlimited only by their resources. By offering them a helping hand we can \neliminate that obstacle and help a new generation achieve their goals \nand live their dreams.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1203\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to recognize the heritage of hunting and provide \nopportunities for continued hunting on Federal public land; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hunting \nHeritage Protection Act. With the introduction of this important \nlegislation, we are able to acknowledge our Nation's rich heritage of \nhunting. The purpose of this bill is to pass that legacy on to future \ngenerations by protecting and preserving the rights of our Nation's \nsportsmen and women.\n  In 2001 over 13 million Americans contributed over $20.6 billion to \nthe U.S. economy while hunting--a true recreational activity. Many \nbelieve that in order to hunt you must own land, but that is not true. \nI believe that hunting should be available as a recreational activity \nfor everyone.\n  I have been an avid outdoor sportsman since my early adulthood. I am \nalso an avid conservationist, like most other hunters. Mr. President, \nrecreational hunting provides many opportunities to spend valuable time \nwith children, just as I do with my son. He has been hunting since he \nwas a young boy where he discovered and learned to appreciate one of \nthe Earth's greatest treasures, nature.\n  Over the years, hunters have contributed billions of dollars to \nwildlife conservation, by purchasing licenses, permits, and stamps, as \nwell as paying excise taxes on goods used by hunters. Since the time of \nPresident Teddy Roosevelt, father of the conservation movement, \nsportsmen and women have been and will continue to be some of the \ngreatest supporters of sound wildlife management and conservation \npractices in the U.S.\n  Hunters need to be recognized for the vital role they play in \nconservation in this country. The Hunting Heritage Protection Act will \ndo just that. This bill formalizes a policy by which the Federal \nGovernment will support, promote, and enhance recreational hunting \nopportunities, as permitted under State and Federal law. Further, the \nbill mandates that Federal public land and water are to be open to \naccess and use for recreational hunting where and when appropriate. I \nshould clarify and stress that this bill does not suggest that we open \nall national parks to hunting. As I mentioned, the goal is simple--I \nwant recreational hunting on our public land to be available to the \ncitizens of this country where and when appropriate.\n  It is crucial that the tradition of hunting is protected and that the \nvaluable contributions that hunters have made to conservation in this \ncountry are recognized. And, we want to ensure that Federal land \nmanagement decisions and their actions result in a `no net loss of \nhunting opportunities'' on our public lands. This bill allows Congress \nto address this issue and to honor our Nation's sportsmen and women.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 1205. A bill to provide discounted housing for teachers and other \nstaff in rural areas of States with a population less than 1,000,000 \nand with a high population of Native Americans or Alaska Natives; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murkowski, I rise to \nintroduce the Rural Teacher Housing Act of 2003.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nhave a profound effect on the retention of good teachers, \nadministrators, and other school staff in remote and rural areas of \nAlaska and in the rest of our Nation.\n  In rural areas of Alaska, school districts face the challenge of \nrecruiting and retaining teachers, administrators and other school \nstaff due to the lack of affordable housing. In one school district, \nthey hire one teacher for every\n\n[[Page S7496]]\n\nsix who decide not to accept job offers. Half of the applicants not \naccepting a teaching position in that district indicated that their \ndecision was related to the lack of housing options.\n  Recently, I traveled throughout rural Alaska with Education Secretary \nRod Paige. I wanted him to see the challenges of educating children in \nsuch a remote and rural environment. At one rural school, the principal \nmust sleep in his office due to the lack of housing in that village. In \nthe same village, there is not enough housing for each teacher to have \ntheir own separate home--several teachers must share a single home. \nTherefore, there is not enough room for the teachers' spouses.\n  Rural Alaskan school districts also experience a high annual rate of \nteacher turnover due to the dearth of affordable housing. Apparently, \nup to 30 percent of teachers leave rural school districts due to \nhousing issues. How can we expect our children to thrive and to meet \nthe mandates of the No Child Left Behind Act in such an educational \nenvironment? Clearly, the lack of affordable teacher housing in rural \nAlaska is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to ensure that \nchildren in rural Alaska receive an educational experience that is \nsecond to none and is also respectful of cultural differences.\n  My bill authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development to \nprovide funds to States to address the shortage of teacher housing in \nrural areas in Alaska and in the rest of our Nation. Specifically, my \nbill provides funds to States that have a population of 1 million or \nfewer people and include qualifying municipalities, which have \npopulations of 6,500 or fewer people and also do not have direct access \nto either a State or interstate highway system. The appropriate state \nhousing authority will accept such funds and will then transfer the \nfunds to an eligible school district in a qualifying municipality. An \neligible school district must be within the boundaries of an Indian \nreservation, one or more Alaska Native villages or land owned by one or \nmore Alaska Native village corporations. This legislation will allow \nthe eligible school districts to address the housing shortage in the \nfollowing ways: construct housing units, purchase and rehabilitate \nexisting housing units, or rehabilitate housing units that are already \nowned by a school district. Once this phase is complete, eligible \nschool districts shall provide the housing to teachers or other school \nstaff under terms agreed upon by the school district and the teacher or \nother staff.\n  It is imperative that we address this important issue immediately and \nallow the flexibility for the disbursement of funds to be handled at \nthe local level. The quality of education of our rural children is at \nstake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 160\n\n       Whereas the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \n     Nations determined that aquaculture is the fastest growing \n     food sector that provides animal protein for citizens of the \n     world;\n       Whereas global aquacultural production (including the \n     production of aquatic plants) has increased at an average \n     rate of 9.2 percent per year since 1970, compared with only \n     1.4 percent for capture fisheries and 2.8 percent for \n     terrestrial-farmed meat production systems;\n       Whereas freshwater aquacultural production increased from \n     15,900,000 metric tons in 1996 to 22,600,000 metric tons in \n     2001, marine aquacultural production increased from \n     10,800,000 metric tons in 1996 to 15,200,000 metric tons in \n     2001, and total aquacultural production increased from \n     26,700,000 metric tons in 1996 to 37,800,000 metric tons in \n     2001;\n       Whereas economic modeling predicts that global annual \n     consumption of fish and shellfish per person will increase \n     over time, from about 16 kilograms today to between 19 and 21 \n     kilograms in 2030, due to increased health consciousness and \n     the stronger demand for seafood products;\n       Whereas the United States imports more than 60 percent of \n     its seafood products, resulting in an annual seafood trade \n     deficit in excess of $7,000,000,000; and\n       Whereas section 7109 of the Farm Security and Rural \n     Investment Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-171; 116 Stat. 436) \n     reauthorized the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 (16 U.S.C. \n     2801 et seq.) until 2007, but did not adequately address \n     emerging national issues\n\n[[Page S7497]]\n\n     such as offshore aquaculture development, water quality \n     concerns, invasive species impacts, and a coordinated siting, \n     permitting, and licensing process: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate calls on the Federal Government \n     to actively pursue a unified approach to strengthen and \n     promote the national policy on aquaculture, including as \n     priorities--\n       (1) ensuring the sustainable development of production \n     where aquaculture is economically viable, environmentally \n     feasible, and culturally acceptable;\n       (2) analyzing the supply and demand for domestic and \n     exported aquacultural products to enable the United States to \n     compete in the global marketplace;\n       (3) increasing the availability of new technical and \n     scientific information that supports aquaculture development;\n       (4) with regard to marine aquaculture, providing \n     encouragement and identification of marine zones favorable to \n     aquaculture that take into consideration desired \n     environmental conditions and potential use conflicts; and\n       (5) establishing a goal of a 5-fold increase in United \n     States aquacultural production by 2025.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution which \ncalls upon the Federal Government to actively pursue a unified approach \nto strengthen our national policy on aquaculture. The United States has \nallowed its seafood trade deficit to reach $7 billion by importing over \n60 percent of its seafood products from foreign countries, a \ndistressing statistic. My resolution calls for immediate action by \nlocal, State, and Federal agencies to cooperatively reduce this seafood \ntrade deficit. The United States must step forward to meet the growing \nconsumer demand for seafood products that are sustainable, economically \nviable, environmentally feasible, and culturally acceptable. In order \nto adequately address the seafood trade deficit, we must promote \naquaculture by committing to a five fold increase in U.S. aquaculture \nproduction by the year 2025.\n  As early as 1878, Congress supported the managed production of fish \nin the wake of a decrease in marine fisheries off the Atlantic Coast. \nAlmost 100 years later, our Nation made important strides to encourage \nU.S. aquaculture by enacting the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 to \ncoordinate all appropriate Federal programs and policies involving \naquaculture. Even though the National Aquaculture Act was reauthorized \nby P.L. 107-171 until the year 2007, the legislation still falls short \nof its goal to ensure coordination and promote a strong aquaculture \nindustry. Producers need improved guidance to clarify and simplify \nregulations pertaining to siting and environmental issues, particularly \nfor the timely development of aquaculture in offshore waters. The level \nof funding for research and development has been very, very low and \ntangible incentives for marine aquaculture have been lacking compared \nto those of the agriculture and fishing industries. Therefore, a new, \nunified Federal policy promoting aquaculture is vitally needed to \ntransform U.S. aquaculture into a major industry.\n  The current trends in aquaculture both worldwide and in the United \nStates necessitate prompt action by the Federal Government. The \ncontribution of aquaculture to global supplies of fish, crustaceans, \nand mollusks is growing by 9.21 percent annually. But aquaculture \nindustries in china, India, Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia have greatly \nsurpassed the United States due in part to less expensive labor, lower \nproperty values, and weaker environmental regulations. In fact, the \ntotal value of aquaculture production is approximately $61 billion \nworldwide; of this, the $0.5 billion U.S. aquaculture industry is far \noutpaced by nations that have a 1 to 28 billion dollar value. Although \nU.S. aquaculture has been considered a minor industry over the years, \nit is rapidly becoming one of the fastest-growing industries and has \nvast, vast potential. The U.S. has two choices. We can either stand by \nand watch our seafood trade deficit grow larger than $7 billion or we \ncan seize this opportunity to promote a strong U.S. aquaculture \nindustry to produce healthier foods and economic benefits for our \ncitizens.\n  U.S. aquaculture development can meet the growing consumer demand for \nquality seafood products and, at the same time, relieve the pressure on \noverfished stocks. More than one billion people currently derive at \nleast 20 percent of their animal protein from fish, and studies have \npredicted that this demand for seafood will only increase over time. \nMeanwhile, half of the world's main fish stocks are fully exploited or \nproducing catches that have reached their maximum sustainable limits. A \nstrong U.S. aquaculture industry will result in a net contribution to \nworldwide food availability, economic growth, and improved living \nstandards.\n\n  In Hawaii, we are at the forefront of U.S. aquaculture through \nsupportive research and production efforts for marine aquaculture. \nHawaii first harvested offshore aquaculture products from sea cages in \n1999 and the State awarded its first commercial lease for offshore \naquaculture in State waters in the year 2001. The aquaculture \ntechnologies developed in Hawaii with high environmental standards can \nhelp lead the world in economically and environmentally sound \naquaculture practices.\n  The U.S. needs to invest in our aquaculture industry today. This \nresolution recognizes the importance of aquaculture and calls for a \ncoherent national approach to provide appropriate guidance for a \nsustainable aquaculture industry in different regions of the United \nStates. This coherent, comprehensive strategy will contribute to \nworldwide food availability while providing much-needed economic growth \nwithin the United States.

The son of Russian immigrants, Al Lerner had an amazing \nsense of patriotism and was so proud to accept the Ellis Island Medal \nin honor of his immigrant heritage and individual achievements in 2002.\n  My personal relationship with Al developed because of the fondness we \nshared for the city of Cleveland, and Cleveland is a better place \nbecause of Al Lerner. His generosity was seen in well known ways such \nas his contributions to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, where \nthe Lerner Research Institute was founded, and to the Cleveland Clinic. \nIn fact, Al Lerner's $100,000,000 contribution to the Cleveland Clinic \nwas one of the largest donations to academic medicine in the history of \nthe United States. Al gave so much of himself to these institutions, \nserving as president and trustee of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and \nestablishing the Lerner Research Institute at the Clinic to conduct \nresearch of new treatments for cancer, coronary artery disease and \nAIDS.\n  Al Lerner also understood how important professional football is to \nthe city of Cleveland, and due in large part to his business savvy, \nLerner and his partner, Carmen Policy, were able to reestablish a \nfootball team in Cleveland. He was subsequently appointed chairman of \nthe National Football League Finance Committee, and I am confident that \nthe Cleveland Browns' 2002 playoff appearance, just 4 years after \nreturning to the league, had a great deal to do with Al's leadership\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\nand guidance. I am not sure Cleveland would have its Browns today \nwithout Al Lerner's dedication and determination.\n  Despite his amazing success as the founder, chairman, and chief \nexecutive of MBNA Corporation, Al Lerner remained grounded. He helped \nraise funds through the company and the Cleveland Browns, for the \n``Cleveland Brown Hero Fund'' to aid families from the New York City \nFire and Police Departments who suffered the loss of a parent in the \ntragic September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Al also answered \nPresident Bush's call in the aftermath of September 11, and was a \nmember of the President's Foreign Advisory Board.\n  Throughout his lifetime, many of Al's other achievements could also \nbe observed in quieter ways that were never heralded. His dedication to \nhis family was remarkable. He married his high school sweetheart and \nbest friend, Norma. They shared 47 glorious years together and raised \ntwo children, Randy and Nancy. My wife Janet and I talked often about \nhow Al and Norma seemed to love each other and genuinely enjoyed each \nother's company. Perhaps the greatest contribution that the two of them \nmade was the strong example of a good marriage for their children, \nseven grandchildren, and anyone who know Al and Norma Lerner.\n  I am honored to have known and worked with Al Lerner and am confident \nthat his legacy will remain an example of hard work, philanthropy, and \ngenuine kindness for generations to come.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 116) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 116), with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 116\n\n       Whereas Alfred Lerner (``Al'' to those who knew him best) \n     was a successful, humble, compassionate, and well respected \n     member of his family and community whose life was devoted to \n     civic involvement and efforts to improve the quality of \n     education and health care available to his fellow citizens;\n       Whereas Al Lerner was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1933, \n     graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1951, and \n     received a B.A. from Columbia College in 1955;\n       Whereas Al Lerner was a Marine Corps officer and pilot from \n     1955 through 1957, displaying his love of country by wearing \n     his Marine Corps cap long after finishing his tour of duty, \n     and later was a director of the Marine Corps Law Enforcement \n     Foundation;\n       Whereas Al Lerner was the son of Russian immigrants, and in \n     2002 received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, which \n     celebrates immigrant heritage and individual achievements;\n       Whereas Al Lerner and his high school sweetheart, best \n     friend, and partner in life, Norma Lerner, shared 47 years of \n     marriage and were deeply committed to their 2 children, Randy \n     and Nancy;\n       Whereas Al and Norma Lerner made extremely generous \n     contributions to local and national charities, including a \n     contribution of $10,000,000 in 1993 to Rainbow Babies and \n     Children's Hospital in Cleveland, a donation of $16,000,000 \n     to support construction of the Lerner Research Institute, and \n     a donation of $100,000,000 to the Cleveland Clinic--one of \n     the largest donations to academic medicine in the history of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Al Lerner served as president and trustee of the \n     Cleveland Clinic Foundation where the Lerner Research \n     Institute was established to conduct research of new \n     treatments for cancer, coronary artery disease, and AIDS;\n       Whereas Al Lerner, along with his business partner Carmen \n     Policy, reestablished a National Football League team in \n     Northern Ohio when he purchased the expansion Cleveland \n     Browns football organization in 1998, worked hard to make the \n     people of Cleveland and Northern Ohio proud of their football \n     team, and was subsequently appointed chairman of the National \n     Football League Finance Committee;\n       Whereas the Cleveland Browns, on the strength of Al \n     Lerner's leadership, reached the National Football League \n     playoffs following the 2002 season, only 4 years after \n     returning to the league;\n       Whereas Al Lerner served as founder, chairman, and chief \n     executive of MBNA Corporation, which employs thousands of \n     people in Ohio and is the Nation's largest issuer of \n     independent credit cards;\n       Whereas Al Lerner served as vice chairman, trustee, and \n     benefactor of Columbia College, which is now known as \n     Columbia University, and also served as a trustee for Case \n     Western Reserve University and New York Presbyterian \n     Hospital;\n       Whereas Al Lerner helped raise funds, through his \n     affiliation with MBNA and the Cleveland Browns, for the \n     ``Cleveland Browns Hero Fund'' to aid families from the New \n     York City Fire and Police Departments who suffered the loss \n     of a parent in the tragic September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks;\n       Whereas Al Lerner was appointed in 2001 by President Bush \n     as 1 of 15 members of the President's Foreign Intelligence \n     Advisory Board, which advises the President concerning the \n     quality and adequacy of intelligence collection, intelligence \n     analysis and estimates, counter-intelligence, and other \n     intelligence activities;\n       Whereas Al Lerner is survived by his wife, partner, and \n     best friend, Norma, their son Randy, their daughter Nancy, \n     and 7 grandchildren; and\n       Whereas Al Lerner passed away on October 23, 2002, and the \n     contributions he made to his family, his community, and his \n     Nation will not be forgotten: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the life, achievements, and contributions of \n     Alfred Lerner; and\n       (2) extends its deepest sympathies to the family of Alfred \n     Lerner for the loss of a great and generous man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/05/senate-section/article/S7508-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7508-S7509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COMMENDING CLEMSON UNIVERSITY TIGERS MEN'S GOLF TEAM\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.
