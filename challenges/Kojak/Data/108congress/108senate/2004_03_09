Mr. President, I am wondering if a decision has been made \nas to what we are going to do tonight at 7 o'clock or thereabouts. As \nthe leader knows, we have the Archives dinner. In fact, it will be the \nlast dinner that will ever be held in the Rotunda, for a number of \nreasons. That is going to be tonight. It is a bipartisan dinner. I \nwonder if a decision has been made yet as to what is going to be done, \nwhether we are going to stay in session or whether there will be time \nyielded off the resolution during the time we are there.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nevada, the \nplan will be to stay in session, unless we can reach an agreement to \nyield back time.\n  Mr. REID. I would also ask, through the Chair to the distinguished \nwhip, has there been a decision made as to what we are going to do \nduring the normal recess we take on Tuesdays for party caucuses?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think, at the risk of being redundant, our plan \nwould be, if we could get an agreement to equally yield back time, we \nwould recess for those lunches; otherwise, we would try to press \nthrough.\n  Mr. REID. So there can be some planning, I wonder if the two managers \nhave any objection to having that done as it relates to the noontime \nrecess we normally take on Tuesdays, with that time equally divided.\n\n[[Page S2378]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think we should see how the morning goes \nbefore we make that decision.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself time on the concurrent resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has that right.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate has a full agenda of \nbusiness this session. To give the American people a full year's worth \nof work, I had hoped the politics of the election this fall would maybe \nwait at least until some of the leaves had sprouted on the trees late \nthis spring.\n  Sadly, that is not the case. We see the one thing in full bloom in \nWashington, DC, right now is all politics, all the time. The most \nrepeated political saw can be summed up by quoting Charles Dickens. We \nare told today in America: It is the best of times, and it is the worst \nof times. It is the best of times for some, and the worst of times for \nothers. We are not one nation, indivisible, but two Americas, they \nsay--two Americas.\n  What are we? Are we staring into painful reality or are we just \nhearing political spin?\n  Well, Mr. President, I would like to think of myself as a fair \nperson. So I think we should let the facts themselves do the speaking.\n  Fact No. 1: To say it is the best of times and the worst of times at \nthe same time is simply political spin. It is spin to say the same fact \ncan be good in one place at one time but bad in another place at \nanother time. Yet many of our colleagues insist on that very twist, \nthat very twist of logic.\n  So let's look at the unemployment number, for example. When the \nunemployment rate dropped to 5.6 percent back in 1996--5.6 percent back \nin 1996--the Senate Democratic leader, our friend, Senator Daschle, \nsaid:\n\n       The economy is doing extraordinarily well. Extraordinarily \n     well.\n       We have the lowest rate of inflation and unemployment we've \n     had in 27 years.\n\n  That is when the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent in 1996.\n  At the same time, President Clinton was saying:\n\n       I was gratified to hear our partners praise the strength of \n     the economy. . . . Lower interest rates have helped us slash \n     unemployment to 5.6 percent.\n\n  That was President Clinton in June of 1996.\n  So, in 1996, 5.6-percent unemployment was viewed by our friends on \nthe other side as good news and a healthy economy.\n  Today, we have 5.6-percent unemployment under President Bush--the \nvery same unemployment figure, a different President. Today our good \nfriend, Senator Daschle, says:\n\n       President Bush suggested that the current unemployment rate \n     of 5.6 percent was a good number. Well, I was a little \n     surprised at that. I'm not certain I would agree that it's a \n     good number.\n\n  In 1996, under a Democratic President, 5.6 percent was considered a \ngood number; 5.6 percent today under a Republican President is not \nconsidered a good number.\n  Our friend Senator Clinton from New York says about the 5.6 percent \ntoday:\n\n       This Administration refuses on so many fronts to accept the \n     obvious and in this instance it is obvious the economy is not \n     creating jobs.\n\n  President Clinton, when unemployment was at 5.6 percent, was praising \nthe healthy economy. Senator Clinton, when the unemployment rate is at \n5.6 percent, says the economy is not very good.\n  It is difficult to understand how this same 5.6 percent jobless rate \nback in 1996 can be considered indicative of a healthy economy and \ntoday not be so considered. So a 5.6 percent jobless rate was the best \nof times under President Clinton and now it is the worst of times under \nPresident Bush. It's the best of times under President Clinton, worst \nof times under President Bush. This is spin. That is all it is. How can \nat one time 5.6 percent be considered the sign of a healthy economy and \nat other times not?\n  We see the same kind of spin on policy. Under the previous \nadministration and when the House and Senate were controlled by our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, temporary unemployment \ncompensation benefits were allowed to expire at 6.4 percent \nunemployment. Again, temporary jobless benefits expired when the \njobless rate was at 6.4 percent and not a word of complaint was heard \nfrom our friends on the other side of the aisle in 1994. It was the \nbest policy back in 1994 to allow temporary unemployment to expire at \n6.4 percent. That was the policy back then. Now 10 years later, when \nthe same temporary unemployment compensation benefit expired because \nthe unemployment rate is at 5.6 percent, the same policy under a better \neconomy is called an outrageous act.\n  So the very same decision made under a Republican President is the \nworst policy. Under a Democratic President, it is the best policy. It \nmakes no sense. Why would it be good policy to let the temporary \nunemployment policy expire at 6.4 percent under a Democratic President \nand not be a good policy at 5.6 percent under a Republican President? \nWhat can we conclude from all of that? It is political spin. That is \nwhat it is--political spin.\n  Letting temporary jobless benefits expire at a 6.4 percent jobless \nrate under President Clinton and a Democratic Congress is the best \npolicy, but letting the same benefits expire at a 5.6 percent jobless \nrate under President Bush and a Republican Congress is the worst \npolicy. It is all Washington spin.\n  But it is not just the number or policy that gets spun around; it is \nalso the words. Let's look at the much discussed term ``outsourcing.'' \nThe term ``outsourcing'' has become a lightning rod. When an economic \nadvisor to President Bush discussed the outsourcing of jobs, amendments \nwere offered, strong condemnations were delivered, and heads were \nsupposed to roll. When the former President's Secretary of Labor \nclaimed, in a Washington Post op-ed on November 2, 2003 that high tech \njobs are going abroad but that is OK, not a peep was heard about the \nformer Secretary of Labor's writing.\n  This is Secretary Robert Reich, November of this past year. Headline: \n``High Tech Jobs Are Going Abroad! But That's Okay.'' This is the \nDemocratic Secretary of Labor. Again we see the same words as the worst \nidea by a Bush advisor but a great idea by a Clinton advisor.\n\n  Confused? It is just more Washington spin. When the outsourcing issue \nwas discussed by a Bush advisor, it was considered the worst advice. \nWhen the same thing was said by a former Clinton Labor adviser, it was \nconsidered good advice.\n  What can you conclude from all of this? Just Washington spin. The \nwhole issue of outsourcing shows how things are spinning out of \ncontrol. After all, Robert Reich, the former Democratic Labor \nSecretary, is Senator Kerry's top labor adviser and a member of his \nsteering committee. It says so right on his Web site. Perhaps most \namazing is their campaign road show announcement on outsourcing that \ncharges President Bush continues to send jobs overseas. But in the very \nnext sentence they announce the participation of Robert Reich in these \nroad shows.\n  This is the same Robert Reich who said high tech jobs are going \nabroad, but that is OK; the same Robert Reich who says he doesn't \nbelieve the outsourcing of jobs is something to lose sleep over; the \nsame Robert Reich who says it makes no sense for us to try to protect \nand preserve high tech jobs or block efforts by American companies to \noutsource; the same Robert Reich, the top labor adviser to Senator \nKerry, who is at political events across the country to bash Bush for \nhis adviser's views on outsourcing.\n  If this doesn't leave you dizzy, nothing will. Why all the spin? Why \nis this word acceptable by one speaker but an outrage when uttered by \nanother? Why is policy fine one day but a horror the next? Why is the \nnumber applauded one day but the same number condemned the next? \nConfused? That is what you get in a political year.\n  The sky-is-falling crowd seems to be spinning the wheel of misfortune \nhoping to hit the political jackpot this fall. And to win this fall, \nthey must say the sky is falling this spring. They must put the worst \npossible spin, the worst possible light on our current economic \nsituation.\n  Opponents claim we have had the greatest job loss since the Great \nDepression. How many times have we heard that, the greatest job loss \nsince the Great Depression? That was a time when one out of four \nAmericans was\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\njobless. Today we have 138.5 million jobs and growing in the United \nStates. Comparing our economic situation today to the Great Depression \nis utter nonsense. In the Depression, one out of four Americans was \nunemployed. Today there are 138.5 million jobs and growing. Close to 95 \npercent of Americans who want a job are employed. The sky-is-falling \ncrowd says this is the worst number in almost a century.\n  So the political season is here. Facts don't matter; up is down; left \nis right; the best is worst, and vice versa. To be sure, the economy is \nnot perfect. As long as someone wants a job and can't find one, we are \nnot going to rest. But let's be honest. If a 5.6 percent unemployment \nrate was good 8 years ago, then a fair person would have to say it is \nnot so bad now. But we haven't heard that, nor will we hear that. \nInstead we are told we are in a jobless Armageddon. Why? Because this \nis an election year and that is just the way the world spins.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky makes a very \npersuasive case about how up is down, right is left, that the other \nside is doing an incredibly masterful job of trying to spin the \neconomy.\n  I want him to comment on something that has concerned me. Over the \nlast 7, 8 months we have seen and heard talk about how bad the economy \nis, how difficult. I want him to recall from 3 years ago the discussion \nin the Senate. I want to see if the Senator from Kentucky sees what was \nclaimed at that time by Senator Conrad and others as potentially \noccurring again in the year 2004.\n  Senator Conrad said in March of 2001, almost 3 years ago to this \ndate:\n\n       I don't think there's any question but the President is \n     talking down the economy, and the Vice President has hurt \n     confidence. . . . It hurts the economy because it puts doubt \n     in people's minds about the underlying strength of the \n     American economy. And any economy is in part based on \n     confidence. So when the Vice President was talking about \n     recession back in December, that set off a string of \n     newspaper headlines--\n\n  By the way, the newspaper headlines: ``Support for Bush Falls on \nEconomy . . . '' after a whole day of speeches on the part of Democrats \nbelittling this economy.\n  It says:\n\n       Newspaper headlines led to a string of additional emphasis \n     on the negative. When you consistently emphasize the \n     negative, you contribute to a climate that loses and lacks \n     confidence.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Kentucky, does he think over \nthe last 7 or 8 months Democrats railing on the negative aspects of \nthis economy has hurt economic growth and, in fact, may have caused \npeople to lose their jobs as a result?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There is no question, I say to my friend from \nPennsylvania, there has been a concerted, coordinated effort to cause \nAmericans to lose confidence in an economy that is, by all standards, \nrolling. You cannot find a category that is not heading in the right \ndirection.\n  As I pointed out, a mere 8 years ago colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle were cheering for an economy of 5.6 percent unemployment, \nsaying that was terrific. Today they act as if we are in the Great \nDepression.\n  I say my friend is right on the mark. There has been a coordinated, \nconcerted, consistent effort over the last 4, 5 months to talk the \nAmerican people into believing the economy is not heading in the right \ndirection.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask, when the administration in March of 2001 was \ntalking about their concerns about the economy, does the Senator from \nKentucky recall whether the economy was growing in January and February \nand March of 2001?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It was clearly not growing. They were stating the \nobvious.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In fact, I believe that quarter of 2001 in which the \nVice President and the President were talking about their concerns with \nthe economy was, in fact, the first quarter of a recession that was \nactually in place at the time; correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So what they were doing was reflecting the reality of \nan economy that was in trouble when they took office.\n  I just want to, again--Senator Conrad is here. I don't want to pick \nhim out as being the only one who was accusing the President and Vice \nPresident of talking down the economy because Senator Daschle was doing \nthe same thing:\n\n       I think we're talking down the economy, and in talking down \n     the economy, I think we're beginning to see the results in \n     the market. The Bush administration has been talking down the \n     economy now for some time . . . but look at what's happened.\n\n  I say to the Senator from Kentucky, at the time the administration \nwas ``talking down the economy,'' the economy was, in fact, in trouble. \nAt the time the Democrats are talking down this economy, is this \neconomy in the same shape it was in January, February, and March of \n2001?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No, this economy is rolling, and virtually every \ncategory by which one can measure the direction in which the economy is \ngoing is heading in the right direction--in some cases dramatically in \nthe right direction. Even the unemployment figure, which they want to \nharp on, is the same unemployment figure they were praising a mere 8 \nyears ago--praising as the best of times. Today it is the worst of \ntimes, and the only thing that is different is there is a different \nPresident in the White House.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So basically the contrast about who is talking up or \ntalking down the economy, which is my point, is the Bush administration \nwas reflecting the reality of what was going on in trying to be honest \nwith the American public as to the state of the economy at the time, \nand what is going on now, as you have clearly illustrated, is the \neconomy is on an upswing and we have a group of people who are trying \nto drive that economy back down where we hoped, we thought all of us \ndid not want it to be?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his question. \nIt is pretty obvious the facts illustrate the economy is rolling, it is \nmoving dramatically in the right direction, and even though \nunemployment is higher than we would like it to be, it is the same \nfigure as a mere 8 years ago when our friends on the other side of the \naisle were cheering the healthy economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have been interested to listen to this \nearly morning repartee on the other side about what the status of the \neconomy is and what the status of the job market is. I do not think it \nis a matter of spin to talk about what the facts are, and the facts are \nreally very clear with respect to this President and what has happened \nto the job market under this President.\n  When people say this is the first President to have lost private \nsector jobs since Herbert Hoover, that is a fact. Nobody is saying, as \nthe Senator from Kentucky represented, the Bush record on the economy \nis the same as the Herbert Hoover record on the economy. That is not \nwhat anybody has said here. The Senator from Kentucky has not been \nhere; perhaps he missed what has been said.\n  What has been said is the simple fact that this administration is the \nfirst administration since Herbert Hoover to lose private sector jobs. \nIn every other administration--Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, \nJohnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, the first President Bush, \nPresident Clinton--there has been in every one of those administrations \ngrowth in the private sector job market.\n  Under President Bush, we have seen a loss of private sector jobs. The \nlast time that was true was in the administration of Herbert Hoover. \nThat is a fact. That is not talking down the economy. It is a fact.\n  The second fact is this recovery is very different from every other \nrecovery from recession since World War II. That also is a fact.\n  If we look at the average of the nine recessions since World War II, \nwhat we see is, after 17 months, after the business cycle peaked, we \nstart to see substantial job recovery. That has been the pattern of the \nnine recessions we have had since World War II.\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\n  Look what is happening in this recovery. Here we are 36 months past \nthe peak of the business cycle, and still we are not getting job \nrecovery. Something is wrong. If we want to be serious about figuring \nout how to solve the problem, we first have to diagnose it correctly. \nWe are 5.4 million jobs short of the typical recovery in the nine \nrecessions since World War II. Something is wrong.\n  Private sector jobs have declined. We have seen 3 million jobs lost \nsince January of 2001. That is not talking down the economy. That is a \nfact, I say to my friend. It is a fact. If we are going to diagnose \nwhat is going wrong here, we have to figure out how is this different \nfrom what we have seen previously. I think any objective observer \nlooking will have to conclude this is something dramatically different.\n  The Chairman of this President's Council of Economic Advisers, in a \nbriefing on the 2004 Economic Report of the President, which was issued \njust last month, said:\n\n       [W]e expect sort of on average jobs in 2004 to be 2.6 \n     million more than the jobs in 2003.\n\n  That was this administration's projection a month ago. For that \nprojection to come true, there would have to be 520,000 jobs created in \nevery month from now to the third quarter of this year.\n  Look what happened in February. There were not 520,000 jobs created. \nThere were not 420,000 jobs created. There were not 320,000 jobs \ncreated. There were not 120,000 jobs created. There were 21,000 jobs \ncreated in February. That is 500,000 jobs short of the monthly totals \nthis administration will need to meet its projection.\n  Every one of these jobs that was created was a Government job. There \nwere no jobs created in the private sector. Something is wrong.\n  When we report to the American people on the status of the economy, \nthere is a dramatic difference between what was occurring during the \nClinton years--remember, during the Clinton Presidency, 22 million jobs \nwere created. This President has lost 3 million jobs. In the Clinton \nadministration, there were 22 million jobs created in the private \nsector.\n  If we look at this current recovery, one of the things we see is that \nwe have the longest average duration of unemployment in over 20 years. \nIn other words, when somebody loses their job, it is taking them longer \nto find a new job than at any time in 20 years. Now, that is \ndramatically different than what occurred during the Clinton \nadministration. During the Clinton administration, there was very \npowerful job creation. In fact, there was not only powerful job \ncreation but the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history.\n  In addition to that, we had the lowest unemployment in 30 years, the \nlowest inflation in 30 years, the highest level of business investment \nin our Nation's history, and record deficits were turned to record \nsurpluses. That is the economic record during the Clinton \nadministration. So if that is what they want to debate, we would be \ndelighted to join in the discussion. We would be delighted to talk \nabout the difference between the economic performance during the \nClinton years and the Bush years.\n  This is just one indication, the longest average duration of \nunemployment in over 20 years. That is what is happening in this Bush \nadministration. Something is wrong.\n  When we go further and look at the number of people employed, the \nSenator from Kentucky said we have over 100 million people employed--I \ndo not remember the exact number he used but I am sure he was accurate \nin his number--but if we look at it in a different way, we see the \nsmallest share of the population at work since 1994; 62.2 percent of \nthe American people are employed. That is the lowest level in a decade.\n  Again, it is just a fact. If we are going to analyze what is \nhappening in this economy, we have to diagnose what is happening. To \ndiagnose what is happening, we have to describe accurately what is \noccurring.\n  We also look at real wages. I asked my staff to find out for me what \nhas happened to real wages in this country during this administration. \nWe went back to 1996--we probably should have gone back even further--\nand look what happened in 1996 to 2000, the last term of the Clinton \nadministration. We saw a dramatic growth in weekly wages. Since that \ntime, they have basically stagnated. Real wages are up less than $8 a \nweek in this administration.\n  If we are interested in public opinion, which I think we all are--the \nSenator from Kentucky talked about public opinion--consumers believe \njobs are hard to get. Eighty-eight percent believe jobs are not \nplentiful or are hard to get. Only 12 percent believe jobs are \nplentiful. So this is not just a matter of opinion on the Senate floor. \nThe American people are saying jobs are hard to get. They are saying \njobs are scarce.\n\n  This is another look at what is happening in the job market. We see \nthat wage growth of production workers is starting to fall behind \ninflation. Again, we went back to the beginning of this administration. \nThe red line is consumer prices. The green line is average hourly \nearnings. We can see now for the first time the lines crossing. So wage \nincreases are not keeping pace with inflation. That is putting pressure \non people. That is why I think we see this strong concern all across \nthe country. People are worried about what is happening in this \neconomy.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to my distinguished friend, the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, I listened to the statement of \nthe distinguished Senator from Kentucky and the questions asked by my \nfriend from Pennsylvania. One thing the debate this morning has not \ntouched upon, and I would like to hear the Senator from North Dakota \nexplain a little bit, when this administration came into power there \nwas a huge surplus over a 10-year period. It is my understanding that \nis gone and we are going to have record deficits as far as the eye can \nsee. Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is a fair statement.\n  Mr. REID. A final question, as part of that, do deficits matter?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, let's first talk about what is happening with \ndeficits under this administration. Over the next 5 years, under the \nPresident's plan, the debt of the United States will increase by $3 \ntrillion. Now let's think about that. That is an average of $600 \nbillion a year of increased debt.\n  The President says he is going to cut the deficit in half over the \nnext 5 years, but he only gets that by leaving out things. For example, \nhe leaves out any war cost past September 30 of this year. He says \nthere is no cost of the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, the war on \nterror, past September 30 of this year. Does anybody believe that?\n  When we ask his people about it, they say, well, it is hard to \npredict what the cost will be. Well, we would agree with that, it is \nhard to predict. The right answer is not zero. The right answer is \nthere is not going to be no cost. The Congressional Budget Office tells \nus the cost is going to be $280 billion. Yet the President has nothing \nin his budget.\n  It does not stop there. If one looks at the cost of the President's \nproposed tax cuts, what one sees is that in the first 5 years they are \nrelatively modest, but the cost of those tax cuts explode in the second \n5 years. It does not end there. The alternative minimum tax, which is \ngoing to cost some $600 billion to fix, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office--my colleagues will remember the alternative minimum tax \nwas designed to catch millionaires. It was put in place back in the \n1980s, but it has not been adjusted. The result is, more and more \nmiddle-income people are being sucked into the alternative minimum tax. \nThere are about 3 million people affected now. By the end of this \ndecade, 40 million people will be affected.\n  In his budget, the President provides 1 year of the cost of fixing \nthe alternative minimum tax. He lets the rest of it go, which is \nwriting in a tax increase beyond the first year, and it will be a tax \nincrease increasingly on the middle class.\n  It does not end there. The biggest thing the President is proposing, \nin terms of how he finances these massive deficits and debt, is to \nborrow money. The President is fond of saying it is the people's money, \nand he is exactly right, it is the people's money. It is also the \npeople's debt.\n\n[[Page S2381]]\n\n  How is he financing these enormous deficits and debt? First, he is \nborrowing every penny of the Social Security surplus over the next 10 \nyears, every dime, $2.4 trillion, money that is really not in surplus \nat all because it is going to be needed when the baby boomers retire.\n  So the President is really not showing the American people how \nserious our fiscal condition is. When he says he is going to cut the \ndeficit in half, he says the deficit in the fifth year will be $237 \nbillion, but if we add back all of the things he has just left out, \nwhat we find is the debt of the country will actually increase by over \n$600 billion in that fifth year. All of this is right before the baby \nboomers retire.\n\n  So on the question of do deficits matter, certainly deficits matter. \nThe trade deficit matters. That is running nearly $500 billion a year. \nThe budget deficit matters. That is going to run nearly $500 billion \nthis year. Why does it matter? Deficits matter because when the \nGovernment spends more than it takes in, it has to borrow the money. \nWhen the Government borrows money, it is in competition with others to \nborrow money.\n  In this society, we have over $20 trillion of debt--government debt, \nFederal Government debt, State and local government debt, corporate \ndebt, private debt--$20 trillion. When the Government has to go borrow \nmoney in competition with the private sector, most economists would \nargue that puts upward pressure on interest rates. When you have $20 \ntrillion in debt in an economy, a 1-percent change in interest rates \ncosts you $200 billion.\n  I can remember very well when Lloyd Bentsen was Secretary of the \nTreasury, he called me to lunch one day down at the Treasury \nDepartment. I walked in and sat down.\n  He said: Kent, you probably wondered why I asked you here today.\n  I said: Yes, I did wonder.\n  He said: I wanted to share with you because now you are on the \nFinance Committee, you have my seat on the Finance Committee, something \nthat is very important to remember when you are dealing with the \neconomics of the country; that is, when you look at the debt of the \ncountry in all forms--government debt, corporate debt, individual \ndebt--and you look at a change in interest rates, you come to \nunderstand how critically important it is to manage this economy in a \nway that keeps pressure off of interest rates. That means it is \ncritically important to hold down deficits and to hold down debt \nbecause that will keep pressure off of interest rates. If you hold down \npressure on interest rates, you are giving more lift to the economy \nthan anything you can do on the tax cut side of the ledger. It is so \npowerful, the difference 1 percent makes in interest rates in this \nsociety because of all the debt there is.\n  It is a lesson I have never forgotten. I don't think any of us should \nforget it. That is why deficits matter.\n  Some will say interest rates are at very low levels now. Indeed they \nare. In fact, one of the reasons we have seen the economy resume growth \nis because interest rates are at a 40-year low, even though we have \nthese massive deficits. How can it be? How can interest rates be at a \n40-year low when we have these massive deficits? It is because right \nnow there is very little competition for money from the private sector \nbecause the economy has been weak. As the economy resumes growth, as it \nhas, we will see upward pressure on interest rates. That is something \nwe have to keep in mind as we fashion Federal policy on the budget.\n  We have the ability in the Senate, the Congress and the President, to \ninfluence the fiscal policy of the country. There are two things that \ncontribute and affect the economy. One is fiscal policy, spending and \nrevenue decisions that are made here and in the House of \nRepresentatives and by the President. The other aspect of Government \npolicy that affects the economy is monetary policy.\n  The monetary policy is guided by the Federal Reserve. The Federal \nReserve has put in place a very accommodative economic policy, the \nlowest interest rates in 40 years. It is a key reason for this economic \nrecovery. But that is jeopardized, it is threatened if interest rates \nare forced up.\n  What might force them to go up? As we see economic recovery, as we \nsee the private sector borrowing more money to build and expand their \nbusinesses, and the Federal Government is also borrowing these record \namounts of money, that will put upward pressure on interest rates. That \nwill threaten long-term economic growth and recovery. That is why \ndeficits matter.\n  Does the Senator from Pennsylvania seek time? I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will pick up where the Senator from \nNorth Dakota left off. I suggest historically the lesson we learn from \nthe conversation he had with Lloyd Bentsen: Lloyd Bentsen was wrong. \nThe bottom line is there are a lot of other factors that go into the \ncalculation of interest rates other than the deficit. That is obvious \nfrom the fact that we have a relatively high deficit right now and \ninterest rates remain low.\n  It is a very complex economy. I think the idea we are going to focus \nin on one thing or another that is going to create jobs or not create \njobs is folly. What we need to do is try to put a grand strategy \ntogether, including keeping inflation low, working to keep interest \nrates low, keeping tax rates low, trying to reduce litigation costs, \ntrying to reduce the costs of regulation. All of those are a complex \nseries of factors, and there are a whole lot of others, frankly, beyond \nthe control of the Senate that we need to look at as to creating an \nenvironment in which jobs can be created and wealth can be created.\n  Our job in the Senate comes down to a few simple things. We have been \ndebating this year trying to reduce the cost of litigation. This side \nof the aisle, generally speaking, has been on the side of reducing that \ntransaction cost to the economy, and it is a huge cost to this economy. \nWe have a couple of other bills coming up such as asbestos litigation \nthat I am hopeful will be scheduled in the next couple of months so we \nwill get a date certain to have a vote in the Senate. I would argue we \ncan do more to help the manufacturing economy in this country by taking \naway the burden of asbestos litigation which is crippling dozens upon \ndozens of large manufacturers who employ hundreds of thousands of \npeople who make this economy go. It is crippling them, having to defend \ntens of thousands of lawsuits. Most of them are frivolous. Most are \nfiled by people who are not sick. They are filed by lawyers who are \nlooking for big fees and big settlements and tying up enormous \nresources and clogging up our courts.\n  We have an opportunity to solve that problem and, more importantly, \nget the money to the people who are truly sick and injured as a result \nof exposure to asbestos. We have an opportunity to do that right here. \nIf you want to help the manufacturing economy, if you want to create \nbetter jobs, if you want to loosen up the burden of frivolous lawsuits \non a whole sector of our society, the manufacturing economy, let's pass \nthis asbestos litigation. I don't hear any of you talking about that.\n  How about class action reform? That is another abuse of the legal \nprocess by a handful of trial lawyers who, again, put together these \nmassive suits, with people getting very little benefit except, of \ncourse, the lawyers who are suing on ``behalf'' of this class of \npeople. We have an opportunity to do something there that will \ndramatically help this economy, help the manufacturing economy, help \nthe economy in general. So the idea there is just one aspect we need to \nfocus on is false. There are a lot of things we can do in the Senate.\n  I can tell you another aspect we need to focus on in the Senate, and \nthat is spending. There is a big concern in our markets today, in the \neconomy today, about the appetite for spending in Washington, DC, and \nthe potential impact that will have on our economy because it will lead \nto further spending. Growing the Government will lead to higher \ndeficits and, as we will see over the next 4 days, calls to increase \ntaxes to pay for more Government spending. What do increased taxes \nmean? That means less money in the private sector out there creating \njobs and more money in Washington--well, maybe creating a few jobs in \ntown.\n  So the idea of more spending and higher taxes is what the Senate is \ngoing to be dealing with in the next few days. That is an important \ntopic to discuss, and one that will have profound consequences on this \neconomy--\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\nbeyond the talking down of the economy that I illustrated before that \nhas been going on for months during the Democratic primary, and the \nchorus in the Senate talking about how terrible things are. To pull out \na chart, as the Senator from North Dakota pulls out, saying that we \nhave a percentage of the population that is working which is lower now \nthan it has been in 10 years, the percentage--does that matter? The \nquestion is, How about the percentage of the people who are looking for \nwork? That is really what we are interested in. The fact that the \npercentage of seniors has grown in America over the last 10 years will \nmean by definition that probably fewer people as a percentage of the \npopulation are going to be working. That is sort of a natural thing to \nassume. This idea that we are going to pull out all these incredible \nsort of arcane statistics to make a point when the overwhelming body of \nevidence is that this is an economy that is growing, unemployment rates \nare at historically low levels, and wealth is growing in this country, \nhousehold income is growing in this country, the idea that this is the \nworst economy since the Great Depression is folly.\n\n  It is the kind of talking down of this economy that the President and \nthe Vice President were accused of 3 years ago when the economy was in \nbad shape. The idea that somehow or another this administration has \nlost all these jobs when this administration entered office during a \nrecession, which, I assume, the Democrats at least will admit the \nPresident had nothing to do with when he was sworn in in January of \n2001--we were in a recession--that somehow or another we are going to \nblame the President for the resulting job loss of that and the events \nof 9/11, or the corporate scandals which ran amok during the Clinton \nadministration, which, again, this President had to patch together--\nthis idea that because the economy was in terrible shape when the \nPresident rose his hand and said I take this oath is now the \nPresident's fault, again, just doesn't, thankfully, make a whole lot of \nsense to the American public.\n  The American public isn't buying a lot of this snake oil salesmanship \nthat is going on about how bad things are in America. I think the more \nwe get the information out about what really is happening in this \neconomy, and the things this administration is doing now and which we \nare trying to do in the Senate to make it better, the better this \neconomy will do--even more than it is doing today.\n  But our job in the Senate over the next 4 days is to ask whether we \nwant to see this economy grow.\n  No. 1, how much are we going to resist the call to increase spending? \nThat is a big concern out there in the private sector. Will Washington \ntry to live within its budget?\n  And, No. 2, how much are we going to try to take from the American \npublic in the form of higher taxes?\n  I have decided to resurrect a couple of charts I have used over the \nlast year. One is the Democratic spendometer. For every amendment that \nis offered which increases spending, we will put that amendment here. \nWe will put the number of Democrats who voted for this amendment, the \n1-year cost, and the 5-year cost over this budget.\n  Just to recollect, I heard the Senator from Nevada, who is a very \npersuasive and articulate spokesman for the other side, talk about this \nhorrible deficit we have. I remind all who are listening that last year \nat this time the Democrats proposed adding $1.3 trillion in new \nspending over the next 10 years to last year's budget.\n\n  Let me repeat that: $1.3 trillion in new spending not offset by other \nspending cuts added to this deficit over the next 10 years. Had we done \nwhat they wanted to do last year, this deficit would be in much worse \nshape than what it is today.\n  That was just in the budget. The first time I brought out this chart \nwas during last January's discussion of the appropriations bills which \nthe Democrats failed to pass when they controlled the Senate in 2002. \nThat was the omnibus bill of January of 2003. During that debate on \nDemocrat appropriations bills that passed out of their committee, they \nsought to add a half trillion dollars in new spending to the fiscal \nyear 2003 budget--the omnibus spending, the appropriations bill in \n2003--and $1.3 trillion over 10 years to last year's budget, which \nagain, thankfully, was defeated. Then, after the budget passed and we \nhad to deal with last year's appropriations bill to which they again \nattempted to add, the spend o meter was brought out--$800 billion in \nnew spending to those bills.\n  I just remind everybody who will come to the floor and bemoan budgets \nand deficits and how irresponsible the President and those of us who \nare in the majority are, they attempted to add $800 billion to last \nyear's appropriations bills, and $1.3 trillion to last year's budget, \nall of which was not offset with any other spending reductions.\n  I will again put up this chart.\n  There is a clever thing, I suspect, that many on the other side will \ndo this time; that is, they will pay for these amendments. They will \nsay they are concerned about the deficit. Last year, they were not. \nLast year, we did not offset these expenditures. Last year, they simply \nran up the tab. But all of a sudden, we are awash with fiscal \nconservatism. We have this great concern now about the Federal budget \ndeficit. What is going to happen with a lot of the amendments that will \nbe offered by the other side is that they will be paid for. How will \nthey be paid for?\n  That brings me to my second chart, the Democrat taxometer. What they \nare going to do is not only increase spending with more money flowing \nto the bureaucrats in Washington, DC, but they are going to do so on \nthe backs of taxpayers in America. They will say: Oh, all we want to do \nis tax the richest of the rich, and our amendments are designed only to \ngo after those wealthy people who can afford to pay taxes. But, of \ncourse, we know that is not what their amendments do. What their \namendments do is instruct the Finance Committee to come up with revenue \nraising. That is all this amendment does. It is all it can do. It \ncannot specify what the Finance Committee will do nor what this \nCongress will do. So all it will do, and will do repeatedly, is \ninstruct the Finance Committee to raise taxes.\n  For every amendment that is offered that is ``paid for,'' we will \nhave, again, the amendment, the number of Democrats who voted for this \ntax increase, the 1-year cost to the taxpayers in increased taxes, and \nthe 5-year cost to taxpayers in increased taxes.\n  When we hear this debate, what we are back to again is sort of a \ntypical saw that we hear in Washington, DC, tax and spend, tax and \nspend, all in the name of trying to have fiscal accountability. In \nreality, it is growing the size of government. It is growing the power \nand influence of the Federal Government over your life and taking your \nmoney so we can have more power over you, and you can have less freedom \nto do what you believe is in your best interests and the best interests \nof your family. Of course, we know, if you listen to the other side, \nthat we can spend your money better than you can; that the money we \nhave to spend is for great and wondrous causes which will have a \ntremendous benefit to the American public; and, of course, if we let \nyou keep this money, you would use it on frivolous things that have no \ngreat benefit to you or to your family or to the community and to the \ncountry.\n  The same kind of cynicism that we have seen pervade on the other side \nof the aisle for decades, nothing has changed. It is the same old saw. \nWe know what to do better with your money than you do, and we are going \nto prove it time and time again over the next 4 days as hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in tax increases will be voted on on the floor of \nthe Senate. Hundreds of billions of dollars of new taxes will be voted \non in the Senate, with hundreds of billions of dollars of wonderful new \nGovernment programs that will solve all the problems we have in America \nthat, of course, if that money were left to you, you would not have any \nidea what to do, that would be of any benefit to the American public or \nto these great causes we announce in the Senate.\n\n  This is the debate. There is lots of talk about deficits and fiscal \nresponsibility, but in the end this comes down to more Government, \nbigger Government, more Government control, less freedom.\n  The late Paul Coverdell used to say his basic understanding of taxes \nwas it is an issue of freedom. The more money we take from you, the \nless free you are\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\nto take care of yourself and to provide for yourself and your family. \nThe less money we take, the more freedom you have. So this is an issue \nof basic freedom, economic freedom in this country.\n  We will see over the next 4 days what party sides with the American \npublic, what party trusts you, and what party believes they can do \nbetter with your money than you can, that they know what is best for \nAmerica than the millions of Americans across this country whose money \nwill be taken and sent to Washington for new programs that will better \nsolve American problems than leaving the money at home with Americans \nto solve it for themselves.\n  I am looking forward to this debate. I could be wrong, but I suspect \nI will need more than one of these charts. I suspect I will need \nseveral of these charts about where the Democrats and how much the \nDemocrats are going to try to increase taxes over the next several \ndays. We will need several charts of how Democrats will try to increase \nspending and grow the size of Government. It will be hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. It may even be, over 5 years, $1 trillion, and \nthey will do so all by maintaining a straight face that they are the \nprotectors of fiscal discipline in Washington, DC; they are the ones \nwho are for lower deficits, who are for Government control--of \ncontrolling Government spending; they are the fiscal watchdogs on guard \nto the American taxpayer.\n  Let's see what happens over the next 4 days. Let's see who calls for \nspending increases. Let's see who calls for tax increases. And let's \nfind out who really is on your side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am delighted to follow the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I have been looking forward for a long time to this \nopportunity because the Senator from Pennsylvania makes a lot of \naggressive assertions. Unfortunately, he is aggressively wrong, wrong, \nwrong.\n  Let's start with the question of when the deficit starts. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania says it started in the Clinton administration.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield if I misstated.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I did not talk about the deficit starting in the \nClinton administration. I am talking about when the recession started.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I apologize; I meant to say when the recession started. I \nthink the Senator from Pennsylvania said the recession started during \nthe Clinton administration.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Again, Mr. President, I think I said it started when \nthe President was taking the oath of office in January of 2001.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to have the Senator state his position.\n  Let me just say the problem with that is the National Bureau of \nEconomic Research, which does the official dating of recessions, says \nthe downturn began in March 2001, early in Bush's Presidency.\n  But that is not the thing I am most eager to answer in terms of what \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania has said. He has repeatedly used his \nspend-o-meter chart in the Senate and that chart is just a complete \nfabrication. I don't know of a nice way to say this. That chart is a \ncomplete fabrication.\n  How is it a fabrication? First of all, all the Democratic amendments \nto last year's budget resolution were paid for. The Senator from \nPennsylvania said they were not paid for. That is factually wrong and \nhe ought to come out here and correct the record because it is wrong. \nAll he has to do is look at the record to know it is wrong. Our \namendments were paid for. I will go to a complete list of those \namendments next to demonstrate the statements of the Senator from \nPennsylvania are false.\n  In addition, the Democratic amendments were offered individually, not \nas a package. The Senator from Pennsylvania wants to act as though the \nDemocratic amendments were offered as a big package. False. They were \noffered individually.\n  Third, the Senator from Pennsylvania wants to act as though these \namendments were all 10-year amendments. False again. Half of these \namendments were for 1 year.\n  What the Senator from Pennsylvania has done is very conveniently \ntaken 1-year amendments and multiplied to make them 10-year amendments \nand then cumulate them to act as though they were a package. Wrong, \nwrong, wrong.\n  What is most wrong, he asserts they were not paid for last year. He \nought to have done his homework better before coming out and making an \nassertion like that because even the least bit of research, even the \nleast bit, would have demonstrated that is a false statement.\n\n  Let's go to the amendments that were offered. I have a list of all of \nthe amendments. We can see whether the statement of the Senator from \nPennsylvania was correct. He says the amendments were not paid for. \nLet's go down the list.\n  An amendment by Senator Biden to restore the COPS Program was a 10-\nyear amendment and costs $1 billion. It was fully paid for, plus $1 \nbillion to reduce the deficit.\n  An amendment by Senator Kerry on HIV/global AIDS cost over 10 years \nabout $800 million. Completely paid for, plus an additional amount to \nreduce the deficit.\n  We can go right down the list. Every single one of the Democratic \namendments was completely paid for--in most cases, more than paid for--\nso the deficit would be reduced as well.\n  The chart of the Senator from Pennsylvania is wrong. Factually wrong. \nHe ought to come out here and correct the record.\n  As I say, I will put this entire list in the Record because it \ndemonstrates all of the Democratic amendments were paid for, countering \nthe assertion of the Senator from Pennsylvania--and more than paid for. \nSo if you did cumulate them, it would reduce the deficit $687 billion. \nIt is not right to cumulate. They were not offered as a package but \nindividually.\n  There was an amendment by Senator Dorgan for veterans, to give \ngreater budget resources for veterans health care, for $1 billion. But \nthat was completely paid for, plus an additional amount to reduce the \ndeficit. That is the fact of the matter.\n  These amendments were offered not as a package, they were offered \nindividually. So this amendment was offered. It was defeated.\n  Then we offered another amendment on rural health care. That \namendment was defeated. Then we offered another amendment. The idea you \ncan combine them as a package is false and misleading.\n  Then the Senator from Pennsylvania has another chart on the \nappropriations bills. This is my favorite because this is another \ncomplete fabrication. The Democratic amendments to the Omnibus \nappropriations bill were offered individually, not as a package. You \ncannot accumulate them.\n  No. 2, the Democratic amendments were for 1 year, not 10 years. They \njust took 1-year amendments and multiplied them by 10. They were not \n10-year amendments. They were 1-year amendments.\n  No. 3, if you did total them and take out the duplication, they \ntotaled $37 billion, not the $500 billion asserted by the Senator from \nPennsylvania. That is an absolute fiction, a concoction. It has \nabsolutely no merit.\n  What is really interesting is what the Republicans did. Our \namendments, if you can total them--which you should not do because they \nwere not offered as a package--but if you did, they were $37 billion.\n  But do you know what the Republicans did when they recaptured \ncontrol? They went into a conference committee, locked out the \nDemocrats, and they came back and increased spending by $63 billion.\n  Let's look at the difference between what they are saying and what \nthey did. Here are the amendments we offered to the Omnibus \nappropriations bills. Each one of them was offered individually.\n\n  We offered improvements in homeland security. It would have cost $5 \nbillion. That was defeated. So that money was still available. We then \noffered an amendment to improve education. That was defeated. It would \nhave cost $6 billion.\n  What the Senator from Pennsylvania has done is add up all these. They \nwere not offered as a package. They were offered individually. They \nwere 1-year amendments, and he multiplied them as 10-year amendments. \nWhat is interesting is, if you did add them all up,\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\nthey do not cost $500 billion; they cost $37 billion.\n  But look what our friends on the Republican side did when they \ncaptured control and wrote the final Omnibus appropriations bill. They \nwent into the conference committee and came back with $63 billion of \nadd-on--$63 billion--trumping us almost two to one if you did \naccumulate our amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator, will you leave the chart, please?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the $37 billion was done in the \nSenate where there was full debate and recorded votes. Is it true that \nthe $63 billion, which was added on, was done in a secret, closed \nmeeting, with no public able to watch what went on, no one knowing how \nthe votes were cast, and not a single Democrat was in the room?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct. Rarely have I seen in my time in the \nSenate--I have been here 17 years--rarely have I seen somebody come out \nwith a more fabricated chart than the one presented by the Senator from \nPennsylvania. It is false in its detail. It is false in its assertion. \nIt is a complete fabrication. For him to come and say our amendments on \nthe budget resolution were not offset is absolutely false, and the \nrecord shows it as clearly as it can be shown.\n  On the appropriations bills, to assert we offered $500 billion of \namendments is just false. It is not true. We authored, if you totaled \nthem, $37 billion of amendments. But you cannot total them. They were \noffered one after another. We would offer an amendment. It would be \ndefeated. Then we would take that same money and offer a different \namendment. That is the fact of the matter.\n  But what is most interesting is, if you did total them, we were \ncompletely outstripped by what the Republicans did when they went into \nthe conference committee between the House and the Senate to work out \nthe differences and they came back and increased spending $63 billion.\n  Now, let's talk about who has responsibility here for the explosion \nof the debt, because that record is very clear. Our friends on the \nother side are in total control. They control the House. They control \nthe Senate. They have since 2001. They control the White House. This is \nwhat has happened to the debt under their stewardship and under their \nleadership. The debt has exploded.\n  When President Bush took office, the publicly held debt was projected \nto be, in 2008, at that amount, $36 billion. In his 2002 budget, it got \nraised to $1.2 trillion. Then his tax cut passed and it went up to $1.6 \ntrillion. Then the President's 2003 budget came up and he expanded the \ndebt to $3.3 trillion. Then we got his budget for 2004 and it increased \nthe debt to $5 trillion. Then we got the Senate GOP 2005 budget and \nthey increase the debt to almost $5.5 trillion.\n\n  These guys are totally in charge. The Republicans control the House. \nThey control the Senate. They control the White House. It is on their \nwatch that the debt has exploded. That is the fact of the matter. It is \nno wonder they are now trying to distort our record to give themselves \ncover for what they have done.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2704\n\n  Mr. President, I am now going to lay down an amendment. I send an \namendment to the desk. I might add, I have the agreement of the \nchairman of the committee that we will proceed with this amendment at \nthis time. I inform the Presiding Officer, I have discussed this with \nthe chairman. I send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2704.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require Congress to pay for any new tax cut or mandatory \nspending legislation until the budget is balanced without counting the \nSocial Security surplus, to encourage Congress to work expeditiously to \n  ensure the long-term viability and permanent sustainability of the \n  Social Security program for current and future generations, and to \nensure that Social Security benefits are not cut to offset the costs of \n   enacting new tax cuts or extending the President's tax cuts that \n                    benefit the wealthiest among us)\n\n       At the end of title IV, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. POINT OF ORDER TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY FIRST.\n\n       (a) Point of Order in the Senate.--It shall not be in order \n     in the Senate to consider any direct spending or revenue \n     legislation that would increase the on-budget deficit in any \n     fiscal year until the budget is balanced without Social \n     Security.\n       (b) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--This section may be \n     waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote \n     of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An \n     affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the \n     Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today is to \nprotect the Social Security trust fund surpluses from additional raids. \nMy amendment would establish a 60-vote point of order against the \nconsideration of any direct spending or revenue legislation that would \nincrease the on-budget deficit in any fiscal year until we have \nbalanced the budget without counting the Social Security surpluses.\n  Very simply, what this amendment does is to say, no new spending, no \nnew tax cuts, unless they are paid for, until we secure Social \nSecurity, until we stop the raid on Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses.\n  I said from the beginning that President Bush's fiscal plan would \nultimately threaten Social Security. I believed it then, and I, \nunfortunately, believe that events have confirmed how seriously the \nPresident's fiscal plan threatens the fundamentals of our economic \nsecurity.\n  Now we see the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Greenspan, \nsuggesting we are overcommitted. He has said to the Congress of the \nUnited States that he recommends we consider reducing Social Security \nbenefits. That is where the President's overall fiscal plan leads. It \nfundamentally threatens not only Social Security but Medicare as well.\n  I want to go back to 2001 and what the President told us then. The \nPresident told us, in his budget blueprint for the 2002 budget:\n\n       None of the Social Security surplus will be used to fund \n     other spending initiatives or tax relief.\n\n  Yet that is precisely what we see happening. Not only is the \nPresident using Social Security, he is using $2.4 trillion of Social \nSecurity surpluses over the next 10 years. Let me be quick to say they \nare not surpluses. All of that money is going to be needed to pay for \nthe retirement of the baby boom generation. The President, who pledged \nnot to take the money and use it for other purposes, is doing precisely \nthat. He is using every penny of the Social Security surplus over the \nnext decade to pay for his tax cuts and other expenses of Government.\n  Interestingly enough, if one looks at the Social Security money that \nhe is borrowing over this next 10 years to pay other bills and compares \nit to the cost of his tax cuts--both those already passed and those \nproposed--one finds a very close fit, a very close fit between the \nmoney he is borrowing from Social Security, with no plan to pay it \nback, and the cost of his tax cuts. They are almost identical.\n  There is $2.4 trillion of Social Security money taken over the next \n10 years--all of it financed with payroll taxes, primarily paid by \nmiddle-income people--and he is using it to provide income tax cuts \nthat disproportionately go to the wealthiest among us.\n  It is very interesting to pierce the veil and to see what the \nPresident is doing and to see the full effects of his policy: $2.4 \ntrillion taken from Social Security--borrowed, if you will--and then \nused to finance income tax cuts.\n  If we look at who the beneficiaries are of those income tax cuts, \nhere it is: We see overwhelmingly they are going to the wealthiest \namong us. The top 1 percent, those earning over $337,000 a year, get 33 \npercent of the benefits of these tax cuts. Almost 69 percent of the \nbenefits go to the top 20 percent.\n\n[[Page S2385]]\n\n  Shown down here on the chart, the bottom 20 percent get virtually \nnothing. The second 20 percent gets 4.8 percent of the benefits. The \nmiddle 20 percent gets 10.6 percent of the benefits.\n  The fourth 20 percent in terms of income, those with $73,000 or less \nin income, get 15.8 percent of the benefits. The top 20 percent get 69 \npercent of the benefits.\n  If we look on the recipient side, those who get Social Security \nbenefits, that is instructive as well. What this chart shows is almost \ntwo-thirds of retirees rely on Social Security for more than half of \ntheir income. In fact, 31 percent of Social Security beneficiaries get \nat least 90 percent of their income from Social Security benefits; 33 \npercent get 50 to 89 percent of their income from Social Security; and \n36 percent get less than 50 percent of their income from Social \nSecurity.\n  What is going on is--again, I like to use the term ``pierce the \nveil''--the President is borrowing from the Social Security trust fund, \n$2.4 trillion during this next 10 years, using it to finance income tax \ncuts costing $2.5 trillion. The income tax cuts go overwhelmingly to \nthe wealthiest among us. Thirty-three percent goes to those earning \nover $337,000 a year, and it is all financed by payroll taxes paid \ndisproportionately by middle-class people. In fact, over 70 percent of \nAmericans pay more in payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes.\n  This is the greatest shift of wealth that has perhaps ever occurred \nin our history, from the many to the few. That is the President's plan.\n  Here we see the difference Social Security has made, before we had \nSocial Security and without it. Nearly 50 percent of beneficiaries \nwould be in poverty. That has been the extraordinary power of Social \nSecurity and Medicare. It has lifted people out of poverty. Before we \nhad Social Security and Medicare, almost half of seniors were in \npoverty. Social Security has reduced that to 9 percent; 9 percent now \nof our seniors are in poverty. What a remarkable social program this \nhas been, the combination of Social Security and Medicare, to lift \npeople out of poverty.\n  The President says: Well, we have a big shortfall in Social Security \nover the next 75 years.\n  Indeed, we do. The 75-year shortfall in Social Security is $3.8 \ntrillion. That is according to the actuaries. But interestingly enough, \nif you look at the cost of the President's tax cuts over that same 75-\nyear period, they are three times as much: $12.1 trillion is the 75-\nyear cost of the President's tax cuts.\n  All of this should inform what we face in the very near future. The \nPresident's massive runup of deficits and debt is occurring at the \nworst possible time, right before the baby boomers begin to retire. \nThis chart shows it very well. It shows the tax cuts explode as the \nsurpluses in the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare become \ndeficits.\n  The green part of these bars is the Social Security trust fund. The \nblue part is the Medicare trust fund. The red is the costs of the \nPresident's tax cuts. What you can see is right now the surpluses from \nSocial Security and Medicare are larger than the cost of the tax cuts. \nAs I have indicated, over the next 10 years the Social Security \nsurpluses that are being taken to finance the tax cuts are about \nequivalent to the cost of the tax cuts. That is over the next 10 years. \nBut look what happens when the trust fund goes cash negative. At that \nvery time the cost of the tax cuts explodes, driving us right over the \ncliff into deeper deficit and debt. This is what is so fundamentally \nflawed about the President's fiscal plan for this country. We see the \nsame flaw in what has been reported out of the Budget Committee. It is \nseen most clearly in the President's plans because of his adherence to \neven more tax cuts when we are running record budget deficits. The \nPresident is proposing increasing spending and cutting revenue when we \nalready can't pay our bills. What does that do? We can see what it does \nas he takes more and more of the Social Security money to finance tax \ncuts and other expenditures. That string starts to run out when the \ntrust fund goes cash negative.\n\n  Unfortunately, the President has made no provision for it. His answer \nis: Cut the revenue more. Spend more, when you already have record \ndeficits.\n  This is where it is all headed. It is not just the Congressional \nBudget Office and it is not just this Senator's calculations. We see \nthese warnings coming from the Comptroller General of the United \nStates. We see them coming from the International Monetary Fund. We see \nthem coming from responsible budget groups warning the President has us \non an unsustainable course.\n  Here is what is going to happen with Social Security. We are going to \nsee a dramatic increase in the number of people who are eligible to \nreceive it. There is going to be a doubling of those eligible for \nSocial Security. We have about 40 million people now who are eligible \nfor Social Security. That is going to double to more than 82 million. \nThe President has no plan to deal with it.\n  Unfortunately, what he is doing is taking the Social Security \nsurpluses. We can see the pattern on the Social Security surplus. We \ncan see it is at very high levels now. The Social Security surplus for \nthis year will be about $160 billion. That continues to increase \ndramatically in preparation for the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration. But instead of using this money to pay down the debt or \nprepay the liability, the President is taking it all to finance current \ntax cuts and other expenditures, putting us in a more vulnerable \nposition.\n  My amendment says, let's protect Social Security first. We protect \nthe Social Security trust funds from further raids by preventing the \nconsideration of new revenue or new spending that is not paid for until \nthe budget is balanced without counting the Social Security surplus. \nThis is enforced by a 60-vote point of order.\n  I want to make clear, the basic idea is if you want new spending, if \nyou want new tax cuts, you can do it, but you either have to pay for \nit, or you have to get a supermajority vote. We would maintain that \ndiscipline until the raid on Social Security is stopped, until we stop \nthe Bush administration from using Social Security funds to pay for tax \ncuts and other expenditures.\n\n  This is a commonsense amendment. I hope very much our colleagues will \nsupport it. It is critically important to provide the discipline on \nboth the spending side and the tax side as we go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for this amendment. \nFor the information of our colleagues, it is my expectation we will \nprobably vote on this amendment shortly after lunch, unless others wish \nto speak on it. We are happy to accommodate that.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment, but I want to give a little \nexplanation about what, in my opinion, this amendment does and does not \ndo.\n  First, if we did what my friend and colleague from North Dakota is \nsaying, we would be in violation of the Budget Act.\n  In the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, section 301, there is a \nSocial Security point of order that says it is against the law to bring \nany budget concurrent resolution to the floor of the Senate if you do \nanything detrimental to the so-called trust fund. I will read the point \nof order:\n\n       It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any \n     concurrent resolution on the budget or amendment or motion or \n     conference report on the resolution that would decrease the \n     excess Social Security revenues over Social Security outlays \n     in any of the fiscal years covered by the concurrent \n     resolution.\n\n  That is strong. That is the law. We comply with the law. If we did \nnot, our entire budget would fall. I make that point.\n  Senator Conrad eludes to the fact that we are raiding Social \nSecurity. I disagree with that entirely. With great respect, I will say \nSenator Conrad's budget, which he wrote in 2002 that passed the \ncommittee but did not pass the Senate, did the exact same thing, for at \nleast $866 billion. I understand politics, and I understand the way \nthis is being framed, but it is absolutely wrong. What do we do with a \nSocial Security surplus? Senator Conrad is correct, there is $166 \nbillion more Social Security taxes coming into the Social Security \ntrust fund than money going out.\n\n[[Page S2386]]\n\n  What do we do with the excess money? We do exactly what the law says \nwe should do. We take that money and buy Treasury bonds that are \nsupposedly invested in West Virginia. I say ``supposedly'' because all \nthe money got into one big pot. Social Security, as well as income \ntaxes, all goes into one big pot.\n  If you are an employee and look at your W-2, you have withholding for \nSocial Security and income taxes that goes out every payroll period. \nAll that money goes into the U.S. Treasury. Half does not go over here \nand half over there. All of it goes into the Treasury, and Treasury \nwrites the checks.\n  With Social Security, if they determine there are less outlays than \nincome, they take the balance and buy T bills. That is a commitment by \nthe U.S. Treasury to pay it back with interest. That is the law of the \nland, and that is exactly what we do. That is exactly what we do under \nthis resolution.\n  This chart shows exactly what the trust funds will be approximately, \nwith the budget and without the budget. The trust fund is exactly the \nsame because we take every dime of the surplus and we buy T bills with \nit. I might add, if our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \noffered a budget, it would be exactly the same or else their budget \nwould fall.\n  I just make that point. I hope people do not get confused about all \nthe raiding talk. We buy T bills with the Social Security surpluses. \nThat is what has been done for years because that is the law of the \nland.\n  There is some discussion that if we had a surplus, maybe we should \nbuy equities or not buy equities. You could buy major corporations, you \ncould buy a very significant portion of the stock exchange, and so on. \nBut we did not do that. We follow the law of the land. Instead of \npicking out which company or sector might benefit from a Government \ninvestment, we said, no, we are going to buy T bills.\n  With those T bills, we can do one of two things: spend the money or \npay off debt. But that is beside the point. The trust fund is basically \nthe same, the obligation to pay. We are not changing the law of the \nland. The law of the land is we have obligations to pay Social Security \nbenefits based on formulas. We can change those formulas. We can change \neligibility. We can change retirement age. We can change the cost-of-\nliving benefits. We can take a lot of different actions. Congress can \ndo that. We cannot do it under a budget resolution, not if it is \ndetrimental to the health of the trust fund.\n  I want to make sure everybody understands we are not raiding the \nSocial Security trust fund. The Social Security trust fund is going to \nbe exactly the same under this resolution as before because that is the \nlaw of the land, and we abide by the law.\n  I also repeat, Senator Conrad's budget and, frankly, any budget that \nI have seen in my years in the Senate--and I have seen 24 of them--we \ndid not pass Senator Conrad's budget, but the 23 we passed all treated \nSocial Security the same--all did.\n\n  What about this point of order he is creating? That sounds pretty \ngood, and I think I hear him correctly when he says no new spending and \nno new tax cuts unless we have this supermajority. Guess what? We \nexempt a whole lot of spending. According to CBO, we exempt about $1 \ntrillion of spending under the baseline. They just assume the spending \nis going to continue, even though, in many cases, the authorizations \nexpire. But the way this is drafted and the way I can tell, we more or \nless exempt that.\n  For example, the farm bill. The farm bill expires at the end of 5 or \n6 years. Under this amendment, we would not say the new farm bill has \nto be paid for, at least that is not my interpretation of the \namendment. So spending has an advantage compared to tax cuts.\n  Any tax cuts, because tax cuts are for a definite short term, a \nlimited term, when they expire, they would have to be 100 percent paid \nfor. But a lot of spending programs, over $1 trillion worth of spending \nprograms, would continue even though they are scheduled to expire. They \nare assumed to continue. Tax cuts are not assumed to continue. There is \na big difference.\n  We also exempt appropriations. We can have big increases in \nappropriated accounts. Discretionary accounts--the money we spend--in \nsome cases have been growing rather dramatically. We will exempt that. \nIn this fiscal year, fiscal year 2004, we are going to have \ndiscretionary spending of about $788 billion, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, and we are projecting under the budget \nresolution $814 billion. It may be higher. CBO scores the President's \nbudget at $823 billion. There is a difference between $823 billion and \n$788 billion of about $35 billion. Under this amendment, no, you do not \nhave to pay for that.\n  If we can have lots of increases in discretionary spending, that \nwouldn't have to be paid for. We basically exempt all the appropriated \naccounts, about $1 trillion of mandatory spending that is assumed to \ncontinue. That does not have to be paid for.\n  What has to be paid for? What is the real target of this amendment? \nThe real target of this amendment is if you want to continue present \nlaw in the Tax Code, you have to have 60 votes. That is what this \namendment is really getting at, and it is trying to cloud the issue \nwith Social Security.\n  We treat Social Security exactly the way Senator Conrad did in his \nbudget. We treat Social Security the same as every other budget that \nhas been before the Senate. We treat Social Security according to the \nlaw. If we have surpluses, we buy T bills--that is an IOU--period.\n  The real essence of this amendment is, they would like to make sure \nthat if we are going to continue present law, we have to have 60 votes. \nThat is the essence of it.\n  It means if there is going to be a lot of other legislation--maybe it \nis the prescription drug bill, maybe it would be the Energy bill, maybe \nit would be anything else--oh, that has to have 60 votes, too. We \nbasically would be changing the way we do business in the Senate and \nsay we have to have 60 votes for anything.\n  Some people think that should be the case anyway. I disagree. Some \npeople go in with the idea that we are going to have a filibuster on \nevery bill, have to have 60 votes. That is not the tradition of the \nSenate. That is not how the Senate historically has worked, and it \nshould not work that way. Filibusters should be very rare and few, and \nit seems as if everybody wants to pull that trigger every time we turn \naround. I disagree with that practice, and I hope people will think \nabout that further because it will greatly undermine the workings of \nthe Senate.\n  Also, this amendment, in my opinion, would encourage spending because \na lot of people around here do not like tax cuts. They would realize \nyou could never have a tax cut if we were not in balance, minus Social \nSecurity, and, therefore, there is real tendency to increase spending \nwith a majority vote and you have to have a supermajority to get tax \ncuts. So it is going to be a lot harder to get tax cuts and less harder \nto get more spending, and the more spending you get, the less likely a \ntax cut will happen.\n  Some of our colleagues and many people would love this bias towards \nspending because you can pass spending increases, discretionary \nspending increases, with a majority vote. They do not count and, \ntherefore, if you spend more, it would be less likely to have tax cuts. \nTax cuts would be out of order.\n  The more I think about this, the less I like it. I have great respect \nfor my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, but I think this \namendment demagogs on the issue of Social Security.\n  Maybe it tries to inflame people about raiding Social Security. I \nabsolutely think that is false. I told my colleague from North Dakota I \nlook forward to having a hearing in the Budget Committee in the not too \ndistant future on this whole concept of trust funds, what is there, \nwhat is not there, what obligations we have, what they really mean, \nbecause I think there are a lot of misconceptions about trust funds in \ngeneral. I look forward to that.\n  I also will make a couple of comments on a few facts relating to \nSocial Security. I know Senator Conrad asked, is it not interesting \nbecause the Social Security surplus is just about equal, the same \namount of money as the tax cuts? Well, I will show Social Security \ntaxes and payroll taxes are just about equal--not quite equal--to\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\nthe total amount of money that we pay out in Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  So one could easily say the Social Security surpluses are used to pay \nMedicare. That is the point I am making.\n  As a matter of fact, they do not quite pay for Medicare. It so \nhappens the Medicare beneficiaries are by and large the same \nbeneficiaries of Social Security, and those are just some facts.\n  To give an example in the year 2004, actually the total benefits for \nSocial Security and Medicare together are $784 billion. The total \namount of money coming in from payroll tax is $753 billion. In other \nwords, we pay out $31 billion more than we take in on payroll taxes for \nMedicare and Social Security.\n  Somebody says: I am not aware of that. I thought we had big \nsurpluses. We have surpluses in the Social Security trust fund \ntheoretically because 12.4 percent of payroll tax goes in for Social \nSecurity; 2.9 percent of payroll tax goes into Medicare. I started to \nsay it is the same payroll tax. If one looks at their W-2, it says FICA \ntax. A lot of people do not even know what FICA means. That is the \nSocial Security and Medicare tax. It is 15.3 percent, which is 12.2 and \n3.9. Do I have that right? I know that did not add up right--I have not \ngiven this speech in a while. It is 12.4 and 2.9, which equals 15.3, \nand that is what individuals pay. Self-employed individuals pay all of \nit. Individuals who have an employer, they pay half and the employer \npays half. It adds up to 15.3 percent of payroll, up to a taxable base \nof $87,900. Wow.\n  So my point is, if we add all the payroll taxes up, that is a lot, \nbut it does not quite pay for all of the benefits that are going out in \nSocial Security and Medicare. It is about $30 billion short. Some \npeople can say, well, those Social Security excesses are used to pay \nfor tax cuts. I disagree with that. I think they are being used to pay \nfor Medicare.\n\n  We subsidize Medicare. Under the budget, we pay for three-fourths of \npart B. That is the doctor expense. The beneficiary pays one-fourth and \nthe Government pays three-fourths. The Government pays for it out of \ngeneral revenues. My point is, this money is all going into one pot. \nAll the money goes into one pot and comes out of one pot.\n  There is a balance. If there is a balance in Social Security, we \ncredit that to the Social Security trust fund. We do it by the law. We \ndo it the same way Senator Conrad did when he passed his budget out of \nthe Budget Committee.\n  So I hope we have a little less talk about we are stealing or raiding \nbecause that language is somewhat political or inflammatory. Again, \nlet's stay with the facts and stick by the budget resolution. That is \nexactly what we do. Let's not create a bias for let's spend more, but \nif we are going to do more in spending, we are really not going to \ncount that. We are not going to count incremental increases in \ndiscretionary. We are not going to count a trillion dollars of \nentitlements that are assumed to be expanded forever, but if we want to \nextend present law on the Tax Code, oh, it has to be paid for.\n  Right now the child tax credit is $1,000 per child. That is present \nlaw. Some of us want to extend that. The President of the United States \nwants to extend that. Some people are saying, oh, no, we think we \nshould have to pay for that. What do they mean? They are trying to say, \nwell, we think there should be higher taxes some place else. In other \nwords, we want to extend entitlements.\n  I will make an editorial comment. I did not hear this argument raised \nwhen we were dealing with greatly expanding the Medicare bill. People \nsaid, oh, let's pay for it, let's make sure that is paid for with \nincreased revenues or reduction in spending. No, it was not.\n  We have a bill that CBO estimates it will be a $395 billion expansion \nover last year's bill. I think it will be more than that. The OMB said \nthey thought it might be higher than that. They thought it might be \n$500 billion and something. I would not be a bit surprised if it was \nhigher than both estimates because we put in some very generous benefit \nincreases. I did not hear a hue and cry about that.\n  Guess what. We did not terminate that law after 5 years or 10 years \nand say at the end of that 5 years it has been paid for. So it is going \nto terminate and go to zero unless other offsets or other cuts are \nfound.\n\n  There is a real bias the way this would work that would benefit \nspending and be very much to the detriment of a continuation of tax \nincreases at least, not to mention further tax reduction.\n  I happen to be proud of the tax reduction that we passed last year. I \nwas very involved in it. I think that was very good tax relief. I think \nwe have seen positive results of the tax bill that we passed last year.\n  Yes, we cut the tax rate on capital gains, and I think revenues are \nstarting to come in. We cut the tax on dividends. We tax dividends \nhigher than any other country in the world. Chairman Greenspan said we \nshould probably have a zero individual tax on dividends. He said we \nshould only tax dividends once. Now we tax them about one and a half \ntimes. We have a 15-percent rate on dividends.\n  I understand some people want that rate to go up to 35 percent, or \nmaybe they want it to go to 39.6 percent. Maybe they want it to go \nhigher than that. I wonder what the reaction would be for the stock \nmarket and what people's 401(k)s would do and what their investment \nbalance would be. Because we made those tax changes last year, there is \nthe best economic growth news we have had in decades in the last two or \nthree quarters. It has been great, positive economic news. That is \nreally good. We have seen the stock market grow by 40 percent from last \nyear at this same point.\n  Now, some people want to increase those taxes. I do not. I want to \ncontinue them. Yet under the Senator's amendment to continue present \nlaw, there would have to be 60 votes. A lot of people realize right now \n60 votes are very hard to obtain on a lot of issues.\n  Under Senator Conrad's amendment, I would think there would have to \nbe 60 votes to do anything. There would have to be 60 votes to pass an \nEnergy bill. There would have to be 60 votes to pass an increase in \nchild nutrition on which Senator Dole and some others are working. \nThere would have to be 60 votes to pass family tax relief; i.e, the \nmarriage penalty relief that we gave for married couples who have \ntaxable income of $58,000, we are going to tax them at 15 percent. That \nis present law. Some of us want to continue that.\n  If we do not continue that, that means instead of paying 15 percent \nup to $58,000, people start paying 25 percent around $52,000. There is \na $900 difference. I do not want to sock it to middle-income families \nwho earn $58,000. Maybe it is a teacher and a spouse with taxable \nincome of $58,000. They are not particularly wealthy. I keep hearing \nabout all of this benefit going to the wealthy. The tax cuts we are \ntrying to extend are very pro-family tax cuts and, frankly, directed \ntowards middle-income Americans. I want to be able to continue that. \nSenator Conrad's amendment says there would have to be 60 votes. There \nwould have to be 60 votes for almost anything at least for the next 10 \nyears.\n\n  I do not think that is the road we want to go down. I urge our \ncolleagues at the appropriate time to vote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think this is a very important debate, \nand I thank my colleague for the way he has joined the debate. I \ndisagree profoundly with him. He knows that, but that is what a debate \nis about. I think this is absolutely one of the most critical debates \nthat we can have because of where we are headed.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma put up a chart that lumps Social Security \nand Medicare together as though they are one program. They are not. \nSocial Security is completely separate and apart from Medicare, as the \nSenator knows. The Senator says if we look at all of the payroll taxes, \nthey do not cover Medicare and Social Security. So there is no real \nsurplus. But that isn't the way these programs are funded. Social \nSecurity is funded with payroll taxes. If you look at Social Security, \nthe revenue coming in is far in excess of the money going out. This \nyear there is a $160 billion Social Security surplus. For this next \nyear, it will be $172 billion. By 2009, the surplus in Social Security \nwill be $235 billion.\n\n  Under the President's plan, and under the chairman's plan, all of \nthese surpluses in Social Security are going to be taken and used to \npay for other\n\n[[Page S2388]]\n\nthings. It is very interesting to see that the Social Security surplus \nbeing taken over the next 10 years is almost equal to the amount of the \nincome tax cuts proposed by the President. You have what I consider a \nspectacle of financing income tax cuts that primarily go to the most \nwealthy in the country out of payroll taxes being paid predominantly by \nmiddle-income people. Then you don't have the money to keep the promise \nin Social Security, so you have the head of the Federal Reserve coming \nto Congress and saying: Whoops, you are overcommitted, you better cut \nSocial Security benefits.\n  Look, I don't think it was ever anticipated when Social Security was \nreformed that those surpluses would be used to pay the operating \nexpenses of the Government. You couldn't do that in the private sector. \nNo private sector employers could take the retirement funds of their \nemployees and use them to pay the operating expenses of the company. \nYou could not do that in the private sector. If you did, you would be \non your way to a Federal facility, but it would not be the Congress of \nthe United States. It would not be the White House. You would be on \nyour way to a Federal facility, all right. It would be a Federal \nprison, because that is a violation of Federal law, to take the \nretirement funds of employees and use them to pay the operating \nexpenses of a company. That is a violation of Federal law. That is \nexactly what we are doing here. Let's understand what we are doing.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Correct me if I am wrong. What we are doing with the \nexcess money is exactly what the law states. According to the statute, \nand I will show you the statute, it says you buy T-bills with it, and \ncorrect me if I'm wrong, that is exactly what we are doing with the \nsurplus.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly right. The problem is this. That \nis what is being done. How do those T-bills get redeemed? We have \nborrowed the money under the President's plan, all of us, instead of \nusing it to pay down debt or to prepay the liability. The cash is gone. \nThe cash has been used for something else, leaving an IOU behind.\n  How does the IOU get paid back? The President has no plan to pay it \nback. The only way I believe the President intends to pay it back is \ndramatically reduce Social Security and Medicare payments in the \nfuture. I think we have seen a forewarning of where it is headed with \nthe head of the Federal Reserve saying to people you ought to consider \ncutting Social Security benefits.\n  The Senator said payroll taxes don't pay for Social Security and \nMedicare. They were never designed to pay for both. Payroll taxes were \ndesigned to pay for Social Security and those funds are in surplus, but \nthey are being used for another purpose. Medicare is a separate \nprogram, financed in part by payroll taxes, in part by general fund \ntransfers. So these are not the same programs. They are not funded in \nthe same way. The fact is payroll taxes, in both the part of Medicare \nthey fund and in Social Security, are in surplus, and the surpluses, \nthe funds, are being taken and used to pay the operating expenses of \nthe Federal Government. I think that is a serious mistake.\n\n  What is the alternative? I think the alternative is to use the money \nto either pay down debt or prepay the liability. That is what most \npeople would do in their private lives, getting ready for retirement, \nand that is what we should have done to prepare for the retirement of \nthe baby boom generation.\n  The Senator says all the money goes in one pot, and that is exactly \nright. That is how it works. All the revenues coming in go in one pot. \nAll the expenditures come out of that pot. The problem with that is all \nthese revenues are not the same. Some of them are supposedly for a \ntrust fund for Social Security and Medicare. Those moneys are designed \nto be in surplus now in preparation for the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration, but they are not being used in a way that will prepare for \nthe retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  The Senator talked about budgets I have offered, and that they are \nexactly the same as what is being done here. No, I say respectfully, \nno, they are not. In 2002 I proposed a budget that had $473 billion \nless in deficit. Why? Because I wanted to use that money to prepare for \nthe retirement of the baby boom generation. In 2003, my budget had $523 \nbillion less in deficit and added debt. In 2004, my budget proposal had \n$1.2 trillion less in deficit and debt for the budget period.\n  The reason was, I wanted to use that money to either pay down debt or \nprepay the liability we all know is coming.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would prefer not to yield for the moment. I would like \nto complete a thought and then I will be happy to yield.\n  My own belief is that would have been a much better strategy for the \ncountry than to run up the credit card. Obviously, once this hole has \nbeen dug so deep, any budget one writes for a time will use Social \nSecurity money. There is no other way to write one anymore. This hole \nhas been dug so deep, the Senator is correct when he says budgets I \noffered last year would have used Social Security funds for a time. \nAbsolutely. There is no way to write a budget anymore that does not.\n  The trick is to get on a glidepath to stop it. We did that \nsuccessfully in the late 1990s. I was very proud to have been part of \nthe 1993 effort and the 1997 effort. Those two budget plans put us on a \ncourse to stop using Social Security money for other purposes, and for \n2 years we stopped what I considered to be a raid on Social Security. \nWe stopped it.\n  The President pledged to continue that policy, not to use Social \nSecurity revenues for other purposes. Why did he make that pledge if he \ndidn't think it was important? Why did he make that pledge if he didn't \nthink it was important?\n  He thought it was important. I think the vast majority of Members in \nthis body pledged to protect Social Security funds. But it is not being \ndone.\n  On the question of this amendment, whether there is a bias towards \nspending or tax cuts, I would say there is no intention to have any \nbias here. When we have put in place budget disciplines, I say to my \nfriend, the chairman of the committee, we have always targeted \nmandatory spending with respect to pay-go provisions and revenue. That \nis how we have done it in the past--mandatory spending and revenues. \nThat is what this amendment does.\n\n  We have used spending caps to discipline discretionary spending. I \nsupport both. I think we need both disciplines. Mandatory spending is \nnow two-thirds of Federal spending. We just saw the biggest increase in \nmandatory spending ever last year, a program that now they tell us will \ncost $530 billion over the next 10 years. I think it would have been \nvery healthy to have in place the budget discipline my amendment \ncontemplates. My amendment says no new mandatory spending--and that is \ntwo-thirds of Federal spending--and no new tax cuts, unless they are \npaid for, until we stop using Social Security money, Social Security \nsurpluses to pay other bills of Government, to pay for tax cuts, to pay \nfor other expenditures of Government. I think that would be the right \npolicy to put in place.\n  The Senator says, Then you would require 60 votes for all these kinds \nof spending initiatives. Absolutely, I would. I would put in place a \nrequirement for at least a supermajority vote, at least 60 votes for \nnew spending. I would put in place a supermajority requirement for \nadditional tax cuts. And, I say to my colleague, I would be part of the \n60 on the middle-class tax cuts. I have stated publicly I am for \nextending the 10-percent bracket. I am for extending marriage penalty \nrelief. I am for extending the child care credits. I would even vote to \nextend the expensing for small business. Sign me up. I will work to get \nthe 60 votes. But I think it ought to be paid for. I think any new \nspending ought to be paid for, until we stop taking the Social Security \nfunds and using them to pay other bills, to pay for the tax cuts, and \nto pay for other expenditures of Government.\n\n  I think at this time with the baby boom generation about to retire we \nought to be taking those Social Security surpluses that are being \ngenerated\n\n[[Page S2389]]\n\nnow that we all know are going to be needed when the baby boomers \nretire and we ought to use that money in one of two ways: We either \nought to pay down the debt with it to better prepare ourselves for what \nwe all know is to come, or we ought to prepay the liability.\n  That is what I urged my colleagues to do back in 2001 when we had \nthese supposedly huge surpluses. I urged that we use a third of that \nmoney to either pay down the debt more or to prepay the liability that \nwe all know is coming. I think that would be a far wiser course than \nthe one we are embarked on now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am reminded of the movie ``Show Me The \nMoney.''\n  I say to our friends on the Democrat side, show me this budget \nbecause this budget would do exactly the same thing. Senator Conrad's \nbudget that was written in 2002, which passed the committee and did not \npass the floor, used $866.3 billion of the Social Security surplus \nunder his budget. If I wanted to--I am not going to do that because I \ndon't believe in that--I could say you were raiding Social Security and \nusing that spending on other programs. I am not going to do that \nbecause I don't think that is correct.\n  I think what he did was the same thing every other budget did \nwhenever there has been a Social Security surplus, and that is buy \nsecurities. I will quote the law. That is the law of the land. If we \nare breaking the law, let people know. People say you are taking that \nmoney and spending it on other things. We are investing that money in T \nbills. I make the argument that it is an entry and say this is how much \nthe trust fund is, but it is exactly the same under this budget as it \nwould be under Senator Conrad's budget. If I had an alternative or any \nother budget that anybody else would offer, it would be exactly the \nsame. You are bound by law to purchase T bills, which are basically \nGovernment IOUs saying we will pay this amount of money with those T \nbills.\n  The Government receives money. What do they do with it? They use it \nto either spend money or pay down the debt. By and large, over the last \nmany years, it has been used for other things. The Government has that \nmoney. The Government has to buy the T bills. We have a T bill. We take \nthat cash and buy a T bill with a promise for a future obligation. That \nobligation is paramount. It has always been made by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  That doesn't mean Social Security doesn't have problems in the long \nterm. Demographically there are fewer people writing the checks than \npeople who will be receiving them. People who will be receiving the \nchecks are living longer. We have some demographic problems that need \nto be addressed.\n  Incidentally, it is a lot worse in Medicare than it is in Social \nSecurity. We need to be talking about it. I am happy to discuss long-\nterm challenges that we have, whether it be Medicare or Social \nSecurity.\n  The Medicare challenge is about five times greater than Social \nSecurity. I think some people think they can score political points \nwith Social Security and are maybe trying to scare senior citizens. \nThis is happening. They forget to say they did the same thing. We have \nalways done the same thing but we think maybe we can score some \npolitical points. I urge our colleagues not to go down that road.\n  There is a bias. There is definitely a bias in this amendment towards \nspending. We don't count discretionary spending. You can increase \ndiscretionary spending under this resolution by $100 million per year. \nYou don't have to pay for that. There is a trillion dollars' worth of \nspending that the Congressional Budget Office has on mandatory programs \nthat expire. Those won't be included. They can expire but we will just \nassume they continue. You don't have to pay for those. But if a tax cut \nexpires, you have to pay for that. But you don't have to on mandatory \nprograms. I find that argument very inconsistent.\n  For all the above reasons, I urge our colleagues to vote no on the \nConrad amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a very important debate. I know it \nis probably hard for people at home to follow.\n  The Senator says we are treating the money exactly the same way, and \nthat we are following the law. To a point, he is exactly right. When \nthe money comes in, the Social Security payroll tax revenue comes in, \nand the money is used, as he described, to buy what are special issue \nTreasury bonds with the full faith and credit of the United States.\n  The Senator made reference to West Virginia. That is where those \nbonds are in a vault calling on the Federal Government to pay back \nSocial Security for the money that has been borrowed. The difference \nis, What is used with the receipts? What is used with the actual cash?\n  I believe the right course would be to use that cash to either pay \ndown the Federal debt or to prepay the liability that we all know is \ncoming in Social Security.\n  The budget I proposed in 2001 for 2002 did precisely that. Instead of \nhaving as big of a tax cut, I had half as big a tax cut and used the \nrest of that money to pay down the debt or prepay the liability.\n  There is a fundamental difference here about how to use the cash \nreceipts that are the overage from the money coming in from Social \nSecurity payroll taxes that are over and above what is needed to pay \nthe immediate benefit. The Senator says we are following the law. Yes. \nWe are following the law. But it is also true that we are taking the \nmoney, and instead of using it to pay down the debt or prepay the \nliability, we are using it to pay for other tax cuts and to pay other \nGovernment expenses.\n  I believe that is a profound mistake. The only way we get back to \nsome policy that stops that practice is to discipline both the spending \nside of the equation and the revenue side of the equation to require a \n60-vote point of order against new tax cuts or new spending that is not \npaid for.\n  I think it would be a tremendous advance for this Congress to say, \nLet's secure Social Security first. That is the first thing we ought to \nprotect. The way to do it is to provide additional discipline on the \nspending side of the equation and the revenue side of the equation, to \nsay if it is not paid for, it has to require a 60-vote hurdle, a \nsupermajority vote, for new taxes and for new spending that is not paid \nfor.\n  I note the Senator from New Jersey is seeking time. How much time \ndoes the Senator desire?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like about 20 minutes, if I may.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me yield 20 minutes off the resolution to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have listened to this debate with \ninterest. Frankly, if this were a theater, which it often is, I would \nstill be looking for the direction that this play is going to take.\n  When we look at the budget resolution before us, I think what we are \nseeing is downright deception. I think it is fair to say that those who \nlook at this budget resolution with favor and try to make the case for \nit are doing it, but I think it has a hollow ring to it.\n  There are a number of games being played, as our friends on the other \nside present their picture of this new budget. By way of example, there \nis 1 year of relief from the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, included \nin their calculation. This AMT will cost something over $650 billion to \nfix for a 10-year-period.\n\n  There is only $23 billion included for this year. There is only 1 \nyear of funding for continued military operations in the war against \nterrorism.\n  All Members know we speculate about where we will be going with our \nneeds in Iraq. It hardly seems reasonable to put out a $30 billion \nfigure that represents a single year when over a 10-year-period it is \nbelieved it will cost $280 billion.\n  The question is, What kind of accounting are we seeing in this \nbudgeting? Is the Bush administration following the practices we are \nseeing in the corporate world? The practices getting so much criticism, \nthe audit reports on Enron and Tyco and\n\n[[Page S2390]]\n\nWorldCom, are we following their example? Or perhaps they learned their \naccounting from the actions of our Government, which is making promises \nthat are so outrageous they will never be kept--cannot be met? If we \nhad a stock issued, I would say they were trying to push the stock \nprice; perhaps they are, but it is called electioneering.\n  It cannot be done. The people on their way to prosecution, the \nleadership in Tyco, Enron, or WorldCom, who are now being punished for \ntheir deception, have learned you can say all you want but when it \ncomes time to evaluating, it has to be in practical terms.\n  What happened? I served as the ranking member of the Budget Committee \nduring the period we moved from deficits to surpluses. I and so many \nothers were proud of our accomplishments. That is why it is so \ndisturbing for me to see all of our hard work undone. I tip my hat to \nour colleague from North Dakota who is now the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee for his hard work. It is never an easy assignment. It \nis fair to say that we feel compelled on our side to tell it like it \nis. What is going on is shameful.\n  Consideration of this budget resolution also provides a much needed \nopportunity to review the economic record of this administration. \nUnfortunately, the report card does not show a passing grade. We see it \nin the confidence that is lost by the public across this country. Why \nhas the confidence been lost? Because over 2 million jobs have been \nlost and people feel that.\n  Last Thursday or Friday we had a hearing at the Democratic Policy \nCommittee where we had unemployed workers talk about what life is like \nafter losing a job. They talked about a small company in Michigan where \nsome 2,700 people were employed in a town of about 9,000. The company, \nElectrolux, is packing their bags and going to Mexico.\n  The man who worked there for 23 years described the personal impact \nit had on him. He said: I have a daughter in college. I have two kids \nfollowing. I had health care taken care of. I paid my mortgage. I did \neverything I could for my family, held my head high, walked with \ndignity. Now my life has retreated into a shameful morass. He could \nbarely talk at one point because he was choking with tears.\n  He asked: What has happened? He said if a cyclone hit, the damage \nwould not be any less than closing this factory. Everything, the \ninfrastructure, the storekeepers, the gasoline station, everyone is \ngoing to feel this impact.\n  That does not affect what is happening in this administration. \nPresident Bush will be the first President to preside over a net job \nloss since Herbert Hoover was in office during the Depression. \nFortunately, or unfortunately, I am one of those people who lived \nthrough Herbert Hoover's presidency. You have to live a long time \nbecause Herbert Hoover was President at the end of the 1920s. He \nbrought panic and havoc to our society, our country.\n  It is astonishing, but there are fewer people at work today than when \nGeorge W. Bush was sworn in. Yet the country has grown substantially; \nthe population has increased.\n  To make matters worse, President Bush was given a 10-year surplus \nestimate of $5.6 trillion. Now CBO is projecting--and we do not hear \nanyone challenging it--CBO is projecting a $3.5 trillion Bush deficit \nfor the same period. That is a reversal of fortune of almost $9 \ntrillion. That change in direction is so gigantic, it cannot be \nhappenstance. It cannot be attributed to carelessness. It can only be \ndue to recklessness or by plan.\n\n  The plan is a grand scheme to shift the size of Government--this has \nbeen pledged by this administration--and the functioning of our \nGovernment while effecting a transfer of wealth hardly seen in \ncontemporary times, in a way often seen in the days of monarchies or \nrevolution, the transfer of wealth from the middle class and the poor \nto the wealthy.\n  I saw a statistic the other day in the newspaper that said in 1977, \nthe top 1 percent of the wage earners of this country earned as much as \nthe 49 percent at the lower end of the wage scale. In reverse terms, if \nyou took accumulated earnings of 49 percent of our people and put it in \na pot, it would have to be a giant pot, it would equal the 1 percent of \nthe people on the top end, people who had all of the means they needed. \nWorse, after 22 years, in 1999, that ratio shifted to 1 percent earning \nwhat 55 percent of the people earn; 55 percent all lumping their wages \nall together equals what 1 percent of our population is earning.\n  Substantial reductions in programs will directly affect people's \nincomes. If they cannot afford to get the babysitters, if they cannot \nafford to educate their children, if they cannot afford to take care of \ntheir wellness, if they cannot afford to see their health care needs \nare taken care of, that is a cut in income. It is deliberate. \nOtherwise, we would not have had a debate on whether overtime ought to \nbe stripped away from people who work hard and who depend on overtime \nas part of their ordinary compensation. But, no, we lost that debate \nhere because the Republicans in the House did not want to go along with \nit.\n\n  When we look at the budget, we cannot look at this budget out of the \ncontext of where we are as a society. Jobs are necessary. It is \nimportant we stop outsourcing our opportunity to create more jobs and \nmore income. It is not a happy picture.\n  Republican irresponsibility with regard to the Federal budget is \nthreatening the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare, \nright as the first cohort of baby boomers gets close to retirement age.\n  Everybody knows if your expenses are higher than your income, there \nis only one way to meet your obligations, and that is, to borrow it. \nThat is what we have done. What we are saying to people across the \ncountry is: Don't watch your spending. Just go ahead and borrow it. \nDoes that sound like good advice to kids who are growing up and \nlearning? I do not think so. Borrow it. Borrow it from Social Security. \nBorrow it from Medicare. That is what you do.\n  The fact that it could totally obliterate the ability of these \nprograms to carry on in future years does not seem to strike home, not \nas long as we can give tax cuts to ``fat cats.'' I speak as someone who \nhas had the good fortune of having been in business and having had a \nsuccess. I am going to get a tax break, I am told, of substantial \nproportion.\n  I do not want to be a showoff. I do not want that tax cut because \nthat is hardly a legacy that means anything to my children. I have 10 \ngrandchildren, the oldest of whom is 10. So their lives are way out in \nfront of them. What would I want to do, more than anything, for those \ngrandchildren of mine? It is to have a country that is stable, that is \nharmonious, where people are getting along, where everybody has a \nchance, where jobs are available, where when they get to retirement age \nthey know Social Security will be there for them, where they know their \nhealth care and their children's health care can be taken care of. \nThat, to me, is the legacy I would best and all of us would best leave \nour children.\n  For me to take a tax cut, for others here who have been financially \nsuccessful to take a tax cut, while the country is bleeding \nfinancially, while we steal it from Social Security and Medicare and \nother programs, while only half the 1.6 million kids who are eligible \nfor Head Start are enrolled--I took a minute today to learn a little \nmore about Head Start.\n  Head Start is for little kids who do not have the chance to \nunderstand what learning is about, maybe because they come from \npoverty-stricken homes, or perhaps they have a single parent, or maybe \nthere is not even a parent in the house, maybe they live with \ngrandparents. It is a program that teaches them there is more ahead in \nlife than they see in their own homes. It teaches them it is good to \nlearn. It teaches them when they get to school--and these are kids who \nare 3, 4, 5 years old--learning is a good objective. It teaches them \nsomething else, that there is a place where they can get some \nnutrition, get a meal or two, while they are in the care of those who \nare running the Head Start Program.\n  It also says something else to them: If you feel sick, you can see a \nnurse or a doctor. But even as you grow, what else can happen is you \ncan get care for your wellness. We can see things that might attack you \nphysically, diseases that are threatening. You can get injections or \ninoculations, and you can get a medication that will help the child \ngrow and develop.\n\n[[Page S2391]]\n\n  Mr. President, hundreds of thousands of those kids are going to lose \ntheir programs because ``fat cats,'' people who earn, on average, \n$1,000,000 a year, or the top asset holders in this country of ours, \nwill get a $100,000 tax cut. And it does not mean anything. When you \nare worth $10 million, $100,000 is not a difference in your life. So to \ndo that and take away care for hundreds of thousands of children in \nHead Start is outrageous.\n  We have other silly things going on. We decided in the budget we \nwould get rid of 2,000 meat inspectors, when we have mad cow running \naround and chickens dying of disease. Yes, cut down on the number of \npeople who are doing meat inspections. Take 25,000 cops off the street \nwho are now in the COPS Program.\n  I was in communities in New Jersey talking about what it means for a \ncommunity with a small police department to lose two, three, five, six \ncops who are there on the Federal program, to lose them and their law \nenforcement efforts as we try to fight crime and be on the alert for \nterrorism.\n\n  It says over 20,000 veterans, as a result of that tax cut for that \n``fat cat''--it almost has a rhyme, but there is no reason to it--it \nmeans 20,000-plus veterans will lose their health care.\n  I had the good fortune to serve in the Army in World War II a long \ntime ago in the European theater, and I know this: The people who count \nthe most on the Government's promises are those who serve us so \ngallantly in the military.\n  We had a visit the other night to Walter Reed Hospital and talked to \npeople who have been severely wounded, some with the loss of a limb, or \neven the loss of two limbs. One young man I spoke to was 23 years old. \nWhat is the prospect for his life? He will get a prosthesis that will \nhelp him get along, but we have to make sure the Medicare we give him \nis the best we can possibly do. But in this budget, there are cuts in \nVA health programs.\n  The administration will not take responsibility for the problems I \nhave just outlined. They do not even acknowledge these problems exist. \nThe Republican solution is to hide the direction and the cuts in vital \nprograms and hope no one is going to notice or deceive people with \nsleight-of-hand tricks, like starting a purportedly good----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, can I have 10 \nmore minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I give 10 more minutes off the resolution \nto the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my colleague from North Dakota.\n  We take a program such as the Medicare program that belted its way \nthrough this House, that made empty promises to people--but they are \ngoing to pay more. Everybody knows it. It is going to cost more, and \nthey are going to get less.\n  There is a battle about whether the administration can send out \ncirculars that purport to describe the benefits of this health care \nprogram. It is an election campaign distribution. We understand 36 \nmillion copies of a pretty circular, showing someone healthy and \npraising Medicare, are going out across the country. But they do not \nstart the program until 2006. Why is 2006 a magic number? Because in \n2004, as we all know, there is a big-time election, and we do not want \nto have an election after the new Medicare program has started because \nwhen people see it in action, they are going to be angry, they are \ngoing to be sore. They will not want to vote for anybody who is \nresponsible for that program being put in place.\n  We keep hearing that jobs are coming back. But the cold, hard facts \ncontradict this claim. The President trumpets the fact that 364,000 \njobs have been created since August. He says it is great news. But the \neconomy would have had to create over 1 million jobs just to keep pace \nwith new entrants into the labor force.\n  The President says this trickle of new jobs, which includes just \n21,000 in February--by the way, 20,000 of those are Government jobs--is \nproof that his tax cuts are working. They are not working. In May of \n2003, the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the CEA, said the \neconomy would create more than 2 million jobs in the first 7 months \nafter the tax cut was enacted. We happen to be short, just missed a \nlittle. We are only 1.7 million jobs short. The tax cuts are not \ncreating jobs. They are creating record budget deficits.\n  What is the solution? Some of my Republican colleagues wish to \nrecreate reality. They now say we have been using the wrong employment \nstatistics. They want to use the so-called household survey, not the \npayroll survey, which most economists, including Alan Greenspan, agree \nis the proper measure. He said:\n  Everything we've looked at suggests that it's the payroll data . . . \nwhich you have to follow.\n  As our friend and former colleague, Pat Moynihan, used to say: \nEverybody is entitled to their own opinions, but not entitled to their \nown facts.\n  We all would be better off if this administration and its allies in \nCongress would stop playing games to make the employment situation seem \nbetter than it really is. The bottom line is, 8 million Americans want \nto work but can't find a job.\n  Another example of the Republicans' utter inability to look at the \nfacts squarely: Budget deficits. Putting President Bush and fiscal \nresponsibility into the same sentence, frankly, is a challenge. \nPresident Bush has broken his father's dubious record by racking up the \nbiggest deficits in our country's history.\n  Initially he told us in 2001:\n\n       We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits.\n\n  What a statement that is. Then he said in 2002:\n\n       Our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short-\n     term.\n\n  Now the President boldly says: Well, we will halve the budget deficit \nin the next 5 years.\n  There are not a lot of believers about to support that.\n  In 2003, he had the audacity to say:\n\n       We will not pass our problems on to future generations.\n\n  Boy, if that was coming from a company with listed stock, I wouldn't \nbuy that stock, I will tell you. If we were depending on those kinds of \nstatements to make our way, we would be sitting with Martha Stewart \nsomeplace, suffering the same consequence. Not a single forecaster sees \na surplus anywhere in our future. In fact, as baby boomers begin to \nretire, the Bush budget deficit is set to skyrocket to 10 percent of \ngross domestic product and more over the next few decades. This deficit \nis huge by any standard, and it is growing by more than $2 billion each \nand every day, which explains why our outstanding public debt has \nsoared above $7 trillion for the first time in our Nation's history.\n  Some are saying deficits are due to the war on terror. The only \nproblem with that argument is we could eliminate the entire Defense \nDepartment and the entire Homeland Security Department and we still \nwouldn't get rid of the deficit. Other Republicans are saying the \ndeficit is due to rising discretionary spending. That is wrong. Even if \nwe eliminated every penny of domestic discretionary spending--that is \nvirtually the entire Government--we still would not get rid of the \nbudget deficit.\n\n  For the most part, the deficits have been caused by massive tax \nbreaks skewed to the wealthiest Americans, pure and simple.\n  The most cynical tactic this administration has used is their \nrepeated attempt to blame the economic mess they have created on the \nprevious administration. Again and again and again, we hear them say: \nPresident Bush inherited the recession. They say this knowing full well \nthe recession began in March of 2001. That is according to the \nnonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter \nof when recessions begin and end. As the saying goes: Facts are \nstubborn things.\n  The Republicans also argue that 9/11 caused the recession. Of course, \nclaiming that the recession began under President Clinton and that 9/11 \ncaused it are mutually contradictory and flat out wrong. These are some \nof the strategies of the present President, administration officials, \nand Republicans in\n\n[[Page S2392]]\n\nCongress to mislead the American people, to disguise the facts, to \ndistort reality, to pretend they are not responsible for the worst \neconomy in years.\n  The American people are smarter than to believe the administration's \npropaganda machine. They know they can't find jobs. They know deficits \nwill hurt the economy. They know their Social Security is in jeopardy.\n  Here is some truth: America simply cannot afford these ruinous \neconomic and fiscal policies any longer. We need a drastic change of \ncourse, and we need it soon. This budget resolution would be a good \nplace to start.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment offered by my friend from North \nDakota. I think we ought to have a 60-vote requirement for any more \ndeficit-increasing tax cuts that are to be made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I heard part of my colleague's speech, \nbut I will just say that budget resolutions are not easy. When I see \npeople holding up charts that have a picture of President Bush and \nanother one of Herbert Hoover and saying job loss and so on, that is \npolitics.\n  Enough with politics. Let's do our Nation's business. Let's pass a \nbudget. Some people seem to think this is a political free-for-all. We \nare going to have an election in November. We have plenty of time to do \npolitics. We have conventions in July, August, and September. That is \ntime enough. This is March. To be having a picture of the President of \nthe United States, and comparing him to Herbert Hoover, I find \noffensive. I find it so political, it is debasing to the Senate. I \nguess people have a right to do that, but enough is enough.\n  Let's stay with the business at hand instead of trying to score \npolitical points. I urge our colleagues to do that. I have never been a \nfan of charts, but my good friend, Senator Conrad, manufactures them on \na daily basis. I compliment him for it. But to have pictures and to use \nthose kinds of things denigrates our President. In my opinion, I am not \nsure it elevates the caliber of debate that we should have before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield to my colleague from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know Senator Nickles talked about the economy and who \nis responsible. We can all debate how much the President actually has \ninfluence over it. I don't know. But when President Roosevelt took \noffice, there was a high unemployment rate. I think it was 20 percent, \nor maybe it even increased under his administration initially. He \ninherited an economy that was in trouble. Is it not a fact that when \nPresident Bush took office, contrary to the myth that is out there, \nthat the third quarter of his last year in office was negative growth, \nand that the first quarter that President Bush inherited, before he had \nany time to do anything, was negative growth, and that President Bush \nactually inherited an economy that was in trouble?\n  That is a big part of some of the difficulties we have had today.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To respond to my colleague's question, maybe it is an \ninteresting analogy between President Bush and President Hoover. \nPresident Hoover was present when the market collapsed on that fateful \nday in October in 1929.\n  President Clinton was President when the market collapsed in March of \n2000. NASDAQ took a dive. The stock market took a dive and continued to \ndive throughout 2000.\n  I do not want to play that game, but I am offended when I see \npictures and hear those kinds of aspersions. I do not think it helps \nthe debate.\n  I agree with my colleague, that market crash was foretelling that we \nhad very significant problems coming, and it resulted in a lot of lost \nrevenue to the Government that no one projected, whether it be the \nWhite House or anybody else.\n  I appreciate my colleague. I want to elevate the caliber of the \ndebate and not be quite so political and quite so partisan so early.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is the Senator aware of the fact that when President \nRoosevelt took over, we had a 22-percent unemployment problem in 1933? \nHe succeeded in bringing unemployment down through Government programs, \nthrough all kinds of programs. But the fact is, he wanted to get people \nback to work.\n  I happen to remember my father was one of those people who had to \nresort shamefully to a Government program. He was embarrassed by it, \nbut he had to feed his family. That was more important. The fact is, I \nbelieve, the Senator would agree, that while the portrayal may not be \nto the Senator's liking, this is the administration that has lost more \njobs since the term of Herbert Hoover. Does the Senator dispute that \npoint?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I respond to my colleague, I am offended by the \npolitical partisan nonsense that is coming up with that picture and the \ntone of the debate. Let's have a good debate. But to cast aspersions--I \nam offended.\n  I am telling my colleague that I do not think we have to go to that \nlevel of partisanship. It is March. Why don't we do our Nation's \nbusiness and play politics in September, October, and November?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is my first time on the floor speaking on this \nparticular subject. I wish to thank the ranking member, Senator Conrad, \nfrom North Dakota.\n  I agree with my chairman that we should be here solving problems \ninstead of throwing salt on old wounds because we have a great \nchallenge ahead of us. There comes a time when we talk about all kinds \nof interests, but the national interest is more important right now \nthan at any time in our history.\n  We do have serious problems and challenges. I think every Senator in \nthis body has the capability and the will to solve some of those \nproblems so we can go home and we can couch the argument any way we \nwant on the political stump. I think we better add something to the \ndebate.\n  Last year was my first year on the Budget Committee. Of course, this \nis my second budget. I compliment the leadership of the committee on \nboth sides of the aisle because in committee we talked about some very \ncontentious issues, different ideas on how we approach the budget and \nhow it affects everyday life in the United States of America, knowing \nthere are circumstances that none of us had any control over and \nprobably will have a limited amount of effect on our country unless the \nAmerican people understand the circumstances in which we find \nourselves.\n  One has to remember the budget is a result of three different \nentities coming together and producing a document that reflects some of \ntheir priorities, some of their do-nots and some of their do-dos, and \nthat is working with the White House and this President and also \nworking with the Senate and the House and both sides of the aisle. That \nis what this product will reflect.\n  There are provisions in this resolution that probably do not find \nfavor with everybody, and there are some provisions in this resolution \nthat we do favor. Nonetheless, it will be a product of working with \neach other on this floor and also with the House of Representatives and \nwith this President that will produce this document, a budget \nresolution.\n  Nobody likes deficit spending. We went through that once before. Some \nof it was self-inflicted. This one was not self-inflicted, as far as \nour Government is concerned. It was a result of some circumstances that \nhappened to this country at a very inopportune time. No one could have \npredicted 9/11. Nobody could have predicted what that would cost or \nwhat that circumstance taught us.\n  It taught us one thing: that our economy is very fragile. \nCatastrophic events tend to shatter all other beliefs about what we do \nhere as far as our economy is concerned.\n  It also taught us that our freedoms are very fragile; that in times \nof stress and national emergency, some things are done by Government \nand by people to cope with the stress of the time.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 probably had more to do with putting us in this \npickle\n\n[[Page S2393]]\n\nthan anything around because of the normal reaction of Government and \nAmericans to that event.\n  What we have to look at most is that this budget reflects much of the \nPresident's proposals, but because of caps that were put in place a \nyear ago, we are looking at some tough choices.\n  This budget takes steps to reduce Federal deficit spending; in other \nwords, slow it down, much slower than first thought when we started \ninto the process or what you have read in the newspapers or heard on \ntelevision. We just have to slow it down. It is kind of like the fellow \nwho one day got up and said: My day started off bad, and then it just \ntapered off.\n  Sometimes in the budget process--and my good friend from North Dakota \nhas been in this process much longer than I and knows much more about \nit, the technical parts of it anyway, but nonetheless there are some \ndays you get nothing for your labor.\n  The resolution cuts the deficit from an estimated, some people say \nover $500 billion. We had a figure of around $477 billion going into \nthe process. Now looking at the figure, it will be around $477 billion \nthis year, but we are going to get it down much lower than that by the \nyear 2005.\n  The resolution prevents tax increases that would go into effect if \nCongress does not act. Those taxes and those tax cuts were very \nimportant to this country. How much deficit would we have had we not \nhad them to spur this economy and see the growth not only in the New \nYork Stock Exchange but NASDAQ.\n  We have seen growth in agriculture. Agricultural products are doing \nvery well now in most sectors. As I go across my State of Montana, we \ncan talk about marriage penalty relief, we can talk about child tax \ncredits, but I will tell you what has helped my State more than \nanything else, especially my agricultural producers and my small \nbusinesspeople--and Montana is made up of small business; small \nbusiness provides the vast majority of jobs in my State--was \naccelerated depreciation because there have been capital expenditures \nto revamp or redo the way they do business and how they do business. \nAccelerated depreciation was the shot we needed in the State of \nMontana.\n  By the way, those recommendations came out of the Small Business \nCommittee of which Senator Kit Bond of Missouri is the chairman. You \nlook for those opportunities when we start talking about small business \nor business in general.\n  The economy is growing at a steady pace, and I believe this budget \nwill be reflective of that growth and show the importance to the \nAmerican people to expand jobs.\n  If we take a look at the GDP and our national debt and our deficit \nspending, right now it is something we can handle, but we cannot allow \nit to continue. So we moved in that direction. I think the resolution \nwill provide important assistance not only to Government through strong \nfiscal responsibility but also the American people through improved \njobs and job environment, and private growth and opportunity.\n  If we look at the household surveys on unemployment, we are going to \nfind a lot of folks are working out of their homes. We see small \nbusinesses perking up everywhere, primarily because of the tax \nsituation. This is a good time to move in and maybe retire from a job \nand start one's own business.\n  So we have asked the American people to sacrifice because we are \nfacing an enemy we have never had to face before. We have never had to \ntake on terrorism as have other countries that have been putting up \nwith it for a long time. As a result, we have said to the American \npeople that some sacrifice is needed, and I think the American people \nhave responded to that because we know we have a different kind of \nenemy that wants to take away our freedoms, not only the economic \nfreedoms we enjoy but also our political freedoms.\n  They do it by fear. That is the worst kind of enemy, that operates in \nthe shadows and complete surprise. They have no regard for age or who \none is, combatants or noncombatants. In other words, they are \ncompletely indiscriminate as far as their targets are concerned. That \nspreads fear among people, and fear rules us.\n  I made the remark the other day to some visitors in Washington, DC, \nthat I can remember when I first came to Washington, it was a very \nbeautiful place. Right now we are moving into a season where Washington \nreally is very pretty, but we are ugly today because of jersey \nbarriers, security and construction. We are not a very nice place \nbecause of what we have to go through in order for this Government and \nits representatives to operate. So the sacrifices that are made not \nonly here but in the whole country are difficult. We have asked America \nto sacrifice in these times, and they have responded.\n  Our young men and women who are still in the field face an unusual \ntype of enemy. They are facing it with great professionalism and great \ncourage. I think we ought to demonstrate the same kind of courage on \nthis floor, to do what we have to do in order to balance this budget, \nin order to present a budget we can live with so the economy continues \nto grow and we can grow out of this situation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will make the point once again as to the \ngreat concern I have about both the President's budget and the budget \nthat has come out of the Budget Committee, and that is it adds \ndramatically to the national debt right before the baby boom generation \nstarts to retire. I look at the President's budget, and in the 5 years \nthat he has proposed, he will add $3 trillion to the national debt. \nWhen I look at the budget proposal from the Budget Committee, it adds \nalmost as much, $2.86 trillion to the national debt over that same 5 \nyears.\n  I hear the other side saying we are cutting the deficit in half. \nWell, maybe they are cutting the deficit in half but the increases in \nthe debt are not being reduced hardly at all. If we look at this chart, \nin 2004 the debt subject to limit, that is the gross debt of the United \nStates, is $7.4 trillion.\n  Under this budget, they will add over $600 billion to the debt. The \nnext year, they will add nearly $600 billion to the debt, $569 billion. \nThe next year, they will add $552 billion to the debt. The next year, \nthey will add $563 billion to the debt. And out here, in 2008, between \n2008 and 2009, they will add another $563 billion to the debt.\n  How can it be that these two statements are both right? How can it be \nthey say they are going to reduce the deficit, they are going to cut it \nin half, and on the other hand the increases in the debt are hardly \nbeing reduced at all? The biggest reason is the Social Security trust \nfunds that are being taken. Over this 5-year period, hundreds and \nhundreds of billions of dollars of Social Security trust fund money is \nbeing borrowed and is being used to pay for tax cuts and other things. \nIt is, in effect, hiding from us our true fiscal condition.\n  The hard reality is the increases to the debt are not being reduced \nby this budget proposal. In fact, the debt is being run up and, as I \nhave said many times, that is at the worst possible time, right before \nthe baby boomers retire. That is why I think the amendment I put before \nour colleagues is so important, because it adds discipline. It says: \nLook, we can't do new mandatory spending--and that is two-thirds of \nFederal spending--and we can't do new tax cuts that are not paid for, \nwithout a 60-vote supermajority, until we stop taking the Social \nSecurity fund and using it to pay for the operating expenses of the \nFederal Government.\n  This reminds me so much of what has happened in the corporate sector \nwhen these various companies--Enron most notably, WorldCom the same \nway--understated how far underwater they really were. They were \nbasically hiding their debt from the shareholders, hiding the debt from \ninvestors, hiding the debt maybe even from themselves. I see some of \nthat same pattern occurring here.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is here. How much time does the Senator \nrequire?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like 15 or 20 minutes.\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota, off \nthe resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first let me compliment my colleague, \nSenator Conrad, for the work he has done. Let me also pay tribute to my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles. While we might disagree on a \ngood many issues, Senator Nickles has been someone who has contributed \nsubstantially to this Chamber through his service in the Senate. I note \nhe is leaving the Senate at the end of this year and I want to pay my \ncompliments to Senator Nickles.\n  There is a tendency in this Chamber, I think, for us to treat the \nserious too lightly and the light too seriously. It is very hard to \noverestimate the importance of this fiscal policy that is completely \noff track, completely out of sync with reality. We have until recently \nhad a fiscal policy that said: Here is what we will do. We will \nincrease defense spending a great deal, we will increase spending on \nhomeland security a substantial amount, we will cut taxes, cut taxes, \ncut taxes again, and then we will hope the economy grows enough to \ncover all of that.\n  The fact is the economy has not grown to cover all of that and we now \nhave sunk into the largest Federal budget deficits in the history of \nour country. But some don't want to admit that we are there. They want \nto ignore it and continue to say this is not a problem, we will just \ngrow out of this.\n  We have a responsibility now to address these issues. It is \nirresponsible for us to say, let's just do it all and let the kids \nworry about this, or let the grandkids worry about it.\n  We are technically capable of doing so many things. Today, on \nTuesday, we have two little vehicles--made in this country--scrounging \naround the surface of Mars, controlled by some controllers in NASA, and \nwe are picking up rocks and analyzing rocks on the surface of Mars. \nWhat a remarkable thing. By the way, I might say just from the pictures \nI have seen from Mars it looks like a place about 5 miles south of my \nhometown. But we spent a lot of money to get to Mars, I want them to do \nwell with these experiments, and I think they are wonderful. I think it \nis quite remarkable, the technology we have to put vehicles on Mars.\n  Why is it we are technically capable of doing these breathtaking \nthings and then we seem so unable to come to the floor of the Senate \nand at least admit that there is a giant problem in fiscal policy? We \nare far off track. Just 3 years ago, we had very large surpluses and \nAlan Greenspan couldn't even sleep at night because he was worried \nthese surpluses would be too big. He didn't know what we could do with \nthem. Three years later, of course, we now find the largest deficits in \nthe history of this country stretching out as far as the eye can see, \nstretching out every single year for the next decade.\n  The budget brought to the floor of the Senate by the majority party \nsays the following: We will take the Federal debt to $10.2 trillion by \nthe year 2009. Let's see if we can ratchet this debt up to $10.2 \ntrillion. It says let's have a deficit this year of $512 billion. Let's \nhave a deficit next year of $445 billion; the year after, let's have a \nFederal budget deficit of $431 billion; the year following that, let's \nhave a Federal budget deficit of $441 billion; and the year following \nthat, the fifth year, the last year for this budget resolution, let's \nhave a budget deficit of $439 billion. This is not a budget that \ntackles problems. This retreats from the problems and from the \nchallenge.\n\n  There is a circumstance that has occurred in this country that should \nrequire all of us to be more serious about this: We ran into a \nrecession. It began in the spring of 2001. Precisely, it began in March \n2001. Following that recession we were the victims of a terrorist \nattack on 9/11. Then we had to fight a war against terrorism. Following \nthat attack against our country the entire aviation industry was \ngrounded. It had a profound impact on our economy. Then we were \ninvolved in Afghanistan and a war in Iraq. We have had some pretty \ntough times and some big challenges.\n  But the administration has said and the majority party has said we \ncan do all of this. We can and should and will increase defense \nspending. We can, should and will increase spending on homeland \nsecurity. And we will cut your taxes again and again and, if the \nRepublicans get their way, again this year. And it will not matter \nbecause it will all add up.\n  This is like the old story in the movies, what are you going to \nbelieve, me or your own eyes? Your own eyes will tell you what is in \nthis document. It says let's take this country to $10.2 trillion in \ndebt in 2009. The question is, when will the Congress, and especially \nwhen will the President, be serious about these policies?\n  It is interesting that the budget sent to us by the President this \nyear predicted we would spend zero, no money at all, for Afghanistan \nand Iraq. We have been spending very close to $5 billion a month in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. Last year I raised the same question. If we are \nspending money, why don't we budget for it? The answer is, we don't \nknow how much to budget. We do know what we are spending, we are \nspending $5 billion a month, $60 billion a year. Do you know what these \ndocuments from the President and the majority say? It says zero, we are \nnot spending anything. What do they mean? They will just hide it by \ncoming up with a supplemental bill later on, I suppose after the \nelection, and we will act as if it doesn't matter.\n  It does matter. It is saying to the kids, you go ahead and pay this \nbill because we don't have the courage to do it. We don't want to pay \nfor it. We don't intend to pay for it. We will ask you kids to pay for \nit when you are old enough to work and pay taxes and inherit this debt.\n  There are many issues to discuss with respect to the budget. My \ncolleague has offered an amendment that I came to support, dealing with \nSocial Security trust funds. This is certainly the biggest bait-and-\nswitch operation in the history of mankind. The bait and switch that \nhas been going on says the following: When you work, you pay a tax from \nyour paycheck and we will tell you this, we will guarantee you we will \nput that money in a trust fund called the Social Security trust fund. \nThen, when you get to the point where you are retiring, we will have \nsufficient moneys in the trust fund to be able to meet those retirement \nneeds.\n\n  The problem is the trust fund at this point is not accepting new \nmoney because all the new money being taken from paychecks in the form \nof Social Security taxes is being used as an offset for other spending.\n  We had people genuflecting on the floor of the Senate about lockboxes \nfor the last 4 or 5 years. They would come to the floor and have an \napoplectic seizure about some lockbox they wanted to create for Social \nSecurity. There is no lockbox. The box is open and all the money is \ngone because budgets like this say we are going to spend all that \nmoney. The only priority with this is to preserve the tax cuts that \nwent to upper-income Americans.\n  I think it is wonderful if you are an upper-income American. Look, if \nyou make $100 million or $10 million or $1 million a year, God bless \nyou, this is a great country and you have a right to do that and I \ncongratulate you on your success. But I would say I expect as an \nAmerican you would also want to contribute to this country, and part of \nthat contribution is to pay for that which we need--a war on terrorism \nand money to fund the troops when we send them overseas to protect this \ncountry. All of these issues are important issues that we have to \nprovide for. When we also protect these upper income tax cuts, we spend \nthe Social Security trust fund. This makes no sense at all. That is a \nclassic bait and switch.\n\n  This reminds me of an old story about elephants. When I was a young \nkid, I grew up in a very small town. But even though it was a small \ntown of 400 or 500 people, we occasionally had a circus come to town. \nIt was a relatively small circus but they at least had one elephant. I \nnever quite understood as a kid why a very large elephant would stand \nin one place if they just put a cuff around the elephant's back foot \nand then a chain with one little steel stake driven into the ground. \nHow on Earth would that keep an elephant from escaping?\n  Then I read about how they do that. They do it in Thailand where they \ncapture these elephants in the wild and then find a big banyan tree. \nThey put a\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\nbig steel cuff on the elephant's leg and they chain that big steel cuff \nto a huge banyan tree. For a week that elephant will struggle and grunt \nand grown and fight and try to pull away from that banyan tree. But it \ncan't. It doesn't get away from that banyan tree. In a while, it learns \nit is there permanently as long as that chain is on its leg, as long as \nthat cuff exists. Then they take the other end of the banyan tree and \nput a stake in the ground and the elephant will never move because the \nelephant is chained to his habit. The elephant knows it can't move. So \nit doesn't move.\n  A big chain to a habit is what I see in this Chamber by the majority \nparty. They say it doesn't matter what the facts are, it doesn't matter \nwhat the deficits are, it doesn't matter that we are off the ditch with \nrespect to fiscal policy. We are going to pretend and act as if things \nare just fine, that things are going along just fine.\n  Those who will pay the cost of this, in my judgment, will be people \n5, 15, 25, and 40 years from now and who will bear the consequences of \nan irresponsible fiscal policy.\n  My colleague has offered an amendment that says: Look, let's prohibit \nthe use of Social Security trust funds except for the purpose they were \nintended to be used. Radical? No. I don't think so. Obviously, there is \nsome common sense to do that.\n  I don't expect that this amendment will pass the Senate when it is \nvoted on because the majority party has to protect the fiscal policy \ndespite the fact that all the evidence is this fiscal policy doesn't \nwork. We have an economy that is not producing jobs. We have an economy \nthat is not providing the opportunity we expect it to provide and that \nthe administration said it would provide. Why? I have some theories \nabout that.\n  We held a hearing last Friday on the question of why American jobs \nare shipped overseas in large quantities. Why do we see all of these \nannouncements about companies that used to make American coats are now \nproducing them overseas? Did you know that the Levis you are wearing \nare not American pants? If you are wearing Fruit of the Loom, you are \nnot wearing American underwear. Did you know that if you are eating Fig \nNewtons, you are eating Mexican Fig Newtons? Yes. They are not produced \nin America--not even Fig Newton cookies.\n\n  The question is, Why are we exporting all of these jobs overseas? \nWhat kind of economy is it that says we have economic growth in this \ncountry but we are not producing new jobs? The new jobs are being \ncreated in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, China, and Mexico.\n  This is a failed economic strategy, a set of failed economic \npolicies, and all you have to do is go to the budget document.\n  Page 4 of this document, which comes from the majority party, says \nthe following. Let us increase the Federal debt to $10.2 trillion by \nthe year 2009. They say, let us every year between now and then have a \nFederal budget deficit over $400 billion. That is over $1.5 billion a \nday every single day for the next 4 to 5 years. This isn't a budget \ndocument; this is a failure.\n  It is a failure of responsibility to own up to what is happening in \nthis country and to fix it not just on behalf of politicians but on \nbehalf of the American people and their children who aspire to have a \ncountry that expands the most opportunity and new jobs and growth once \nagain.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for taking the \nfloor to bring this to our attention. I would like to ask him this \nquestion.\n  Was it not during the last 2 weeks that the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, Alan Greenspan, who has been Chairman under both Democratic \nand Republican Parties, testified before the House of Representatives, \nI believe the Budget Committee, suggesting we have now reached a point \nbecause of our deficit situation and the debt of America when we have \nto seriously consider structural changes in Social Security relative to \nthe benefits paid out to senior citizens and their retirement age? Does \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who had endorsed President Bush's \ntax cuts for the wealthiest people in America, now say we are in such a \ndesperate situation that we have to turn to Social Security and to cut \nback in terms of potential benefits for future recipients?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois is absolutely \ncorrect. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, did \ntestify and say that we have to look at cutting Social Security \nbenefits.\n  I find it interesting that Mr. Greenspan, who was actually shaking \nthe pom-poms in support of the tax cut and this administration's fiscal \npolicy, is now saying part of the cost of the policy should be for us \nnow to consider cutting Social Security for senior citizens.\n  Look, their fiscal policy has provided the largest rewards in history \nin the form of tax cuts for upper income Americans. We have one-half of \nthe world's billionaires living in this country. Good for them. I wish \nI were one of them. I wish my colleague from Illinois was among them, \nand I wish my colleague from Wyoming was among them. But it seems to me \nthose who have done so well in this country would want to help pay the \nbill.\n\n  Promoting tax cuts for the upper income folks, those at the very top \nof the ladder--for example, those who have $1 million a year in \nincome--and saying during these tough times you get $80,000 a year in \ntax cuts makes no sense to me. Yet Chairman Greenspan supported that, \nand he now comes back and says--he doesn't say it quite this way but \nthe cause and effect are the same--we don't have the money now. We gave \nmoney in terms of tax cuts to the folks who make $1 million a year. Now \nwe should ask the folks at the other end of the ladder to take a cut in \nSocial Security benefits. I don't understand that.\n  In my judgment, when we talk about fuzzy math, this isn't fuzzy; this \nis vacant math.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would further yield for a question through \nthe Chair, last week Paul Krugman, wrote an article for the New York \nTimes entitled, ``Maestro of Chutzpah'' directed toward Mr. Alan \nGreenspan, which addressed this issue.\n  Mr. Greenspan came before Congress endorsing President Bush's tax \ncuts for the wealthiest people in America and now that we have rid the \nworld of those tax cuts which have created record deficits that we have \nnever seen in the history of the United States, Mr. Greenspan is now \ncoming back to us saying the way to start resolving these budget \nproblems is to cut Social Security benefits.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota if he would respond to whether \nKrugman accurately notes that during the 1980s it was the Greenspan \ncommission that persuaded Congress to increase the payroll tax for \nSocial Security which supports the program, a tax which is regressive, \nfalls more heavily on middle- and lower-income families.\n  In fact, Mr. Krugman goes on to write that Greenspan's suggestion in \nthe 1980s that raised the retirement age in America and raised the \npayroll taxes in America is generating record surpluses in the Social \nSecurity trust fund with the regressive payroll tax. Now that Social \nSecurity has generated the money it needs, it is Mr. Greenspan who says \nnow we need to reach into the Social Security trust fund and make \ncertain we pay off our debt, and also we need to cut benefits and raise \nthe retirement age even further.\n\n  I ask my friend from North Dakota, the Senator who has come to the \nSenate to address this issue, is it disingenuous for Mr. Greenspan to, \non the one hand, call for higher payroll taxes so the Social Security \ntrust fund grows, and then when it grows to such a point, to allow tax \ncuts to be funded by Social Security trust fund that go to the \nwealthiest people in America? The working families are paying into the \nSocial Security trust fund, but it is the wealthy families who are \ntaking the money out from the Bush tax cuts.\n  I ask the Senator his response.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As always, the Senator from Illinois creates the \ncalculation exactly the right way. It is true the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board chaired the commission in the early 1980s that \ndecided to collect more money in the Social Security trust fund than \nwas necessary to meet current expenses. Why? Because when the war \nbabies or the baby boomers retire,\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\nwe will have the largest crop of babies ever produced in this country \nwho will hit the retirement rolls, and we need to save for that day. In \nfact, it was the Greenspan commission that recommended that. Congress \nembraced that.\n  Now Mr. Greenspan comes back to the Congress and says you are using \nall that money for tax cuts for upper income Americans and you are \nincreasing defense, increasing homeland security, and telling people \nyou do not have to pay for that. So now why don't we cut Social \nSecurity payments for the elderly.\n  There is an old song in that movie, ``Where have you been, Joe \nDiMaggio?'' We ought to ask the question, Where have you been, Alan \nGreenspan? It seems to me that as the construct of this fiscal policy \nhas become clearer and clearer, I would have expected the Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board perhaps to send some warning signs.\n  I finished the book ``The Price of Loyalty,'' written by Mr. Suskind. \nWhat he says, according to former Treasury Secretary O'Neill, is that \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is a critic of this fiscal \npolicy in private while being supportive of this fiscal policy in \npublic. A wrong approach.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield myself an additional 10 minutes on the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might continue, in the same book, it notes Chairman \nGreenspan and Treasury Secretary O'Neill had several ideas. One of them \nwas a trigger which said there will not be any tax cuts if the surplus \ndisappears. The surplus is long gone. Later Lindsay and other economic \nadvisers, including the President, resisted this idea of trigger.\n  Second, the book notes it was the plan of Chairman Greenspan to take \n$1 trillion out of the surplus and frankly make certain Social Security \nwould be stronger for that much longer period of time. Yet we now have \nthis same Chairman of the Federal Reserve who is telling us that absent \nboth of those happening, he now has the solution, and the solution is a \nlater retirement age and cutting the benefits out of Social Security to \npay for the Bush deficit created by the Bush tax cuts for wealthy \npeople.\n\n  How can it be fair to senior citizens who paid into Social Security \ntheir entire lives, who receive rather modest returns for that, to be \ntold they should receive even less so people in the highest income \ncategories can end up receiving these Bush tax cuts?\n  If I am not mistaken, this warped logic is continued by the \nRepublican budget which is presented in the Senate. I ask the Senator \nfrom North Dakota if he could respond to that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the budget that is presented in the Senate \nhas on page 5 their estimate of what the debt should be in the year \n2009. This is recommended policy. By 2009, we should have a debt of \n$10.2 trillion, they recommend. Every year getting there we should have \nbudget deficits, each and every year, of over $400 billion a year.\n  Maybe it is something in the water. Maybe it is the food. One would \nexpect there to be some conservative impulses here to decide that a \nfiscal policy ought to add up. This simply does not add up.\n  I mention one additional point. It was not very long ago when the \nSenate considered a proposal to spend a substantial amount of money, \n$20 billion--do you know how hard it is to get $20 billion for \nanything? It is a huge amount of money. The proposal was to spend $20 \nbillion to reconstruct the country of Iraq. We must have it, they said. \nWe won't pay for it; just have to have it.\n  I said, Iraq has the third largest reserves of oil in the world. The \nIraqis can pump their oil and pay for their own reconstruction.\n  They said, We will not hear any of that. We demand the $20 billion. \nThe majority party, the same folks who have written this budget said, \nwe demand that money. We do not want to pay for it, just borrow it and \nspend it in the country of Iraq for reconstruction.\n  It is the kind of thing that if you did not know where the desks were \nplaced in this Chamber you would not recognize who was saying this.\n  There is no common sense with respect to this kind of a budget \ndocument. This fiscal policy is radically off track and the quicker we \nstop, say wait, this has to somehow add up or this country will bear \nthe consequences--this somehow has to make sense.\n  Let me conclude by making this point. We have a lot of people who \nthink they know how the economy works and yet the Treasury Secretary \nsaid he is mystified. I used to teach economics and I am not sure I \nknow how it works, but I know despite all the judgments about fiscal \nand monetary policies, this economy moves forward when the American \npeople are confident about the future. If citizens are confident about \nthe future, they do things that manifest that confidence and there is \nan expansion of the economy. They buy a house, buy a home, take a trip, \ndo the things that expand the economy. If citizens are not confident, \nthey do exactly the opposite and the economy contracts.\n\n  The biggest problem we have, in my judgment, is that it is very hard \nfor the American people to take a look at this fiscal policy--deficits \nas far as the eye can see, the largest in American history, a $10.2 \ntrillion debt--and conclude, yes, that works all right for us. Instead, \nthis looks to them like a bunch of politicians who have their heads in \nthe sand.\n  I came to the floor to support the amendment my colleague from North \nDakota offered dealing with Social Security trust funds. I am happy to \ndo that. After having debates in the Senate for about 5 years on the \nsubject of lockbox, there is not a lockbox in sight. If there was a \nbox, there would be no lock in site. Every single penny of money \ncollected for Social Security is being used to give tax cuts to upper \nincome folks and defend spending in homeland security because this \nmajority party says you can do it all, do not worry, charge it to the \nkids. That is irresponsible fiscal policy and one we need to change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes and ask it be \ncharged against the budget debate itself and not the amendment on the \nRepublican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of discussion about \nhow important eliminating the deficit is. I could not agree more. We do \nneed to eliminate the deficit. The reason we have a deficit today is \nbecause this Senate has refused to make tough choices about spending.\n  I make the point that when President Bush assumed office, he came \ninto office when the economy was starting to move down. I don't think \nanybody can dispute that. When he took office, he was challenged as \nmuch as any President in recent history because not only was the \neconomy turning down--and, I might add, with an unprecedented turndown \nof 2 to 3 years consecutively--but then on top of that we had the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attack. We went to conflict in Afghanistan, as \nwell as Iraq. It has been a tough time for this President.\n  Fortunately, this country has had strong leadership. Without that \nstrong leadership, I would hate to imagine where we might be today.\n  We look at the combination of all these events as having an impact on \nrevenues coming into the Federal Government. They had an impact on \nspending. I have been a supporter of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, as have many Members of the Senate, but there has always \nbeen a provision in times of conflict that there would be an exception \nto balance the budget. This is one of those exceptions in time caused \nby the attack on September 11 against the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. \nThen we lost a plane in the Midwest. Heroic, Americans on that plane \ntried to take over that particular plane. So I think it is \nunderstandable why the Senate and the House would decide we need to \nappropriate some dollars to take care of this time of conflict.\n\n  If we look back, the spending was probably the second most \nsignificant thing that contributed to our shortfall\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\nas far as eliminating the deficit. The most significant factor was the \nrecession.\n  An analysis has been made by the Joint Economic Committee that has \nindicated that at least 40 percent--and there are other estimates of at \nleast 49 percent--of the deficit can be attributed to this \nunprecedented recession.\n  Then, second in line is the amount of spending we have had, somewhere \naround 35 percent, if my memory serves me correctly. I might be off a \nfew percentage points. And then somewhere around 25, 26, 27 percent--in \nthat area--was attributed to the tax cuts we put in place.\n  The problem has been basically the turndown in the economy and the \namount of spending. I think it is all too easy to go ahead and \ncriticize the tax cuts and ignore the major reasons as to why we are \nhaving a shortfall in the deficit. I happen to think the tax package we \npassed when the President was first elected, and then we came back and \npassed an economic stimulus package, and then last year we passed \nanother package of tax cuts, really did stimulate the economy.\n  We are going to have amendment after amendment on the floor saying we \nought to increase spending and increase taxes. I think it is the wrong \nway to go. I think if we raise taxes, as our economy is showing signs \nof recovery, it sends the wrong message, and that later on this year we \nwill find our economy still struggling and trying to work its way out \nof this economic downturn. But if we can sustain these tax cuts--in \nfact, even those that are expiring, if we go ahead and renew those, I \nthink it will instill confidence in our economy and that we can expect \nit to continue to do well for the rest of the year.\n  I think the American workers need a break. Frankly, they send a lot \nof money to Washington. The producers of this country send a lot of \nmoney to Washington. From our colleagues on the other side, we hear all \nabout how they want to go ahead and tax the wealthy, the upper 10 \npercent or the upper 1 percent, and then provide some program of \nsustained spending that is never going to quit. It is going to continue \nto grow.\n  If we look at our tax policy, we put taxes in on a temporary period \nof time--10 years most of them--and then they go away. In our spending \nprograms, we put them in place, and they just seem to go on and on and \non.\n  If we look at what happens to those tax figures as we go out in time \nin the budget, and we look at what happens to the spending figures as \nwe go out in time from this year, the spending increases at a greater \nrate than the cost from the tax cuts. In other words, if we were to \nspend an equal amount of money for tax cuts and an equal amount of \nmoney for one of the spending programs, as it moves out over time, \nthere is a discrepancy that develops, and spending increases at a \ngreater rate than what happens with the tax cut.\n  I think it is something we need to do. I think it would be shameful \nif we abandoned the President's plan for economic growth, particularly \nwhen the economy is starting to recover.\n  There are those who would argue they do not think the jobs are coming \nor growing as fast as they would like to see. I agree, we would all \nlike to see the jobs grow faster, but the fact is we are getting job \nrecovery.\n\n  If we look at the household survey, for example, for a number of \nmonths now--close to 9 months--we have seen some phenomenal growth. Why \nis the household survey important? Because it measures small business. \nIt measures individuals who are out producing on their own, or a few \npeople are out producing on their own. There is no salary. They are all \nin together. They decide to start a company or provide a service.\n  I am a veterinarian. A lot of them are veterinarians. They are a \nsingle-person practice. They are going out there and taking care of the \nneeds of the community, and they are working and creating revenue for \ntheir family. They pay property taxes. They are supporting their \ncommunity. But they never get counted, except in the household survey, \nbecause they may very well be operating out of their home.\n  We have a plethora of small businesses that work that way. We have \nseen this growth. I think a good percentage of that growth has been so \nphenomenal that they are trying to come up with an explanation for it.\n  Here is my conclusion. I think when we had the downturn in the high-\ntech sector of our economy, many of those individuals left their former \nemployers with some kind of bonus when they separated, so they had this \npocket full of cash. They did not have a job, so they thought: Here is \na great opportunity for me to go into business for myself.\n  A lot of these businesses are things that can sustain themselves if \nyou have a good computer system and you can run it out of your home. \nYour costs are minimal. It is a great opportunity for an entrepreneur \nto take some idea he may have and start a business for himself, with a \nrelatively inexpensive operation, and running it out of his home. That \nis the American dream.\n  This is the small business sector. This is where Americans have hope \nnot only of owning their own home, but also of going into business for \nthemselves. A lot of them have this desire.\n  I think when we saw the downturn and a separation of many employees \nfrom high-tech companies, they took the separation bonuses they were \ngetting and took this opportunity to go into business for themselves. I \nthink that is great. That is the strength of America.\n  Now let's look at the payroll survey. The payroll survey in the last \ncouple months has been showing a growth. That is the last parameter, \nhistorically, that you see happen when the economy is recovering. I \nthink that is great.\n  We saw job growth this month. Maybe it was not as great as some would \nlike to see it. The previous month was a phenomenal figure; in fact, it \nled to some pretty optimistic projections on job growth this month that \ndid not occur. But I think over time we are going to continue to see \nthis growth in jobs. I think that is very important to the recovery \nefforts, and our tax cuts have contributed to that. We recognize this \nin the budget which the Republican Budget Committee has proposed and \nbrought to the floor. I think it is one that recognizes our economy is \nstarting to recover.\n  This economic growth is going to help us eliminate some of our \ndeficit problems. I am optimistic about that. I think we made some \ntough decisions in this budget when we made some spending decisions.\n  Last year, I told the chairman of the Budget Committee that we simply \nhad to have a plan on how we were going to eliminate the deficit. \nObviously, we had to limit the spending parameters. So the Budget \nCommittee went ahead, last year, with a plan as to how to pay down the \ndeficit. What I was watching for this year was to make sure we stayed \non plan to eliminate that deficit within 10 years. And we are well \nwithin the plan.\n  I was pleased, at the first of this year, when the President endorsed \nthe idea that we needed to have a plan to pay down the deficit. The \nplan he put forward was a 5-year plan. It said, as a percentage of \ngross domestic product--which is probably, from an economist point of \nview, a very realistic way of looking at the impact of our deficit on \nthe economy--that in 5 years we want to eliminate it by one-half.\n  I looked at those figures and, lo and behold, the nominal rate was \nalso reduced in half. Now, this is the actual dollar figure. The Budget \nCommittee did better than that. They eliminated the plan. They did \nbetter than that. They reached about where the President was in about 3 \nyears or so. And both the figures--as a percent of gross domestic \nproduct and nominally speaking, where we look at actual dollars--has \ngot us well on the way to eliminating the deficit.\n  I am proud to support this budget because we are taking a realistic \napproach.\n  Spending is a problem. We are going to have to take a serious look at \nspending. I remember when we passed the budget in 2000, the last year \nof the Clinton administration, we were trying to adjourn the Congress. \nIn the last few days of that session, we passed over $500 billion in \nnew spending. We had to compromise with then-President Clinton on a lot \nof his spending priorities. He was moving out of office. We were trying \nto get out of session so we could move on with the election. That $500\n\n[[Page S2398]]\n\nbillion in new spending over a 10-year period is now coming home to \nroost.\n  We are beginning to see phenomenal growth in spending in programs. It \nstrikes me how many people believe we need to do more spending. If we \nlook out at producers in the country, the taxpayers, they are having to \ntake cuts. Many of them are losing their jobs. Yet the agencies can't \nafford to take a cut. Even the President's budget, as austere as it is, \ntakes care of defense needs. We are in conflict. It takes care of \nhomeland security to protect the country, and we should put our efforts \ninto that. It is a very small increase in the rest of the budget, about \n.5 percent.\n  The fact is, there is still an increase in spending. While the rest \nof the country is suffering reductions in their household spending, the \nGovernment still claims it needs increases year after year, despite \nwhat happens to the economy.\n  There are going to have to be some serious decisions made about \nspending programs. Some of those decisions are going to be made this \nyear. That is a step in the right direction. We need to look at what it \nis we can put in place as a policy for the Senate and the Congress to \nhold down spending. In 2002, a number of provisions we had adopted that \nwould help us restrain spending in the Congress, help us restrain \nspending on the Senate side, expired. When they expired, we all of a \nsudden began to see spending increases. We needed to have budget \nparameters. Thankfully we began to put them in place in the last \nbudget, and we are going to put them in place now with this budget.\n  I know the chairman committed during our Budget Committee \ndeliberations he would work with the ranking member to see if they \ncannot put together legislation and send a bill to the President he \ncould sign where we could put in place some of the President's \nrecommendations on how we can restrain spending and some of the \nrecommendations of Members in the Senate. They are giving a lot of \nserious thought to it. I know Senator Conrad, as well as Senator \nNickles, is thinking about it. I commend them both for looking at some \nof these parameters.\n  We have in this particular budget some provisions to help restrain \nspending in the future. Hopefully we can keep those in the budget, and \nhopefully they will be applied in a way that will help hold down \nspending.\n  I want to talk a little bit now about who is paying the taxes. About \n1 percent of the population, the top 1 percent, pays 34 percent of the \nindividual income taxes. These are 2001 figures. Then if we look at the \ntop 50 percent, they pay about 96 percent. That means the bottom 50 \npercent of individual income tax filers is paying the balance, is \npaying only 4 percent of the individual income tax. We keep hearing \ntalk about how the producers of the country, the top 50 percent of the \ncountry, are getting off scot-free. They are the ones who are really \nmaking a difference. They are the ones who are making our economy move. \nI made some comments in this regard yesterday.\n\n  I also looked at the amount of money. If you take all the income tax \nfilers together, the whole group of them, and you take those paying \n$100,000 or more in taxes, they pay 75 percent of our total income \ntaxes. So they are paying their fair share.\n  Today a study was brought to my attention that had been done by the \nUrban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Usually I don't pay too much \nattention because they don't actually end up focusing on tax cuts and \nthe tax issue. But they have come up with some very interesting data, \nmore current than what I was quoting as far as the tax foundation was \nconcerned. The bottom 50 percent of taxpayers is paying minus 3 percent \nof income taxes. In other words, our earned tax credits are kicking in, \nand they are showing the bottom 50 percent of the taxpayers is paying a \nminus 3 percent of income. The earned income tax credit is a cash \npayment we give to those with lower income. Fourteen percent of the \npayroll taxes come from that 50 percent.\n  Yesterday somebody said: You didn't talk about the payroll taxes. \nThis bottom 50 percent makes up about 14 percent of the payroll taxes. \nThat is only 5 percent of all income and payroll taxes. So when we \ncombine those together, we come up with 5 percent. That includes your \nfilers, plus the withholding from their taxes.\n  What happens to the top 10 percent of the taxpayers? The top 10 \npercent pay 71 percent of our income. That is based on the Urban-\nBrookings Tax Policy Center. Thirty-two percent of those are payroll \ntaxes. That is a total of 53 percent of all income and payroll taxes \ntogether. So 10 percent of all taxpayers, including income tax plus \npayroll taxes, are paying 53 percent. The bottom 50 percent is paying 5 \npercent when you combine them.\n  The producers of this country, the wealthy, if you want to put them \nin that category, are the ones who are really making a difference.\n  It is time we put aside class warfare and talk about meaningful \nchange in the economy that will make a difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as a member of the Budget Committee, I \nyield myself up to 20 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Colorado was \nin the Budget Committee and saw our focus on health care issues. He \nsaid in particular he was hoping we would have an effort to bring forth \nideas that would generate bipartisan support. That is exactly what I \nhope to do this afternoon. I want to discuss the question of laying the \nfoundation in this budget resolution for containing prescription drug \ncosts.\n  If you think about what happened in the Budget Committee, there was \nno topic that generated as much interest and as much concern as the \nquestion of health care and particularly Medicare and prescription \ndrugs.\n  In fact, at one point the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, said: Well, are we going to relitigate the \nentire prescription drug bill on the budget? Obviously, the budget \nresolution does not allow for something like that.\n  I think Chairman Grassley's comments were indicative of the \nfrustration and concern across this country with respect to the \ninability to hold down the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs.\n  I want to discuss an idea about which I and others on the Budget \nCommittee have been talking. It is also in the legislation I have been \nable to work on with Senator Snowe.\n  What particularly pleased me in the Budget Committee is Senator \nGregg, the chairman of the HELP Committee, said he thought this idea \nhad considerable merit. I am hopeful by the time this comes out on the \nfloor, we can do what Senator Allard has been talking about, and that \nis to have ideas that are bipartisan that deal with these important \nissues, particularly concerns such as health care where we have this \ndemographic tsunami ahead, that really do address what the American \npeople, and especially seniors, are talking about.\n  What will be offered before too long is an effort to lay the \ngroundwork in the budget resolution for making sure the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services has the authority to negotiate for our \nseniors and hold down the costs of prescription drugs.\n  For the first time, the Congressional Budget Office in a letter to me \non March 3 said:\n\n       Giving the Secretary an additional tool--the authority to \n     negotiate prices with manufacturers of such drugs--can put \n     greater pressure on manufacturers and could produce some \n     additional savings.\n\n  What I say to the Senate and colleagues is for the first time now, we \nhave the Congressional Budget Office on record stating that giving the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services the authority to negotiate \nprices could produce additional savings for some pharmaceuticals that \nare purchased by our seniors.\n  I would hope every Member of the Senate would be sympathetic of this \ndesire to contain costs in prescription drugs at this time. There are a \ncouple of reasons for this. The first, in my view, is the fact we have \njust seen in recent weeks the prescription drug legislation that passed \nis going to cost $134 billion more than was estimated.\n  In light of this dramatic increase, which has come up in a matter of\n\n[[Page S2399]]\n\nweeks, in light of the fact we have this demographic revolution ahead, \nit seems to me it is critical the Senate act responsibly and search for \nevery way possible to assure access to affordable medicines for seniors \nand to protect the interests of the taxpayers.\n  I voted for the Medicare legislation. I still have the welts on my \nback to prove it. I also believe strongly in making sure the private \nsector has every opportunity to help in lowering costs and delivering \nneeded pharmaceuticals to seniors.\n  I have always felt there is considerable merit in the approach used \nby the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program that uses the private \nsector to make sure you get a fair shake for Federal employees. But I \nalso think it is important there be backup kinds of tools, that there \nbe additional tools to the private sector approach, and that is why it \nis so important the Senate, before it completes its business, uses the \nopportunity to lay the groundwork in this budget resolution to make \nsure the Secretary of Health and Human Services is in a position to try \nto wring out the best possible bargain for seniors and for taxpayers on \nthese medicine costs.\n  Given the fact the Congressional Budget Office has now told us \nadditional savings are possible when we provide the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services with the authority to negotiate, it seems to me to \nbe derelict to not have the Senate on a bipartisan basis lay the \ngroundwork for giving the Secretary that authority to negotiate.\n  I was very much encouraged when the distinguished chairman of the \nHELP Committee, Senator Gregg, said there was considerable merit to \nthis idea.\n  I see the Senator from Colorado on the floor. He has talked \nrepeatedly about his desire to have bipartisan efforts in the health \ncare area.\n  In the past, every time in the budget resolution when Senator Snowe \nwas on the committee, Senator Smith, and others, we have been able to \ndo it. This year it was not possible, and that is tragic, particularly \nin light of the increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals and the \nincrease in the prescription drug costs over a matter of a few weeks.\n  I am very hopeful now we will have a chance to move ahead on this \nissue. The approach that will be offered is one I think is consistent \nwith the votes of those who supported the legislation and many who were \nagainst it. Many who were against the legislation said they had \nreservations because it did not do enough to contain costs. Now we have \nthe opportunity, because of what the Congressional Budget Office has \ntold us, to actually rein in the costs of this program. We have seen we \ncan do it in some areas that are very significant. Take single-source \nmedicine. The American Academy of Actuaries has found in many instances \nthese drugs comprise a significant portion of the entire expenditure of \nthe program. I think we can do this in a fashion that ensures access \nfor those who need this medicine.\n  I have worked so closely with those programs--the National Alliance \nfor Mentally Ill and others--that are concerned about those drugs. We \ncan get these cost savings, ensure access for those individuals, and \nsave taxpayers money. It seems to me if the Congress simply lets pass \nthis opportunity to rein in the costs--and we see the costs of the \nprogram have skyrocketed more than $100 billion in a matter of months--\none has to ask oneself, What is ahead? How much more of this program, a \nprogram so desperately needed by the elderly, is going to be eaten up \nas a result of the Senate not taking the steps to rein in the costs?\n  The Congressional Budget Office has told us now what is possible, so \nit really becomes a question of political will. I am very hopeful as \nthe Senate goes about its work over the next few days, we understand \nhere is a chance to build on the legislation that passed. It is not \nputting in place price controls and some kind of arbitrary ``set the \nprices from Washington, DC'' kind of regime. I believe private \nmarketplace forces can work. I have seen that in my hometown where we \nhave many older people in managed care programs. But I also want us to \nmake sure the Secretary of Health and Human Services has every \nappropriate additional tool to try to wring out price savings for both \nseniors and taxpayers. With the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nnow telling us for the first time, reversing the position they outlined \nback in January of this year, I think we ought to make sure we pass \nlegislation that lays the groundwork for the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to have the tool, the authority to negotiate prices, \nthat can produce the additional savings for some pharmaceuticals the \nCongressional Budget Office has outlined.\n  I want to emphasize to my colleagues this is not price controls. This \nwould not set aside the private sector and the authority of the private \nsector to negotiate. I happen to think that is constructive. I think we \nwill get some savings. Certainly, the fact some seniors will get their \nhealth care medicines and pharmaceuticals through managed care plans \nand have the kind of buying power that produces will be very useful, \nand I support that. But I also think on top of that private sector \nleverage, we ought to give the Secretary the authority to negotiate.\n  It is, in effect, a fallback tool that can ensure you wring out \nsavings for taxpayers and for older people. I offer in the spirit the \nSenator from Colorado talked about in the committee--he wanted to see \npeople come forward with ideas, and I say to the Senator from Colorado, \nI have come forth with an idea.\n  I have come forth with an idea that the distinguished chairman of the \nHELP Committee, Senator Gregg, says has considerable merit. When there \nis that kind of opportunity and one faces these escalating costs we \nhave seen just in a matter of weeks, $134 billion more than was \noriginally envisioned, the Congress ought to act.\n  A number of colleagues have worked very hard on this issue over the \nyears--Senator Kennedy, Senator Feingold, Senator Stabenow on this \nside. I have been so pleased to be able to work with Senator Snowe and \nSenator Smith on many of these issues over the years.\n  I ask my colleagues to reflect on what the Congressional Budget \nOffice has said on this topic. When there are these kinds of increases \nin prescription drug costs both for older people who walk into a \npharmacy and for the entire Medicare Program, $134 billion increase in \na matter of months, let's heed the objective analysis of the \nCongressional Budget Office and make sure we wring out every possible \nsavings for the taxpayers and seniors of this country.\n  There was a reason why in the Budget Committee no subject was \ndiscussed at such length as health care costs. The reason is medical \ncosts are gobbling up everything in sight. There are no costs going up \nlike medical bills. We see that for every possible group.\n  I am one who believes the private sector can help contain costs. That \nis why I have been a supporter of the Federal Employee Health Benefit \nPlan. I also believe when the Congressional Budget Office tells us \nthere are ways to make additional savings by giving Health and Human \nServices the authority to negotiate a good deal for senior citizens \nunder the Medicare Program, it would be derelict for the Senate not to \nmake sure that opportunity was not picked up on.\n  We will have a good debate on this issue. I am very hopeful that the \nwords we heard from the distinguished chairman of the HELP Committee, \nthe idea of giving the Secretary the authority to negotiate prices for \nseniors has considerable merit and that we can have bipartisan support \nfor the efforts in this budget resolution to lay the groundwork for an \napproach on prescription drug cost containment.\n  This is about cost containment. It is not about throwing the whole \nlaw in the trash can. It is not about starting over. It is about \ncontaining costs. It is about the principal concern older people and \ntaxpayers have all across this country. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas told us we have a chance to contain costs. We ought to lay the \ngroundwork to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes. I ask to have \nthat charged against the time allocated to the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I emphasize that we are moving forward.\n\n[[Page S2400]]\n\nWe just finished a recession. The attack on America and the war on \nterror have created some unacceptable budget deficits and we are trying \nto deal with these in the budget.\n  Since 2001, spending increases and the economy, not tax cuts, have \nbeen the biggest contributors to the deficits. The President's economic \npolicies are working. The gross domestic product growth is up, \nunemployment is down, and the combined value of the New York Stock \nExchange and the NASDAQ have increased 40 percent. We are moving \nforward. We can reduce deficits by slowing spending and preventing \neconomically damaging tax increases.\n\n  I will go over just a few things that our budget will do. In 3 years, \nby 2007, it is going to cut the deficit in half and continue bringing \ndeficits down. It is going to slow the growth of discretionary \nspending. We are eliminating wasteful mandatory spending. We are \nattempting to prevent tax increases on families. We are trying to \nmaintain some spending discipline. We are trying to show that as \nRepublicans, we can lead, and that Senator Nickles from Oklahoma is \nwilling to take and make the tough decisions necessary to eliminate our \ndeficits under this budget.\n  Our Nation's priorities, as reflected in the budget, are that we \nfully fund the President's request on homeland security; education, \nthere is a $1 billion increase for both IDEA and title I grants; \nveterans health care, there is a $1.4 billion increase for veterans \nhealth care; international affairs, $3.6 billion increase under the \nPresident's proposal, including funding for the global AIDS initiative. \nThe budget also rejects several of the President's proposed cuts for \ncongressional priorities like the Corps of Engineers and the EPA Clean \nWater Act.\n  I think this is a very responsible budget. I think it is a very \nthoughtful budget, and obviously it is a budget that reflects what the \nAmerican people are trying to tell the Congress. The noise I hear back \nhome and the noise I hear from the American people is, look, these \ndeficits are a problem, but the tax cuts are not what is contributing \nto the deficit. The tax cuts are actually stimulating our economy.\n  Even the people who are in our States are beginning to realize that \nthe economy is recovering. They would like to see it recover more, and \nI do not blame them. I do, too. The fact is the tax cuts are making a \ndifference.\n  I would like to go back to the discussion I was holding earlier this \nafternoon on who pays the taxes. I will speak about this chart I have \nbefore me. This chart reflects a study made by the Urban-Brookings Tax \nPolicy Center. Under this area of ``with tax cuts,'' the issue is, what \nis going to happen as far as the income tax rates are concerned?\n  Well, the bottom 50 percent of the tax cuts is a minus 3 percent. \nWhat does that mean? That means that there is actually a cash payout to \ntaxpayers. How does that happen? We have an income tax credit where we \nactually make a cash payment to individuals who are low income who are \nworking.\n  The top 10 percent of the taxpayers are 71 percent. The payroll \ntaxes--and yesterday when we were talking about what was happening with \ntax cuts, I was talking about the income taxes and then they brought \nup, well, what about the payroll taxes? That is how much one's check \ncomes up short. There is the gross amount and then they take out all \nthe payroll taxes and the bottom line is what a person takes home.\n  This means the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers pay about 14 percent of \nthe payroll taxes and the top 10 percent of the taxpayers 32 percent. \nThat figure was a little bit of a surprise to me. I thought perhaps \nthat would be closer, but again it is pretty obvious that the higher \nincome taxpayers are paying a considerable amount more than those in \nthe bottom 50 percent. That is the top 10 percent. Then if we combine \nboth of those, if we combine the income taxes that are paid and then \ncombine the payroll taxes, it averages out that the bottom 50 percent \nof the taxpayers pay about 5 percent of the taxes. The top 10 percent \npay 53 percent of the taxes.\n  What happens without the tax cuts? An interesting phenomenon has \nhappened. Every time we have cut taxes in the Senate, the percentage \nthe high-income taxpayers pay keeps going on. When we cut taxes, they \npay a greater percentage of the revenues derived from income tax. This \nis reflected in the column ``without the tax cut.''\n  Here is what we see happening. We see that the bottom 50 percent pay \nabout a minus 1 percent. In other words, they are not getting as much \nmoney sent back as we saw with the tax cuts. We see less taxes being \npaid by the top 10 percent. So here we are with the tax cuts, and their \nshare of the taxes goes from 67 percent up to 71 percent.\n  We even see that phenomenon happening when we combine both income and \npayroll taxes. This is significant. When we make our adjustments in our \ntax cuts, those who are in the higher income pay a higher percentage of \ntaxes as we move forward with our tax cuts. I think that is important.\n\n  The upper income pays a greater share of the tax burden with tax cuts \nthan without. This is broken out a little differently, but if we look \nat the top 1 percent, the red here reflects with the tax cuts and, over \nhere, what happens without tax cuts. We see the top 1 percent ends up \npaying a greater percentage of the tax cuts. We go here to the 10 \npercent, we see there is still an increase. Without a tax cut it is a \nlower percentage than with the tax cut. We are getting a shift \nautomatically to the higher income taxpayer.\n  On the 50 percent it is close to even, although there is a little, \nvery narrow difference there. Then the bottom half actually is paying \nfewer taxes as a percentage with the tax cuts as opposed to without.\n  What happens with this budget when we are talking about the child tax \ncredit, the marriage penalty, and changing the tax bracket? We need to \ndo this if we want to preserve income for the family. Here is how this \nbreaks out as we have it in the bill. If we let all these taxes expire, \nhere is what happens. If we don't take any action on taxes this year, \nhere is what happens. Assume the family tax bill in 2004 for a middle-\nclass family of 4 is $6,000. Then here is what would happen with that \nfamily of four. They are going to pay $600 more, because we begin to \nsee a drop in the per-child tax credit. It expires. Then we begin to \nsee the marriage penalty relief expire. We see a drop there--$911. We \nsee the 10-percent bracket expansion expires. That adds $100. So the \ntotal tax increase that will hit that family of 4 is $1,611. That means \nthe family tax bill from 2004 to 2005 is going to increase $7,611. That \nmeans there is going to be $1,611 less expendable income from that \nfamily.\n  My view is if we can keep that money in the family they are going to \ncreate jobs because they are out buying products, they are buying and \nstimulating the economy, as opposed to the Federal Government, where \nthat does not happen. That phenomenon is not there. That is a 26-\npercent tax increase that happens if we do not go ahead and implement \nthese tax relief provisions that are in the budget bill. These are very \nimportant. They are important to families in America and they are \nimportant if we are going to continue to see our economy grow, because \nit gives the family greater discretionary income so they can meet their \nneeds.\n  If we can keep the money in the taxpayers' pockets in their own local \ncommunities, then that money is available to help those communities. \nTaxpayers look at the whole tax burden. If it is too high at the \nFederal level, they don't particularly feel they want to give up their \nhard-earned taxes for things that are happening in their community. But \nif they can get tax relief at the Federal level, then they realize some \nrelief from the Federal tax burden and they are more willing to support \nwhat needs to be done in their community. Maybe they need to increase \nthe sales tax for open spaces or have a sewer plant replaced or maybe a \nwater treatment plant for the drinking water needs to be improved upon, \nor maybe the roads and highways need to be taken care of. These are \nlocal projects. It means there is more money available at the local \nlevel so the local communities can do that.\n\n  To me, this makes a lot of sense. We need to move the power from \nWashington back to our cities and States. That is what this is all \nabout. It is not about whether we are going to tax the wealthy. The \nwealthy are carrying their fair share. It is about getting the\n\n[[Page S2401]]\n\nmoney back down to the States, back down to the individuals, where it \nwill make a difference in people's lives.\n  This is a well-thought-out budget. I think it moves this country \nforward. It is a budget that I think will make a difference in American \nlives. It is something I hope we can pass out of the Senate, get to the \nconference committee, and we can get it back with minimal change. \nObviously there will be a few things that will happen. We will have a \nnumber of amendments here on the floor, but this is basically a pretty \ngood plan. We need to get a budget this year. That is the first step. \nThen once you get the budget passed you can get your appropriations \nbills.\n  Without a budget, it is catastrophic. We saw that happen 3 years ago. \nWe didn't get a budget passed from this Senate. We saw spending get out \nof control. We saw all sorts of budget discipline lost in the budget \nprocess and this all contributed to the deficits we are facing today.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to work with the chairman of the \nBudget Committee because he has indicated a willingness to work with \nthe Members of the Senate to take care of their concerns. Let's get a \nbudget passed and move forward, a budget that will hold the Senate \naccountable so we will be well on our way to eliminating the deficits \nwe now face.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes on the \nunderlying resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are considering now for the next 3 days the \nrecommended figure that has come from the Budget Committee to allocate \nthe resources of this country in the Federal budget. We know we will \nhave the debate on this. This is a question of choices. It is a \nquestion of priorities, even with the scarce resources we have at the \npresent time, how these resources ought to be allocated in the national \ninterest.\n  The overall issue on the budget is to recognize there are two \ninstruments that guide our economy. One is monetary policy, which is \ninterest rates, and there is fiscal policy, which is about what we \nspend. Both of those together ultimately decide whether we have a \nstrong economy or a weak economy, those two elements. We are \nconsidering the second element here today, what we call the fiscal \npolicy, the resources we have to invest or give in tax breaks or invest \nin education or health care. That is what this debate is about.\n  What we do know is this has a major impact. What we do with this \nbudget has a major impact on the state of our economy. When you have \nPresidential leadership that understands both the fiscal and monetary \npolicy, you can get economic growth, you can get price stability. We \nhave seen it in the past. We only have to be reminded about the recent \nleadership we had with President Clinton in 1992, 1993, when we had a \nbudget that was the benchmark and the benchpost for the expanded \neconomic growth we had. There were 22 million jobs created over that 8-\nyear period. That is a result of fiscal policy, the budget as well as \nthe monetary policy. They were harmonized in a way that brought \neconomic growth to our country, price stability and economic growth.\n  Earlier than that, in the early 1960s, we had a similar effort to use \neconomic growth, fiscal policy, and monetary policies. The early 1960s \nhad the longest period of economic growth and price stability we had \nhad up to that time, for this century. So we know this is an \nextraordinarily important document, in terms of deciding what the state \nof our economy is, whether there are going to be good jobs, or whether \nthere are going to be investments in education, whether there are going \nto be investments in training, whether we are going to deal with the \nchallenges of health care.\n  Anyone who is interested in the issue of jobs has to look over this \nbudget and ask, where is the policy? Where's the beef? Where are the \nprovisions in this budget that are going to reflect itself in expanded \njob opportunities? You come to the conclusion that they are not there.\n  For those men and women across this country--the millions who have \nlost their jobs and the millions more who have gotten new jobs that are \nnot paying what the old jobs were paying--can say as a result of their \nbudget, if it goes through the way it is, help is not on the way. This \nis not a budget that is going to bring this economy back to a growing \nand expanding economy. What it is basically doing is just what we have \ndone in the last 3 years. We should have learned our lesson. We have \nmassive tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals in this society, and \nthen we find out that it still hasn't worked in terms of producing \njobs. Now we find the administration is going to do the same thing with \nregard to this budget, and hopefully out there somewhere there will be \ncreation of jobs. They just aren't going to be there.\n  We should have learned the lesson of that. All we have to do is look \nat what the administration has said and what has happened over the \nperiod of the last 3 years going back to 2001 when we had the \nadministration's proposal on these very extensive tax reductions and \nbreaks for the wealthiest individuals that it was estimated were going \nto create millions of jobs. That is the purple line right here. What \nhappened is the red line declined with a total loss of 3 million jobs. \nA million have been recovered. We are still 2 million jobs short of \nwhere we were when this President became President.\n  Do we understand that? After the economic policies of this \nadministration, we are 2 million short.\n  It is amazing because we keep hearing this Bush administration \ntalking about how we are going to have very extensive job growth, and \nit never happens. It just doesn't happen. It hasn't happened. Why \nshould we believe it is going to happen with this budget? It isn't \ngoing to happen.\n  Here we see the first estimate. Then last year they said it is going \nto really happen up here. We will have an increase of another 2 or 3 \nmillion jobs. From the point where the Bush administration's estimate \nof where we are now, we are 5 million jobs off.\n  We had the most recent report last week, and we had the question \nabout the creation of jobs: Not a single new private job in the \ncountry. The 21,000 new jobs are basically in the public sector.\n  It is amazing to me--it must be to millions of Americans--because \nthey hear from our President an entirely different story. They heard in \nthe State of the Union from the President of the United States:\n\n       The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2000 \n     was the fastest in nearly 20 years. Productivity and jobs are \n     on the rise.\n\n  On ``Meet the Press,'' February 8, the President said in response to \nMr. Russert:\n\n       Well, it's happening. There is good momentum when it comes \n     to the creation of new jobs.\n\n  There it is on February 8.\n  On February 23 at the National Governors Association Conference.\n\n       Obviously the economy and jobs are on my mind. I know they \n     are on yours as well. I am pleased that the economy is \n     growing.\n\n  There it is again. The President is saying that everything is hunky-\ndory.\n  Just last week in California on March 4:\n\n       A lot of people are feeling confident and optimistic about \n     our future so they can say I am going to hire two more.\n\n  They can sit here and tell the President in front of cameras, I will \nhire 2 more people.\n  There was a good deal of laughter. He said:\n\n       That's confidence.\n\n  He said in Texas on March 6:\n\n       The economy is getting stronger. We have pro-growth and \n     pro-entrepreneurial that is making the economy stronger and \n     stronger.\n\n  With all of these statements, the problem is the President just \ndoesn't get it. He doesn't understand what is happening out there \nacross the Main Streets of this country.\n  It is interesting that we find just today Treasury Secretary Snow \nspoke in Washington at the National Association of State Treasurers and \nnoted that with the underlying condition of the economy looking \nunusually sound, the lack of job growth is a mystery.\n  Now at least you have the Secretary of the Treasury understanding \nthat.\n  But to say with this budget that everything is just going well in \nterms of\n\n[[Page S2402]]\n\nour economy fails to understand what is happening in the Main Streets \nacross this country. We have an opportunity to do something about it. \nThe question is whether we will.\n  Certainly the budget that has been recommended by our Republican \nfriends doesn't bode terribly well for working families or for the \nmiddle class. This legislation extends the tax breaks for wealthy \ninvestors while refusing to extend the unemployment benefits, leaving \n90,000 more workers each week without benefits. The 90,000 workers who \npaid into the compensation fund each week are losing those benefits. \nWhat do they use that unemployment for? They use that to pay the \nmortgage, pay the rent, and put the food on the table. That \nunemployment compensation fund is in surplus.\n  The proposal of the Senator from Washington was about $5.5 billion. \nBut, no, that wasn't included in this budget. That would be a hand \nreaching out to workers in this country who have paid into that fund.\n  The judgment and the choice and the priority of the Republic \nbudgeteers is to say, Look, we are going to provide the continuation of \nthe tax breaks for the wealthy and leave the 90,000 workers behind.\n  Then they permanently reduce the tax breaks for the top brackets paid \nby the wealthiest taxpayers but provide no relief for the workers that \ncannot afford the spiraling cost of health benefits and cuts in health \ncare for low-income families. That will be a $11 billion cut which is \ndirected to working families and low-income families, but we don't \naddress that. Repeal the inheritance tax on multi-millionaire estates \nwhile raising taxes on low-income workers by cutting the earned income \ntax credit.\n  I heard my friend from Colorado say when he was describing who is \npaying it on the taxes, Look, some people actually get a rebate. That \nis true. Those are families that are on the lower rung of the economic \nladder. They have the earned income tax credit. It has been enormously \nsuccessful in making work pay. They have to be working, and they \nreceive those funds. That is being cut back. Imagine that. Some tax \nhelp and assistance for low-income working families we are cutting back \nand at the same time eliminating the taxes for the very wealthiest \nindividuals in this country.\n  The issue goes on and on.\n  I want to point out a couple of factors with regard to the issues on \neducation and the issues on health care and what we are finding in \nregard to this particular budget.\n  We have passed what we called the No Child Left Behind Act, which was \na bipartisan effort. We said that over a 12-year period we would try to \nbring proficiency to every child in America. It is not easy. It is \ndifficult and complex. We had a variety of different ways to try to do \nit. Basically it was to get a well-trained teacher in smaller class \nsizes to try to provide help and assistance to those children who \nneeded help, who are going to be periodically tested, and those who \nneed help are going to get the supplementary services. Involved in \nsupplementary services will be well-trained people who can help those \nchildren that have spelling needs. It was going to involve parents. It \nwas going to provide additional help to those schools so they could get \nup to standard. It was a real contract with parents, children, and the \nCongress of the United States.\n  The tragic fact is the children are meeting their responsibilities; \nthe parents are meeting their responsibilities; the teachers are trying \nto meet their responsibilities; and we are failing in ours.\n  That is why. Here it is. You can just look at this chart under the \nBush budget that we have before us about the number of children who are \ngoing to be left behind going from fiscal year 2005 all the way to \n2013, still leaving 4 million children out, still leaving 4 million \nchildren behind. That is absolutely unacceptable.\n  We will have the possibility under the Murray amendment to do \nsomething about that. It is a responsible amendment. It will pay \neffectively for itself. It is not going to run up the deficit. It will \nensure that all children are included and at end, that ``no child is \nleft behind.''\n  We have to make a judgment. This is an issue of priorities. Do we \nwant to invest in our children or do we want to leave those children \nfurther and further behind?\n  I want to point out briefly while I am talking about the No Child \nLeft Behind Act that the Bush administration has been withholding data \nfor 6 weeks now. But the Congressional Research Service tells us that \nover 7,500 school districts are about to get a cut in No Child Left \nBehind Act aid. Many of these are the poorest of the poor school \ndistricts. East St. Louis, IL, 41-percent poverty, will get a $315,000 \ncut in July. Canton, MS, 34-percent poverty, will get a cut of $148,000 \nthis July. Camden, NJ, 38-percent poverty, will get a cut of $550,000 \nthis July. East Cleveland, OH, 35-percent poverty, will get a cut of \n$90,000 in July. Holyoke, MA, 36-percent poverty, will get a cut of \n$350,000 this July.\n\n  Money does not answer all the problems in education, but it is a \npretty clear reflection of the kind of priority we in this body are \ngiving to education. We are allowing cutbacks in children's education, \nwhile expanding, making permanent, the tax cuts for the wealthiest \nindividuals.\n  That is not the only issue. We just mentioned the challenges facing \nK-12. We have other issues on No Child Left Behind, including ensuring \nwe have well-qualified teachers who will work in supplementary \nservices, dealing more effectively with the issues of disability, \ndealing with limited English proficient students, trying to work with \nStates on a representative size in measuring annual and yearly \nprogress. But you cannot do those issues if you do not have the \nresources necessary. This budget does not provide them.\n  Let's look at what has happened in the area of higher education and \nask what this budget does in the areas of higher education. This chart \nreflects the increased costs of college tuition for the public for \naverage tuition for 2- and 4-year public colleges: $3,725 for 2001-\n2002; 2003 and 2004, $4,700, a 26-percent increase.\n  On the one hand we have a budget that is not performing in terms of \ncreating jobs in our society, as the most recent results of last week \nindicate, and not doing the job in terms of our commitment to the \nchildren in K-12. What does this 26-percent increase in costs say to \nthose working families, middle-income families trying to put their kids \nthrough college?\n  What has been the reaction of this administration and our Republican \nfriends? College budget: more student debt, less grant aid.\n  We have seen the increase of the student debt by $4.7 billion in the \nlast 3 years for students under the Bush education program, effectively \ncutting 171,000 LEAP student grants, which are the State grants, \nmatched by the Federal Government. This budget zeros out any increase \nin individual student Pell grants in spite of what the President said \nwhen he ran for the Presidency. He said we ought to have a Pell grant \nof $5,000 when he was running for the Presidency. There is not a nickel \nincrease. And zero increase in college work-study programs and campus-\nbased financial aid, which are programs that are basically essential \nfor low- and moderate-income families who need to be able to \nsupplement, besides their scholarships, besides their loans.\n  I will show what the budget does and what choice is before the \nSenate. As I mentioned, in this budget we have a question of \npriorities. These are the priorities. The Bush plan to cut No Child \nLeft Behind saves little compared to the cost of tax cuts for the top 1 \npercent.\n  This is the cost of the Bush tax cut for those making over $337,000 \nin 2005: $45 billion. This is the additional cost to fully fund No \nChild Left Behind in 2005, $9.4 billion. What is important? There we \nhave it. We will have a chance to vote on it.\n  What are your priorities? Ensuring that we will be able to fund the \nprograms for the education of the children or are we going to provide \nthe $45 billion?\n  Let me show the chart for this year. We will hear from the Budget \nCommittee chairman saying we have addressed this higher education. They \nput in some funding which will be necessary to keep the floor under the \nPell grants and then they take them out. The Senate GOP would need to \nadd to its budget to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act, the $8.6 \nbillion, yet\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\nthere is virtually no real commitment in there.\n  I will discuss two items in terms of health care that are not \naddressed. There is no attempt with this budget to try to deal with the \nissues of coverage on health care, and there is virtually no effort to \ntry to get a handle on costs of health care. What we have seen over the \nperiod of the last 3\\1/2\\ years of the total numbers of individuals who \nare not covered with health care has been going up, up, up. This is the \nchart that shows how the numbers have been going up since this \nadministration: 39.8 million, 41 million, and 43 million.\n  Look at what has happened in the course of a year. Let's take a look \nat what happens in terms of health care costs. We have the total number \nof people going up, up, up. This chart shows the premium increase \nversus the consumer price increase: 10 percent, 12 percent, 13 percent; \n2001, 2002 and 2003; a 43-percent cumulative over this administration.\n  Maybe someone in the Budget Committee can show us where this budget \nis doing anything about the costs coming out of the pockets of working \nfamilies in this country. We are not creating jobs, we are not \ninvesting in the education of the children, and the issues of health \ncare costs and coverage are out of control. We would think that at \nleast this budget would have addressed those issues and questions. \nFortunately, there will be amendments over the next 2 days to address \nthose. I hope our colleagues will support them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my friend from \nNorth Dakota is playing politics with two very critical issues to our \nNation's economic well-being: The skyrocketing deficit and the future \nof Social Security.\n  Clearly, there is a lot we need to do to tackle the enormous $500 \nbillion deficit. There is also a critical need to shore up Social \nSecurity.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that, recently, Federal Reserve Chairman \nAlan Greenspan called for new steps to restrain spending, warning that \nunless we take action, our lack of fiscal discipline could lead to \nincreased long-term interest rates. He also recently expressed serious \nconcerns about the need to address Social Security, given the impending \nretirement of 77 million Americans 7 years from now. Unfortunately, \nthis amendment is not a solution.\n  We need to start making some tough choices around here and in a \nmanner that puts the good of the Nation ahead of partisan politics. I \nsupport PAYGO budget enforcement mechanisms, but not when they are tied \nto a political agenda. I regret that I must vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe we have agreed to the \nparliamentary aspects of this effort.\n  I rise to pay tribute to those lost in the Baltimore Harbor water \ntaxi accident, and to express great gratitude to the brave rescuers who \nsaved many of the lives, and, of course, to express condolences to the \nfamilies.\n  Let me tell the Senate about what happened, very briefly.\n  On Saturday, a beautiful, mild afternoon in Baltimore's Harbor became \na nightmare. A sudden storm arose. A beloved water taxi capsized in the \nBaltimore Harbor. Twenty-five people were thrown into the water. They \nfought for their lives in freezing cold water.\n  They were families, tourists, Maryland residents, people from across \nthe country, even members of a National Guard unit visiting us.\n  Two women tragically lost their lives, including a beloved pediatric \nnurse. One young girl is still fighting for here live.\n  Three people still remain missing: a couple about to be engaged and a \n6-year-old boy on a trip with his father and mother and two other \nsiblings.\n  I express my heartfelt condolences to those families who are \nsuffering the loss of a loved one. The victims and their families are \nin our thoughts and our prayers.\n  But I also want to bring to the Senate's attention what happened with \nour very brave initial responders.\n  This accident happened off of Fort McHenry. Stationed there is a \nNaval Reserve unit. They happened to be on duty as part of their \nweekend training. At the same time, located there is the Baltimore City \nFire Department Maritime Unit.\n  The minute this boat went over, as this storm hit, a Naval Reserve \nmaster chief petty officer saw the boat capsize and sounded the alarm \nto the Navy Reserve unit. Without hesitation, 20 men got on a boat that \nwas a relic from World War II, that was used as a landing craft, and \nwith great skill they began to proceed out to this capsized boat, \nexactly as the Baltimore City Maritime Fire Department saw it. And then \nwithout even putting wet suits on because there was not time--the water \nwas 44 degrees--the firefighters jumped\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\noverboard. The Navy came in as a rescue mission, maneuvering this \nlanding craft, and coming up close. As they lowered its bowel ramp, \nthey used it as a sidewalk into the water. The Navy men walked into \nthat water, forming a human chain, grabbing people, and pulling them \nout. And then they skillfully negotiated right up to the capsized boat \nand used the ramp as a crane to lift it up, and out came three people \nwho had been trapped underneath.\n  Once again, the Navy rescued two and the fire department rescued one. \nNow two people are dead. Three are missing. Indeed, it is a very \nmelancholy situation, but if the Navy had not responded the way they \ndid, and if the fire department had not been there, the tragic \nconsequences would have been far more significant.\n  That kind of bravery, jumping into the water, risking hypothermia is \nsomething we need to recognize. These initial responders did it \nquickly, without thinking and without hesitation and without stopping. \nTheir quick thinking and all of their training and all of their \ningenuity and all of their bravery and all of their gallantry helped \nsave 20 lives.\n  Our terrific Baltimore emergency workers back on shore began to take \nthe people to the hospital. On shore, the Navy took their drill room \nand turned it into a triage center. I am telling you, they provided \nemergency medical care. They were taking blankets and clothing and even \ntheir own shirts and socks and giving it to those who came from the \nfreezing cold water. We could have faced a greater loss had it not been \nfor them.\n\n  When I went to visit with them yesterday, I said: I want to go to the \nSenate to tell your story. As I gathered their names, they said: We \ndon't want to be singled out. We're Navy. We're the fire department.\n  They wanted to be known for the team they belong to. They told me \nthey were part of a team, that they needed each other, and that they \ncounted on each other, and it was the team effort that saved their \nlives.\n  They do that every day. The fire department and the Navy train every \nday to save lives. They were there when we needed them, and they were \nbest at what we needed them for.\n  Now Baltimore fire rescue workers continue to recover the bodies of \nthe victims. Indeed, it is a chilling job, but we want to be able to \nbring those bodies back home.\n  I salute our initial responders. I salute those who are now engaged \nin the recovery activity. I thank God for the emergency medical team \nthat whisked them to the hospital to take care of their hypothermia, \ntheir cardiac arrest.\n  It was a tragic day in Baltimore, but the heroism of Baltimore shines \nas a beckon to deal with their sorrow. That is why I offer this \nresolution today. I ask that the Senate and my colleagues join in \nexpressing our gratitude for them and our condolences to those families \nof lost loved ones.\n  I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from Idaho for his courtesy.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland. In fact, \nI appreciate the Senator from Maryland coming to the floor today and \nsharing with us, the Senate, and the country this incredible example of \nhow these first responders can make such an important difference when a \ntragedy strikes. Those in Maryland are to be commended for this \nresponse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2404-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2404-S2430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                            2005--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2704\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, the amendment that is before the Senate \ntoday, and on which I expect we will vote very soon, is an amendment \nthat would change the budget enforcement rules as we proceed forward in \nconsidering legislation. This amendment would amend title IV of the \nbudget enforcement provisions of the committee-reported resolution to \ninclude a 60-vote point of order against the consideration of any \ndirect spending or tax relief legislation that would increase the on-\nbudget deficit in any fiscal year, in its terms, ``until the budget is \nbalanced without Social Security'' payroll tax receipts.\n  The problem this amendment poses, although it sounds very admirable \non its face, is that it is based on the faulty premise that either tax \nrelief or spending is raiding the Social Security trust fund.\n  I will be one of the first to agree we should control spending in \nthis body, such that we do not engage in deficit spending, which makes \nit more difficult for the Federal Government to pay down its \noutstanding debt obligations.\n  In fact, as I said yesterday on the floor, when I ran for Congress, I \nran on a principle of a balanced budget, and beginning in about 1994, \nin this Congress, we were able to exert the kind of fiscal discipline \nthat helped us ultimately, with the assistance of a strong economy, to \nachieve a balanced budget to start paying for what we were spending in \nCongress and to be able to pay down significant amounts of the national \ndebt.\n  I believe that is a very admirable principle. But to argue that \neither the excess spending or the cuts in taxes are somehow raiding the \nSocial Security trust fund is to create a spin that needs to be \nclarified.\n  The first point I believe the public needs to understand is that when \nproceeds come into the Social Security trust fund, by law, those \nproceeds are utilized, first, for the purposes of the Social Security \nbenefits that are provided. Then, if there are excesses--and in the \npast few years there have been excesses; there will be for a number of \nyears until the Social Security trust fund begins to run deficits--\nthose excesses or surpluses are then invested, by law, in Government \nbond instruments, in other words, Government debt instruments.\n  Those Government debt instruments, as other debt instruments which \nthe Government issues, are then sold to the public or to buyers around \nthe world, frankly, and then repurchased at the time when they become \ndue by the Federal Government.\n  It will be necessary for us, when these bonds come due--for any year \nwe issue them--to pay for them. The more deficit spending we engage in, \nthe more debt we incur, and the heavier the debtload for future \ngenerations, it is true.\n  The net effect of the amendment we are now debating is directed \nspecifically at tax relief. There is tax relief that this Congress and \nthe President of the United States have passed, and the President \nsigned into law in the past few years that will expire because of the \nprocedural mechanisms utilized to get it through the Senate. The \nvarious provisions of this tax relief that we were able to accomplish \nin the last few years expire on different dates, depending on the terms \nof the legislation we passed.\n  I believe everyone should be very clear about one important fact. \nAlthough there has been a lot of debate in the last few days, and will \nbe for the next few, primarily attacking the President for supporting \ntax relief and primarily saying that this tax relief was for the \nwealthy and the rich, the fact is the tax relief was provided across \nthe board to Americans from all income categories who pay taxes. In \nfact, the highest percentage of the tax relief went to those who were \nin the lower and middle-income categories.\n  We can debate the value of the tax relief that is claimed to be for \nthe wealthy. Most of it went to small businesses that apparently are \ncategorized as the wealthy. Most of it was that which is providing the \nincentive to invest in capital that will generate strength in the \neconomy and create more jobs. But setting that debate aside, those \nprovisions of the tax relief that this Congress and previous Congresses \nenacted over the past few years under President Bush's leadership that \nexpire this year, those that are in jeopardy of going away this year \nare not these tax increases that everyone has been referring to in the \nlast few days, these so-called tax cuts for the wealthy. They are \ninstead the tax cuts that directly benefit the middle and lower income \nclasses.\n  What are they? First, we expanded the 10-percent income tax bracket \nso that more people are covered at the 10-percent level than the higher \nlevels of taxes. That is the lowest level of tax in the income tax \nstructure. The tax bracket of protection for the lowest level of \nincome-tax payers was expanded. It is that tax relief that will\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\nexpire this year. It is that tax relief which is the target of this \namendment. It is that tax relief which this amendment will make more \ndifficult to maintain and which will result in direct tax increases on \nthose who are paying taxes at the first and lowest level of income \ncategory in our income-tax code.\n  The second tax that is going to expire this year is not this so-\ncalled tax on the wealthy that is so excoriated in the Senate. No, it \nis the marriage tax penalty relief. Those who fought us for years to \nstop elimination of the marriage tax penalty would love to see a \nprocedural roadblock put into the place of this marriage tax penalty \nrelief that is expiring. We don't want to see that happen.\n  What is the third and the last tax that will expire this year after \nthe expansion of the 10-percent bracket and the elimination of the \nmarriage tax penalty? It is the $1,000-per-child tax credit. I don't \nbelieve those who are attacking the President's tax relief are going to \nclaim that everybody who has a child and who can take advantage of the \nchild tax credit is wealthy, according to the standards they have been \nputting forth. This one doesn't impact across income categories except \nthat it is phased out for those in upper income categories and is a \nprimary benefit specifically to those in the lower and middle-income \ncategories.\n  So we have three critical tax relief provisions that are going to \nexpire this year which directly benefit the lower and middle-income \nclasses that will be made more difficult to extend if this amendment \npasses.\n\n  When you look at these things on their face, it sounds very nice to \nsay let's put a procedural mechanism in place to make it harder to cut \ntaxes. But let's not make a mistake. The taxes they are going at are \nthe taxes specifically identified in the reconciliation provisions of \nour budget; that is, the expansion of the 10-percent bracket, the \nelimination of the marriage tax penalty, and the child tax credit. For \nthose reasons, I believe it is important we recognize this amendment \nmust fail.\n  There has been a lot of talk about what is going to happen to Social \nSecurity. I, for one, will vote to have strong fiscal restraint in this \nbudget and to do what is necessary to stimulate and strengthen our \neconomy, to make sure our economy can start gaining steam again and \nhelp us address these budget deficits.\n  I have a small chart that shows what the Social Security trust fund \nis going to look like under the current budget or without the current \nbudget, having undone the current budget. The point is, it is the same. \nThe reason it is the same? There will be about $4 trillion in the \nSocial Security trust fund either way. The reason it is the same either \nway is all surpluses in the Social Security trust fund are by law \ninvested in government bonds and government debt instruments. Those \ngovernment debt instruments will protect the Social Security trust fund \nin either case.\n  Again, I want to make clear, the way to protect the Social Security \ntrust fund is to stop overspending our budget. The way to protect the \nSocial Security trust fund is to stop running deficits and start, once \nagain, as we were in the late 1990s, paying down the national debt, \ngiving greater strength and resiliency to our economy and confidence in \nour ability to repay these debts as they come due.\n  Let's not get ourselves caught up in this debate about whether taxes \nand tax cuts are bad or good. Those who debate this issue on the floor \nand criticize the President primarily have two messages: The first is, \nthey want to blame the tax relief of the past few years for all of the \neconomic problems our Nation has faced in the last 3 or 4 years, when \nin reality we saw the stock market bubble pop. We were attacked on 9/11 \nwhich drove down consumer confidence and drove spending through the \nroof in terms of the war on terrorism and the effort to defend attacks \non our homeland. And we have seen other problems, mainly the \nuncontrolled increases in entitlement spending that drive spending in \nthis budget.\n  Over the next few days we will continue to have this debate over \nwhether it is better to have higher taxes and higher spending and \nsomehow spend ourselves into prosperity or whether it is better to have \nlower taxes and give an economic stimulus to the private sector and to \nstrengthen consumption and then try to control the deficits, thereby \nstimulating the economy and controlling spending. That is going to be \nwhat we debate in one context or another for the rest of this week.\n  I say to those who are listening, this amendment will essentially \naccomplish one thing, and that is to put roadblocks in the way of the \nkind of tax relief for which we have been fighting for the last 3 or 4 \nyears. It doesn't put roadblocks in the way of discretionary spending \nproposals. It doesn't put roadblocks in the way of entitlement spending \nincreases. It puts roadblocks in the way of efforts to maintain the tax \nrelief that we have had in the past few years. Again, primarily that \ntax relief which we are targeting and which we are projecting to the \nFinance Committee in our reconciliation bill is the tax relief that is \nintended to expire this year: The expansion of the 10-percent tax \nbracket for those at the lowest level of income tax payment, the \nmarriage tax penalty elimination, and the $1,000-per-child tax credit.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I almost don't recognize my amendment when \nI hear the description of the Senator from Idaho. The amendment he is \ntalking about is not my amendment. My amendment says very simply: No \nnew mandatory spending, and that is two-thirds of Federal spending; no \nnew tax cuts unless they are paid for until we stop using Social \nSecurity funds for other purposes. The only way around that is a \nsupermajority vote.\n  So let me repeat what this amendment does. This amendment says: No \nincrease in mandatory spending, no new tax cuts that are not paid for \nuntil we stop the use of Social Security funds for other purposes.\n  Let me be clear. We have had in the past pay-go provisions, and the \npay-go provisions operated in just this way. They were focused on \nmandatory spending, not on discretionary spending. We disciplined \ndiscretionary spending with spending caps. We have a cap in place right \nnow. Mandatory spending we disciplined with a pay-go provision just \nlike mine, and we disciplined the tax cut side of the agenda with a \ndiscipline just like mine. But those disciplines were stopped in 2002.\n  What I am saying is they ought to be put in place. We ought to insist \nthat if somebody wants more spending, new spending on the mandatory \nside, they ought to come up with a way of paying for it. If they want \nnew tax cuts, they ought to find a way to pay for it until we stop the \nuse of Social Security money for other purposes. We would defend those \ndisciplines with a 60-vote point of order.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Will the Senator respond to a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will in a minute. Let me complete my thought, and then \nI will be happy to yield to the Senator for the purpose of a question.\n  I believe this is critically important that we put this discipline in \nplace. The Senator has referenced the middle-class tax reductions. I \nhave said publicly that I will support the extension of the 10-percent \nbracket. I will support the continuing marriage penalty relief. I will \nsupport the continuing relief that we see with the expansion of the \nchild tax credit. But to do it, we ought to pay for it, just as we \nought to pay for new spending. If we cannot pay for it, then we ought \nto have a 60-vote hurdle in front of us to discipline the spending-and-\ntax-cutting process in this body.\n  Look, we have record budget deficits, and under the budget that is \nbefore us by the majority, the increases in the debt are virtually \nunchanged over the 5-year period. The debt is being increased under \nthis budget by $2.86 trillion. The increases in the debt year by year \nare never below $550 billion, $560 billion.\n  I will be happy to yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, may I ask a parliamentary inquiry--I guess \nit is not parliamentary inquiry--if the Senator from North Dakota will \nyield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada will state his \ninquiry.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to my friend from Idaho. May I ask the ranking\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\nmember of the committee what the chairman and he have decided on a \nvote? We have people anxious to know when this vote is going to take \nplace. Can the ranking member or the chairman respond to my question of \nwhen the vote will take place on the pending amendment?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to respond to my colleague from Nevada, \nwe told people to expect a vote at 2:30 p.m. I told my colleague from \nNorth Dakota we expected a very short summary and debate by the two of \nus. It is agreeable with this Senator to vote in the next 6 or 8 \nminutes, 10 minutes, 4 or 5 minutes to a side.\n  Mr. REID. Can we set the vote at quarter to 3?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That will be fine.\n  Mr. REID. Ten minutes, five minutes on each side.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall \nvote on the Conrad amendment occur at 2:45 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. With the time to be equally divided.\n  Mr. NICKLES. With the time equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. And no second-degree amendments in order.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is not necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time? If no one yields time, time will be charged equally.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. The amendment I am offering says \nthis: No new mandatory spending, no new tax cuts unless they are paid \nfor until we stop using Social Security money for other purposes. It \nguards that budget discipline with a supermajority point of order. That \nis how we have worked in the past with the pay-go provision, focused on \nmandatory spending and on the tax side of the ledger. It is not \ndifferent from what we have done in the past.\n  Some have said it does not discipline discretionary spending. We have \nnever disciplined discretionary spending with this kind of mechanism. \nWe have done that with spending caps, and we have in place today a \nspending cap. I have supported spending caps to discipline the \ndiscretionary side of the spending.\n  Remember, mandatory spending is two-thirds of Federal spending, and \nwe have nothing in place now to protect us on the revenue side or the \nmandatory spending side. That is what this amendment does.\n  If we look at the President's budget, it is very interesting what we \nsee. Over the next 10 years, he is taking every penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus and using it to pay for other items. What are the \nother items he is paying for? One is his income tax cuts. There will be \na $2.4 trillion Social Security surplus over the next 10 years. By the \nway, it is not surplus at all. It is a misnomer because we are going to \nneed that money when the baby boomers retire. But he is taking that \nmoney that is in surplus for the moment and using it to pay for other \nprograms, including $2.5 trillion of income tax cuts.\n  Income tax cuts are primarily going to the wealthiest among us. If we \nlook at who benefits from the Bush income tax cuts, what we see is the \ntop 1 percent, those earning over $337,000 a year, get 33 percent of \nthe benefit.\n  Our friends on the other side will say they pay more taxes. Indeed, \nthey do, but they do not pay 33 percent of the tax burden in this \ncountry. They pay about 23 percent of the tax burden in this country. \nThey have gotten a disproportionate benefit.\n  If we look at who benefits from Social Security, we see that two-\nthirds of retirees rely on Social Security for more than half their \nincome; 31 percent get at least 90 percent of their income from Social \nSecurity; 33 percent get 50 to 89 percent of their income from Social \nSecurity; 36 percent get less than 50 percent of their income from \nSocial Security.\n  The big problem we have is shown on this chart. This shows the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds that are now in surplus. Those \nsurpluses are being used to pay for other items. The red bars show the \ncost of the President's tax cuts. What one can see is, as the trust \nfunds go past negative, the expense of the President's tax cuts \nexplodes, driving us right over a cliff into deeper and deeper deficit \nand debt.\n  That is what has led the head of the Federal Reserve to urge cuts in \nSocial Security. The head of the Federal Reserve has come before \nCongress and has said: You are overcommitted. You are spending way more \nthan you are taking in, and this is going to lead to an incredible \ncrunch. He said to us: One of the things you ought to consider is \ncutting Social Security benefits.\n  The President said to us repeatedly that Social Security funds should \nnot be used to fund other expenses of Government.\n  In his 2002 budget blueprint, the President said:\n\n       None of the Social Security surplus will be used to fund \n     other spending initiatives or tax relief.\n\n  That is a broken promise. In 2001, in a radio address, the President \nsaid:\n\n       Every dollar of Social Security and Medicare tax revenue \n     will be reserved for Social Security and Medicare.\n  In a radio address on March 3, 2001, the President said:\n\n       We're going to keep the promise of Social Security and keep \n     the government from raiding the Social Security surplus.\n\n  That is exactly what he is doing. That is why this amendment is \nimportant. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote against \nthis amendment. For those who say we are raiding Social Security, I \nbelieve that is absolutely false. We are protecting Social Security \njust like any other budget, just like the budget Senator Conrad passed \nout of the Budget Committee a couple of years ago. He raided Social \nSecurity to the tune--if one uses that terminology, and I do not want \nto use it because I do not believe it--of about $866 billion. He did \nthe same thing that we are doing today.\n  We knew exactly what the law says. The law says if there are surplus \nSocial Security revenues, they are to be invested in T-bills, and I \nwill quote the law. This is the Social Security Act, Section 201(d):\n\n       It shall be the duty of the Managing Trustee to invest such \n     portion of the Trust Funds as is not, in his judgment, \n     required to meet current withdrawals. Such investments may be \n     made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United \n     States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and \n     interest by the United States.\n\n  That is exactly what we do. I think some are trying to politically \nscare people into making a mistake. The mistake would be to say 60 \nvotes are needed to do anything in the future, supposedly pay-go for \neverything.\n  In reality, they did not cover appropriated amounts. There could be \nan appropriation increase of $100 billion. Oh, that does not have to be \npaid for. Maybe there are caps, maybe there are not caps. We have had a \nyear that we did not have a budget resolution and did not have caps. It \nwould be very easy not to have a resolution and not to have caps.\n  Basically, discretionary spending would be exempt from this very new \nstringent requirement. Plus, there would be almost an encouragement for \nmore spending. Some people could say let's increase spending because if \nspending is increased, there will not be a tax cut. Obviously, there \nare some people who do not want to have a tax cut--not only not have a \ntax cut, they do not want to see present law extended. That is really \nwhat we are talking about. Some people want to have a supermajority or \nmandate where there cannot be an extension of present law. So this is \nvery important.\n\n  I heard my colleague say any increases in mandatory, those are \ncovered just like tax increases. That is not the case. There are \nbillions of dollars of mandatory programs that are sunset, but \naccording to the CBO those are assumed to be extended. They do not have \nto be paid for after they are sunset, but taxes are sunset and they \nhave to be paid for. So this makes it tough on the taxpayer.\n  If this amendment passes, there is a big bull's eye on taxpayers. \nLook out, you are getting ready to be hit. Congress is making it a lot \neasier to spend money. New spending on the discretionary and lots of \nmandatory are not covered, but any taxes, even present law extension, \nthose are going to be hit. Taxpayers, look out.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this resolution. I do not think 60 \nvotes\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\nshould be required to pass everything in the Senate, and I am afraid \nthat is what this amendment would lead to.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment. I yield the \nremainder of our time, and I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't know if any of my colleagues are \nprepared to offer an amendment at this time. If not, I would like to \nspeak to the budget which is before the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from Illinois 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 25 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Once again, if any colleagues are prepared to offer an \namendment, please indicate and I would be happy to give them a chance \nto do that.\n  Before beginning, I notice the junior Senator from Michigan is here. \nI would like to ask, if possible, in a colloquy how much time she would \nlike to use so I don't go over. I know she has waited patiently for a \nchance to speak.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I was hoping to have 15 minutes if that \nis possible.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If it is all right with the Senator from Michigan, I will \ntake 15 minutes, and if there is no objection, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the floor then be yielded to the junior Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is an important debate because it is \na debate about promises that have been made and promises that have not \nbeen kept. Many Members can recall President Bush, when he came to \noffice, said he had a plan for putting America's economy back on its \nfeet.\n  Now, understand, when President Bush took office we had gone through \na period of amazing economic expansion in the United States. Under the \n8 years of the previous administration we had created some 27 million \nnew jobs in America. We can remember the feeling of exhilaration and \nexcitement as this economy charged forward. Silicon Valley was leading \nour technology and our economy, and people across the board were \nfinding their retirement plans and savings were growing to historic \nlevels. There was a great feeling of optimism, creation of more jobs \nthan at any time in our history, lower inflation, a situation where we \nhad more new businesses created than we had seen in any comparable \nperiod, and more for women and minorities. It was a dramatic period of \neconomic expansion. It was a period when there was real confidence we \nwere doing the right thing.\n  Some of that is within the control of the President and some of it is \nnot. Giving credit to the previous administration, I believe President \nClinton made an important early decision. When he came to office, he \ndecided his party, the Democratic Party, would do something that \nsurprised many observers. He said, we will seriously and honestly \naddress the deficit.\n  We remember the deficit. Under President Ronald Reagan and President \nGeorge Bush 1, we had amassed annual deficits and a national debt \nemerging from them of record proportion. In fact, there was more debt \nin that period of time than any time since the beginning of the United \nStates of America. The debts just kept on coming.\n  In came President Clinton who said: We can do better; but in order to \ndo better, we have to do two things. One, we have to cut spending. \nSecond, we will have to impose some new taxes. There were tax cuts for \nsure in the package, and I voted for it, but he said those are the \nthings that have to be done. If they are done, President Clinton said \nin 1993, I believe it will be a signal to the business community in \nAmerica that the U.S. Government will get its house in order. We will \nstop running these massive annual deficits. We will stop accumulating \nthis national debt. We will be more responsible. President Clinton \nbrought that proposal to Congress. I was serving in the House at the \ntime. It passed the House of Representatives by one vote, without a \nsingle Republican Congressman voting for it. Then it came to the Senate \nwhere a vote was cast again on President Clinton's plan to get the \neconomy back on its feet, and what happened here? A tie vote broken by \nthen-Vice President Al Gore, all Democratic votes again, passing the \nClinton plan.\n  Members of the Republican Party came to the floor during the debate \nand predicted if President Clinton had his way, if his plan were \nenacted, we would lose jobs, move into a recession, and find our \neconomy permanently damaged. Those speeches were coming at us like \nrapid fire out of a gun from the other side of the aisle. They did not \nprovide one single vote for the Clinton plan to put this economy on its \nfeet. Fortunately, it passed and, in passing, set us on course for the \ngreat economic expansion which I just explained.\n  Now look where we are today. The first thing to do is to consider \nwhere President Bush was when he came to office. This chart is an \nindication of the deficits in surplus in the United States. Under \nPresident Reagan we can see the first deficit he ran into was in the \nrange of $79 billion. Then the annual deficit increased to about $153 \nbillion. In other words, we were overspending that much each year.\n  Then under President Bush's father, the annual $153 billion deficit \ngrew to $290 billion. That was money we were spending we did not have. \nWe were increasing the mortgage of the United States of America every \nsingle year under President Reagan and President Bush's father.\n  Then came President Clinton and he said, as I described earlier, we \nneed to do the responsible thing. We need to cut spending and we need \nto increase taxes on those who can afford to pay. As a result, we see \nthe deficit line go from a high of $290 billion under President Bush's \nfather and the annual deficit start plummeting under President Clinton \nuntil 1997 when we will start running surpluses. Who would have \nguessed, after all those years, 12 or 13 years of straight deficits, we \nstarted running surpluses in America.\n\n  What did a surplus mean? It meant we were putting money into the \nSocial Security fund instead of borrowing it. Why is that important? \nBecause we\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\nhave a horde of Americans, called baby boomers--and I am just outside \nthat class--who will show up for Social Security and Medicare soon. We \nsaid, let's get Social Security and Medicare stronger. We know they are \ncoming. That is what President Clinton did. Because of his decisions, \nwe reached the maximum point in his administration where we had an \nannual surplus of $236 billion, generating more money than we were \nspending. What a change. What a dramatic change over this period under \nPresident Reagan, President Bush's father, and President Clinton.\n  Then look what happened when President Bush came into office. He came \ninto office with an economy that was starting to show some recession, \nit is a natural thing, and came up with a plan for America which called \nfor the most substantial tax cuts in our history, with a substantial \npart of them going to the highest income, wealthiest Americans. \nPresident Bush and his adherents in the House and Senate insisted if \nyou just give a tax break to the wealthiest people in America, they \nwill save it and spend it and invest it in a way that will turn the \nAmerican economy around.\n  President Bush carried the day. I didn't vote for it. Some of my \nDemocratic colleagues did. He passed not one but two major tax cuts.\n  Now look what happened as a result of President Bush's economic \npolicy over the last 3 years and 3 months. Look at this line. We have \ngone from a $236 billion surplus under President Clinton to a $477 \nbillion deficit we are facing today--an abject failure of President \nBush's economic policy.\n\n  Every year we continue to give tax cuts we cannot afford to pay for, \nand we continue to spend money we do not have. How in the world can the \nFederal Government do that? How can we consistently act like a bankrupt \nnation and get by with it? Well, the answer is, we reach into the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  This trust fund is created every single minute of every day by every \nworker in America. As they go to work and earn their wage, the Federal \nGovernment takes about 7 or 8 percent of it from the employee, the same \namount from the employer, and says: We are putting that away for Social \nSecurity, so when you are ready to retire it will be there.\n  All that money accumulates and grows. We pay the current Social \nSecurity recipients, and we save the balance for the future. That \nbalance grows. The way we sustain a deficit is by reaching into that \nSocial Security trust fund and spending it, leaving IOUs behind.\n  The vote that was just taken, for those who are following it, was \nvery basic. It said: Stop reaching into the Social Security trust fund \nto increase tax cuts for America or to increase mandatory spending. You \nsaw what happened. The vote went down resoundingly. I guess my \ncolleagues are being very honest about this. They know we have deficits \nwe cannot handle, and they know you cannot sustain those deficits \nwithout reaching into the Social Security trust fund and taking the \nmoney out, and they are perfectly willing to keep doing that. In fact, \nthey are willing to increase the tax cuts at a time when we are in deep \ndeficit and have to rely on the Social Security trust fund to save it.\n  So what do we have here? We have such a dramatic reversal in such a \nshort period of time. President George W. Bush's economic policy has \nfailed miserably. This red line on this chart, this dramatic increase \nin our annual debt is a clear indication.\n  Now take a look at some other economic indicators. There are those \nwho argue the economy is growing; good signs are on the horizon; a \nreason for optimism. Well, what happened last Friday? Last Friday we \nhad a report from the Department of Commerce about the number of jobs \ncreated last month in our economy. The report said 21,000 new jobs were \ncreated. Cause for celebration? Hardly. All 21,000 new jobs were \ncreated by State and local governments; no net increase in jobs in the \nprivate sector in businesses. Businesses are not creating new jobs. The \nBush economic policy has failed in that regard as well--21,000 new \njobs, all with State and local governments. We need to create about \n125,000 new jobs each month just to keep up with the new entries into \nthe workforce, people who are now looking for jobs for the first time. \nWe are not even keeping up with the new entries.\n  We have an incredible thing happening. Over 400,000 Americans have \nstopped looking. They have been on unemployment for so long they have \ngiven up. They are not even looking any longer. They are not being \ncounted. The number of unemployed people in this economy, \nunfortunately, is growing dramatically.\n  Again, the Bush economic policy has failed, with record deficits, \nhigher than any time in our history. Unfortunately, this President has \npresided over the loss of more jobs during his administration than any \nPresident in the history of the United States since President Herbert \nHoover in the Great Depression.\n\n  Those are the realities of the failed Bush economic policy, and the \nbudget before us today is proof positive of the fact that is likely to \ncontinue.\n  The Bush administration has not been realistic when it comes to job \nprojections. Take a look at this chart. The black line at the bottom \nshows the actual job situation, how many jobs we have had in America. \nThese red lines that come shooting off, suggesting many more jobs are \ngoing to be created, are all predictions by President Bush's \nadministration. The economic reports of 2002, 2003, and 2004 said \nrecovery was on the way, around the corner, and millions--literally \nmillions--of jobs will be created. Each and every time they have been \nwrong. Their policy has been wrong.\n  Just several weeks ago, a gentleman by the name of Gregory Mankiw, \nwho is the head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, sent \nthis Congress a report, signed by President George W. Bush, that took a \nlook at the job situation. Incredibly, Mr. Mankiw reported to us that \nin fact the outsourcing of jobs, the sending of American jobs overseas, \nMr. Mankiw says, is a good thing. It is healthy for us to see American \njobs leave our shores to India and China and other countries around the \nworld.\n  His argument--I suppose among some economists this is credible--was \nthat now jobs that did not used to be ``tradeable,'' in his words, are \ntradeable. Call center jobs--the next time you get a call at home from \nsomebody who wants you to take a credit card or change a phone service, \nask them from where they are calling. I started asking recently. My \nlast two callers were calling from India.\n  This morning we read about a small town in Virginia that is about to \nlose Travelocity, which is an agency which books travel for people \naround the world. Their jobs--several hundred in a small Virginia \ntown--are going over to India. Mr. Mankiw says to Congress: Don't get \nworried. This is a good thing. This is a healthy thing. Call center \njobs in America are tradeable.\n  Well, I do not think Mr. Mankiw is living in the real world. I defy \nhim to take that argument to any main street in America, in Michigan, \nin Idaho, or in Illinois, and say to the people there what we are \nfacing in America today is a good thing, with jobs going overseas.\n  How does that relate to this budget? Sadly, when we look at the job \nsituation, you find that, as Lou Dobbs of CNN estimates, 348 companies \nin America are now outsourcing work overseas, either sending U.S. jobs \noverseas or choosing to employ cheap overseas labor instead of American \nworkers.\n  The President's budget, which we have today, is so deep in red ink he \nhas cut back on what is called domestic discretionary programs, and by \ndoing so, he has no jobs program whatsoever. He does nothing in his \nbudget to end tax breaks for companies that are sending jobs overseas. \nHe does not extend unemployment insurance. During the first 6 months of \n2004, that will mean an estimated 2 million unemployed workers receive \nneither a paycheck nor unemployment insurance. He does not provide the \nmoney for these families to keep their basics together, to pay for \ntheir mortgage and utilities and food and health insurance.\n\n  Time and again, the Republicans in the Congress have refused to offer \nunemployment benefits to the casualties of the Bush economic policy. Is \nthat compassionate conservatism? I do not think so. I think he is \nturning his back on hard-working people who have been victimized by his \nfailed economic policy.\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\n  Also, this budget shortchanges job retraining. Vocational and adult \neducation programs cut by almost 25 percent, from $2.1 billion to $1.6 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, 2.5 million full-time, year-round workers live in \npoverty in the United States. You can talk about all the tax breaks in \nthe world but, frankly, they never reach these folks. Pennies come to \nthem. Thousands come to those in higher income categories.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes, if the Senator from Michigan will bear with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, take a look at the annual growth rate of \nprivate sector jobs under President Bush. You have to go all the way \nback to President Hoover to see such a low growth rate, which had a \nnegative growth rate of over 4 percent. Under President George W. Bush, \nwe see here something that has not happened in this country for almost \n70 years: the loss of private sector jobs because of a failed economic \npolicy.\n  Then when you take a look at the manufacturing jobs, that is where it \nis really painful. Manufacturing jobs are the best-paying jobs in \nIllinois and Michigan. We just had a hearing last Friday. Employees of \nElectrolux--was it in Greenville, MI?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Greenville, MI.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Greenville, MI, a town of about 9,000 people, if I \nremember correctly, and over 2,000 jobs are going to be lost.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Twenty-seven hundred jobs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So, 2,700 jobs. I am glad Senator Stabenow reminds me. \nElectrolux makes Frigidaires. They are moving to Mexico. We asked them \nwhether they sold Frigidaires in Mexico. No. They are going to sell \nthem in the United States. More manufacturing jobs heading over the \nborder.\n  Maytag, in Galesburg, IL--the stories just go on and on and on. It is \nnot like these jobs are leaving and new, good jobs are coming. When we \nasked an employee of Lucent Technologies from Illinois how much he made \nan hour for Lucent after almost 30 years on the job, he said $27. When \nI asked him: What kind of job are you looking for now? He said: I am \nlucky to get one that pays $8 an hour with no benefits.\n  For the Bush administration to argue there are job replacements out \nthere is to overlook the obvious. For certain workers there is nothing \nthat can replace a good-paying manufacturing job in a person's \nlifetime. And that, unfortunately, is the sad reality.\n  When you look at this budget, you realize the obvious.\n  The money is not there for health insurance, which is critical for \nunemployed workers and basically for workers and businesses large and \nsmall. There is no money provided here to basically take care of the 43 \nmillion Americans who don't have health insurance. Many of them are our \nneighbors who get up and go to work every morning, many with children \nwho have no health insurance protection.\n  This budget fails to keep the President's promise on education. \nPresident Bush came to office and said: I am an education President and \nfor No Child Left Behind. It was passed with a bipartisan vote. Still \nhe refuses to find the money to pay for the very program he has \nmandated on State and local school districts. The President's budget \nfor No Child Left Behind falls $9.4 billion short of his promise. At a \ntime when the President says we have to give the wealthiest in America \nsome $45 billion in tax cuts, the President has not kept his word on No \nChild Left Behind.\n  The money is not there to deal with health insurance, nor is there \nmoney to retrain workers who have lost their jobs. That is the best we \ncan get out of President Bush's budget. Is it any wonder people across \nAmerica say: It is time for a change.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his eloquence, \nas usual. My friend from Illinois has addressed concerns we have in \nMichigan as well. There is nothing more important to us than making \nsure everyone has a good-paying job and the health benefits, pensions, \nand other job security that go along with it.\n  Last year Michigan lost more jobs than any other State. We understand \nwhat needs to happen for our families and how to create real economic \nsecurity and to create jobs, to support a level playing field in trade, \nto tackle the rising cost of health care, to invest in education \ninnovation. All of the things that make for the creation of a strong \neconomic policy are what we should be doing. I thank my friend from \nIllinois for speaking to some very important issues.\n  One of my concerns as a member of the Budget Committee is in fact \nthis budget does not adequately fund education. It eliminates some \nimportant areas of technology innovation. A program called the Advanced \nTechnology Program, which we have used in Michigan with the auto \nindustry and other manufacturing industries, partnering with our \nuniversities to create new, cutting-edge technologies that will allow \nus to compete in the global economy, has been proposed for elimination \nin this budget, and that is of great concern to me.\n  Those who don't support tackling the trade issues and creating a \nlevel playing field, those who say free trade, anything goes, point to \neducation and innovation and say: That is how we compete. That is how \nwe create jobs. Yet we see in this budget areas of tremendous need to \ninvest in our people and create opportunity, areas that in fact are \ncut.\n\n  I wanted to speak for just a moment on some things that have been \nsaid in the debate about the challenge for us in total as it relates to \nthe budget. We are told the problem is domestic spending, that, in \nfact, if we were to have only a small amount of growth in our domestic \nprograms--education, protecting the environment, family health care, \nlaw enforcement, homeland security--somehow that is what we ought to be \ndebating because that will make the biggest difference in reducing the \ndeficit.\n  Certainly we want to fund programs in a way that provides \naccountability and efficiency and supports every precious dollar being \nused as wisely as possible. It is important to look at one comparison \nin terms of numbers when we look at where to go to focus our time to \nreduce the massive red ink that has been created in the last 3 years.\n  First, if you exclude the Department of Defense, all discretionary \nspending--so we are not talking about Medicare and Medicaid but all \ndiscretionary funding, education, Head Start, children's health care, \nfamily health care, senior programs, environmental protection, homeland \nsecurity, the COPS Program, supporting firefighters, the Justice \nDepartment, everything we do outside of defense, everything we do \noutside of defense in the discretionary domestic budget--is costing \n$445 billion this year.\n  The deficit projected for this year, 1 year, the deficit during the \nsame time period is $521 billion. We could eliminate every penny of \ninvestment in our children, every penny invested in protecting the \nenvironment, every penny for law enforcement and firefighters and \nhomeland security, and every penny we provide to protect our parks and \nall of the other things we do in the domestic budget, we could \neliminate every penny and we would still have a debt.\n  This is extraordinary.\n  I was fortunate to be in the House of Representatives in 1997 when we \nbalanced the budget for the first time in 30 years. I was very proud of \nthat vote. It was tough because we had to make choices about how to \nbalance the budget. But we did it. We saw at the end of the decade, and \nas I began my term in the Senate, a debate about the largest budget \nsurpluses in the history of the country, $5.6 trillion in surpluses. In \n3 years we have gone to the largest deficit, over $3 trillion in \ndeficit in just 3 years.\n  There is something else that has been talked about. We could wipe out \nevery penny in domestic spending for the United States and not \neliminate this deficit. So surely something else is at play. We have to \nlook at the larger picture of what is going on.\n  That relates to the number shown on this chart. We have tax cuts that \nhave\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\nbeen voted upon by this body in 2001 and 2003. Both enacted and \nproposed tax cuts over the next 10 years will take $2.5 trillion of \nrevenue. So we remove that from the Federal ledger, $2.5 trillion. That \nalmost equals--it is pretty darn close--$2.4 trillion in Social \nSecurity surpluses. We have surpluses built up here. We take dollars \naway here.\n  Now we are being told, because Social Security surpluses are \nessentially being used to fund these tax cuts, we have a surplus on one \nside, we have a deficit on the other. They pretty much equal each \nother. Common sense would say the Social Security surplus is in fact \nfunding these tax cuts.\n  Another way to look at that is, when we look at the amount of Social \nSecurity surplus that is saved in the next 10 years, it is zero. It is \nanother way of saying the same thing. We save zero. It is being used. \nIt is not being saved. It is not being put aside in the infamous \nlockbox we used to talk about and I still think is a good idea. Instead \nwe save zero, and the amount of Social Security surplus that is spent \nis in fact the whole amount, $2.4 trillion.\n  At the same time this is happening, we hear from the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve that because of the challenge in Social Security, \nbecause of the fact the surplus is being used because of the baby \nboomers and the long-time obligations that are coming, we should look \nat raising Social Security taxes or lowering benefits.\n  There is another option. The other option is don't use this money. \nDon't use the Social Security trust fund to fund tax cuts primarily for \nthe privileged few.\n  There are some tax cuts--the child tax credit, the marriage penalty \nrepeal, small business efforts, the lowest income tax bracket being \nlowered--that are helpful to everyone, and they make sense to help grow \nthe economy. But the vast majority of the tax cuts are geared to the \nprivileged few in this country at a time of war, at a time when we need \nto ask everyone to be sacrificing together so that we are not leaving \nmounds of red ink for our children.\n  When we look long term at the budget cuts as compared to Social \nSecurity, other people say, that is not true. Let's look at the reality \nover 75 years. The actuaries look over a 75-year period at the \nsoundness of Social Security. Let's look over the next 75 years. If all \nof the tax cuts that have passed are made permanent, with those being \nproposed by the President, we will see a cost of $12.1 trillion over 75 \nyears; $12.1 trillion of revenues essentially pulled out of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  What is the shortfall in Social Security? Shockingly, a Social \nSecurity shortfall over 75 years is $3.8 trillion. So it is absolutely \naccurate to say, as we look to the future and plan, as we know the baby \nboomers are coming, of which I am one, and we know the challenges of \nhaving more people in retirement and fewer people working, that we \nbetter pay attention to these numbers and understand that, \nunfortunately, the hole that has been dug as it relates to jeopardizing \nSocial Security is one that was dug consciously.\n  We, in fact, can stop that. We can reverse it. We can protect Social \nSecurity for the future, as our leader on the Budget Committee tried to \ndo in the last amendment where he said we are not going to use Social \nSecurity until we can totally protect Social Security; that we are not \ngoing to add to that deficit through either spending or tax cuts. That \nwas the right amendment to adopt, and I commend him for it. I am deeply \ndisappointed it was not adopted.\n  The budget is all about choices. It is all about our values and our \npriorities. I believe at a time of challenge and national security \nconcerns, a time of war, it is all about being in this together as \nAmericans as well, not asking some to sacrifice greatly and others not \nto sacrifice at all.\n  What is great about our country is that we come together and we chip \nin, and we certainly saw that after 9/11. We saw the wonderful spirit \nof what it means to be an American: people willing to chip in, be part \nof the positive solution, be part of helping each other. I believe they \nwant a budget for the United States that reflects the same attitude--\nall of us chipping in, all of us being willing to be responsible for \nthe future for our children and not leave them trillions of dollars in \nred ink that they will then have to figure out how to pay for after we \nare gone.\n  That is not the legacy I want to leave for my children and \ngrandchildren yet to come. I am very interested in having us put \nforward a budget that reflects the values and priorities of all \nAmericans, not just a privileged few. That is what this debate will be \nabout every day this week: What choices are we going to make? Are we \ngoing to do more tax cuts for the privileged few or are we going to \nkeep everybody safe by fully funding all of the homeland security needs \nwe have? Are we going to give more tax cuts for the privileged few or \nare we going to protect Social Security for the next 75 years, for the \nnext generation?\n  We have choices to make, and I am very hopeful that the choices we \nwill make will be ones that will make us proud when we look at the \nfaces of our children in the future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the Senator \nfrom Michigan for an excellent presentation, but much more than that, I \nthank her for the superb contribution she makes on the Senate Budget \nCommittee. I think she has been one of the strongest members of the \nBudget Committee in a very long time. She is somebody who has a very \nstrong background in economics and business issues and understands that \na budget is about choices, and these choices matter. They matter to the \nlong-term economic security of the country. They matter to whether we \nare going to have Social Security and Medicare for our seniors in the \nfuture or if it is going to be dramatically reduced.\n  The Senator from Michigan understands this is a matter of choices \nabout national security, whether we are going to have the resources to \nfund the military in a way that keeps it the most powerful and most \ndominant military in the world.\n  She understands that a budget is about choices between those issues \nthat strengthen us as a nation and as a people in terms of providing an \noutstanding education because that is what it is going to take to be \nfully competitive in a modern world; whether we are going to be able to \nexpand health care coverage in America to deal with the more than 40 \nmillion people in this Nation who do not have health care coverage; \nwhether or not we are going to have homeland security that is something \nthat makes us as safe as we can be in the face of this terrorist \nthreat.\n  Frankly, we on our side question the choices the President has made \nto cut the COPS Program. The COPS Program puts 100,000 police on the \nstreet. The President says cut it 94 percent. What sense does that make \nwhen there is an ongoing terrorist threat? What sense does it make to \ncut port security by almost two-thirds? That is what the President is \nsaying. What sense does it make to cut the funding for firefighters all \nacross America by a third? Those are the choices the President has \nmade, all of it sacrificed on the altar of tax cuts going primarily to \nthe wealthiest among us. As I indicated earlier today, under the \nPresident's plan, the tax cuts he seeks to make permanent would add \n$1.5 trillion to the debt. The President says it is the people's money. \nGive it back. There is nothing to give back. The money is gone. This \ncountry is in debt. The deficit this year alone is going to be \napproaching $500 billion, and the truth is, that does not begin to \ndescribe how deep the hole is because that counts the $160 billion more \nhe is taking from Social Security, every penny of which he has to pay \nback and he has no plan to do it.\n  Now we are talking about an operating deficit in the range of $700 \nbillion in this year alone. And the President comes in and says: Let's \njust hold down the growth of nondefense, nonhomeland security domestic \nspending. That sounds as though he is doing something. But when you \nlook at it, that part of Federal spending is just a tiny share of the \nFederal budget.\n  The spending he is talking about slowing down is only 17 percent of \nFederal spending, and his savings are only about $7 billion when you \nhave a $700 billion problem. I call it the 1-percent solution. He is \nnot dealing with the problem in any serious way.\n  Then the President says: Don't worry; I know we have run up these big\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\ndeficits, the biggest in the history of the country, and we have a lot \nmore coming. But I am going to cut the deficit in half in the next 5 \nyears. But he is not. The only way he cuts the deficit in half the next \n5 years is he just leaves out everything. For example, he leaves out \nany war cost past September 30. Does anybody believe the war in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and the war on terror ends on September 30? The \nCongressional Budget Office tells us it is going to cost $280 billion \nmore, and the President has nothing to pay for it.\n\n  I see the leader in the Chamber and I understand he is ready to offer \nan amendment, so I will cut short my remarks at this moment.\n  I conclude by saying it is time we face reality. The President's \nbudget is not going to cut the deficit in half in the next 5 years. If \none looks at the additions to the debt, what they see is there is \nvirtually no change over the 5 years of the President's plan. The \nadditions to the debt are going to run $500 billion, $600 billion a \nyear every year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2710\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2710.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To create a reserve fund to allow for an increase in \n Veterans' medical care by $2.7 billion and lower the national debt by \n   reducing the President's tax breaks for taxpayers with incomes in \n                      excess of $1 million a year)\n\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $4,860,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $486,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $22,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $4,860,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, increase the amount by $486,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $22,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, increase the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $4,860,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, increase the amount by $486,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $22,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $4,860,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, decrease the amount by $5,346,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, decrease the amount by $5,368,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, decrease the amount by $5,373,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $5,373,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $4,860,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $5,346,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, decrease the amount by $5,368,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, decrease the amount by $5,373,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $5,373,000,000.\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . RESERVE FUND FOR VETERANS' MEDICAL CARE.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     shall revise the aggregates, functional totals, allocations \n     to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, \n     discretionary spending limits, and other appropriate levels \n     and limits in this resolution by up to $2,700,000,000 in \n     budget authority for fiscal year 2005, and by the amount of \n     outlays flowing therefrom in 2005 and subsequent years, for a \n     bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, or conference \n     report that provides additional fiscal year 2005 \n     discretionary appropriations, in excess of levels provided in \n     this resolution, for veterans' medical programs, excluding \n     construction projects and a program that provides grants to \n     states to build long-term care facilities, included in this \n     resolution for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, given all that the brave men and women in \nuniform have done for our country, there should not be any disagreement \nthat veterans should be our top budget priority this year. This is \nespecially true now during a time of war when hundreds of thousands of \nfuture veterans are on the front lines in Iraq in the war on terrorism \nsacrificing everything for this country.\n  Unfortunately, the budget before us does not make veterans a \npriority. It does not demonstrate that we recognize and respect all \nthat we have asked of them. It does not keep the commitment this Nation \nmade to them when we asked them to lay their lives on the line.\n  The budget before us proposes a funding level for veterans health \ncare that is more than $200 million below last year's level adjusted \nfor inflation. In other words, veterans do not even receive what they \nreceived last year. Despite our best efforts, last year's level was \nalso insufficient. There are 60,000 veterans who are already wait-\nlisted for health care as we speak.\n  This budget gets worse. The budget proposes a $250 enrollment fee for \nmiddle-income veterans to receive health care. The budget seeks to more \nthan double the prescription drug copayment for low-income veterans. It \nwould prevent priority 8 veterans from enrolling in veterans health \ncare.\n  Despite the fact that the average veteran must now wait for more than \n6 months to have his or her disability claim processed and a backlog of \n348,000 claims, this budget proposes eliminating 540 claims-processing \nstaff. That is a remarkable development. At a time when we have 348,000 \npending claims, this budget proposes we eliminate 540 of the very staff \nwhose responsibility it is to process these claims.\n  As a result of this increased fee and barriers to access to the \nveterans health care system, the administration's own budget estimates \nmore than 1 million veterans will drop out of the veterans health care \nsystem. My amendment would prevent all of this. It would give the \nveterans the resources and care they have earned. It would restore \nfunding to the level called for by the Independent Budget, a national \ncoalition of leading veterans organizations that have made an \nassessment of what veterans need and deserve. My amendment would add \n$2.7 billion to the veterans health care account and $2.7 billion for \nadditional deficit reduction. The cost of this amendment would be fully \noffset by reducing the tax breaks for those earning $1 million a year \nor more.\n  This chart illustrates how the amendment would be paid for. Taxpayers \nwith incomes in excess of $1 million will receive a tax cut under this \nbudget of $27 billion this year. Coincidentally, that is almost exactly \nthe amount of money that veterans are now given in the health care \nbudget in this year. They will receive a benefit, under these cuts, of \nabout $140,000 a person under the current budget rule. My amendment \nwould reduce that $140,000 to $112,000. Every millionaire in this \ncountry would still get a $112,000 tax cut, and we would simply use the \ndifference between $112,000 and $140,000 to pay for the extra $2.7 \nbillion to go first to pay for the veterans health care, and the other \nto reducing the size of the debt.\n\n  Hundreds of thousands of Americans have served their country \nhonorably. Before we prevail in Iraq and the war on terror, hundreds of \nthousands of other Americans are going to be asked to lay their lives \non the line.\n  In order to demonstrate our appreciation for what so many have \nalready done, and will be asked to do, we have an obligation in this \nbody to do our share. We have an obligation to provide our veterans \nwith the resources and care commensurate with what they have done for \nus.\n  The amendment is very simple. It simply restores to the level the \nindependent budget has required in order to ensure that we eliminate \nthe backlog, and provide the veterans with the care they need while we \nrefrain from asking them to pay additional costs. We eliminate that \n$250 annual fee some veterans will now have to pay. We eliminate the \nincrease in payment for prescription drugs and the per-office visit. We \ndo that simply by reducing the amount of\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\ntax cut, only to millionaires, by approximately $28,000 per year. They \nstill will receive $112,000 in a tax cut in the next fiscal year. That, \nin my view, is a reasonable sacrifice, given the message this amendment \nand this budget, if it were amended, would send to our veterans and to \nthose soldiers in Iraq who are counting on us to do the right thing, \nwho are counting on us to remember not only to support our troops, but \nto support our veterans.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Conrad, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota, did a brilliant job today \nresponding to the false statements made by the Senator from \nPennsylvania. He did it factually and with enough emotion to make his \npoint well taken. I thought it was a stunning retort to these \noutlandish statements that have been made by the Senator from \nPennsylvania for some time now.\n  But in addition to those statements that I think need some \ndiscussion, there was another statement the Senator from Pennsylvania \nmade about why this country is in deficit, why the President's budgets \nare so off kilter. He said it is because of, among other things, \nasbestos litigation. And he talked about how hard it was on business.\n  I acknowledge that the asbestos litigation has been hard on companies \nthroughout America, but not once during the statement of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania did he mention the people who are in dire physical \ncondition--not once. The reason there is this litigation going on is \nbecause people are dying, and suffering. There are two conditions \ncaused by asbestos that are fatal. One is something called \nmesothelioma. With mesothelioma, from the time that you are diagnosed \nwith this dread disease until the time you die is an average of 14 \nmonths. With asbestosis you can linger a long time and suffer a long \ntime. So we shouldn't make these little passing statements about this \nasbestos litigation bankrupting companies--it has not happened. Some \nhave filed bankruptcy without losing a single job in the process. The \nonly people who have been hurt, with their bankruptcies, are the people \nwho are sick and dying.\n  My brother called me a couple of weeks ago and said: Do you remember \nHarold Hansen?\n  I said: Yes, I remember Harold Hansen.\n  My brother is quite a bit older than I am. I idolized my brother. I \nhad two brothers older than I am. They were both wonderful. One passed \naway. But I remember the Hansens. We lived in Searchlight, far from the \nnearest high school, and when we went to high school we lived with \nother people. My brother Dale lived with the Hansen family. I remember \nHarold and Chuck. They were good athletes in high school. I remember \nthem.\n  He said: You know, he called me and he has mesothelioma.\n  I said: Has he ever worked around asbestos?\n  He said not that he knows of, no.\n  So I said: We have to make sure he is taken care of because he \ndoesn't have long to live.\n  And he doesn't. He has about a year left, if he is average.\n  So the fact is, we have to do something about asbestos litigation. \nThere are some cases that are filed that should not be filed, but we \nhave to make sure the people who are sick are protected. And when \npeople come to this floor and just by chance mention this is causing \nthe deficit of this country--let them recognize that people, while they \nare speaking, are dying from what big corporate America did to them.\n  I recommend, for people who want to make statements about how bad \nasbestos litigation is, that they read a couple of books.\n  Let them read ``Fatal Deception,'' a brand new book that talks about \nthe deception of big companies that covered up the disastrous \nconsequences of their use of asbestos. Let them read a book called \n``Libby Montana,'' also a new book that talks about a little town in \nMontana which was decimated as a result of this product. They covered \nup what would happen. For a few hundred thousand dollars, W.R. Grace & \nCompany, which was making billions a year, could have created a clean \nhouse for these people which would have protected them from exposure, \nbut they didn't want to waste the money on these people from Libby, MT. \nIt is not just people who worked in the plants who got sick. Workers in \nthose plants would go home with asbestos in the dust on their clothes \nand the wife would wash their clothes. Now we have wives dying of this \ndisease. Children would come rushing to meet their father coming home \nfrom the plants at Libby, MT, and they would also come in contact with \nthe dust that would come out of their clothes. Now the children are \ndying.\n  I hope Members who come to this floor and make statements about \nasbestos litigation will read those two books. We want to do something \nwith asbestos legislation to make a better approach to the way \nlitigation takes place. But until those people with asbestosis and \nmesothelioma are taken care of, as long as I have breath I will fight \nthe effort to wipe out those cases.\n  My friend from Pennsylvania also didn't mention one reason for the \ndeficit. Some of us on this floor think we are in a quagmire in Iraq. \nWe need to spend money to make sure our troops get everything they \nneed. I attended a meeting in the majority leader's office, along with \nSenator Daschle and Senator McConnell, with the Iraqi Governing \nCouncil. One of these Iraqi Governing Council people said: People in \nAmerica think we have the second largest reserves of oil in the world. \nHe said: I want you and them to know that we have the largest oil \nreserves in the world--not No. 2 but No. 1--and within 2 years we are \ngoing to be producing 6 million barrels of oil a day.\n  That kind of clicked in my head. If that is the case, why don't we, \nrather than giving them the money, loan them the money and secure that \ndebt with oil?\n  That is what we tried to do on the floor. We were, as we say in a \nbaseball game, skunked. We were unable to get enough votes to have the \ncountry of Iraq loaned the money; no, it was, give it to them--a \ncountry producing 6 million barrels of oil a day within a matter of \nmonths. We gave them $150 million in supplemental appropriations.\n  Then the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, last \nweek was asked by the press: We are spending billions of dollars on \nhealth care for Iraq. Don't you think we should be spending some of \nthat in America? He responded by saying we have universal coverage in \nAmerica, because if you do not have insurance you get taken care of. \nTry to explain that to the 44 million people who have no health \ninsurance and who have to go begging if their child has a cold or some \nillness which they do not know what it is. And he says there is \nuniversal coverage. Man, I have trouble accepting that.\n  My friend from Pennsylvania, in addition to not understanding the \nsituation dealing with asbestos, I think doesn't understand the \nsituation about where money has been going during the 3 years of this \nBush administration. We are talking down the economy? He says we are \nthe ones who are creating discomfort with the American people. We are \ntelling the truth. If that is uncomfortable, that is what we have to \ndo.\n  He talks about arcane statistics, referring to the charts of the \nSenator from North Dakota. Sometimes statistics are arcane, if you do \nnot agree with them.\n  We had a situation during the last years of the Clinton \nadministration where we were paying down the national debt. What does \nthat mean? We were spending less money than we were taking in. We were \npaying down the debt. What do we have now? We have red ink as far as \nyou can see. The surplus we had when he took office is gone. That is \nwhat this budget is all about. Whether the programs that this President \nhas pushed forward is bankrupting the country or not, I think simple \nmath says this country is going bankrupt, if it is not already \nbankrupt.\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Conrad, I yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, later on--I do not know if it \nwill be today or tomorrow--I will be offering an amendment to bring the \naccount that deals with veterans health care up by $1.8 billion. This \nis the amount that was considered and agreed to in a joint bipartisan \nreport in the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs as the very minimum \nthat we need over and above the President's request to give the \nveterans of this country the very basic minimal health care they \ndeserve.\n  I must say I was shocked when I offered this amendment in the Budget \nCommittee last week that there was a partisan rollcall vote against \nthis increase. I don't think there is one Senator in this body who has \nnot heard the cries and the pleas from our veterans back in our States, \nor the anguished stories of having to wait months before they could \neven get an appointment with a doctor in order to be able to get a \nprescription.\n  I don't think there is a Senator who hasn't heard the anguished pleas \nfrom veterans about why the President's budget starts to shift a lot of \nthe burden to the veterans by increasing the copays and by an \nenrollment fee, particularly at a time such as this when we are \nhonoring our veterans every day because of the sacrifices we see being \ncarried on by our servicemen and servicewomen around the world. Of all \ntimes and places, not to give our veterans the minimum health care \nwhich they not only expect but which they certainly deserve is just \nunconscionable.\n  Interestingly, there is a double game that is being played. There is \na lot of rhetoric going around. But when it comes time to produce, the \nvotes are never there. We are going to give the Senate an opportunity \nto put their vote where their rhetoric is.\n  This amendment I will be offering at a time our leadership suggests \nwill, in fact, provide for the offsets for the $1.8 billion to come out \nof the tax account and out of the tax loopholes that are rampant in the \nTax Code and in the President's proposed budget.\n  I want to take this opportunity. As soon as the leader of the \ncommittee gives me the high sign, I will be on the floor offering that \nso all the Senators will have an opportunity to vote on that amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank our colleague, Senator Nelson from \nFlorida, who has been such a valuable Member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee. He did a superb job of offering the amendment he has just \ndescribed in the committee.\n  I am very hopeful that either his amendment or Senator Daschle's \namendment will pass so we can increase the amount of money going to \nveterans million dollar care. I held a hearing in my State on this \nquestion. I invited all the veterans organizations. It was \ndisappointing to hear what is happening to veterans across the country. \nWe had testimony of people waiting 10 months to get an appointment for \nspecialty care, an appointment to see an orthopaedic surgeon, an \nappointment to have certain eye care because there is a shortage of \nspecialists in the VA. They testified clearly and compellingly that \nmore money is needed.\n  We will hear from the other side, we will hear from the chairman of \nthe committee, that there have been significant increases of veterans \nmedical care. There is a chart that shows that is exactly true, going \nback 10 or 12 years. We would expect just on inflation alone, over that \nextended period, we would see a doubling of the costs. Remember, when \nwe come to veterans medical care, that upward slope is even sharper \nbecause health care expenditures have been advancing faster than the \nrate of inflation.\n  In addition, the population that is in need of health care is \nexpanding because we have our World War II, our Korean War veterans, \nand our Vietnam vets getting to that age when they need more intensive \ncare. The result is tremendous upward pressure on the costs.\n  That chart shows spending on veterans from I don't know how far back, \n1990 perhaps, $15 billion, and we are now approaching $30 billion; but \nwe have to remember over that extended period of time, not only are we \ndealing with inflation, we are dealing with medical inflation that is \nrunning at higher levels than other inflation. The number of veterans \nwho are in an age group that requires more intensive care is exploding.\n  What was very moving at the hearing I conducted was to hear from \nveterans all across North Dakota. We heard of the tremendous stress on \nthe veterans population because of an inadequate level of care in our \nVA facilities. No. 1, an inadequate number of VA facilities, so many \npeople are traveling for specialty care in North Dakota 12 hours one \nway in a van and then 12 hours back to get a doctor's appointment. We \nhad veterans testify they traveled 12 hours one way in a van, had to go \nall the way to Minneapolis to get specialty care and got there to be \nadvised their appointment had been canceled and then had to get back in \na van and drive 12 hours back to North Dakota. That is not right.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for \nyielding.\n  Just to add to his comments what he has described in North Dakota, \nimagine because of our size and particularly during the winter months \nwhen so many veterans come to the State of Florida how the problems are \ncompounded. When a veteran has to wait 5 months for an appointment just \nto see a doctor to get a prescription, that is not health care for our \nNation's veterans.\n  I have had occasion to talk to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nquite frequently recently on problems we have in some of our hospitals \nin Florida. Listen to what he said in the House Veterans Affairs' \nCommittee on February 4 of this year. Secretary Principi said:\n\n       I asked OMB for $1.2 billion more than I received.\n\n  Even the Secretary of the VA is calling for money.\n  Then is it any wonder our Senate Veterans' Committee in a bipartisan \nanalysis of the VA budget concludes that we should have at least $1.8 \nbillion more? That is the figure I have offered in the amendment I will \nbe offering.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for yielding.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Florida for making the point. It \nis an important point. We had testimony at my hearing where people have \nwaited 10 months to see specialists.\n  While it is absolutely true what the Senator from Colorado shows on \nhis chart, that we have seen substantial increases already in veterans \nhealth care funding, veterans medical care funding, it is also true we \nare still not meeting the need. The reason for that is not only \ninflation but medical inflation and the sharp increase in the number of \nveterans being served.\n  In 2002, 4.7 million were provided health services. That is expected \nto increase to 5.2 million in 2005. So we have, really, a double \nwhammy. We have inflationary costs, medical inflation running far ahead \nof regular inflation. On top of that, the number of veterans seeking \ncare and needing care increasing now, of course, with the operation in \nIraq and Afghanistan. All who have been to Walter Reed have seen that \ncircumstance firsthand. We have seen the wards literally filled with \nyoung soldiers and some not so young who have been grievously injured. \nThey deserve to know they will get the best medical care this country \ncan provide.\n  That is what the Senator from Florida is saying in the Senate. That \nis what the Democratic leader is saying in the Senate. We have a \ncommitment here. This is a priority. It is a priority that ought to be \nmet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator such time as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n[[Page S2414]]\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt the veterans have sacrificed a lot \nfor our freedom in this country. I am looking at this amendment where \nwe have $5.4 billion we take out of tax cuts. I am assuming a lot of \nthat would come out of the child tax credit, for example, and then it \nis put over in reserve, perhaps, to be used later by the appropriators.\n  There are several points I will make. No. 1, this administration and \nthe budgeteers in this Senate have been committed to the issue of \nveterans. This chart shows a picture is worth a thousand words. Look at \nthe year 2000; before that it is very much a flat line. Then after the \nyear 2000, after President Bush has been elected to office, we see a \nvery distinct steady climb in the amount of benefits provided for \nveterans.\n  In real figures, in 1997 we were looking at 2.8 percent increase on \nveterans medical care; in 1998, 4.2 percent; in 1999, .7 percent; in \n2001, we had 7.8 percent--and it persists--in 2002, a 7.6 percent \nincrease; in 2003, a 12.3 percent increase; in 2004, an 11.1 percent \nincrease. We do not have the medical cost-of-living increases for 2004, \nbut prior to that most of those were in the 4 percent range, so we were \nappropriating dollars over and above what the medical cost-of-living \nfigures were showing. We were sensitive to that. We all realize that \nthere are a lot of needs out there for veterans. I see a lot of need \nfor veterans in my State.\n  Here is what concerns me about the amendment. We have young families \nright now making a huge sacrifice for us in fighting for freedom in \nIraq, Iran. I have a lot of families in Colorado, families all over the \nState that have young children. They are taking advantage of the child \ntax credit. Do we take this away, in the way of a tax increase, do we \ntake away that benefit and make it available to the veterans when we \nhave been giving them a double-digit increase for the last several \nyears? There are a lot of different choices they have to make between \nthe balance of our needs. I guess one of the concerns I have is how \nthese tax increases being proposed by the other side are going to \nimpact our active military, and also making the assumption that our \nveterans do not pay taxes. They do pay taxes.\n\n  I hear as much concern from veterans about the effect of taxes on \ntheir daily lives as I do from any other population. Of course, we \ndon't hear too much from those who are right now serving over in Iraq \nwho have dependents because they are tied up with that. But to think in \nthis debate that somehow or other these tax increases are not going to \nhave an adverse impact on those already serving in the military and our \ncurrent veterans of foreign wars--we have to keep this issue in \nbalance.\n  My point is, in this whole debate, in trying to imply that somehow we \nhave not been sensitive to the needs of the veterans of this country, \nall one has to do is look at the double-digit increases that have \nhappened in the last several years for the veterans, exceeding the cost \nof living for medical care, what they call the medical care inflation \nrate. But, again, we cannot assume that veterans do not pay taxes. They \ndo. We need to balance this out.\n  I think what the Budget Committee has reported out is responsible. It \nis a little bit different than what the President proposed. For \nexample, the President proposed a $250 enrollment fee. We took that \nout. We were sensitive to what impact today's environment is having on \nveterans. We took that out.\n  I think this has a good balance. I would hate to upset that balance. \nI would hate to take away a tax cut that is going to have a beneficial \neffect for our men overseas. I think it will have a beneficial effect \non our veterans as they are trying to save their money to meet their \nown needs with their own families at home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Daschle \namendment to increase funding for VA medical care.\n  America is at war, and my thoughts are with our troops. Our men and \nwomen in uniform have my steadfast support, and so do those men and \nwomen who fought before them. We need to get behind our troops and our \nveterans, and use this budget to support them. We must support the \nbrave men and women who have fought for our country. Our veterans need \nto know that America is with them and that we owe them a debt of \ngratitude.\n  As the ranking member on the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, my \nguiding principle for the VA budget is that we keep the promises we \nmade to our veterans. This means no toll charges on veterans to get \nhealth care or prescription drugs, and no waiting lines for veterans to \nget medical care. But the VA's budget request puts new toll charges and \nmeans tests on our veterans.\n  Specifically, the budget proposes four things. First, the budget \nproposes to keep the VA closed to priority 8 veterans. These are \nveterans who are not disabled as a result of their service, and who the \nVA considers to be higher-income. Second, the budget proposes a new \n$250 membership fee for priority 7 and 8 veterans. Third, the budget \nassumes that VA will increase outpatient primary care copayments from \n$15 to $20. And finally, the budget proposes to increase prescription \ndrug copayments from $7 to $15.\n  We have great respect for VA Secretary Principi. He's a combat \ndecorated Vietnam veteran who continues to serve his country. But he's \nbattling OMB now for adequate VA funding, and I am deeply concerned \nthat the budget OMB gave VA this year leaves VA foraging for funding.\n  Over a year ago, the VA health care system stopped accepting new \npriority 8 veterans. Manufacturing is fading and private health \ninsurance is failing. And many of those affected are priority 8 \nveterans. Many corporations involved in manufacturing had defined \nbenefits plans that included health plans with guaranteed retiree \ncoverage. For these veterans, VA healthcare is their last safety net, \nuntil they turn 65 and are eligible for Medicare.\n  For example, in Maryland, there are 13,000 Bethlehem Steel retirees. \nMany are Vietnam veterans. They came back from serving their country at \nwar, and they continued to fight for America's national and economic \nsecurity by working in our steel mills. But now, many have lost their \nhealth insurance because of Bethlehem Steel's bankruptcy. They are not \neligible for Medicare yet. Under this budget, many will be turned away \nfrom VA--the safety net they counted on will not be there because VA \nwill continue to shut-out priority 8 veterans.\n  Bethlehem Steel's veterans, and other veterans who worked in \nmanufacturing or for other businesses that don't offer health \ninsurance, fought for their country and now they will have to fend for \nthemselves on the open-market for health insurance. I am deeply \nconcerned that this policy and many other potholes in VA's budget leave \nour veterans paying toll charges, standing in lines, or without any \nhealthcare at all.\n  In the last 5 years, the VA-HUD Subcommittee has provided large \nincreases for medical care--$1.7 billion in 2000, $1.3 billion in 2001, \n$1 billion in 2002, $2.4 billion in 2003, and $3 billion in 2004. We \ndid this because we know that the failure of private health insurance \ncompanies and high prescription drug costs are really straining our \nveterans on fixed incomes. At the same time, our veterans' population \nis growing, and getting older. Today, VA treats 2 million more veterans \nthan in 1996.\n  Last year, the VA-HUD Subcommittee rejected the proposals that we see \nin the administration's budget request again this year. Instead, we put \n$1.6 billion more than the request in the Federal checkbook for VA \nmedical care. Our veterans didn't stand in waiting lines when they were \ncalled up or they volunteered to serve our country. So they shouldn't \nhave to stand in line to get medical care.\n  Veterans who need specialized health care services must not be kept \nwaiting--like spinal cord injury care, blind rehab, and prosthetics. \nFor example, the Blinded Veterans Association tells us that there are \nover 2,000 veterans waiting up to 2 years for admission into a blind \nrehab center.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support our veterans in this \nbudget by supporting the Daschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator?\n\n[[Page S2415]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield time to the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  How much time does the Senator seek?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first, I want to respond to the question \nposed by my colleague from Colorado. The amendment before us does, in \nfact, propose that we increase spending for veterans by recovering some \nof the tax cuts. But it does that only for those who are receiving \nincomes in excess of $1 million a year.\n  So with respect to the concern that was expressed about those \nNational Guard men and women who are now serving in Iraq being \ninconvenienced by this amendment, I would venture to guess there are \nvery few of those who are now serving in Iraq who are making $1 million \na year or more.\n  This amendment is not about reducing the child tax credit. It is not \nabout cutting aid for working families. It is not about that at all. It \nis about trying to ratchet back just a little bit of the tax cut for \nthose earning over $1 million a year in income and using it to invest \nin health care for veterans.\n  It is very simple. In the year 2005--that is next year--those with \nincomes in excess of $1 million a year will have received $27 billion \nin tax cuts from the President's tax cut proposal. This amendment \nproposes taking $2.7 billion of that $27 billion and using it to invest \nin veterans health care.\n  The other side is saying this amendment will hurt working families, \nkids, and childcare. Don't believe any of that; just read the \namendment. Then you will understand none of that applies to this \ndebate. So the question for this Congress is, Will we ever keep our \npromise to veterans? Will we ever do that?\n  We have a kind of tax that we apply for veterans who have a \ndisability. Their military pensions are reduced dollar-for-dollar by \nthe amount they receive in disability from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. We tried to get rid of that offset. But the President \nthreatened to the entire Defense Authorization Bill if Congress tried \nto fix the problem.\n  Serve our country, we say to our veterans, and you will receive \nhealth care benefits. But we do not meet the promise. It is time for \nthis Congress to ask itself the question: Are you going to keep \npromising? If so, are you ever going to keep the promise? Because you \ncannot promise veterans you will provide health care and then have them \nserve their country and then come back to find out we actually did not \nreally mean that.\n\n  Many of those who need this health care, these days, are those who \nTom Brokaw calls the greatest generation, that group of Americans who, \nin his book, he describes as laying on Omaha Beach on the D-Day \ninvasion, who were in Guadalcanal, who went across the sands of \nnorthern Africa, through France, and into Germany. That greatest \ngeneration fought for this country with valor.\n  At the end of May we are going to dedicate a wonderful memorial to \nthe World War II veterans here on The Mall. But we apparently have \ndecided that we do not have enough money to keep our promise to them \nfor the health care we indicated they would receive.\n  Many of them are now in their seventies and eighties and are at the \nmaximum need for that health care, and we say we just do not have the \nmoney. But we have the money to give those who make $1 million or more \nin income a year $27 billion in tax cuts next year but we do not have \n$2.7 billion to invest in health care for veterans. It does not make \nsense to me.\n  One day I traveled to a VA hospital on a Sunday morning. A sister of \na veteran had asked if I could get the medals for this veteran. I have \nalready told my colleagues this story on another occasion, but it is \nworth repeating. They were medals he earned in World War II conflicts. \nSo I did.\n  On a Sunday morning, I went to the VA hospital to present him with \nhis medals. He was an American Indian. His name was Edmond Young Eagle. \nEdmond was dying of lung cancer. I did not know it at the time but he \nwould die in 7 days.\n  But on that Sunday morning, at that VA hospital, the doctors came \ninto the room, the nurses came into the room--his sisters were there; \nsome people even drove up from the Old Soldiers Home in Lisbon, ND--and \nwe cranked up the bed so Edmond Young Eagle was in a sitting position. \nHe was sick but he was well aware of what was happening that morning.\n  I pinned on his pajama top the medals this man had earned in the \nSecond World War. He fought in northern Africa. He fought in Europe. He \nhad been at D-Day, at Normandy. On that day, 7 days before he died of \nlung cancer, as I pinned the medals on his pajama top, this American \nIndian said to me: It's the proudest day of my life.\n  He fought for his country. He came back, lived on the reservation, \nnever had very much, never had a family. He did not have children. He \nworked odd jobs. But he was enormously proud--enormously proud--as he \nlay dying in the hospital of the service he had given to his country.\n  This country can do no less, in my judgment, for all of those \nveterans than to say to them: We are proud of you. And part of that \npride will be registered by our vote in favor of full health care \nbenefits for veterans to whom we have given that promise.\n  One day I was holding a town meeting in North Dakota. A man came to \nthe meeting, an older fellow with kind of stubbled white whiskers. He \nhad not shaved for some long while. He walked up in front of the entire \ncrowd and he said: Mr. Senator, my teeth don't fit, and they cut my \ngums and cut my lips. He opened his mouth to show me the cuts in his \nmouth.\n  He said: I flew in the Air Corps in the Second World War and they \npromised me health care. And they gave me teeth a long time go. Now \nthey don't fit. They won't give me new teeth.\n  He said: I don't have any money.\n  He was nearly 80 years old, destitute, with no money. He had cuts in \nhis mouth from teeth that didn't fit and a VA that said: We're sorry, \nno teeth.\n  That should not happen to veterans in this country. It should not \nhappen. We know better than that. If this country cannot keep its \npromise and show its gratitude to those who serve America, tell me what \nis a higher priority--not five, just one? Tell me what is a higher \npriority?\n  We have seen people come to this floor breathless about giving \nmillionaires tax cuts, believing if we give more tax cuts to those at \nthe upper income level, somehow American's ship of state should begin \nsailing once again.\n\n  We will spend $27 billion next year to give tax cuts to those whose \nincomes are $1 million or more a year. The question on this amendment \nis, will we spend $2.7 billion of that to provide health care for \nveterans to whom we have promised that health care?\n  My colleague Senator Conrad has described the circumstances of the \nveterans health care delivery system. We have more people reaching that \nage, Second World War veterans who need health care. They come to the \nVA system to claim it, only to be told: We are sorry. It is not \navailable. You have cataracts? You can wait a year or, in the case of \nNorth Dakota, as my colleague said, you can drive from Fargo to \nMinneapolis, 225 miles and, by the way, do it three times. Then you get \nyour cataract surgery. You go down for a checkup, then go back for \nsurgery, and then go back and get checked up again. And, by the way, do \nthat after you have waited for 9 to 12 months, and maybe you get all \nthat if you are lucky.\n  Why? Because there the VA doesn't have enough money. We couldn't \nafford it. The health care system doesn't have enough money. We have \nplenty of money for people at the top of their income ladder, calling \non their friends around here for tax cuts.\n  This is about choices. It is always about choices in this Chamber. \nWhat do we choose to do? What is our priority. Someone once said, think \nof the task of writing an obituary for someone you never met but had a \ncheck register with which you could judge that person's life. What \nwould you know about and what would you say about their priorities? \nSuch is true of this budget of ours. One hundred years from now we will \nall be gone. Yet historians can take a look at what we decided was\n\n[[Page S2416]]\n\nimportant. What did we describe as valuable? What were our choices? \nWhat was our value system? You can tell something about that by looking \nat these budgets. What did you choose to spend the taxpayers' dollars \non? What did you invest in? Did you do things that kept your promise? \nDid you do things that invested in the future?\n  That is the choice when we vote on this amendment. I am pleased to \nhave cosponsored the amendment with my colleague Senator Daschle. We \nlive in a region of the country where people drive long distances for \nhealth care. We are told North Dakota is one of the least well served \nregions of America with respect to veterans health care, measured by \nthe number of miles veterans have to drive to access the health care \nsystem. We need to change that. Senator Conrad and I and others are \nworking to do so.\n  One way we would change it is to decide now to make the tough choice \nand say: This is valuable. This is worth providing funding for, to \nimprove health care for America's veterans.\n  One final point: We talk a lot about service to country these days. I \nand many of my colleagues have been to the veterans hospitals in the DC \narea, visited with many veterans who have been injured in this Iraq \nwar, injured in other circumstances. Many now will return from Iraq. We \nhave the largest rotation of troops going on since the Second World \nWar, 120,000 or 130,000 troops moving from that region of the world, \nIraq, Afghanistan, back into this country, and then rotating a similar \nnumber into that region.\n  As these veterans come back to our country, they will be welcomed. \nOur country will say: A job well done. Thank you for your service. Our \ncommunities will have celebrations. Families will open their arms to \ntheir loved ones. The question is, will this Congress celebrate their \nreturn? Will this Congress open its arms to our veterans by casting \nvotes that say to them: We stand with you and we keep our promise with \nrespect to veterans health care?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about the \nfacts. Every once in a while we need to get back to facts. I made the \nstatement in our Budget Committee no matter what level we assumed in \nthe budget for veterans, some people would try to offer amendments to \nincrease it. It is almost a habit. It is going to happen. I guess we \nhave to expect it.\n  Let me throw out a few facts. The budget we have before us increases \nveterans care, mandatory and discretionary, by 14.5 percent.\n  I looked at the amendment and I said, how much does this increase \noutlays for veterans? It is zero. So we have a lot of rhetoric. It \nincreases taxes over present law, certainly over the budget resolution. \nBut then it tries to avoid a budget point of order by creating a \nreserve fund that says, well, if and when the appropriators spend more \nmoney, then we will give them more money.\n  I don't know that that would pass a budget point of order. I will \nhave to talk to the Parliamentarian about it. But it is life's little \ngame. It doesn't increase benefits for veterans, at least directly.\n  I think I heard the sponsor of the amendment say, the budget before \nus has copays on drugs for certain veterans, level 7 and 8 veterans. \nThat was in the President's budget. It is not in our budget resolution. \nFrankly, when people talk about crowding, level 7 and 8 are for \nnonservice-connected and high income veterans. People who might be \ninjured playing basketball or something else like that and have high \nincomes would have to have a higher copay under the administration's \nproposal. It may be a good proposal. Anyway, we didn't assume it in \nthis budget. We also didn't assume that $250 deductible on the same \ncategory of people, high income people, nonservice connected. It was \nproposed by the administration. We did not assume it in the budget. It \nwas mentioned that we did. Maybe he was referring to the President's \nbudget, not the budget before us.\n  Let's talk about some of the facts. The facts are, when I look at how \nthe function totals have grown over the years, I look in 1993, total \nveterans benefits and services was $36 billion. In the year 2001, it \nwas 47. That was an increase of about $9 billion. In 2001, it was 47. \nToday it is 70, actually 70.34. Last year it was 61. This is mandatory \nas well as discretionary. Both count, both are real dollars. Both are \nUncle Sam writing the check. To go from $61 billion in 2004 to $70.4 \nbillion in 2005, that is a 14.5 percent increase.\n  Even though we have allocated 14.5 percent, some people say that is \nnot enough, and we would have to have 22 or 25 percent if this \namendment was adopted and if this reserve fund was created and if it \nwas released.\n  I don't know when you say enough is enough. I understand there is \ndemand on veterans care. Senator Allard pointed out the amount of money \nwe have spent has risen dramatically. I might mention, it has grown \nmore in the last few years. In just veterans health care services \nalone, it has risen from $21 billion in 2001 to $29 billion under this \nresolution. That is a very significant percentage increase. I could go \non and on. We have done a lot.\n  I might mention we have done a lot in other areas. I mentioned \nmandatory as well as discretionary. Last year we passed concurrent \nreceipts, so starting for the first time this year, veterans who are \nservice-connected disabled with 50 percent or more rating receive both \nmilitary retirement and VA disability. That affects about 250,000 \ndisabled military retirees. We passed the Montgomery GI bill increasing \nthe benefits of that 52 percent in educational benefits. They can \nreceive benefits equaling up to $35,000 worth of GI benefits.\n\n  Veterans buying their first homes, we have increased the VA home loan \nguarantee by 20 percent up to a maximum mortgage of $240,000. We have \ndone a lot.\n  Under this budget we increase medical care, which I have heard is \nbeing cut, by $1.4 billion over last year. So we have done a lot. We \nincreased medical and prosthetic research by about 25 percent. I could \ngo on and on. A lot has been done. Yet I see this amendment says we \nhaven't done near enough. We want to it grow 20 percent.\n  How sustainable is that when we are trying to do a budget that holds \nthe growth of spending down close to a freeze in nondefense areas? We \ndidn't hold it to a freeze in VA. VA discretionary and mandatory is \n14.5 percent. That is a big increase. Yet it is still not enough.\n  I want to attack how this is being paid for. I have heard some people \nsay this assumes there is only going to be a tax on millionaires. That \nis not in the budget resolution or the amendment. The amendment says, \nlet's raise taxes by about $5.4 billion for 2005. One can say, our \nassumption is that is only going to be on millionaires. It reminds me \nof Russell Long: Yes, tax someone. Don't tax me, tax somebody behind \nthe tree. Tax somebody else.\n  Well, what we are assuming in the budget resolution, what we guess we \nmight be successful in getting passed, what I hope and expect we will \nbe successful in getting passed is a continuation of present law.\n  In present law, most of those benefits go to low-income people, to \nfamilies. For example, the child tax credit is $2.6 billion. The \nmarriage penalty relief is $5.4 billion. So we almost pay for this if \nwe eliminate the marriage penalty relief that we have given people for \n2004 and that some want to give in 2005.\n  This idea we are just going to tax millionaires, do my colleagues \nthink the President is going to sign a bill that is going to increase \nmarginal rates? I can guarantee you he will not. I know the President \nvery well. I can tell you we will not let that pass. I am not going to \nlet it pass. I happen to be on the Finance Committee. I can talk for a \nlong time. That is not going to happen.\n  People can say: We are just going to tax these upper income rates. \nThose happen to be small businesspeople. The real tax debate is: Are we \ngoing to extend present law? Are we going to make present law \npermanent, or are we going to extend permanent law? Those are family-\nfriendly tax cuts--marriage penalty relief, child tax credit, and the \n10-percent rate.\n  Some people are saying we do not want to do those cuts; we do not \nwant to extend those cuts. My point is, if you look particularly in the \nlast few years, since President Bush has been in office, total spending \nfor veterans care\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\nhas risen dramatically. It has risen more than Bill Clinton's first 8 \nyears--substantially more. The total amount of outlays since 2001 has \nincreased by $23 billion. In President Clinton's 8 years, total \noutlays, mandatory and discretionary, grew by $11 billion. Yet that is \nstill not enough, according to this amendment.\n  Then this amendment says let's just increase taxes. They assume it is \ngoing to be on those darn millionaires. For one, they cannot make that \nassumption. If you read the amendment, it doesn't say that. It tells \nthe Finance Committee: Raise more taxes than assumed by this resolution \nby several billion dollars.\n  Also, this is interesting: Oh, this just applies to 2005. Sure, if we \nare going to increase spending by $2.7 billion in 2005, you might as \nwell multiply that by 10 plus an inflater because this is not going to \nhappen for 1 year. We are not going to fund it for 1 year and drop it \noff, just as I hope we do not give a tax cut to families and then stop \nit at the end of this year. I hope we don't. So the real cost of this \namendment over a 10-year period of time would probably be more like $35 \nbillion, and people should be aware of that fact.\n  My guess is we will have a lot of amendments where people will want \nto raise taxes and raise spending. I happen to disagree with that. I \ndisagree and will take issue with this idea of increasing marginal \nrates from 35 percent. When Bill Clinton was elected, the maximum rate \nwas 31 percent. It went all the way up to 39.6, and we finally have it \ndown to 35 percent. Thirty-five percent happens to be the same rate \nthat corporations pay. Why should individuals who maybe own a business, \nmaybe a restaurant or something, why should they pay more than the \ncorporate rate? That would be bad policy. If you want to slam the door \non the economic recovery, that is a good way to do it because about 80 \npercent of the jobs are created by small business, and they are 80 \npercent of the beneficiaries of that top percent.\n  That top percent rate does not fly. There is nothing in this \namendment when one reads it that says it only applies to millionaires. \nThat is in rhetoric but not in reality. The reality is it raises taxes \nby $5.4 billion, and we are going to assume, yes, maybe eventually it \nis going to come to Veterans Affairs even though there is not an outlay \nfor the VA in this amendment.\n  At the appropriate time, I will urge my colleagues to vote against \nthis amendment. I advise my colleagues my expectation is we will be \nvoting on this amendment probably in the next 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Members be added as cosponsors to Senator Daschle's \namendment: Senator Boxer, Senator Feingold, Senator Reid of Nevada, \nSenator Lincoln, Senator Dorgan, Senator Graham of Florida, Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Leahy, Senator Johnson of South Dakota, and \nSenator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as always, the chairman of the committee \nhas been very articulate in his defense of his budget. The problem is \nhe is defending the indefensible when it comes to the question of \nfunding for veterans medical care.\n  Yes, there have been increases in funding for veterans medical care. \nI think the chart the Senator from Colorado had up showed veterans \nmedical care back in 1990 was about $15 billion, and now in that period \nof time--14 years, actually 15, to 2005--it is almost double, not \nquite.\n  Medical inflation in that period of time would lead to a doubling \nalone--only medical inflation. Is that the only factor forcing up costs \nfor veterans medical care? No.\n  Let's recall in 1996 this Congress voted to expand eligibility for \nveterans medical care. In 1996, there were 100,000 in categories 7 and \n8, and by 2003, the number eligible increased from 100,000 to 1.3 \nmillion. In categories 1 through 6, there were 2.6 million people in \n1996. By 2005, that will increase to 3.7 million people. The fact is, \nthe increases for veterans medical care are not keeping pace with the \ndemands.\n  The chairman of the committee talks about facts. I agree. Let's talk \nabout facts, and the facts are that medical inflation over that period \nof time has doubled the cost to provide the same coverage to the same \nnumber of people. We have not quite doubled the amount of money.\n  It is not just a matter of medical inflation for the same number of \npeople. The number of people eligible has been dramatically expanded by \naction of this Congress. Again, in 1996, we dramatically increased \neligibility, and the number of those in categories 7 and 8 that was \nonly 100,000 of the workload in 1996, by 2003 had increased to 1.3 \nmillion. That is an increase of more than tenfold.\n  In categories 1 through 6, 2.6 million people were eligible in 1996. \nBy 2005, that is expected to reach 3.7 million people. That is an \nincrease of almost 50 percent.\n  The reality we are confronting is not just numbers on a page. The \nreality we are confronting is, Are we providing adequate resources for \nthe medical care of the Nation's veterans? The Nation's veterans have \nlooked at the President's budget and have said it is inadequate. They \nhave said it is inadequate to the tune of about $3 billion.\n  That is why Senator Daschle is on the Senate floor saying we ought to \nincrease veterans medical care by $2.7 billion. He has said we ought to \npay for it, and we ought to pay for it by looking to those who are \nfortunate enough to be earning over $1 million a year and ask them to \ngive up 10 percent of their tax cuts.\n  Their tax cuts in 2005 are going to cost $27 billion. The Senator \nfrom South Dakota is asking our colleagues to go to those who are the \nwealthiest among us, earning over $1 million a year, and ask them to \ngive up 10 percent of their tax benefits in that year so we can more \nadequately fund veterans medical care. That is a reasonable request.\n  I note the Senator from Wisconsin is in the Chamber, and I ask him \nhow much time is he seeking.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, if I could have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes off the resolution to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor yielding me this time.\n  I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota to fully fund health care programs for our Nation's \nveterans.\n  America is indebted to our veterans and military personnel and to \ntheir families for the extraordinary service and sacrifice that they \nhave so selflessly provided to our country. As we debate this budget \nresolution, our men and women in uniform put their lives on the line in \nthis country and around the world, from Iraq to Afghanistan to the \nBalkans to the Korean DMZ and countless other places. We thank those \nmen and women and we hope for their quick and safe return to their \nfamilies.\n  At the same time that the current members of our Armed Forces serve \nus across the globe, we must not forget those who paved the way for the \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines of today. Our Nation's veterans \nand their families have given selflessly to the cause of protecting our \nfreedom. Too many have given the ultimate sacrifice for their country, \nfrom the battlefields of the Revolutionary War that gave birth to the \nUnited States, to the Civil War, which sought to secure for all \nAmericans the freedoms envisioned by the Founding Fathers, to the \nglobal fight against Nazism and fascism in World War II.\n  In the last century, Americans fought and died in two world wars and \nin conflicts in Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. They also \nparticipated in peacekeeping missions around the globe, some of which \nare still going on.\n  We owe it to our veterans to ensure that they have a decent standard \nof living and access to adequate health care. It is the least that we \ncan do in return for their courageous service to our country. This is \nespecially important as we welcome home a new generation of veterans \nwho are serving in Iraq and in the fight against terrorism. We must \nensure that their service and sacrifice, which is much lauded during \ntimes of conflict, is not forgotten once the battles have ended and our \ntroops have come home.\n\n[[Page S2418]]\n\n  The amendment that we are considering will go a long way toward \nensuring that the VA health care system can meet the demand for care \nfrom the existing veterans population and will help to ensure that the \nVA is able to care for returning veterans who will require health care \nservices.\n  For too long our veterans have had to wait months for appointments to \nsee a doctor at a VA facility. Others are unable to access VA care \nwithin a reasonable distance from their homes. I cannot tell my \ncolleagues how many times I have heard that comment at the town \nmeetings ended all over Wisconsin. And still others are told by the VA \nthat they are not eligible for care because their priority group level \nis too low. The amendment before us today would ensure that the \nVeterans Health Administration is funded at the level recommended by \nthe Independent Budget for Veterans Affairs, which is drafted annually \nby a coalition of veterans service organizations. By their \ncalculations, the President's budget request falls short by nearly $2.8 \nbillion, and the underlying budget resolution is $2.7 billion below \nwhat would be needed to meet demand at VA health care facilities during \nfiscal year 2005.\n  The amendment that is before the Senate would increase the amount for \nveterans' health care in the budget resolution by $2.7 billion. This \nincrease would ensure that all veterans, including those in priority \ngroup 8 who are currently barred from enrolling in the VA health care \nsystem, receive care at VA facilities. It would also eliminate the need \nfor the proposed prescription drug co-payment increases and new user \nfees for veterans in priority groups 7 and 8 that have been proposed by \nthe President.\n  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs said the following about his \nDepartment's budget request:\n\n       My top priority in health care is to ensure that resources \n     are available to care for those veterans who are most \n     deserving of VA's medical services. The proposals in this \n     budget will assist us in continuing that focus on our core \n     service population in our health care system.\n\n  Let me repeat that. The Secretary said his budget would ensure that \nresources are available to care for those veterans who are ``most \ndeserving of VA's medical services.''\n  In my view and in the view of veterans and their families who I have \nspoken with around Wisconsin, all veterans are deserving of the VA's \nmedical services. I am troubled that the Secretary's comments seem to \npit groups of veterans against each other for health care services. The \namendment before the Senate today will enable the VA to serve all \nveterans who wish to take advantage of their health care benefits.\n  In order to offset this increase, the amendment would reduce the tax \ncut for Americans making more than $1 million annually. This is a more \nthan fair exchange that will allow us to provide badly needed health \ncare services to our veterans.\n  I am deeply concerned that for the last several years funding for \nveterans health care and other programs for our Nation's veterans has \nbeen delayed as Congress and the administration wrangle over the \nFederal budget. I believe strongly that we should consider and pass a \nbudget resolution and 13 individual appropriations bills each year. I \nregret that the VA budget has been rolled into omnibus measures, thus \ndelaying this important funding for our Nation's veterans.\n  I hope that this amendment will be the first step in providing \nadequate funding to care for our veterans in fiscal year 2005 and \nbeyond. This is the very least that we can do for those who done so \nmuch for our country. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The Senator yields.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I believe I heard my good colleague and friend from \nWisconsin, a member of the Budget Committee--and I have worked with him \non some issues and amendments--say this is only a tax increase on \nmillionaires, but I read the resolution. It says, raise taxes, but it \ndoes not say raise it on millionaires.\n  Would the Senator not agree with me on a budget resolution the \nFinance Committee can raise revenues, but they cannot be directed how \nto do it?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I think this amendment offered by Senator Daschle \nclearly attempts to fund this out of the most unjustified aspects of \nthe tax cut that was put into place. It would simply prevent certain \ntax cuts that are for very high-income people from going forward, and \nat a minimum level make sure the Veterans Affairs budget is fully \nfunded. I believe this is an appropriate amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I appreciate that answer, but the facts \nare, and my colleague from North Dakota I know will affirm this if \npressed, we do not write tax law in the budget resolution. We may \nassume something. I am assuming we are going to continue law that is \npresently in effect. We have at least scored enough for reconciliation \nto make sure low and middle-income families do not get a big tax \nincrease to the tune of, for a family of 4, about $1,600, and for a \nfamily of 6 about $2,200 next year. That is basically all we are \nassuming for next year. And a little AMT relief. In reconciliation, \nthat is all we are assuming.\n  If last year is any example, we assumed a lot but we only got what we \nreconciled. Reconciliation assumes continuation of present law. In \nother words, no tax increase on families, no tax increase on marriage \npenalty, no tax increase on families that have children. That is what \nwe are assuming.\n  This amendment says, no, we want $5.5 billion more in taxes. That is \njust the first year. That might as well be multiplied by 10.\n  My point is, this assumes a tax increase. The proponents may say they \nassume it is only for millionaires, but that is not what the amendment \nsays. The amendment says to the Finance Committee, go raise some taxes; \nincrease spending in an account that is already growing by 14.3 percent \nin the budget we have before us, mandatory and discretionary.\n  So I just make those points. I am a little disappointed to hear my \ncolleague from Florida say he wants to do an amendment tomorrow that is \ngoing to raise the same function by another $1.5 billion without regard \nto how this amendment comes out. How many times do we have to vote on \nVeterans Affairs? I guess I will wrestle with that one tomorrow.\n  I just tell my colleagues, in looking at what this President has done \nand what this Congress has done since the year 2001, it is a dramatic \nincrease compared with what the previous Congresses did for the last 8 \nor 10 years; a dramatic increase. Yet some people are still saying that \nis not enough.\n  This amendment needs to be defeated for a lot of different reasons. I \nmentioned we have done a lot for veterans, including expanding the \nMontgomery Bill of Rights by 52 percent, by expanding concurrent \nreceipt--last year a multibillion dollar expansion for about 250,000 \nretirees. We added $1.4 billion for VA medical care under this \nresolution. We did not assume the increase in copays that some people \nhave alleged.\n  I urge our colleagues, in the not too distant future--my guess is we \nwill be voting on this amendment within the next 20 minutes--to vote \nno.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, perhaps this would be a good time for us \nto say what a budget resolution does do and doesn't do. The chairman is \nentirely correct that when the budget resolution gives an instruction \nto the Finance Committee to raise a certain amount of revenue, it does \nnot control how they do it. When the Budget Committee gives an \nallocation to an appropriations committee or an appropriations \nfunction, we give them an allocation of funds. We don't tell them how \nto spend it. That is true.\n  What is also true is when we offer amendments on the floor we talk \nabout assumptions. In fairness, the chairman has talked about \nassumptions that he has with respect to his reconciliation instruction. \nHe has said he is assuming that money will be used to extend the 10-\npercent rate, to extend the child care credit, to extend marriage \npenalty relief. But the fact is we do not control how the Finance \nCommittee ultimately decides to use those funds any more than we \ncontrol, with what Senator Daschle has done, reducing the tax cuts for \nthose who earn over a million dollars a year by 10 percent in\n\n[[Page S2419]]\n\norder to fund increased resources for veterans medical care.\n  The chairman's assumptions are made with respect to reconciliation. \nHe has stated them clearly and directly. The Democratic leader has \nstated his assumptions clearly and directly. He has indicated he would \nfund the increased spending for veterans health care by reducing the \ntax cuts for those who earn over $1 million a year by 10 percent. That \nis his assumption. Just as the chairman has indicated, the \nreconciliation instruction that he has provided in this Budget \nresolution he believes ought to be used to expand, for the most part, \nmiddle-class tax cuts.\n  The fact is, neither of them control what the Finance Committee does \nwith their allocation. But it is an assumption and both sides are using \nassumptions, so there is really not a difference there between the two \nsides.\n  With that, the Senator from Florida is seeking time. Is he asking for \n10 minutes?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. If possible.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the distinguished Senator from Florida 10 minutes \noff the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from \nNorth Dakota yielding me 10 minutes. I hope he will not take offense at \nwhat I am going to say.\n  The Senators from Oklahoma and North Dakota have just given us a very \naccurate and descriptive statement of how certain parts of the budget \nprocedures operate. But let me say, I do not believe this issue is \nabout the arcane features of budget policy; rather, they are first \nabout choices.\n  When we voted in 2001 and again in 2003 for the most massive tax cuts \nin American history, targeted primarily at the wealthiest 10 percent of \nAmericans, we were making a choice. One of those choices comes home \ntoday, and that is, will we be able to adequately finance our \nresponsibility to the health care of American veterans as well as the \nhealth care of those American men and women who have been injured as a \nresult of the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq?\n  That comes to the second thing this is about. This is about real \npeople. I take a different job every month, and in November, on \nVeterans Day, I worked at a VA hospital in Miami, FL. While I was \nthere, I met a returning soldier. I will use the name ``John'' in order \nto respect his confidentiality.\n  John is approximately 24 years old. He was born and lived most of his \nlife in Puerto Rico. The reason he is in the Miami VA hospital is \nbecause it has responsibility for certain specialty care that is \nprovided to veterans from most of Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. \nVirgin Islands.\n  John was a member of the Puerto Rican National Guard and was called \nup to duty in Iraq. Prior to his reporting for duty, he married a \nbeautiful young lady who I will call Linda. John was a tanker. He was \nassigned to a tank unit that led the surge from the Kuwait border into \nBaghdad. After the conflict ended, his tank crew was given the \nassignment of taking down some of the buildings Saddam Hussein had \nconstructed in Baghdad, some of them because they were no longer safe \nby virtue of U.S. military action, some because of their symbolic \nimportance. John's assignment was to stand by the side of the tank as \nthe tank was used as a battering ram to take down these buildings. \nUnfortunately, in the course of this he was hit by a falling wall from \none of these structures and is now a paraplegic. He is in the spinal \ncord injury program at the Miami VA hospital.\n  You can imagine the devastation of John and Linda, as their plans for \na life together, functioning as a normal couple, have been devastated \nby this spinal cord injury.\n  John is who we are talking about here today and John very \nspecifically is who we are talking about here today because this \nCongress, in the late 1990s, took on for the Veterans Administration \nthe responsibility for 2 years after discharge from active duty for the \ncare for Americans who had been injured in combat. John is one of those \nveterans.\n  Last year we asked the VA how much it was going to cost to carry out \nthis responsibility. They did some calculations based on, first, what \ntheir experience was in the first Persian war as to what percentage of \ntroops would be injured and become eligible for this VA service, and \nwhat is the current per-capita cost of delivering this service.\n  Do you know what they came up with? The cost would be $350 million. \nThe administration objected to that cost, and after extended \nnegotiation that figure was reduced to $100 million--less than a third \nof what the VA estimated the cost would be. Then do you know what \nhappened. They didn't spend it on health care. They spent it to improve \nthe processing capability of the VA for a variety of veterans \napplications. That may be desirable to do, but that is not what even \nthe miserly $100 million was appropriated to do.\n  John now sits there in his wheelchair facing many years--possibly a \nlifetime--as a paraplegic, and his country told him last year he wasn't \nworthy of having that service he had been promised by the Congress. Now \nwe are about to tell him again he is not worthy of having that service \nfinanced.\n  We need to be realistic. This budget for American veterans and the \nbrave fighting men and women who are returning is totally inadequate. \nIt does not provide even enough to cover the cost for medical \ninflation, including payroll increases for the health care of the \ncurrent group of U.S. veterans.\n  This budget, unfortunately, reflects this administration's priority. \nIf enacted, it will have a devastating effect on the men and women who \nhave served this country with honor and those who are currently serving \nwith honor because this administration has said this is all it is \nwilling to do.\n  Rather than funding these programs as our veterans were promised, the \nPresident seeks to fund the shortfall in his request by increasing the \nout-of-pocket costs to the so-called higher income veterans. That means \nveterans who have earnings starting at approximately $24,000. We would \nraise the prescription drug copayment from $7 to $15. But, more \nimportantly, we would charge a $250 enrollment fee which not only has \nas its goal to generate some additional revenue but, more importantly, \nit will artificially reduce the demand for VA services by veterans who \neither cannot or do not feel it would be advantageous to pay that $250 \nenrollment fee.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. If I could just finish. The Senate Committee \non Veterans Affairs has reviewed this on a repeated basis. The \nPresiding Officer is a member of that committee, as am I. All of the \nmembers of the committee, Republicans and Democrats, rejected the \nproposed increases in copayments or in the $250 annual enrollment fee.\n  All Members agree Congress needs to appropriate sufficient funds to \nobviate the need for these abhorrent out-of-pocket costs to veterans.\n  The committee also recognized the need to protect vital specialty \nservices. These were not included in the President's budget.\n  Can you believe we are not going to fund the long-term care needs of \nthe veteran population which is aging in place and which will have \nincreasing demands for either community-based services or institutional \ncare as they are unable to be fully independent?\n  It also would substantially reduce mental health services to a \npopulation which as it ages encounters increasing and more severe \nmental health problems.\n  It is insulting to laud this budget but continue to bar veterans from \nthe VA health care they have earned by their service.\n  It is unfair to double prescription drug copayments for other \nveterans so some veterans can have their increased costs paid through \nthat means rather than through the appropriations to the Veterans \nAdministration.\n\n  This is nothing short of hypocrisy to deliberately reduce demand for \nhealth care services and count that reduction in demand as if it were \nsavings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would be happy to extend an additional \n5 minutes of time to the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. No. I will yield when I complete my remarks, \nwhich will be soon.\n  The amendment my colleagues and I are debating today would provide \nthe\n\n[[Page S2420]]\n\nVA with the $1.8 million which is necessary to keep the current \nservices in place and would also provide the funds to meet the cost of \nthese wounded returning American service men and women like John so we \nwill be able to honor the commitment we have made to him. It will also \nprovide the funds to continue to meet our long-term care and mental \nhealth needs.\n  These numbers were not derived out of smoke. These numbers were \nderived by an independent budget committee. This is a committee made up \nof representatives of all the major veterans organizations looking at \nwhat is the realistic cost of providing appropriate service. This \nconsortium of veterans organizations has set the bar as well as to how \nmuch VA needs will be to treat their patients.\n  This administration has made the war in Iraq and Afghanistan a \npriority, appropriately so. But at the same time, this administration \ndoes not want to provide the resources to meet the health care needs of \nreturning combatants. This war will create a new generation of \nveterans, and this budget fails to take that into account.\n  This budget has the potential of creating a conflict between \ngenerations of veterans. It is asking the current veterans assume a \nfurther dilution in their medical services so the newly returning \ninjured combatants will be able to receive the care for which they have \nbeen promised.\n  It is up to us in the Congress to see service members and veterans \nalike receive the benefits they have earned. We can do no less than to \nmeet our duty to their patriotic service.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I would be glad to yield to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I wanted to clarify. I heard my \ncolleague say increase in copays. You are aware, I am sure, under the \nresolution we are not assuming any increase in copay for categories 7 \nor 8, and we are also not assuming the $250 deductible.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Does that mean the budget is even more out of \nbalance in terms of providing services than the one the President \nsubmitted which would have had those increases in out-of-pocket costs?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thought I heard my colleague say you were opposed to \nthese increase in copays. I was trying to make sure you are aware we \ndid not assume an increase. We did not have that in our budget. I \nwanted to make sure you knew that. If you didn't, I will read it to \nyou. It says the committee resolution does not assume the President's \nproposal to establish a new $250 enrollment fee for priority 7 or 8 \nveterans or to increase the insurance for prescription drug copayment \nfor priority 7 and 8 veterans from $7 to $15. That is not in our \nresolution. I wanted to make sure you knew that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Does the resolution, therefore, contain the \nfunds from appropriate sources to offset that which would have been \nraised had the President's recommendation of the prescription drug \ncopayment increased and the enrollment fee been enacted?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I want to remind our colleague to go \nthrough the Chair. I warned other people. I think I need to do that.\n  Our resolution, to answer my colleague's question, has a $1.4 billion \nincrease in VA care. It assumes an increase in VA--and it is \nmandatory--from $61 billion to $70 billion--a 14.3 percent increase, so \nmy colleague will know.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. My question was not what the totality is, but \nsince the President assumed a substantial additional revenue source for \nthe VA through these enrollment fees and increased copayments, how does \nthe budget resolution propose to fund those items or to provide the \nreplacement revenue that would come from those two items?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Florida has \nexpired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I have a couple comments.\n  We did not have the assumptions; they were not revenue raisers, as I \nunderstand from the administration's perspective. What they were trying \nto do is get high-income nonservice-connected disabled veterans to not \nclog the system or at least have them pay a little more. If they were \nnot injured by military service--maybe they were playing basketball or \nwhatever and they had high incomes, shouldn't they pay a greater \npercentage of the prescription drug? That was the assumption. It is \nmore to change behavior than to raise money. We did not make that \nassumption in our resolution.\n  I yield the Senator from Texas as much time as he desires. I know \nthere is a reception tonight. If the Senator could keep his remarks to \n10 or 15 minutes.\n  For the information of our colleagues, I suspect we will have a vote \nprobably about 5:45, hopefully not much later than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I will say a few words about this budget \nresolution because it is an important document. As in any budget, we \nidentified what our Nation's priorities are, and we have done the tough \njob that all budget writers have to do, whether it is the Senate, a \nsmall business, or a family, in trying to figure out how to live within \nour means, how do we make sure we are good stewards of the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from \nOklahoma and the ranking member, the Senator from South Dakota, for \nconducting a very important debate about our Nation's priorities and \nhow they are reflected in this budget and the civility with which that \ndebate has taken place in the Budget Committee and in the Senate.\n  There is no higher priority in the Federal Government than our \nnational security. Indeed, this budget does fund an increase in \nnational security; it, likewise, funds an increase in homeland security \nfunding--two items which would strike me as no-brainers in a post-\nSeptember 11 world. Particularly when it comes to military spending \nwith our troops in the field and with the Nation being at war, we have \nto keep our commitments to those troops in the field that we will give \nthem the resources they need in order to get the job done.\n  As to the rest of the nondefense, nonhomeland security spending, this \ndiscretionary part of the budget is essentially flat. That represents \nthe considered judgment of a lot of people who have this Nation's best \ninterests at heart: How do we deal with this budget deficit and how do \nwe meet this Nation's commitments without killing the burgeoning growth \nof the recovery of the economy while at the same time recognizing we \nare a nation at war, a nation that needs to harden its homeland \nsecurity.\n\n  However, what we all need to realize when we hear amendments being \nproposed from the Senate to this budget, we are talking about spending \nmore of the taxpayers' money, plain and simple. The American people are \nwise enough to understand when people talk about tax increases on the \nwealthy, if they begin to look at the numbers, ultimately what we are \ntalking about are tax increases on the middle class and literally on \nall Americans.\n  I referred back to some figures and discovered that last year our \nDemocratic colleagues offered budget amendments in the range of $85 \nbillion additional spending to the budget over 1 year and it would have \ncalculated $1.2 trillion over 10 years.\n  I don't know how anyone can stand in front of this group or anyone \nelse and say those geometric leaps in spending could be accomplished \nwithout raising taxes across the board. We cannot do both. We cannot \nhave the kind of huge increases in spending that our colleagues across \nthe aisle would want to have without raising taxes across the board.\n  I know it is easier to make the class warfare argument, tax \nmillionaires, but when we look at the people who are paying taxes, it \nincludes small businesses that pay not as corporations but pay as an \nindividual taxpayer would if they were a sole proprietor or a \npartnership or small subchapter S corporation. They essentially pay \nincome taxes as if they were individuals.\n  What our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are proposing when \nthey talk about raising taxes against the wealthy, they are talking \nabout raising taxes against the very engine that grows jobs in our \neconomy. We have come off of a rough time in our history, the last 2\\1/\n2\\ years since September 11. Of course, we were starting into a \nrecession when President Bush and Vice\n\n[[Page S2421]]\n\nPresident Cheney took office. We suffered a body blow to our Nation's \neconomy and to our consciousness on September 11. That had a \ndevastating impact on our economy. Of course we saw the stock market \nplummet as investors lost confidence in corporate America because of \nsome scandals which shook that confidence to its very core.\n  So we have had what some have called, many have called, the perfect \nstorm. It is as a result of the tax relief and growth package we passed \nlast year in this body, something our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle argued mightily against, but it is as a result of allowing \nthe people who earn the money to keep it, to keep more of it, and spend \nit as they see fit, to save it, and to invest it in their small \nbusinesses that we have seen the job growth.\n  We have seen the roaring back of the economy in a way we have not \nseen in the last 20 years. It comes to productivity; it comes to growth \nin the gross domestic production.\n  I fear if we were to accept this formula offered by our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle to tax more and to spend more, it would \nsimply squelch the nascent recovery we are seeing in this economy.\n  There is a lot of discussion about jobs. Obviously that is a core \ngoal we all share. We do not grow jobs by killing the profits, by \ntaxing the engine of job creation--which our colleagues across the \naisle would do by their proposals, including this one. The only way we \nget more in this economy is by letting people who earn the money keep \nmore of it and invest it, save it, and create more jobs. That is simply \nthe formula that we on this side of the aisle, as well as our \nPresident, have said is the philosophy we should approach.\n  Let the people who earn the money keep more of it. We have seen as a \nresult explosive growth in our economy. We know over time we will \nreduce unemployment rates to the point that literally anybody and \neverybody who wants to work can find a job. Indeed, that is our goal.\n  While we have to make tough choices in writing a budget, just as \nanyone else does, what our colleagues by this amendment seek to do is \nto add to an already substantial increase when it comes to veterans \nbenefits and services. I can think of no more sympathetic or deserving \ncause than our veterans.\n  My dad was a veteran of World War II. He flew B-17s in the Army Air \nCorps, was shot down after a bombing mission over Mannheim, Germany, \nwas captured and served for a time in a German prisoner-of-war camp \nbefore General Patton and his Army came along and liberated him and his \ncolleagues. As so many in this generation, he came back to this \ncountry, married my mom, and helped build this Nation into what is \ntoday the envy of the entire world. We owe a debt to all of our \nveterans to see that we address their needs, whether it is health care \nor other veterans benefits.\n  But at a time when this budget resolution proposes giving less money \nthan the Commander in Chief has asked for in terms of current military \noperations, I am sure all of our veterans would understand why we say a \n14.5-percent increase over last year is a reasonable increase in \nveterans benefits and services, and why they would say--at a time when \nwe are looking at trying to balance the budget under tough times and \nactually giving the Commander in Chief, our Department of Defense, less \nthan what has been requested because of our attempt to try to balance \nthe budget, to meet our priorities to the soldiers and airmen and \nsailors and marines in the field and on the waters--that is an \nappropriate increase at this time.\n  Particularly for those veterans coming back from their military duty, \nthey would want to make sure there will be, once they leave active duty \nmilitary service, jobs for them to hold to provide for their families.\n  I think this is a good budget resolution. I agree with the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma the best thing we could do to keep faith with both our \ntroops in the field and our veterans is to make sure we are \nresponsible, that we meet our priorities, that we do not overtax, that \nwe do not overspend, and that we continue to grow this economy so \nanyone and everyone who wants to work can find a good job.\n  With that, I yield the floor back to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I think we are about to wrap up the \ndebate on this amendment. I know the Senator from Arkansas wants to be \nrecognized for a couple minutes. Once she finishes, I will have the \nfinal comments on the amendment and we will prepare to have a vote.\n  I yield the floor to accommodate the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the leader yield to her?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes. Are we under a time agreement now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield time off the resolution, 3 \nminutes, to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I thank my colleague, the minority \nleader.\n  I stand today to speak in strong support of Senator Daschle's \namendment to the budget resolution that would ensure the U.S. Veterans \nAdministration has the funding it needs to provide the best services \npossible to our Nation's veterans.\n  My father passed away about a year and a half ago. He was an \ninfantryman in the Korean war. Both of my grandfathers served in World \nWar II.\n  I believe probably one of the most important values those men \ninstilled in me when I was growing up was the need to respect and honor \nour Nation's veterans, those who had put their lives on the line to \nensure our freedoms and this incredible Nation we are a part of could \nbe sustained.\n  I have always treasured that lesson, and my father's example has \nguided me throughout my career in public service, as well as the \nexamples of those I have met along the road of the very strong and \ndetermined and willing Arkansans who have also served this country.\n\n  That lesson has always been important, but it is particularly \npoignant today. With the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq, a new \ngeneration of young people has stepped forward to defend our Nation and \nthe world against threats to our security, peace, and stability. Many \nhave given their lives in this cause. A great many more, who rarely get \nmentioned, have been wounded in action, and they will need our support \nin the years to come.\n  We often hear people talk about the American military's superiority \nin weapons and technology, which is the most advanced and powerful in \nthe history of the world. I know every Member in this body is proud of \nthat. But there is also no getting around the fact our most important \nmilitary strength resides in our people, in the men and women who \nserve, and in the officers who lead them. No weapon and no technology \nis as valuable to our military as our military personnel.\n  One of my top priorities has been to ensure our military personnel \ngets the support they need, whether it is equity in pay, health care, \nhousing, or child care.\n  With an all-volunteer military, it follows you are going to have more \ncareer soldiers, and more of those soldiers are going to be married and \nhave families. We should recognize this and provide for their needs. \nParticularly with the demands placed on our soldiers in the war on \nterror and in Iraq, we need to find new ways to better serve them and \ntheir families in recognition of their service and their sacrifice to \nthis country. Their sacrifice today reminds of us of the sacrifices of \nearlier generations. It reminds us of the service and sacrifice of \nthose who are here today. It should remind us we owe our veterans a \nmuch greater debt than just gratitude and respect. We also have an \nobligation to support the health and well-being and dignity of our \nveterans and their families when they need health care or when death, \ndisability, and economic hardship leave them in distress.\n  The cornerstone of this commitment is our Veterans Administration, \nwith its numerous support programs for health care, homelessness, and \nveterans with special needs. But as many of you know all too well, our \nveterans programs have not always lived up to their promise. While \nthings have improved in many respects, we still have some distance to \ntravel to make our\n\n[[Page S2422]]\n\nveterans programs the most effective they can be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield the Senator 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. One of my priorities as a Senator has been to seek ways \nwe can make our Government work better. I believe one important place \nto begin is with our programs for our veterans. It is particularly true \nas our population ages, the Veterans Administration must adapt to new \ndemands. Over 45 percent of American veterans are now over the age of \n60.\n  In addition, the largest group of veterans, the Vietnam-era veterans, \nare nearing retirement. We are going to need innovative approaches to \nmeet the needs of these veterans. A top priority should be to ensure \nour veterans benefits are more fair and equitable. The amendment \nSenator Daschle and I, as a cosponsor, offer today would increase \nfunding for veterans health care by $2.7 billion. We would accomplish \nthis by reducing tax cuts for people making over $1 million per year, \nso this measure would not add to the Nation's budget deficit, the \nbudget deficit our children will be paying.\n\n  One measure of a nation's greatness is how well it cares for those \nwho have fought and sacrificed to protect its citizens, its values, its \nfreedoms, and its interests.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment to \nensure our veterans have health care they so richly deserve, and that \nwe do so without putting an enormous burden on our children.\n  I would like to also comment on some of the talks we have had, both \nin the Finance Committee and here, about where those dollars are \nactually going to come from and who actually gets harmed, and remind \nour colleagues today these dollars do not come out of the small \nbusiness arena. We have had information from the IRS which indicates \nthat. We have charts which help us show that.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at what is most important: The \npriorities and the choices we have to make today, and the consequences \nwe will see from those choices we make. Let us support our veterans.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I thank very much the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas for her strong statement.\n  Does the Senator from Iowa seek recognition to speak on this \namendment, as well?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I do want to speak.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield the floor to accommodate the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I yield the Senator from Iowa such time \nas he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, what we have to think about when \npeople suggest raising taxes is, I have hardly ever had anybody ever \ntell me they want to raise taxes. How high do taxes have to be to be \nhigh enough to satisfy the people asking to raise the taxes?\n  Since we hear that more from the other side of the aisle than we do \nfrom this side of the aisle, I cannot help but ask anybody on that side \nof the aisle who is going to be suggesting during this debate on the \nbudget to raise taxes, how high do they have to be to satisfy you?\n  We have had marginal tax rates of 93 percent in the last 50 years. \nWas that high enough? We had 70 percent in the last 20 years. Is that \nhigh enough? We have had them as low as 28 percent. People felt an \nawful lot of economic good happened, particularly promoting \nentrepreneurship, when they were lower.\n  I think the most important thing for my colleagues to think about \nduring this debate is on the issue of process. Quite frankly, we are \nbeing given some direction through this amendment to raise taxes. We \nare being told the intent is to raise them on the very wealthy, but \nthat is not how the budget resolution works. The budget resolution just \nsays to the Budget Committee, raise X number of dollars based upon what \nthat budget says. We decide where that is going to be raised.\n  Anybody who believes that by voting for this amendment, they are \nputting the burden on just the wealthy, for instance, are sadly \nmistaken. What it takes to get a bill out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee is a bipartisan compromise, and just taxing one class of \npeople is kind of a nonstarter for our committee, if you believe in \nbipartisanship.\n  In addition, if the issue of raising taxes just on millionaires is an \nissue, you need to remember you cannot just tax the wealthy. You \nconfiscate all the income of people over $1 million, and you are going \nto run the Government for a few days. If you see that as a solution to \nour budget problems, you don't study the statistics, you don't study \nthe impact taxation can have on the economy.\n  Also, if it is the millionaires, just think in terms of the top 1 \npercent, earning about 27 percent of the income, paying 33 percent of \nall of the income tax coming into the Federal treasury. Once again, how \nmuch is enough for the top 1 percent to pay? They make 27 percent of \nall the income. They pay 33 percent of the taxes. Should they pay 50 \npercent? Pretty soon it gets to the point where maybe they ought to pay \n100 percent of it all. But that is a nonstarter. There is not enough \nincome there to take care of our problems.\n  What does this high tax philosophy lead us to? It eventually leads us \nto taxing the common ordinary American to a greater extent than is good \nfor the country, good for economic freedom, and obviously a \ndiscouragement to entrepreneurship.\n  I believe I saw on the chart, the one the Senator from Arkansas had, \ndoes taxing higher tax rates or lowering marginal tax rates really help \nsmall business? That is probably based on the argument that every small \nbusiness does not pay the highest marginal tax rate. We are not dealing \njust with what is the highest marginal tax rate; we are dealing with \nfairness between self-employed, sole proprietors, and their highest \nrate of taxation and the highest rate of taxation of corporations. So \nanybody who is suggesting we ought to raise the marginal tax rate above \nwhere it is now at 35 percent is being unfair to sole proprietors, \nself-employed people, compared to corporations.\n  We should not have a penalty against small business in America. \nRegardless of the income of that small business, there should not be a \npenalty. When you have a 38.6-percent marginal tax rate, that is a 13-\npercent penalty on small business. It is unfair to sole proprietors. \nThere is no reason individuals paying taxes in America ought to have to \npay more than corporations.\n  I am not arguing raising the corporation tax because we know what \nthat does to our international competitiveness. That hurts our \ninternational competitiveness because we have high cost of capital. But \nI am arguing for fairness between corporations and sole proprietors, \nself-employed people, people who scrounge to get money to invest. They \ndon't have stockholders. They can't go to the bond market like \ncorporations can. They have to raise their capital. They live \nrelatively moderately and maybe even low income throughout their \nlivelihood to reinvest their earned income, to expand their business, \nto create jobs. Why do we want to penalize them? That is basically what \nthis business of taxing the wealthy is all about.\n  There isn't enough wealthy in this country to do everything they want \nto do on the other side. Eventually it filters down to hurting the \nmiddle class.\n  We have to protect the middle class. What we are doing is talking \nabout lower rates of taxation, protecting working men and women from \nhaving their resources confiscated by government.\n  I urge we defeat the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I have great respect for the Senator \nfrom Iowa. He does a terrific job as our chair of the Finance \nCommittee. I would ask him to read the amendment. He gave a great \nspeech on fairness among taxpayers. I am concerned about fairness in \nthis budget between millionaires and veterans. That is the fairness I \nam looking for.\n\n[[Page S2423]]\n\n  In this budget, there is a $27 billion tax cut for millionaires \nalone. What I am asking is the $27 billion we have for veterans for \ntheir health care, which is also in this budget, be increased by a mere \n$2.7 billion. How do I do it? Not by raising taxes. We are not talking \nabout raising taxes. Each millionaire in this budget will get a \n$140,000 tax cut this year. We are simply suggesting maybe we could \nreduce that $140,000 to $112,000 so veterans are not going to have to \nwait in line up to 6 months to get health care today, so veterans who \nare concerned about whether their VA facility is going to close do not \nhave to be concerned about it, so veterans who are being told today \nthey are going to have to pay $250 to walk in the front door will be \ntold, you don't have to worry about that anymore because now the \nmillionaires only get $112,000 and you are going to be able to walk in \nthe door without having to pay that fee. That is the fairness I am \ntalking about. We don't want to raise taxes, but we certainly want to \nsee some fairness when it comes to veterans.\n  I have seen countless bumper stickers in South Dakota, across the \ncountry that say support our troops. I think we ought to add three \nwords: ``and our veterans.'' If we really are serious about supporting \nour veterans and our troops, we ought to be willing to say to our \nveterans: You know the billion dollars you are now being asked to pay \nfor your health care? We are actually going to find a way so you are \nnot going to be asked to pay anymore, that billion dollars can be \nreduced somewhat.\n  I actually have had veterans in the last couple weeks ask me about \nhaving to pay double for prescription drugs, which is also in this \nbudget. We increased the fee for each prescription drug from $7 to $15, \neach office visit to $20. We are telling category 7s and 8s they are \nnow going to have to pay $250 to walk in the door. That accumulated \namount of money is a billion dollars paid for by veterans after they \nhave fought and defended their country.\n  Is it fair to simply say: We are going to give the millionaires of \nthis country a $112,000 tax cut so we have an opportunity here to \nprovide some fairness to veterans in a budget as the war in Iraq and \nthe war on terrorism go on?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, my colleague and good friend from South \nDakota said: This budget increases copays on veterans on drugs from \n$7.50 to $15. That is not correct. Read the resolution. The resolution \nhas a paragraph that we did not assume either the $250 deductible or \nthe increase in copays for category 7 or 8 veterans. It is not in the \nbudget. I have only said that about three times. Maybe my good friend \nmissed one of my great speeches.\n  Look what we have done. I venture to say that whatever we do is never \nenough. Mr. President, I say to Senator Byrd, many times he talked to \nme about mandatories. Mandatory spending on veterans and discretionary \nare growing under this budget from $61 billion to $71.4 billion. That \nis a 14.5-percent increase. Not too many categories in this budget will \nbe growing 14.5 percent.\n  I want people to know we are doing a lot. We have assumed a $1.4 \nbillion increase in VA health care. So we have a lot already in this \nassumption that we are already expanding.\n  I looked at the amendment of my colleague from South Dakota, and \nwhere is the increase for outlays for veterans? It is not in this \namendment. It assumes maybe there is a trust fund, and if the \nappropriations bills come in and if they spend a certain amount, then \nmaybe it will be increased and then we will increase the caps. It has a \nlot of assumptions. The only thing for sure is that it increases taxes.\n  It is very hypothetical, at the most, to say we think that is only \ngoing to be on millionaires for a certain amount. That is not what the \namendment says. The amendment says increase taxes next year by $5.4 \nbillion over the budget resolution.\n  I also tell my colleagues the taxes that we are assuming for next \nyear will be continued to make sure taxpayers do not have a tax \nincrease are really the marriage penalty relief of $5.4 billion, and \nthe 10-percent tax bracket. That is $4.3 billion for 2005, and the \nchild tax credit is $2.6 billion. That is really what we are assuming.\n  This idea we are going to rewrite the Tax Code is just not going to \nhappen--I think my colleagues know that--not in this election year, not \nin this environment.\n  What we are assuming are some profamily tax credits. It just so \nhappens veterans are also taxpayers. If we do not do some of these \nthings, a lot of veterans are going to have an increase in their taxes, \nif they have kids, to the tune of maybe $1,200, $1,600, $2,200, \ndepending on how many kids they have. The marriage penalty alone, if \nthey have taxable income of $58,000, a husband and wife, is $900.\n  The only fact we are sure about in this amendment is we are going to \nincrease taxes and maybe veterans might get some of it if it goes \nthrough this process of a reserve fund and then the reserve fund is \nreleased and then, depending on appropriations--that is an interesting \nway to say we are trying to help veterans.\n  This budget tries to help veterans. It tries to be responsible, to \ngive a significant increase, a $1.4 billion increase for veterans when \nwe have very little increases period in nondefense, nonhomeland.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote no on the amendment. Madam President, I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  All time is yielded back.

Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \nthat will be the last rollcall vote tonight. Senator Conrad and I have \nindicated we are willing to stay to do additional business tonight, \nmaybe well into the night. That remains to be seen, depending on the \namendments that will be offered and/or discussed. If there are \nrollcalls on the amendments to be offered tonight, we will hold those \nover for tomorrow at a mutually agreeable time with our leaders.\n  For the information of our colleagues, I am not sure how late we will \nwork tonight. We will see. I think we are making progress on the \nresolution\n\n[[Page S2424]]\n\nand on the amendments. I know Senators Lindsey Graham and Jim Bunning \nhave an amendment. I don't believe it is quite ready. I believe Senator \nMurray has an amendment. I also believe Senator Bennett wants to speak \non a report.\n  We will have additional business probably for some time tonight, for \nthe information of our colleagues. Some of our colleagues have said \nthey would like to speak tonight. That is fine with this Senator. We \nwould like to get as much work done on this resolution as possible so \nwe are not crammed into the last day and a half with a lot of votes.\n  I do thank our colleagues. We are off to a good start in working \nthrough this resolution. I thank our colleagues for their cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nKentucky if he wants to lay an amendment down. Does the Senator from \nKentucky wish to speak? I have anticipated speaking on behalf of the \nJoint Economic Committee. The ranking member of the Joint Economic \nCommittee, Senator Reed, is also prepared to speak. We are here under \nthe Budget Act to make a presentation to the Senate in the middle of \nthe budget discussion. I don't know if that has ever been done, but we \nare going to do it. It is for that purpose I sought recognition, but I \ndon't want to hold up the Senator from Kentucky if he has an amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Will the Senator from Utah yield?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to the Senator yielding to the \nSenator from Kentucky. It is not appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if the Senator from Kentucky has a \nquestion, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BUNNING. The Senator from Kentucky was going to make a general \nstatement on the budget resolution. If the Senator from Utah would like \nto yield, that is up to him. But I rose to seek recognition to make my \ngeneral statement on the budget resolution.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky if he would tell me how long he intends to talk.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah has no right to yield \nto the Senator from Kentucky except for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators may not yield control of the floor to \nother Senators.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, they can yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators may yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, under the circumstances, then, having \nmade arrangements with Senator Reed for this time, I will proceed and \nsuggest to the Senator from Kentucky he respond when we finish.\n  The debate has been an interesting one since the beginning of the \nbudget period. There has been a great deal said about the economy and a \ngreat deal said about the state of the economy. Much that has been \nsaid, in my opinion, has more to do with the fact this is an election \nyear than it does with the situation facing the economy.\n  In response to the requirement of the act creating the congressional \nbudget process that says the Joint Economic Committee is to make a \nreport to the Senate during the Budget Committee deliberations, I have \nasked for and received this time for myself and Senator Reed to address \nthe Senate.\n  I do not wish to address the specifics of the budget resolution \nbecause I think it is more important we lay down the background of the \neconomy and what is really happening in the economy. I will do my best \nto keep it out of the realm of politics, keep it out of the realm of \nthe rhetoric of this election, and stay as close as I can to statistics \nand facts so we can understand exactly what is happening in the economy \nand where the economy is headed. The basis and sources I have used in \nthis situation have in every case been from outside groups. This is not \nthe Republican Policy Committee or any other partisan group that has \ncome up with these statistics. I will share them with the Senate \ntonight in the hope it will help the Senate and anyone who is watching \nunderstand exactly where the economy is.\n  We begin, if we can, by reviewing exactly what happened with respect \nto the recession and the recovery. There has been a lot of rhetoric \nabout this. I have heard on the Senate floor this is the worst \nrecession in 50 years, the worst economy we have ever had.\n  On this chart, we go back to the year 2000 and through the year 2003. \nThe first quarter of 2004 is not in yet, so this goes back to the \nbeginning of the softening of the economy through the recession and the \nrecovery.\n  These bars are by quarters. The first quarter of 2000 was a very weak \nquarter. This is measuring the growth of the economy in terms of the \ngross domestic product, the GDP. These data come from the government \nagency that tracks economic performance. These data are always \navailable only after the fact. It is almost impossible to be sure of \nthe data at the time it is happening, but after the fact the Bureau of \nEconomic Analysis goes back and reconstructs what happens and makes \nwhatever changes have to be made in order to make sure the data are \ncorrect. This is their current reading of what has happened in the last \n4 years.\n\n  In 2000, in the first quarter, very weak quarter, only 1 percent \ngrowth; second quarter, very high. Some will say that is because of \nweather. Very often, there is bad weather in the first quarter which \ncauses sales to go down. They are delayed. They show up in the second \nquarter. But in the third quarter, we spilt into negative territory; \nthat is, instead of expanding, the gross domestic product contracted \none-half of 1 percent.\n  The definition, according to many observers, of a recession is two \nsuccessive quarters of contraction, and we did not have that. We came \nup with a relatively weak fourth quarter in 2000.\n  I will point out in that period of time there were those who were \nsuggesting the economy was in fact weakening. They were attacked as \nhaving made partisan political statements trying to talk the economy \ndown for political purposes. We now know in fact they were correct, the \neconomy was in fact weakening. In the first quarter of 2001, once \nagain, the economy contracted rather than expanded. Then in the second \nquarter, it contracted even more.\n  The common definition of a recession was therefore met with two \nsuccessive quarters of contraction, and then you have a third quarter \nwhere the economy contracted 1.3 percent. This, of course, was the \nquarter in which September 11 occurred.\n\n  We have the three successive quarters of contraction. There are some \nwho say this quarter, the fourth quarter of 2000, will be revised to \nshow contraction rather than expansion as the data are further \nreviewed. As of now, these are the data the Bureau of Economic Analysis \nhas given us.\n  The fourth quarter of 2001 was positive, up 2 percent. Not robust \ngrowth, but at least positive. By definition, that is the beginning of \nthe recovery. The first quarter of 2002 was strong and then we went \nback to anemic growth and kept that pretty much through 2002.\n  In 2003, the growth starts to pick up and becomes very robust. The \nentire year showed growth of 4.3 percent which, by historic terms, is \nhigher than the average growth of all of the years of the 1990s. If we \ncan sustain 4.3 percent growth, we can be very happy indeed. We can see \nthe economy is starting to recover, the recovery is getting traction \nand it is getting hold in 2003.\n  Let's go back over the same time period and look at some of the \nspending patterns that came through the same situation. In green, the \nbars are the same quarters on the previous chart and they show consumer \nspending. A very unusual thing happened during this period of recession \nand recovery. Consumer spending remained positive in every single \nquarter. It got a little weak in the first quarter of 2001, but it \nremained positive, above the line, in every single quarter. That has \nnever happened before. In recessions consumer spending goes negative, \nbut in this one the consumers had enough confidence they stayed \npositive all the way through. That is one of the things that kept this \nrecession from being deeper and more long lasting than it might \notherwise have been.\n\n[[Page S2425]]\n\n  The blue bars, however, show a very different story and give us the \nreasons why this recession occurred. The blue bars are business \ninvestment. Business investment in the first and second quarters of \n2000 was very strong. A weak third quarter followed, and a very weak \nfourth quarter, and into negative territory we fell in the first \nquarter of 2001, staying there for one, two, three, four, five, six, \nseven, eight, nine successive quarters, with business investment down. \nIt is not until we get to the second quarter of 2003 that business \ninvestment becomes positive again and very strong.\n  This was an investment recession. It was not a consumer recession. It \nwas an investment recession, as businesses felt they were overextended \nand cut back on their investment. After nine quarters--a long period of \ntime--business investment finally began to be robust again. This again \nis from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. When this starts to happen, we \nassume we will start to get jobs because business investment has the \nbiggest impact on jobs, not consumer spending.\n  From the Department of Labor we have statistics on jobless claims. \nThis shaded period on the chart is the period of the recession--that \nis, the three quarters when there was negative gross domestic \nproduction growth. The jobless claims heading into the recessionary \nperiod are going up. They reach their peak during the recessionary \nperiod. Then when the recession ends and the recovery takes place, the \njobless claims start coming down somewhat, until you get that strong \nbusiness investment that we saw on the previous chart. Then the jobless \nclaims start coming down much more dramatically, indicating the jobs \nare on their way back.\n\n  We have heard a lot about manufacturing. The Institute for Supply \nManagement provides a composite index on manufacturing activity. In \n1999, manufacturing was up. And manufacturing follows the same pattern. \nIt starts down in the second half of 2000 and comes down during the \nrecession and stays down for longer than the recession itself. It is \ndown in negative territory below this line, through all of 2001, gets \nup a little bit in 2002 but comes back down and again down, finally.\n  When business investment starts up in 2003, the manufacturing \nactivity comes up strongly. So it goes down, stays down, but when the \nbusiness investment comes back, the manufacturing activity comes back \nvery strongly.\n  What about jobs, then? Where are the jobs? If this activity is coming \nback, why aren't we seeing the jobs? If there is investment activity, \nwhy aren't we seeing the jobs? What we are seeing is something we have \nnot seen before, and that is the surveys done by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics as to jobs--and there are two of them, one known as the \nestablishment survey or payroll survey and one known as the household \nsurvey--have diverged in ways they have never diverged before in \nhistory.\n  Before, they pretty well track each other. The difference is the \npayroll survey or establishment survey gets its sample entirely from \nfirms and other employers, whereas the household survey does its sample \nby checking households to see who has jobs and who does not. The \nhousehold survey picks up agricultural jobs. The household survey picks \nup self-employed and, to the degree they impact the statistics, the \nhousehold survey would pick up illegal aliens who for one reason or \nanother do not show up on the payroll survey.\n  Everyone says the payroll survey is the more reliable. I will \nstipulate that everyone says that, but I ask this same ``everyone,'' if \nthat is the case, how can you explain the sudden discrepancy between \nthe two, a discrepancy that has come in this recession and this \nrecovery? The discrepancy is not minor. If you take the entire period \nwe are talking about, the payroll survey shows a loss of 2.3 million \njobs while the household survey shows a gain of 614,000. That is a \ndiscrepancy of three million jobs.\n  I don't have the answer as to what is causing that discrepancy. We \nhave tried to do studies in the JEC staff to get the answer. I have \nasked the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics if she will do \nsome studies to find the answer. I have discussed this with Chairman \nGreenspan, and he says the Federal Reserve people are concerned about \nthis and are trying to find the answer.\n\n  If we take the period since November of 2001--this is the recovery \nperiod, as opposed to the entire period that included the recession--in \nthis recovery period, even while we are in recovery, the payroll survey \nsays we have lost 718,000 jobs; the household survey says during the \nrecovery we have added 1.895 million jobs. That is a very wide margin.\n  If we look at just the past six months, the period of the strongest \nrecovery, the period when we are getting the strongest activity, the \npayroll survey says yes, we have finally started to add jobs. In the \nlast 6 months, the payroll survey says 364,000 new jobs, while the \nhousehold survey says 981,000. I am not saying the household survey is \nright and the payroll survey is wrong, I want to make clear. I am \nsaying something is happening in the economy that has not happened \nbefore for which we do not have an accurate gauge. What is important is \nthat our statistics be accurate so when we throw them around in a \npolitical debate, we know we are telling the truth.\n  It is very clear to me the payroll survey needs to be adjusted \nupward. How far upward, I do not know. It is probable the household \nsurvey needs to be adjusted downward. How far downward, I do not know.\n  Commissioner Utgoff, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has \nsaid the real number is probably somewhere in between the number shown \nby both surveys. But she does not know. This is one of the things we \nare pursuing in the Joint Economic Committee, to do what we can to get \naccurate data so we can make accurate analysis of what is happening in \nthe economy.\n  All right. Let's look at the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate \nis figured on the basis of the household survey.\n  As shown on this chart, the shaded areas show the recession. In this \ncase I have gone beyond the time period of the first chart. In this \ncase we go back to the recession that occurred during the time Ronald \nReagan was President, and you will see two shaded areas because Ronald \nReagan suffered the double dip; that is, we went into a recession, had \ntwo quarters of negative growth or of contraction of the economy, came \nout, and went back in for an even longer period of time.\n  This is the worst recession in memory. Unemployment hit a high of \n10.8 percent at that time. When it spiked up and came back down, there \nwere a lot of people, with unemployment at that level, who said: Well, \nwe are in good shape now. The jobs are coming back. Notice that level \nwas about 7 percent unemployment, but it came down further as the \nprosperity of the late Reagan years took hold, and it was down until \nthe next recession hit. As is always the case--it was the case, as \nshown on this chart here and here--it happened here. As soon as the \nrecession hit, the unemployment went up and spiked up even during the \nrecovery. This is the period of time when we talked about the jobless \nrecovery. I had just come to the Senate, and I remember everybody \nsaying: Well, if we are in recovery, where are the jobs? Unemployment \nspiked several quarters after the recession was over at 7.8 percent--\nnot nearly as bad as the 10.8 percent of the previous peak, but still \npretty bad.\n  All right. Then it started coming down slowly. We did not get down to \nthe prerecession level for 4 years. It took 4 years for the economy to \ngenerate enough jobs to bring us down to the prerecession level of \nunemployment, which was just under 6 percent.\n  Incidentally, that is the level where we are right now, because in \nthis recession we saw exactly the same reaction. The unemployment rate \ncame up dramatically during the recession, just as it did here several \nquarters after the recovery started. The unemployment rate was still \ngoing up. It peaked a little later than this one did, but a lot lower \nthan this one did. The unemployment rate peaked at 6.3 percent and then \nstarted coming down, and it is now down to a level which in previous \nrecessions would be considered very good.\n  In the debate on the floor about the extension of unemployment \ninsurance, we noted that extended benefits were allowed to run out at a \nlevel of unemployment that was well below the corresponding level at \nwhich such benefits\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\nexpired during the Clinton administration.\n  I share all of this information to make this point: This recession is \ndifferent. It is not different because it happened on George W. Bush's \nwatch or because it happened in a Republican-controlled Congress. As \nPaul Samuelson has pointed out, if Presidents knew how to create jobs, \nevery President would have a 3.5 percent unemployment number going into \nhis reelection. If Congress could control jobs, every Congress would \nsee to it in every October, as we were running for reelection, the \nunemployment rate would be at 3.2 percent. But unemployment is a \nreflection of what is happening in the economy. What this information \nshows us is what is happening in technology with this recession and \nthis recovery is different from that which has happened in previous \nrecessions.\n\n  Let me give you my personal view of what is happening here. I believe \nthe recession we have just gone through and the recovery we are now in \nrepresent the first recession and recovery of the information age, as \nopposed to the previous recessions and recoveries, which were the last \nrecessions and recoveries of the industrial age.\n  When I took economics, I was told recessions basically were a series \nof inventory buildups, and recoveries were inventory selloffs.\n  For example, you got excited about how well things were going in the \nautomobile industry, and you built more cars. Suddenly, the vice \npresident of marketing looks out on the back lot and says: Good \nheavens, there are 40 acres covered with Chryslers we haven't been able \nto sell. Send everybody home. Lay them all off until we sell off all \nthe back acres full of cars. And after some time, suddenly he looks out \nthe back window and says: There aren't any cars. Quick, get everybody \non the phone and tell them to come back to work so we can build up \nagain. That is the classic, vastly oversimplified definition of an \nindustrial age recession and recovery.\n  It is clear from the data I have displayed here that this recession \nwas different. This recession was an investment recession. This \nrecession came at a time when productivity, by virtue of the \ninformation age and the application of high technology, was higher than \nit has ever been. This was a recession where productivity stayed \npositive and in high territory all the way through the recession, and \nproductivity has stayed high during the recovery.\n  In the hearing we held last Friday, I asked Commissioner Utgoff: What \nwas productivity growth in 2003? She said: 4.4 percent. I asked: What \nwas GDP growth in 2003? She said: 4.3 percent. In other words, \nproductivity grew faster than GDP, even though GDP grew at a rate \nhigher than the average of the 1990s. When productivity goes up faster \nthan economic growth, you lose jobs.\n  I asked: How many jobs did we lose in 2003, again according to the \npayroll survey, which is the survey she uses for this kind of \ncalculation. She said: We lost 60,000 jobs in 2003. I asked: Is that \nabout the right number with productivity at 4.4 percent and GDP at 4.3 \npercent? She said: Yes, that is about the right number. If productivity \nis growing more than GDP, at that number you would lose about 60,000 \njobs statistically.\n  That is the challenge we have as we look forward. We do not want to \ndo anything in the economy to bring down productivity, because \nproductivity is what gives us a higher standard of living, productivity \nis what gives us lower prices, productivity is what gives us \neconomic dominance in the rest of the world. Our rate of productivity \nis higher than any other nation's, and we clearly want to keep it that \nway.\n\n  The challenge is to get GDP growing faster than productivity. That is \nwhere the jobs will come from, and that is why we are having a \ndifferent kind of recovery this time, because it is a different kind of \nrecession, because it is the first recession of the information age \nwhen we are finally reaping the rewards of all the investment we have \nmade in technology in the decades leading up to this. It is finally \npaying off in this very significant productivity.\n  That is what I believe is happening. As we do our analysis around \nhere, I think, therefore, it is not helpful to be using industrial age \nassumptions dealing with the first information age recession and \nrecovery.\n  A few other items, and then I am through.\n  We have heard a lot on this floor about the size of the deficit and \nhow terribly big it is. In terms of nominal dollars, I will concede--\nabsolutely, I will stipulate--it is the largest deficit in history.\n  Now let's look at it the way you have to look at it if you are going \nto understand it intelligently, which is, how big is it with respect to \nthe size of the economy?\n  Going back over the same period where we have talked about previous \nrecessions, only this time I have gone back and picked up some others, \nthis chart goes back to the recession of 1970--again, the recession \nperiod is shaded--the recession of 1975, the double dip of the early \nReagan years, the recession in the early 1990s, and now the recession \nwe have just gone through. In every case, when you go into the \nrecession, the deficit comes up.\n  In this case the deficit is not measured in absolute dollars. It is \nmeasured as a percentage of the economy. In 1970, it goes up. When you \nget into the recovery, it comes back down. In the next recession, the \ndeficit goes up dramatically because this recession lasted longer and \nbecomes a double dip. The deficit goes up tremendously because this was \nthe most serious recession we had. Then in the recovery it comes back \ndown. It goes up. The recovery hits us and it starts coming down. \nIndeed, we even get into a surplus period. And we were in a surplus but \nthe recession hit us, and once again the same historic pattern occurred \nas the deficit came back up and is now coming back down.\n  The blue lines are history. You can see that the highest point of the \ndeficit as a percentage of GDP was during the double dip that occurred \nin the early Reagan years. Then there was a pretty high point in the \nrecession of the early 1990s, pretty close to the high point of the \nrecession in the mid-1970s. The current point is about equivalent to \nthe size of the deficit in the 1970s, below the deficits of the last \ntwo recessions.\n  The red line and the green line on the chart are the projections of \nwhere the deficit is going in the years ahead. The red line is the \nPresident's projection. The green line is CBO's projection.\n  I can't tell you which one of the two is right. I can tell you that \nboth of them are wrong. Because when you try to make projections that \nfar ahead with an $11 trillion economy, you are always going to be \nwrong. But I can tell you that the trend will be down.\n  I remember the projections when the deficit was here. This was when I \ncame to the Senate when President Clinton went to the White House. We \nhoped and prayed--and we signed the balanced budget agreement in the \nmid-1990s--that it was going to get the deficit down to zero by 2002. \nWe went into surplus in 2 years. We missed it. Everybody missed it. CBO \nmissed it. OMB missed it. Everybody missed it. The economy was so \nstrong that the deficit turned into a surplus.\n  Then we had the projections of surplus, and we missed it again. I \nhear the rhetoric on the floor: We were promised this surplus. Well, \nthe only thing I can promise is that these lines are wrong. Even though \nthey are CBO's best guess, they are OMB's best guess, they are wrong. \nBecause the economy responds in different ways than the computers \nanticipate around here.\n  Let's go directly to the question of the debt. This is the real \nissue, because deficits in one year or one business cycle don't matter \nall that much. It is the accumulation of the deficits, cycle over \ncycle, that adds up to the national debt that matters. If you have too \nmany of them back to back, you have real problems. If you have one that \nis not a problem by itself, you can deal with it.\n  Here is the publicly held debt as a percentage of GDP. That is the \nmeasure Chairman Greenspan urges us to use and so that is the measure \nwe have used. People are always a little surprised to find that the \nhighest level of publicly held debt in our history was 1945. We paid \nfor the Second World War with debt. It was over 100 percent of the \neconomy. It started coming down.\n\n  Here we have the Korean war, and the debt kept coming down. It \nbottomed out in the mid-1970s and started to rise again. That is the \nperiod of time\n\n[[Page S2427]]\n\nwhen we began to get some entitlement programs built into the system, \nthe later years of Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Then it starts going \nup again, and it goes up again and up again and up again.\n  As we saw from the statistics in the previous chart, the deficit then \nfell, even becoming a surplus, and the debt comes down dramatically. \nThen we hit the latest recession. The debt starts up again. Once again, \nthe blue line is historic debt to GDP. The red line is the President's \nprojection and the green line is CBO's projection.\n  Once again, the only thing I know about those projections is they are \nwrong. It will be something different. It always is.\n  We can see the debt at the present time is in relatively comfortable \nterritory. I know Senator Conrad will then start talking about, yes, \nbut what happens out here. I agree with him, what happens out here is \ngoing to be horrendous if we don't start to fix things. But I don't \nthink that this particular year, in a time of war, in a time of \nrecovery, when the economy is just getting traction, that the size of \nthe deficit--which we don't know what it will be at the end of the \nyear; last year we missed it by $80 billion--is going to determine what \nis going to happen out here. I think what is going to happen out here \nin terms of the Social Security and Medicare problem has to do with the \nway we restructure Social Security and Medicare around the demographic \nrealities rather than what we do in this particular year. I am \nperfectly willing to vote for this budget as it comes out in this \nsituation.\n  There are other charts that I shall not burden you with. I will end \nwith this one. We, once again, get to this question of projections. We \nhave a projection of a surplus. No, we have a projection of a huge \ndeficit. We always go back after the fact and the actual figures never \nmatch the projections. They are always high or low. Again, last year \nthe fiscal year that came in $81 billion lower than the high \nprojections we got in the middle of the year. You say: Gee, $81 billion \nis a huge miss.\n  Not necessarily. Out of an $11 trillion economy, $80 billion is \nwithin the margin of error, a phrase that all of us understand.\n  Here, then, is the analysis of what happened to the surplus. Yes, the \nblue shows that the surplus went for tax cuts. The 2001 tax cut took 18 \npercent of the projected surplus. The economic stimulus package that we \npassed in 2002 took another 1 percent. The tax cuts of 2003 took \nanother 5 percent of the surplus. Thirty-eight percent of the surplus \nwent for increased spending: the war on terror, rebuilding New York, \nhandling the aftermath of 9/11, homeland security, and lack of \ndiscipline on the Senate floor for a whole series of issues.\n  I am a member of the Appropriations Committee. I know what happens in \nthe conferences. I know what happens when people come in and start \nsaying: We have to have this much more and that much more, and you have \nto hold the line. And the line doesn't get held and the combination is \nmore red, if you will, than blue.\n  But the biggest part of the chart, the reason we missed the \nprojection, 40 percent was the weak economy. We just missed calculating \nwhat the economy would produce because we missed the recession. We \ndidn't see the recession coming and we didn't see how weak the recovery \nwould be.\n  There are those who insist--and I happen to agree with them--that if \nwe had not passed the tax cut, the economy would have been weaker than \nit was.\n  Just about every economist I talk to on Wall Street says: If you had \nnot passed the tax cut, you would not have had the recovery that you \nhave had in the financial markets.\n  That is not trivial because in the financial markets we have seen the \nrecovery, if you will, in the form of between $3 trillion and $4 \ntrillion worth of wealth. That may very well have funded the increased \nbusiness investment I showed on an earlier chart. You cannot say this \nis a sum zero game and if the tax cuts had not occurred, then you would \nhave had that much of the surplus left, because if the tax cut had not \noccurred, there would have been more weakness in the economy. I don't \nthink it is one-to-one. I think clearly the tax cuts took more out of \nthe economy than came back. But, over time, it may well have been one-\nto-one. The tax cuts happened at the right time and in the right places \nto produce a stronger economy and give us the recovery we need.\n  So, Mr. President, I conclude with this observation once again: I \nbelieve that the recession we have just gone through is the first \nrecession of the information age; therefore, this is the first recovery \nof the information age. It has not behaved like any previous recession, \nand it has not behaved like any previous recovery. We need to \nunderstand it far more than we do--we may have to go through 2 or 3 \nmore before we truly understand it--in order to make the right \nprescriptions as to what we should do. But we are in recovery. The \nrecovery is now strong.\n  GDP is now growing almost as fast as productivity, and if GDP can \ngrow faster than productivity, then jobs will come. We don't want to do \nanything to destroy productivity in the effort to create jobs because \nit is the growth of productivity that is responsible for our standard \nof living and for our hope for the future.\n  Overall, for the next 10 years, the prospects for the U.S. economy \nare very strong and bright. Hanging out there in the future, there is \nthe baby boom retirement problem and the challenge that we have to deal \nwith that in a structural fashion.\n  I hope this has been useful to the chair and other Members of the \nSenate. I appreciate the indulgence and allowing me to go through this \nin detail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes from the time \nallocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, I thank the chairman of the Joint \nEconomic Committee, Senator Bennett, for arranging this discussion on \nthe economic aspects of the budget before us. Also, I thank him for his \ngracious and very thoughtful chairmanship of the committee.\n  In 1992, it was popular to say, ``It is the economy, stupid.'' I \nthink circa 2004 the saying is, ``It is jobs, stupid.'' I think the \neconomy can be measured in many different ways. It can be measured by \nGDP, which seems to be moving along at a healthy pace. It can be \nmeasured in terms of productivity.\n  But for most families, the true measure is a very simple one: Do I \nhave a good job? Will I keep this job for the next several years, \nhopefully until I retire? Will my children, who I have attempted to \neducate and give advantages to, be able to realize even better job \nopportunities and be able to hold those jobs in the future? Frankly, \nfor families across this country, those questions are very uncertain at \nthis moment as a result of the record of the last several years in \nterms of job creation, the record of the administration in terms of its \neconomic stewardship of the most critical factor, and that is jobs for \nAmericans.\n  There is much discussion about these numbers. For example, this \nmorning, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, \npointed out that in 1996 the unemployment rate was the same as it is \nnow, 5.6 percent. He then stated that Democrats at that time argued \nthat achieving that rate of unemployment was good news, but today we \nseem to be unsatisfied with the 5.6 percent unemployment rate.\n  First, the Senator from Kentucky is right about that fact. In January \n1996, 3 full years into President Clinton's term, the unemployment rate \nwas 5.6 percent. Now, 3 full years into President Bush's term, the \nunemployment rate is 5.6 percent. But that is where the similarities \nend.\n  When President Clinton took office in January 1993, he really did \ninherit a weak economy. The unemployment rate was 7.3 percent. Three \nyears later, it was 5.6 percent, a drop of 1.7 percentage points. Of \ncourse, Democrats regarded that 5.6 percent unemployment rate as a \nsignificant improvement, and based on the experience of the Reagan-Bush \nyears when the unemployment rate was always above 5 percent, it was \nabout as good as it seemed to get.\n  What has been the experience under this President Bush? He inherited \nan\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n\neconomy that was definitely slowing down from the very strong growth \nachieved in the late 1990s. But the unemployment rate was 4.2 percent \nwhen he took office in January, 2001. The unemployment rate had been \nbelow 5 percent for 3\\1/2\\ years prior to his inauguration. So 3 years \nlater, when the unemployment rate was 1.4 percentage points higher than \nwhen he took office, a 5.6 unemployment rate doesn't look very good at \nall. That is because it is a sign of continued weakness in the economy.\n\n  The unemployment rate has been above 5.5 percent for over 2 years. \nPut simply, under President Bush, unemployment went up. Under President \nClinton, it went down. Families throughout this country recognize the \ndifference.\n  Let's look not just at unemployment rates, but at job creation. When \nthe unemployment rate stood at 5.6 percent in 1996, the economy had \nalready created nearly 7 million new jobs under President Clinton. As \nwe all know, the unemployment rate may be the same for President Bush \nat a comparable point in his Presidency; but instead of presiding over \nthe creation of 7 million jobs, he has presided over the loss of 2.2 \nmillion jobs--one of the most significant records of job loss of any \nPresident of the United States in our history.\n  My colleagues on the other side sometimes think it is unfair to \ncompare President Bush's job record with President Hoover's. We are not \nsaying that the economy today is the same as it was in 1930. We are \nsaying what the facts show. This is the most persistent jobless \nrecovery since the 1930s. The unemployment rate is lower now, but we \nare not creating jobs.\n  One of the worst aspects of the job slump we are experiencing is a \nlarge faction of the unemployed have been unemployed more than 26 weeks \nand are no longer eligible for regular State unemployment insurance \nbenefits. This morning, Senator McConnell argued that the President and \nour Republican colleagues were justified in not reviewing the Federal \ntemporary extended unemployment compensation program because the \nunemployment rate was so low. But here again, the numbers tell a \ndifferent story.\n  When President Clinton discontinued the temporary Federal extended \nbenefits in 1994, the unemployment rate was 6.4 percent, as Senators \nMcConnell and Bennett said. But the economy was creating jobs at a \nrapid pace at that time. The situation is starkly different now. The \nofficial unemployment rate may be 5.6 percent, but when you include \npeople who want to work but have dropped out of the labor force and \npeople who are working part-time because of the weak economy, you are \ntalking about an unemployment rate that is 9.6 percent, and that is a \nfunction of one I think important point that must be made again and \nagain: The way we measure unemployment in the United States is based \nupon the number of people who are in the workforce who are actively \nseeking work, either have work or are actively seeking it.\n  What the number really disguises is the number of people--hundreds of \nthousands of people--who have given up or are working part time. Let me \nsay this again. If we were looking at all the people who historically, \nin the last several years, have been in the workforce, and we looked at \nthe number of jobs, the rate of unemployment would be closer to 9.6 \npercent.\n  That is the difference between creating jobs in the mid-1990s when \nthe waiting period for a job was much shorter and today when very \ntalented, highly trained individuals are having a very difficult time \nto find any employment whatsoever.\n  With respect to the budget resolution at hand, the President's \neconomic policies have failed, and the budget being proposed by the \nmajority will lock us into that failed policy.\n  What the economy has needed for the past few years is short-term job-\ncreating policies and long-term growth-creating policies. What we have \ninstead are tax cuts that go disproportionately to upper income \ntaxpayers and create a legacy of large budget deficits and mounting \ndebt.\n  Those tax cuts have provided very little job-creating stimulus \nrelative to their huge costs, and they will depress growth in the long \nrun.\n  All of the economic analysis I have seen says that when the economy \nis in a slump with excess unemployment--which is the situation we have \nbeen in for several years now--the immediate policy objective is to \nstimulate job creation. Giving tax cuts to high-income taxpayers who \nare more likely to save those tax cuts than to spend them is exactly \nthe wrong approach.\n  If this is an investment recession, then our policies have not been \nparticularly geared to stimulating directed investment. These large \nincome tax cuts to wealthy Americans have not translated into jobs.\n  If we really were interested in creating jobs, we could have targeted \nmuch more of these tax cuts to lower income Americans who would consume \nand thus drive up demand. We could give specific incentives to industry \nto provide investments in new plant and equipment. This approach, which \nwould make much more sense if you are trying to deal with a lack of \ndemand and an investment slump, could have been done, but it was not.\n  Last year, when we debated a similar stimulus package, the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that nearly 2 \nmillion jobs would be created in the second half of last year, with \nabout half a million of those jobs coming as a direct result of the tax \ncuts.\n  Again, these are the projections of the Council of Economic Advisers: \n2 million extra jobs and a half million jobs directly related to the \ntax cut.\n  In fact, however, in that period, only 124,000 jobs were created. We \ngot the tax cuts--actually most of the tax cuts went to the wealthiest \nAmericans--but we did not get the jobs.\n  I do not know when we will see a truly sustainable job-creating \nrecovery, but I know it will not erase the legacy of large structural \nbudget deficits that the policies of the past 3 years have produced.\n  Economic analysis tells us that persistent structural deficits are \nbad for the economy. They drain national savings and slow down or crowd \nout private investment. That means our standard of living grows more \nslowly and becomes more costly.\n  Analysis by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee \non Taxation has found that tax cuts that add to the budget deficit are, \non net, harmful to long-term growth.\n  Some have tried to distract our attention from the deteriorating \nlong-term budget outlook by talking about cutting the deficit in half \nin 5 years. Such an approach completely ignores the real story, which \nis what happens to the budget when the baby boom generation starts to \nretire in just a few years.\n  In my opinion, the charts Senator Bennett showed historically looking \nback at the highs and lows of deficits miss a very important point. In \nthe mid-sixties, in the mid-seventies, and even in the mid-eighties, we \nwere not on the cusp of a huge number of Americans being entitled to \nSocial Security benefits and Medicare benefits in the foreseeable \nfuture. I think failing to recognize the onset of the baby boom \ngeneration into these programs and reserving funds to deal with it is a \ntremendous mistake.\n  I read, as many did, a book about Secretary of the Treasury Paul \nO'Neill's tenure in the Bush administration, and I was struck by the \nfact that he and Chairman Greenspan apparently saw this onslaught of \nthe baby boom generation with respect to Social Security, and they were \nworking very diligently to reserve $1 trillion from our surplus to do \nthe structural reforms about which so many talk. But what happened on \nthe way to structural reforms? That trillion-dollar surplus turned into \na trillion-dollar deficit, and our opportunity to deal honestly and in \na timely fashion with Social Security, and also Medicare, evaporated \nalong with the evaporating surplus.\n  The budget before us represents a continuation of the failed policies \nof the past 3 years. It has no effective programs to provide short-term \njob-creating stimulus and does nothing to address the problems faced by \nlarge numbers of American workers who see their jobs disappearing.\n  By making the tax cuts permanent, it locks us into a legacy of \ndeficits that could leave us unprepared to deal with the demographic \nchallenge of the baby boomers' retirement.\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\n  Those deficits will depress future standards of living by draining \nnational savings, discouraging investment, and adding to our foreign \nindebtedness.\n  This is a situation that argues for different policies. I agree, I \nthink, with the Senator from Utah that we are in a different type of \neconomic climate. The information technology has transformed radically \nwhat we do in our economy, but the policies and programs espoused by \nthe President and embraced by this budget do not recognize, in my view, \nthis new reality, and certainly I do not think we can content ourselves \nwith the view that in the long run everything will be fine because, as \nMaynard Keynes pointed out, in the long run we are all dead.\n  Our constituents expect us to act in the short run prudently and \nrealistically to help them, and I hoped we could be here debating a \nbudget that would invest in our people, would reassure the American \npeople that we are working to help stimulate the creation of private \njobs in this economy.\n  Finally, I point out what was most alarming to me in the last report \nfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics last Friday is that not only was \nthere negligible job growth--21,000 jobs--virtually none of these were \nin the private sector. They were public sector jobs.\n  We can do more, and we should do more, to ensure that every family in \nthis country feels confident in their job and in the ability of their \nchildren to obtain meaningful work in this country. That should be the \nfirst priority of any government. This budget does not represent that \ntype of priority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island yields the \nfloor. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, maybe I can engage in a colloquy with the \nchairman for a moment. I am going to speak in response to Senator \nBennett for probably 20 or 25 minutes, and I do not want to unduly take \nthe time of the chairman. Perhaps he wants to stay and listen to this. \nHe has heard much of this before. I want to tell him what my intention \nis.\n  If there are arrangements we can make for tomorrow at this point, \nthat would be useful. We have just been talking about that point. Maybe \nwe can talk some more later. I wanted to tell the chairman that I \nsought recognition for the purpose of speaking for some amount of time \ngiving an alternative view of what we heard from Senator Bennett. I do \nnot know how the chairman wants to proceed. I do not want him to just \nhave to sit here and listen to what he has heard several times before.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my very good \nfriend, Senator Conrad. I will suggest the absence of a quorum and see \nif he and I can work out an arrangement for finishing tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Dakota, who has \nthe floor, suggest the absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments. I \nheard my very good friend, Senator Reed from Rhode Island, call \nPresident Bush's economic policies failed. I take issue with that.\n  Last year we passed an economic stimulus package and it happened to \nwork. The proof is in the pudding. We have the results. The last three \nquarters have been phenomenal growth. The third quarter of last year \ngrew at over 8 percent. That is record growth for the last 20 some \nyears, which is phenomenal growth. A quarter after that, it was 4.4 \npercent. So if we look at the GDP, we can see real significant growth \nas a result of the growth package we passed last year.\n  Look at the stock market. The stock market was a precursor for the \ndecline in the economy that happened in the year 2000-2001. NASDAQ, as \nI mentioned a few times, declined by almost 50 percent in the year \n2000, kind of sending a signal there was a recession coming. \nSubsequently, we saw two or three quarters of negative growth in 2000-\n2001.\n  We made these changes last year in economic policy by accelerating \nthe rate cuts by saying we should not tax individuals more than \ncorporations. I thank my colleagues for their vote on that last \namendment saying we really should not tax individuals, doctors, \nlawyers, entrepreneurs, or self-employed individuals at a rate higher \nthan Exxon. That was one of the things that was voted on just a minute \nago, and I thank my colleagues.\n  I think reducing the tax on dividends has helped the economy. The \nstock market has now shown significant growth. Dow Jones a little over \na year ago was at 7,700. Now it is at 10,500. NASDAQ went up by 50 \npercent last year. The stock market has sent some good signals and we \nhave seen good economic growth for the last few quarters.\n  When my good friend, and he is my good friend, my marine buddy, \nSenator Reed from Rhode Island, said President Bush's economic policies \nare a failure, I beg to disagree. I think we have evidence the changes \nwe made last year have caused very significant, positive economic \ngrowth, and I mention that with great respect, but I wanted to give a \ndifferent viewpoint.\n  Momentarily, we are going to be locking in an order for tomorrow. We \nmade good progress on the budget today. We worked a lot of the day. \nSenator Conrad and I both have been on the floor since 9:30 this \nmorning, and we are really starting to work our way through the budget. \nI thank all of our colleagues, Democrat and Republican, for their \ncooperation in doing so.\n  Tomorrow I believe Senator Ensign from Nevada wishes to make a \nspeech, and shortly after that I believe Senator Murray will be \nrecognized to offer an education amendment. After that, I believe \nSenator Lindsey Graham and Senator Bunning have an amendment, and we \nwill consider that. There will be a mutually agreeable time to vote on \nthose amendments. We do not expect the debate on those amendments to be \ntoo prolonged. That is not in our interest. Our interest is trying to \ncomplete this budget and to conduct business in an appropriate, orderly \nmanner so we can avoid the vote-aramas that have happened in the past.\n  I want to let our colleagues know there will not be any more votes \ntonight. We will be on the floor for a little while longer. We do have \nin the queue a couple of the amendments ready. It will be Senator \nMurray's amendment and Senator Lindsey Graham's amendment tomorrow \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is it the chairman's intention we not ask for a unanimous \nconsent in terms of that basic structure or could we at least have a \nunanimous consent agreement to the extent Senator Ensign would be \nrecognized for up to 30 minutes and then we would turn to Senator \nMurray's amendment, and after the disposition of that amendment we \nwould go to the amendment of Senator Graham of South Carolina?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to enter into such an agreement. That would \nbe fine. I can state the agreement. I think the staffs are working on \nit. Why do we not let staff complete it because we will also yield back \nsome time and complete that. I am happy to agree to such a request.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I think it will help our colleagues \nunderstand there is a basic order and structure tomorrow so they can \nmake their plans accordingly in terms of seeking recognition if they \nunderstand Senator Ensign will first be recognized for a period and \nthen we will turn to the Murray amendment on education and then to the \nGraham amendment.\n  Senator Wyden is here. I yield to Senator Wyden 5 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Conrad of North Dakota, and \nalso thank Senator Nickles, whose staff has been working with me.\n  Many Senators know last year we put a tremendous amount of effort in \ntrying to get a bipartisan bill passed to\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\nget our forests healthy again. We have seen much of our country just \ndevastated by staggering forest fires.\n  A key part of that legislation was to authorize $760 million in \nhazardous fuels reduction programs. The amendment I have filed--and I \nwill be asking the Senate to vote on it tomorrow--has generated \ninterest among many colleagues of both political parties. It would add \n$343 million to last year's $417 million for hazardous fuels reductions \nto reach the $760 million authorization in title I Healthy Forests \nlegislation.\n  It seems to me what we have seen over the years is essentially a \nshell game, where various Forest Service programs are robbed in order \nto fund the hazardous fuels reduction programs and we end up without \nadequate resources across the board in the forestry area. I am hopeful \nwe will be able to agree with our Republican colleagues on this effort.\n  Suffice it to say, it was a Herculean task to get Healthy Forest \nlegislation passed last session. I think many thought it was \nimpossible. It seems to me the Senate owes it to the people who are \nwaiting to see improvements in their communities to fully fund this \nimportant legislation.\n  I am going to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this \nparticular piece of legislation. This amendment will ensure we really \nget some health back into this idea of healthy forests. We are not \ngoing to be able to do it if we consistently underfund these programs.\n  In the past, it seems to me, we played sort of a ``rob one fund in \norder to fund another fund'' kind of program. That is not going to do \nthe job responsibly for the long term. We are talking about millions \nand millions of acres that we are going to have to thin in the days \nahead.\n  After the Senate passes historic legislation, legislation that is \ngoing to be good for the environment, good for the economy, promote old \ngrowth, involve local communities, protect the rights of citizens--for \nexample, being involved in forestry policy--what we have to do is fund \nthis properly.\n  There will be interest among colleagues on both sides of the aisle on \nthe legislation. I thank Chairman Nickles for being willing to work \nwith me on it, and Senator Conrad as well. On the other side of the \naisle, Senators Domenici and Burns are intensely interested in this \nmatter. On our side of the aisle, Senators Daschle, Feinstein, \nBingaman--all of us have cooperated with the ranking member, Senator \nConrad, and the chairman, Senator Nickles.\n  My amendment has been filed, and I am hopeful we will be able to pass \nit without controversy tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, for his \ngracious comments. It is a pleasure working with him on a multitude of \nissues, this being one, forest fires.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2430-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I \nsalute these volunteers of all backgrounds and ages who have reached \nout to people in need beyond our borders and who have presented an \nimage of our country that is compassionate, energetic and approachable. \nI am especially proud of the 255 people from Wisconsin who are \npresently volunteering for the Peace Corps in South Africa, Ghana, \nNicaragua, Philippines, Turkmenistan, Mongolia and many other \ncountries. Wisconsin is one of the biggest contributors of Peace Corps \nvolunteers in our country, ranked 15 among the 50 States. For the 10th \nyear in a row, University of Wisconsin-Madison has the highest number \nof alumni serving as Peace Corps volunteers. The selfless service of \nWisconsinites must be commended.\n  In 1960, President Kennedy challenged Americans to serve their \ncountry by living and working in developing countries. Americans have \nbeen answering this call ever since by joining the Peace Corps. Decades \nlater, I have been struck by the lasting impact that this organization, \nand the young people who have fueled it, have had around the world.\n  In 2002 I traveled to visit the sites of the 1998 embassy bombings. \nTanzania, a country where about half of the population is Muslim, is no \nstranger to suspicion and mistrust of the West. Yet as I found myself \nmeeting with a group of Tanzanian legislators, asking for their views \nabout how to strengthen our partnership in combating terrorism and to \nimprove the relationship between our countries, I was overwhelmed by \ntheir enthusiasm for the Peace Corps.\n  These distinguished legislators told me about how their first English \nlanguage teachers were Peace Corps volunteers, and how those teachers \nseemed to be opening the whole world to them just by their very \npresence in the classroom. These legislators said that the best way to \nstrengthen our relations with their country was to foster meaningful \npeople-to-people links by increasing our Peace Corps presence there.\n  In today's world where our challenges are global in nature, there is \nan urgent need for Americans to participate in programs like the Peace \nCorps. Peace Corps volunteers reach across the political and cultural \ndivide, connecting with people as individuals. They treat others with \nrespect by learning about their cultures and their lives, and they put \na human face on America, which would otherwise be simply a distant \npowerful land. They help dissolve resentment against our country that \nmight flourish in their absence.\n  I congratulate Peace Corps and its volunteers for 43 years of \neffective service in a mission of world peace and friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2430-5", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2430-S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the\n\n[[Page S2431]]\n\nLocal Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  One terrible crime occurred in October 2003 in Providence, RI. There, \na woman was grabbed off a street by two men who yelled homophobic slurs \nand then egged each other on while raping her at knifepoint. The woman \nwas walking to a club around 11:30 p.m. when a large tan vehicle pulled \nup nearby. The driver asked her for directions, and as she spoke with \nhim, another man grabbed her from behind and forced her into the back \nseat of the vehicle. The men accused her of being a lesbian and called \nher names. They then pulled into a lot and took turns raping her at \nknifepoint. After, they pushed her out of the car and sped off.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2431-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF MARK McCLELLAN AS ADMINISTRATOR, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND \n                           MEDICAID SERVICES\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, 3 weeks ago President Bush nominated \nMark McClellan to be Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS. I rise today to express my deep concern over \nthe news that some of my colleagues have threatened to delay his \nconfirmation.\n  This is happening at a time when CMS has more on its plate than it \nhas had in 39 years--since the creation of the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms in 1965. Last November, I proudly joined my colleagues in \nsupport of a bill to finally provide over 40 million seniors a \nvoluntary prescription drug benefit through Medicare. After years of \nhaving to carry the burden of high prescription drug costs without any \nassistance from Medicare, the bill we passed will provide 1.6 million \nseniors in my State with access to affordable prescription drugs. This \nis long overdue.\n  At CMS, steps are already being taken to implement the provisions in \nthis bill. In fact, 2 months from now, in May 2004, seniors across the \nNation will have the opportunity to enroll in a Medicare-endorsed drug \ndiscount card that is expected to yield an average 10 to 25 percent \nsavings on all prescription drug purchases. On top of these discounts, \nthe Federal Government will annually purchase the first $600 in \nprescription drug costs for those seniors below 135 percent of the \npoverty level.\n  Five weeks ago, on February 5th, CMS announced that over 100 separate \nentities had submitted applications to offer Medicare-approved cards to \nbeneficiaries, a response they called a ``robust level of interest'' \nfrom potential card sponsors. While this is encouraging, this level of \ninterest places greater demand on CMS staff as they continue to review \napplications and move forward in announcing their card endorsements \nwithin the next month.\n  Furthermore, former CMS administrators have been quick to point out \nthat if the new drug benefit is to commence on time in January 2006, \nrules must be written and finalized no later than October or November \nof 2005. Vital decisions must be made about the administration of the \nbenefit in the development stage, which is now--decisions that require \nstrong leadership and expertise. Unfortunately, CMS has been without a \nleader since January, when Tom Scully resigned.\n  I assure you that the success of Medicare and the prescription drug \nbenefit rests with a capable CMS workforce under strong leadership. CMS \nalready faces an enormous challenge. Approximately one quarter of its \nworkforce will be eligible to retire in the coming years. In fiscal \nyear 2003, 30 percent of individuals serving in career Senior Executive \nService positions at CMS were eligible for retirement. In addition, 20 \npercent of CMS's workforce was eligible to retire. The leadership to \nmove this vital agency forward is lacking without a confirmed \nadministrator.\n  Gail Wilensky, administrator of CMS's predecessor, the Health Care \nFinancing Administration from 1990 to 1992, describes the task ahead as \n``the largest challenge an administrator has had.'' Similarly, her \nsuccessor, Nancy Ann Min DeParle, who had the demanding task of \nimplementing the Balanced Budget Act throughout her tenure from 1997 to \n2000, has correctly stated that implementing the new drug benefit will \nbe even more taxing than previous initiatives and will require the \nagency to design a ``new delivery system that does not now exist even \nin the commercial market.''\n  I could not agree more. I have concerns about the arduous task ahead \nfor CMS and as a result, will be holding a hearing at my Government \nAffairs Subcommittee in the coming weeks to examine CMS' capacity to do \nthis job. I expect Dr. McClellan to be at this hearing to discuss his \nplans for leading CMS in this pursuit.\n  I cannot think of a more qualified leader for CMS at this critical \ntime than Dr. Mark McClellan. His work at the helm of the FDA over the \npast 2 years brought innovation and creativity to the agency, which \nmany believe has dismantled bureaucratic barriers and led to quicker \nreviews of drug and other product applications to speed generic drugs \nto the marketplace. I am most appreciative of his work in this area, as \na few years ago, I was able to secure $400,000 for the FDA to educate \nour nation's seniors about the safety and cost-effectiveness of generic \ndrugs.\n  Dr. McClellan earned a medical degree from the Harvard University-\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology Program in Health Sciences and \nTechnology and a doctorate in economics from MIT. He served under \nPresident Clinton between 1998 and 1999 as Deputy Assistant Secretary \nof the Treasury and served as health policy coordinator and a member of \nPresident Bush's Council of Economic Advisers before joining the FDA.\n  In fact, Dr. McClellan has always enjoyed broad support across party \nlines, and it was no surprise that just last week, Senator Edward \nKennedy described Dr. McClellan as a superb choice for CMS \nadministrator who ``brings to the job a powerful intellect, a deep \nknowledge of the programs and a commitment to public service.''\n  What did come as a surprise was the announcement by several Senators \nthat, despite Dr. McClellan's outstanding qualifications, they are \nthreatening to block his nomination to gain leverage on the issue in \nCongress of re-importing pharmaceuticals from outside of the United \nStates.\n  As Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of \nGovernment Oversight and Management and the Federal Workforce, I am \ngravely concerned. Delaying this appointment at a time when CMS \ndesperately needs leadership will affect the agency's ability to \neffectively implement the prescription drug benefit and even more \nurgently, the drug discount card program.\n  This is not fair to the 5,000 dedicated CMS employees who are working \ntirelessly to implement the congressionally mandated prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  This is not fair to our Nation's seniors. Every American, and \nparticularly every senior citizen, should be outraged.\n  Now is not the time to play political games. We must make sure that \nCMS has the leadership it needs at this juncture to handle the task at \nhand. I urge my colleagues to reconsider their decision to delay the \nnomination of Dr. Mark McClellan and confirm his appointment to this \nimportant position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2431-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2431-S2432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING SUJEY KALLUMADANDA\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today is, and will always be, a special day \nin the life of one of my staffers, Sujey Kallumadanda. For on this day, \nSujey has successfully completed all the requirements, passed all the \ntests, completed the interviews and officially taken the oath as a new \ncitizen of the United States. I appreciate having this opportunity to \ncongratulate him on his effort and to wish him well on his acceptance \nof this wonderful new title he will carry with him for the rest of his \nlife, United States Citizen.\n  Sujey's story is quite a remarkable one. It begins with his \nemigration from India when he was young and his arrival in the United \nStates with his family. He is the latest of his family to become a \ncitizen of the United States,\n\n[[Page S2432]]\n\nand he couldn't be more proud of his new status.\n  The journey that began in India brought him to Texas where he \ngraduated from Texas A with a bachelor's degree in Economics. He then \ngraduated from Michigan State University with his law degree, and from \nthere he went on to Georgetown University where he received his Master \nof Laws in Securities and Financial Regulations.\n  Sujey is a member of the New York Bar and his background and \nunderstanding of banking and financial matters made him an invaluable \nsource of information for my staff. He has also proved to be an \nimportant asset as we have worked on and studied issues of importance \nto the small business community.\n  My staff and I have greatly enjoyed having Sujey on our team and I \nwould like to think we have taught him some valuable lessons about \nAmerican life. For instance, thanks to my staff, Sujey has developed an \nappreciation for the finer things in life like Wyoming Honey Candy. I \nhaven't been able to convince him to read fiction novels or that \nWyoming is the center of the sports universe but that will come with \ntime. All in all, I don't think he'll ever be the same. But one thing \nis for certain, and that is the drive and focus he placed on achieving \nhis dream of life in the United States.\n  Now his apprenticeship is over, and he has received the greatest \nhonor our Nation has to bestow--American citizenship. I know he will \ncarry it proudly and with purpose in the years to come.\n  Sujey knows full well that being an American Citizen is not only a \ngreat honor, but that it brings with it both great freedoms and \nrights--and great duties and responsibilities. He will become very \nfamiliar with them both as he continues to take part in one of the \ngreatest experiments in government the world has ever known--the \nAmerican democracy.\n  Congratulations, Sujey. By your example you have reminded us that we \nare very fortunate to be American citizens. By your heartfelt \ndedication and commitment to earning your citizenship you have taught \nus that citizenship is a great honor and we should never take it for \ngranted. Good luck and God bless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2432-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2432-S2433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Women's \nHistory Month. As an outgrowth of International Women's Day, the \nEducation Task Force of the Sonoma County Commission on the Status of \nWomen planted the seeds of Women's History Month during the week of \nMarch 8, 1978. The task force established an agenda of events and \ncelebrations that included a multicultural perspective recognizing the \ncontributions made by all women. Soon thereafter the idea spread, as \nmany Sonoma area schools began holding similar week-long programs.\n  In 1979, Molly Murphy MacGregor, Director of the Sonoma County \nCommission, spoke so eloquently during a Women's History Institute \nConference about the importance of this recognition that, by the end of \nthe conference, participants vowed to promote the idea of Women's \nHistory Week within their own organizations and to secure a \nCongressional Resolution declaring the week of March 8, National \nWomen's History Week.\n  By the end of 1980, Maryland's own Senator Barbara Mikulski, then a \nMember of Congress, sponsored a joint congressional resolution \ndeclaring the week of March 8 as National Women's History Week. That \nsame year, President Jimmy Carter issued a presidential message to \nencourage recognition and celebration of women's historic \naccomplishments during the week of March 8.\n  In 1987, at the request of women's organizations, educators, and \nothers, the National Women's History Project petitioned Congress to \nexpand these celebrations to the entire month of March. Upon bipartisan \napproval of the National Women's History Month Resolution, National \nHistory Month was born, affording us the opportunity to focus each year \non areas of accomplishment and inspiration--and to honor the many great \nwomen leaders from our past and present who have served our Nation so \nwell.\n  As scientists, writers, doctors, teachers, and mothers, women have \nshaped our world and guided us down the road to prosperity and peace. \nFor far too long, however, their contributions to the strength and \ncharacter of our society went unrecognized and undervalued.\n  Women have led efforts to secure not only their own rights, but have \nalso been the guiding force behind many of the other major social \nmovements of our time--the abolitionist movement, the industrial labor \nmovement, and the civil rights movement, to name a few. We also have \nwomen to thank for the establishment of many of our early charitable, \nphilanthropic, and cultural institutions.\n  I would like to take this time to single out a few women from the \nState of Maryland whose work and accomplishments are very much in line \nwith this year's theme ``Women Inspiring Hope and Possibility.'' These \nindividuals are from different professions, different age groups, \ndifferent backgrounds, but they all represent what it means to inspire.\n  Edith Houghton Hooker, a member of the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame, \ntruly embodied this year's theme. Ms. Houghton Hooker was convinced \nthat progressive reform would occur much more quickly and completely if \nwomen achieved the right to vote. In 1909, in the midst of Maryland's \nsuffrage movement, Hooker organized the Just Government League and \naffiliated her organization with the National American Woman Suffrage \nAssociation, NAWSA. In 1910, the defeat of suffrage in the Maryland \nGeneral Assembly led Hooker and others to believe that, although they \nshould continue to urge suffrage legislation at the State level, the \npassage of a national constitutional amendment should be the priority \nof their organization's efforts. Ms. Houghton Hooker also realized \nearly on that while there were several local and statewide suffrage \norganizations, these groups would have to present a united front in \nAnnapolis and that activists would have to engage in an effective and \ncollaborative public information campaign.\n  With that in mind, in 1912, she created the Maryland Suffrage News as \nthe official organ of the Just Government League, which served to \naddress each of those needs: unity, a statewide presence, and public \ninformation. The News became the weekly voice, not just for the Just \nGovernment League, but for the entire suffrage movement in Maryland. In \naddition to developments regarding suffrage, the News informed its \nsubscribers, most of whom were from the middle class, of the needs and \ncircumstances of working class women, and the problems associated with \neducation, crime and corruption. And, in 1917, largely because of her \nwork in growing the News, Hooker was named President of the Maryland \nSuffrage Party of Baltimore. Now, the many bound volumes of the \nMaryland Suffrage News reside in the Maryland Historical Society, where \nour generation and future generations can learn about the struggles of \nthe suffrage movement, the dedication of suffragists, and the \nimportance of the result.\n  The late Rachel Carson, another Maryland woman and scientist, \ninspired the Nation as pioneer of the modern conservation movement. \nCarson, a well-known naturalist, wrote Silent Spring, which became a \nkey symbol of the new environmental movement in this country. After \nWorld War II, Ms. Carson became concerned about the increased use of \nsynthetic chemical pesticides and took it upon herself to alert a \nnational audience to the environmental and human dangers of haphazard \nuse of these chemicals.\n  In the tradition of women inspiring and helping others, I would be \nremiss if I failed to mention Clara Barton, founder and first president \nof the American Red Cross. While recuperating from illness in Europe, \nshe learned of the Treaty of Geneva, which provided relief to sick and \nwounded soldiers. Upon her return to the U.S., her crusading ensured \nthe signing of the Geneva Treaty in 1882. Ms. Barton founded the \nAmerican Red Cross in 1881, where she served as its first president. \nSeveral years later, she wrote the American Amendment to the Red Cross \nConstitution, which provided for disaster relief during peacetime as \nwell as war. As part of her legacy, the American Red Cross continues to \nprovide relief work in times of famines,\n\n[[Page S2433]]\n\nfloods, and earthquakes in the United States and throughout the world.\n  I also want to mention some of today's heroes from Maryland. Sol de \nAnde Mendez Eaton serves as an activist for the Maryland Hispanic/\nLatino community. Ms. Eaton convened the first Maryland Statewide \nconference on civil rights as co-chair of the Maryland Advisory \nCommittee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. She has worked at the \nlocal and State level as a pioneer in the areas of women's health and \ndomestic violence. Every day, she continues to inspire us to work for \nthe rights of others by seeking to reduce discrimination in employment, \nhousing, education and health.\n  June Bacon-Bercey, another Marylander, the first African American \nwoman to receive a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences, inspires us as well. As \na television forecaster, she is also the first African American woman, \nand indeed the first woman to receive the American Meteorological \nService Seal for television-radio weather-casting. In 1979, Ms. Bacon-\nBercey became Chief Administrator of Television Activities for the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency.\n  She is a scientist, an international expert on weather and aviation, \nas well as a wife and mother. Recognizing the difficulties that other \nwomen would face in pursuing her profession, she has chosen to go \nbeyond her substantial personal achievement to help other women reach \ntheir goals in weather-related professions. In fact, she donated her \nwinnings from a game show to create a scholarship plan for young women \nwanting to join meteorology. In view of this year's theme, I commend \nMs. Bacon-Bercey not only for her example and inspiration to other \nwomen, but for her generosity in directly helping others reach their \ndreams.\n  Since the first woman received a medical degree from a United States \nmedical school, in 1848, female doctors have helped shape and change \nthe course of medicine. A model physician in the State of Maryland, Dr. \nMarie Amos Dobyns, has worked in Maryland for over 20 years and served \nover 3,000 patients. As an Eastern Cherokee Native American, she \nintegrates her heritage into her medical practice and her vision of a \npartnership between patient and physician has inspired would-be \nphysicians across the country to seek out innovative approaches to \noffering comprehensive patient-centered care.\n  I am privileged to speak in honor of the mothers, wives, daughters, \nfriends and neighbors that have inspired and opened up possibilities \nfor us all. We should take this month to redouble our efforts to ensure \nthat their work has not been for naught. In that regard, I ask us all \nto take Women's History Month as a time to reflect on the contributions \nof women, but also as a time to refocus on how much needs to be \naccomplished to achieve full equality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2433-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2433-S2434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY F.

Ms. Diaz became its chief investigator, \n     strategist, watchdog and lobbyist.\n       She deployed volunteers in Africa, the Middle East, South \n     America and trouble spots like Kosovo and Afghanistan.

Her calling gradually shifted from the \n     newsroom to the outside world. She studied administration, \n     planning and social policy at the Harvard Graduate School of \n     Education, receiving a master's degree in international \n     education in 1988.

Diaz traveled to the world's trouble \n     spots, dodging minefields, tsetse flies, lions, and wars on \n     her mission to help refugee women and children reclaim their \n     lives.\n       As executive director of the New York-based Women's \n     Commission for Refugee Women and Children, Ms. Diaz went on \n     fact-finding missions to places such as Serbia, Angola, \n     Rwanda, Nepal, Pakistan, Haiti, and South America to talk to \n     the displaced women and children firsthand.\n       On her return to the United States, she would plead their \n     cases before the United Nations and lobby law makers and \n     relief agencies to improve their conditions. When they needed \n     asylum in this country, she fought for that, as well.\n       Ms. Diaz, 43, who formerly worked in Boston, died Feb. 12 \n     of pancreatic cancer at New York's Columbia Presbyterian \n     Hospital.\n       ``Mary was passionate about her work and was dedicating her \n     life to it,'' said the commission spokeswoman, Diana Quick.\n       She often got results, Quick said. After Ms. Diaz's report \n     on her trip to Bosnia, the Clinton administration provided a \n     fund for its women refugees. During a visit to Tanzania, she \n     got the rules changed to allow Burundian women as well as men \n     to distribute food to fellow refugees--and, as a result, many \n     women got food.\n       After a visit to Afghanistan in 2002, Ms. Diaz initiated a \n     fund for programs for Afghan women.\n       ``Since Mary became executive director,'' Quick said, ``the \n     commission has grown from a small organization with a staff \n     of four and a budget of $425,000 to one with more than 20 \n     staff and a budget of $4 million.''\n       Ms. Diaz's death, said Ruud Lubbers, who heads the United \n     Nations High Commission for Refugees in Geneva, ``left a void \n     in the refugee and humanitarian world, where she touched many \n     lives.''\n       In Boston, where Ms. Diaz worked for Catholic Charities \n     from 1984 to 1994, the last six years as its director of \n     refugee and immigration services, Judith Whitmarsh of \n     Catholic Charities described her as ``the kindest and most \n     compassionate person I've known.''\n       Whitmarsh, a former program coordinator of the state Office \n     for Refugees and Immigrants, said Ms. Diaz was ``particularly \n     concerned with people who were disenfranchised.\n       ``When new immigrants arrived at the airport, Mary would \n     always make sure there was a friendly face to greet them and \n     that there would be some cultural orientation for them. If \n     they had experienced trauma, there would be help. If they \n     didn't know English, she got them into classes so they could \n     find jobs.''\n       Ms. Diaz became executive director of the Women's \n     Commission, a nongovernmental organization, in 1994, five \n     years after it was founded by actress Liv Ullman.\n       Ms. Diaz also gave eloquent and poignant speeches about the \n     plight of refugee women and children to potential donors. \n     ``Mary was very strong in a very quiet way,'' Quick said.\n       In an address in Minneapolis in 2002, seeking support for \n     the reproductive health care and rights of adolescents in \n     refugee settings and war zones, Ms. Diaz told the story of \n     Marion, a 14-year-old girl she had met in Sierra Leone.\n       ``Marion was living with her family near Freetown when \n     rebels forced their way into her home and demanded her mother \n     surrender one of the children,'' Ms. Diaz said in her speech. \n     ``When her mother refused, the rebels threatened to kill \n     everyone in the house. Her mother pointed to Marion.''\n       ``Marion was gang-raped almost immediately,'' Ms. Diaz \n     said, ``but told she had to walk with the rebels or be shot. \n     She lived with different commanders as a slave for more than \n     two years, escaping one day when she was given permission to \n     go to the market. She gave birth to a baby a year after being \n     abducted.''\n       Marion developed serious health problems that couldn't be \n     addressed in Sierra Leone, Ms. Diaz said. She had a chance to \n     go home, but her mother wouldn't take her back.\n       Ms. Diaz believed the international community had a \n     responsibility to help children like Marion.\n       Ms. Diaz was born in Newport News, Va. Tom Ferguson of New \n     York City, her longtime partner, said her desire to serve \n     others came naturally. Her late father, from the Philippines, \n     was a doctor; her mother is a nurse. Two brothers are \n     doctors. One sister is a teacher, another a librarian.\n       Ms. Diaz grew up in Pottstown, Pa. After high school, she \n     graduated from Brown University in 1982, with a major in \n     international relations. She worked briefly for a \n     Philadelphia television station and then came to Boston, \n     where she studied for a master's degree in international \n     education at Harvard University, which she earned in 1988.\n       Four years later, while she was at Catholic Charities, a \n     group of 112 Haitian children got separated from their \n     parents en route to refugee camps at Guantanamo Bay. They \n     ended up in Boston, under Ms. Diaz's care. First, she met the \n     children at the airport, Ferguson said, then took them all \n     for lunch at Buzzy's Fabulous Roast Beef and a swim in a pool \n     before reuniting them with their parents.\n       Ms. Diaz ``left her mark wherever she went,'' Whitmarsh \n     said.\n       In addition to Ferguson, Ms. Diaz leaves her mother, Bertha \n     of Pottstown, Pa.; two brothers, Philip of Columbus, Ohio, \n     and Joseph of Barrington, R.I.; and two sisters, Theresa of \n     Reading, Pa., and Bernadette of Oak Park, Ill.\n       A memorial service will be held tomorrow at 2 p.m. in The \n     Church of the Ascension in New York City.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2434-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN IOWA'S MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nIrvine Lee Shanks, who passed away Friday, March 5, 2004, at the age of \n73. Mr. Shanks broke the college basketball color barrier in Kentucky \nwhen he took the court for Berea College in 1954. On that day in \nFebruary, at a small basketball stadium in Ohio, he became the first \nblack man to play for a previously all-white college basketball team.\n  He enrolled at Berea College at the age of 23, likely lured by that \ninstitution's goal of educating the underprivileged at no cost. To this \nday, Berea is one of the few affordable options for the lower-income \nfamilies of Kentucky and Appalachia.\n  Just as Berea is not your typical college, Mr. Shanks wasn't your \ntypical student. He was married with two children. He was a veteran of \nthe Korean War, choosing service to his country rather than a \nbasketball scholarship at Tennessee A in Nashville.\n  Returning to college was difficult, but the 6-foot-5 center excelled \non the basketball court. He stood out among his teammates for other \nreasons as well, but there were no major racially-inspired incidents \nduring his games. His team, however, often chose to miss meals or sleep \non campuses because they could not find restaurants or hotels that \nwould serve a black man. Despite these difficulties, his team came \ntogether in 1955 and upset Georgetown College to win the Kentucky \nIntercollegiate Athletic Conference Championship.\n  Mr. Shanks' experience in sports reminds me of my time in Major \nLeague Baseball and my good friend Jackie Robinson. Breaking barriers \nand achieving success seem to be a common link between these two \nathletes. These pioneers in sports taught our Nation quite a bit and \ndeserve our thanks for setting America on the road to equality. What I \nhave seen in baseball makes me admire Mr. Shanks accomplishments that \nmuch more.\n  He was a role model for all throughout the State and helped change \nsociety's attitudes towards race. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2434-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2434-S2435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN LEGACY FOUNDATION\n\n   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today, \nrecognizing the fifth anniversary of the American Legacy Foundation, an \norganization dedicated to educating Americans on the dangers of tobacco \nuse.\n  In 1964, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service \nofficially recognized that cigarette smoking\n\n[[Page S2435]]\n\ncauses cancer and other serious diseases. However, 40 years later, \ntobacco use remains the Nation's leading preventable cause of death. \nTragically, tobacco use continues to affect the lives of millions of \nAmericans, particularly plaguing our Nation's young people. Each year, \nsmoking kills more than 440,000 people in the United States, and \nmillions more suffer from serious tobacco-related illnesses.\n  Established in 1999 under the Master Settlement Agreement, the \nAmerican Legacy Foundation has developed national programs that address \nthe health effects of tobacco use. Tobacco prevention programs play a \nvital role in decreasing tobacco use among youth, and the Legacy \nFoundation's innovative antismoking campaigns have had a significant \nimpact in reducing tobacco use, especially among our Nation's youth. As \na result of their continuous dedication, millions of Americans are \nliving healthier lives.\n  Unfortunately, the future of the American Legacy Foundation is in \nquestion. This year the foundation received its last payment from the \nMaster Settlement Agreement. Because of this dramatic reduction of \nresources, all of the successes of the last 5 years are in jeopardy.\n  I am pleased to stand here, recognizing the achievements of the \nAmerican Legacy Foundation. I know that my fellow colleagues will join \nwith me in applauding the efforts of the Legacy Foundation and \ncongratulating them on their fifth anniversary. I hope that they will \nalso join with me in pledging continued support for this life-saving \ncause. Only with such concerted action can we avert millions of \npremature deaths and prevent future generations of young people from \nfalling victim to the tobacco epidemic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2435-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MAINE LOBSTERMEN'S ASSOCIATION\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nMaine Lobstermen's Association on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, \nReaching this significant mile stone is a testament to the \norganization's positive message and the strong guidance of its \nleadership throughout the last half-century.\n  Lobstermen are symbolic of Maine's unique way of life. Harvesting \nlobsters is part of the proud heritage of Maine's coasts and the State \nproduces more lobster than any other in the Nation. Each year, over 50 \nmillion pounds of lobster are harvested in Maine, adding several \nhundred million dollars to the State's economy. Lobstering is a \ntraditional occupation which represents the values of Mainers and their \ndeep connection with the abundant natural resources and beautiful coast \nthat surround the State.\n  Maine's lobster fishery, though well recognized today, had very \nhumble beginnings. According to the Gulf of Maine Aquarium, lobsters \nwere once so plentiful that they were considered a plain, dull food and \na cheap source of nutrition for those living near the Northeast coast. \nLobstering was done by hand until the mid-19th century, when trapping \nbecame more popular and allowed for larger numbers of lobsters to be \ncaught. The fishery also experienced growth due to the advent of new \ncanning practices, which enabled Maine lobsters to reach far and wide \nacross the glove. As Maine's lobster fishery has grown, changing \ntechnologies and stronger regulations have put new pressures on \nlobstermen, while also ensuring the continued success and \nsustainability of lobstering as an occupation.\n  Founded in 1954, the MLA has promoted a spirit of cooperation among \nlobstermen, and it has fought hard to improve their way of life as \nMaine's lobster fishery evolves. Through the dedication of its \nmembership and the strong leadership of its directors, the Association \nhas been instrumental in keeping the grandest tradition of Maine's \ncoasts both profitable and sustainable. Along the way, it has grown to \na considerable size and now counts over 1,200 lobstermen in its ranks. \nThe Association has such a large membership that it currently bills \nitself as the biggest commercial fishing industry on the East Coast.\n  As Maine's Senator and as chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Oceans, \nFisheries and Coast Guard, I am particularly dedicated to helping \nfishing communities maintain the quality of life which they deserve. I \nam extremely grateful to the Association for its tireless dedication to \nMaine lobstermen, and I thank each and every one of its members for \nbeing actively involved in their communities through their membership. \nI look forward to many more years of working closely with the MLA.\n  Again, I congratulate the Association on its past successes, and wish \nit at least another 50 years of growth and achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2435-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2435-S2439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS\n\n       POM-365.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the recovery \n     and stabilization of the manufacturing industry in the United \n     States; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 190\n\n       Whereas, historically, manufacturing has been a base \n     industry for the national economy, steadily comprising \n     approximately 17 percent of the Gross Domestic Product since \n     1947; and\n       Whereas, the manufacturing industry has experienced a rapid \n     decline and economic losses over the last three years. After \n     a peak in July 2000 of 17.3 million people employed by the \n     manufacturing sector, employment declined by more than 2.7 \n     million jobs over the next 38 consecutive months; and\n       Whereas, lowered demand due to troubled economic \n     conditions, coupled with unfair foreign competition, has \n     greatly hindered the economic prosperity of the manufacturing \n     industry. There is substantial concern over the continuation \n     of manufacturing in the United States if the unfair trade \n     practices of other nations on our domestic market are not \n     addressed; and\n       Whereas, the restoration and revival of the manufacturing \n     sector are vital to the economic recovery of the United \n     States, as manufacturing has consistently led the economic \n     recovery from previous down-turns; and\n       Whereas, maintaining a strong and vibrant manufacturing \n     industry is crucial to sustaining or enhancing our national \n     security. Recent bankruptcies and other losses in the \n     manufacturing industry could put the United States in the \n     unprecedented position where it must purchase defense \n     technology from other countries, as foreign companies \n     currently produce such items as a key guidance chip for smart \n     bombs. Most recently, a foreign company purchased a bankrupt \n     domestic manufacturer that retained the rights to the sleath \n     fighter technology; and\n       Whereas, developing a package of economic incentives to \n     help foster additional growth in the manufacturing industry \n     and assist in keeping domestic manufacturers competitive with \n     their foreign counterparts will greatly benefit not only the \n     manufacturing industry, but will also provide great economic \n     benefits to Michigan and the entire country: now, be it \n     therefore\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to develop economic incentives and other \n     programs to aid in the recovery and stabilization of the \n     manufacturing industry in the United States; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the United States Secretary of Commerce, \n     and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-368.

and\n       Whereas, approximately 47% of the nation's steelworkers are \n     employed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the states \n     of Ohio and Indiana; and\n       Whereas, more than nine out of ten steelworkers are \n     employed at establishments with 50 or more employees; and\n       Whereas, as of 2000, 40.3% of steelworkers were covered by \n     union contracts; and\n       Whereas, employment in the steel industry is expected to \n     decline by approximately 22% from 2000 through 2010; and\n       Whereas, employment levels will be influenced greatly by \n     the ability of United States steel producers to compete with \n     imports from foreign countries; and\n       Whereas, between 1997 and 2002, proliferation of illegally \n     dumped foreign steel in the United States economy has \n     resulted in approximately 35 steel companies filing for \n     bankruptcy and the loss of 54,000 industry jobs; and\n       Whereas, in June 2001, as a result of the crisis in the \n     domestic steel industry, the Federal Government and the Bush \n     Administration initiated a trade investigation under section \n     201 of the Trade Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-618, 19 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2101 et seq.), a safeguard clause that allows a domestic \n     industry injured by unfair trade practices to seek relief \n     through the International Trade Commission; and\n       Whereas, in March 2002, in response to a report by the \n     International Trade Commission that the American steel \n     industry had suffered serious injury based on the surge of \n     steel imports, the Bush Administration imposed three years of \n     declining tariffs ranging from 8% to 30% on imports of 13 \n     finished steel products and a three-year increasing tariff \n     rate quota on certain imports; and\n       Whereas, the Section 201 steel programs tariffs will \n     decline each year until they expire on March 6, 2005; and\n       Whereas, based on the Section 201 tariffs, the American \n     steel industry is experiencing its most significant \n     restructuring in decades and has been able to begin a process \n     of consolidation and reorganization; and\n       Whereas, steel prices are stabilizing, layoffs and \n     bankruptcy filings are slowing, prices are recovering, \n     domestic mills are increasing production and inventories are \n     healthy; and\n       Whereas, the actions taken by the American steel industry \n     as a result of the Section 201 tariffs will inure to the \n     long-term benefit of American steel-using industries, the \n     United States economy and the Pennsylvania economy; and\n       Whereas, Section 201 tariffs imposed must undergo a review \n     process at the midpoint of their duration; and\n       Whereas, the midterm review of the tariffs is designed to \n     help assess the effect of the tariffs and decide whether to \n     extend them for the full three-year term; and\n       Whereas, President Bush will determine whether the Section \n     201 tariffs should remain in effect; and\n       Whereas, the United States International Trade Commission \n     Report of September 19, 2003, which analyzed the preliminary \n     effects of the tariffs noted that, since the imposition of \n     the tariffs, industries producing steel products have \n     undergone major reconstruction and expansion and the assets \n     of several bankrupt steel producers have been acquired by \n     other firms; and\n       Whereas, since the imposition of the tariffs, steel \n     producers and the United Steelworkers of America, the \n     principal union representing steelworkers in the United \n     States, have negotiated groundbreaking collective bargaining \n     agreements and adopted principles designed to reduce fixed \n     costs, improve productivity and protect retiree welfare; and\n       Whereas, according to the report, approximately one-half of \n     the steel-consuming firms surveyed shifted some of their \n     purchases to domestically produced steel after the imposition \n     of the tariffs; and\n       Whereas, according to the report, almost two-thirds of the \n     responding steel-consuming firms reported that they or other \n     firms did not relocate or shift production to foreign plants \n     or facilities after tariff implementation; and\n       Whereas, it is evident from the report that the Section 201 \n     tariffs are contributing greatly to the revitalization of the \n     steel-producing industries in the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania and the nation; and\n       Whereas, on three separate occasions prior to the release \n     of the International Trade Commission's report, both Houses \n     of the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed resolutions \n     urging the President to maintain the Section 201 steel \n     tariffs for the full three-year term; and\n       Whereas, the International Trade Commission's report \n     reveals that the Pennsylvania General Assembly's earlier \n     support for continuing the Section 201 steel tariffs was \n     justified, prudent and in the best interests of the steel-\n     producing industry in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: \n     Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That based on the International Trade \n     Commission's report, the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania reaffirm its support for continuing the Section \n     201 steel tariffs until March 6, 2005, as the tariffs have \n     been instrumental in reshaping and reinvigorating the steel-\n     producing industries in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and \n     the nation; and be it further\n\n[[Page S2437]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania strongly urge the President and Congress of the \n     United States to continue to support the revitalization of \n     the American steel industry for the benefit of the citizens \n     of this nation and for the benefit of the national economy; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be submitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the Vice President of \n     the United States, to all members of the Congress who \n     represent districts in Pennsylvania and to the Governor of \n     the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-370. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to legislation to extend the production tax credit \n     for wind power energy development; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 88\n\n       Whereas, in an effort to foster the development of \n     alternate energy sources for the future, a production tax \n     credit for wind power energy development was established in \n     1992. In the years since that time, significant progress has \n     been made in the challenging work of developing clean sources \n     of power for our country; and\n       Whereas, the long-term strategy behind the production tax \n     credit for wind energy development has been impeded by the \n     fact that this federal program faces sunset provisions every \n     two years. Sunset provisions clearly are a productive tool to \n     ensure sound spending policies. However, in an extended \n     effort like developing viable wind energy technology, which \n     has enormous capital expenses, the requirement for renewal \n     every two years has proven to be counterproductive. Over most \n     two-year cycles, the amount of power added through wind \n     technology investment drops considerably in the second year, \n     as developers worry about whether the tax credit incentive \n     will be revived after it expires; and\n       Whereas, the production tax credit, like other incentives \n     that the government has provided throughout history to \n     encourage various development initiatives, would be far more \n     effective if it could be extended beyond the two-year period. \n     This emerging industry, which may one day be a key part of \n     America's overall energy needs, will make much more \n     significant advances with a consistent, multiple-year \n     approach: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to extend the production tax credit for wind \n     power energy development beyond the two-year cycle under \n     which it now operates; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-371.

An increasing number of our people cannot \n     afford the medications they need to live and function. This \n     situation is harmful not only to a large segment of our \n     population, but to our entire health care system; and\n       Whereas, since prescription medications contribute \n     significantly to public health by minimizing the need for far \n     more costly services, including hospitalization, the current \n     Medicare program is not nearly as effective as it could be in \n     helping our senior citizens protect their health and well-\n     being. The overall ramifications of this problem are \n     amplified by the realization that the first waves of baby \n     boomers are now reaching retirement age; and\n       Whereas, although health care is a challenge that includes \n     a wide range of factors, it is essential that a prescription \n     drug benefit be established within Medicare. For those men \n     and women currently grappling with the difficulties of paying \n     for medicines they need, adding this benefit will provide \n     immediate relief and help them maintain their health. For \n     their families and our entire country, this is a program that \n     needs to be put in place swiftly Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize Congress to enact legislation to establish a \n     prescription drug benefit within Medicare; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-372.

This has \n     resulted in financial losses and further exacerbated the \n     challenges faced by our manufacturers; and\n       Whereas, the World Trade Organization and the World \n     Intellectual Property Organization implemented a set of \n     standards and principles outlining how international \n     intellectual property rights should be applied and how to \n     settle disputes between members of the World Trade \n     Organization and the World Intellectual Property \n     Organization; and\n       Whereas, the United States can defend the intellectual \n     property rights of domestic business through the procedures \n     established by the World Trade Organization and the World \n     Intellectual Property Organization; and\n       Whereas, to ensure a vibrant economic recovery in Michigan, \n     our businesses and entrepreneurs must be secure in their \n     intellectual property, for it is through these innovations \n     that companies build their economic strength and maintain \n     their competitiveness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memoralize the Congress of \n     the United States to expand its efforts through the World \n     Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property \n     Organization to ensure that the intellectual property of \n     domestic businesses and individuals is protected and that \n     actions are taken against those countries that violate the \n     World Trade Organization and World Intellectual Property \n     Organization standards; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States of America, the President \n     of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the United States Secretary of \n     Commerce, and the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-373.

and\n       Whereas, Between 1997 and 2002, proliferation of illegally \n     dumped foreign steel in the United States economy resulted in \n     approximately 35 steel companies filing for bankruptcy and \n     the loss of 54,000 industry jobs;

and\n       Whereas, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Switzerland, China, \n     New Zealand and Brazil have joined Europe in welcoming the \n     World Trade Organization's ruling; and\n       Whereas, The Section 201 steel tariffs have provided the \n     Bush Administration with the leverage to negotiate a \n     resolution to the underlying structural problems of massive \n     global excess steel capacity and foreign government subsidies \n     that caused the import surge and prompted the imposition of \n     the steel safeguard; and\n       Whereas, Continuation of the Section 201 steel tariffs for \n     the full three-year duration, even in the face of retaliatory \n     sanctions from the European Union and other steel-producing \n     countries, would help restore market forces and level the \n     playing field in the global steel sector;

The increase \n     in the trade deficit with China alone, one of the countries \n     known for currency manipulation, represents about 15 percent \n     of the decline in United States production since 2000; and\n       Whereas, Article IV of the International Monetary Fund \n     Articles of Agreement states that members shall avoid \n     manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary \n     system in order to prevent effective balance of payments \n     adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over \n     other members.'' Under IMF surveillance procedures, a \n     principal indicator of such manipulation is ``protracted \n     large scale intervention in one direction in the exchange \n     market.'' Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to take the necessary actions, through the \n     International Monetary Fund or otherwise, to ensure that \n     foreign nations that trade with the United States do so \n     fairly and do not manipulate their currency; and be it \n     further RESOLVED, That a copy of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the United States \n     Secretary of Commerce, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-375. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; to the Committee \n     on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, In the interest of ensuring that children with \n     disabilities in the United States receive a free appropriate \n     public education, the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act (Public Law 91-230, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 et. seq.) \n     encroached upon the states' traditional domain over education \n     and established certain mandates that all state and local \n     governments must observe in the education of children with \n     special needs; and\n       Whereas, In recognition of the high cost of these Federal \n     mandates, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     allows the Congress to provide each state with a maximum \n     Federal grant equal to the number of children with \n     disabilities in the state multiplied by 40% of the average \n     per pupil expenditure for all special education students in \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Government has not provided sufficient \n     funding to pay for the costly mandates imposed by the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; and\n       Whereas, The Commonwealth's need for these increased funds \n     is urgent and immediate; and\n       Whereas, The Federal funding the Commonwealth currently \n     receives for each student with special needs is only the \n     equivalent of 12% of the national average per pupil \n     expenditure; and\n       Whereas, By this measure, the Federal Government \n     contributes only 12% of the total cost of special education \n     in this Commonwealth even though the Commonwealth and its \n     school districts must comply with 100% of the costly mandates \n     imposed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; \n     and\n       Whereas, These costs have been increasing rapidly in recent \n     years; and\n       Whereas, In this Commonwealth, even though the population \n     of students with special needs increased by less than 1% \n     between 1995 and 2000, the number of special education \n     instructors has increased by 14% to 14,547; and\n       Whereas, In the same period, the Commonwealth's \n     appropriations for special education have increased by over \n     25% in order to keep pace; and\n       Whereas, If the Federal Government would provide the level \n     of funding that the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act allows, the Commonwealth would have sufficient resources \n     to meet these growing needs; in fiscal year 2001-2002 it \n     would have received $605,000,000, an increase of \n     $421,544,956, or 229.78%, over the Federal funding the \n     Commonwealth received in fiscal year 2000-2001; and\n       Whereas, Because the Federal Government has failed to \n     provide the level of funding that the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act allows, it has placed a \n     disproportionate financial burden on the Commonwealth and its \n     school districts; and\n       Whereas, If the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     is to fully accomplish its mission to provide a free \n     appropriate public education to children with disabilities, \n     the Federal Government must provide State and local \n     governments with the funding they need to successfully \n     implement the act's mandates: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of Pennsylvania urge the Congress \n     of the United States to fulfill the commitment of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by taking \n     immediate action on legislation that would provide resources \n     equal to 40% of the national average per pupil expenditure \n     for special education students for each Pennsylvania student \n     with special needs: And be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     President and Vice President of the United States, to the \n     presiding officers of each house of Congress, to each member \n     of Congress from Pennsylvania, to the National Conference of \n     State Legislatures, to the National Governor's Association, \n     to the State Board of Education and to the Secretary of \n     Education.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-376. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan relative to unopened \n     prescription medications recovered from deceased patients; to \n     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 233\n\n       Whereas, there are a host of issues relating to the \n     difficult social, medical, and legal challenges of end-of-\n     life concerns. A significant source of confusion, at times, \n     are the procedures for prescribing and handling medications \n     for terminally ill patients, including drugs that are \n     governed by controlled substance laws; and\n       Whereas, one aspect of end-of life care that needs to be \n     resolved is how to handle prescription medications for \n     patients who have died. It is a common situation for there to \n     be prescriptions that are written and filled but unused. At \n     the present time, there are no provisions of federal law that \n     offer a means of returning unused and unopened medications in \n     a way that these expensive medicines can be dispensed and \n     used by another\n\n[[Page S2439]]\n\n     terminally ill patient. Each year, thousands of dollars worth \n     of prescription medications are wastefully discarded after a \n     patient dies. In many situations, the medicines could safely \n     be used for the benefit of others; and\n       Whereas, when medications, including those used by hospice \n     patients in the final stages of life, are still sealed in \n     tamper-evident containers that assure safety, there is little \n     reason to destroy the medication rather than dispensing it \n     again at no cost to a new patient beyond a handling fee. \n     Appropriate changes need to be made to federal laws and \n     regulations, including those that govern controlled \n     substances; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to amend \n     federal laws and regulations to address the issue of unopened \n     prescription medications recovered from deceased patients; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-377. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee relative to funding for \n     the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant; to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 110\n\n       Whereas, the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) was \n     enacted in the 2002 reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice \n     and Delinquency Prevention Act; and\n       Whereas, this grant provides dollars for use by states and \n     units of local government to promote greater accountability \n     in the juvenile justice system; and\n       Whereas, between 1998 and 2002, the State of Tennessee \n     received $20,757,000 in JABG funds for accountability-based \n     juvenile justice system programs; and\n       Whereas, rural counties across the State have received \n     funds to assist with juvenile court services and with \n     decreasing the backlog of juvenile cases; and\n       Whereas, the types of programs in Tennessee currently being \n     funded by the JABG include: (1) intensive probation services; \n     (2) residential observation and assessment services; (3) \n     intensive after-care services; (4) alternative school and \n     summer adventure-based programs; (5) additional juvenile \n     court officers and referees to handle cases; (6) improved \n     data systems for tracking juvenile cases; and (7) new youth \n     and drug courts for diversion from the regular juvenile \n     justice system; and\n       Whereas, because of the JABG funds, juvenile courts in \n     rural areas, which normally have minimal resources, now have \n     a greater variety of services to meet more individualized \n     needs; and\n       Whereas, because of the services enabled by the JABG funds, \n     juvenile offense referrals in Tennessee for crimes such as \n     homicide, robbery, aggravated assault, rape, larceny, and \n     burglary have been reduced by 16 percent between 1997 and \n     2001; and\n       Whereas, the JABG funds are providing for seven staff \n     positions and community-based services through OASIS Center, \n     YCAP Positive Beginnings program, Save Our Children and Frank \n     Reed Memorial Tutoring Program, all of which are community-\n     based youth serving non-profit agencies in Nashville, \n     Tennessee; and\n       Whereas, because of services provided by JABG funds, the \n     Metropolitan Nashville/Davidson County juvenile court's \n     central intake diversion unit was able to divert 1,700 youth \n     out of the juvenile justice system; and\n       Whereas, JABG funds are being used in Davidson County to \n     support an onsite mental health specialist in the juvenile \n     court, who facilitates intervention with the mental health \n     cooperative and provides the court with information on youth \n     who are acting in ways that warrant evaluation; and\n       Whereas, it is necessary to maintain JABG funds to continue \n     the success of reducing juvenile crime in Tennessee and \n     providing more individualized, accountability-based \n     interventions for youth involved with the juvenile courts; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the one hundred third general \n     assembly of the State of Tennessee, That the continued \n     success in the reduction of juvenile crime in Tennessee and \n     the increase of vital services provided to children who are \n     in the juvenile criminal system is dependent upon the renewal \n     of Juvenile Accountability Block Grant funds by the federal \n     government. Be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Senate strongly urges the United \n     States Congress and the President of the United States to \n     restore funding for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant \n     because of the tremendous value these funds provide for local \n     communities in Tennessee. Be it\n       Further resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Senate is \n     directed to transmit enrolled copies of this resolution to \n     each member of the Tennessee Congressional Delegation, to the \n     Honorable George W. Bush, President of the United States, to \n     the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and to the President and Secretary of the \n     United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2439-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. CAMPBELL, from the Committee on Indian Affairs, with \n     an amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       S. 1601.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to change the \neffective date for paid-up coverage under the military Survivor Benefit \nPlan from October 1, 2008, to October 1, 2004; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military \nSurvivors' Fairness Act of 2004, legislation to eliminate a major \ninequity that has existed for several years among certain year-groups \nof military retirees already enrolled in the Survivors' Benefit Plan.\n  In the interest of a strong national defense, it is critical that we \nkeep faith with the men and women who serve in our military. This \napplies both while military members are serving, and as they move \nbeyond their working years. Our military retirees and their families \nhave made significant sacrifices in the defense of their country. They \ndeserve benefits commensurate with those sacrifices.\n  In 1972, Congress created the Survivors' Benefit Plan (SBP), giving \ncareer military members the option of taking less retirement pay in \ntheir own lifetime in return for the continuation of that pay to the \nsurviving spouse, in the event the retiree pre-deceased his or her \nspouse.\n  SBP was a wise and important decision by the Congress; hundreds of \nthousands of military members have enrolled in SBP since 1972, and the \nprogram has given much-deserved security and peace of mind to those \nspouses who, along with military members, share the burdens of a \nmilitary career.\n  Congress expanded the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) in 1999, by \ncreating the ``Paid-Up Provision.'' Under that provision, retirees who \nare at least seventy years old and have already been paying into SBP \nfor at least thirty years are considered ``paid up'' and do not have to \ncontinue paying in to receive benefits.\n  This change provides a modest but frequently important boost to \nretirees' income at a stage in their lives, in their 70's, when they \nmay be less able to supplement their retirement income from other \nemployment.\n  However, there is a major caveat, and a significant inequity here. \nThe ``Paid-Up Provision'', under the 1999 legislation, does not take \neffect until October 2008. As a result, those who enrolled before 1978 \nwill continue under the current law to have to pay in as much as six \nyears longer than enrollees from 1978 or after.\n  The SBP program was created in 1972. An effective date of 2008 for \nthe SBP's ``Paid-Up Provision'' means that those who enrolled in the \nfirst six years of the program, i.e., between 1972 and 1977, must, in \norder to get the same retirement benefits, pay in longer, as much as \nsix years longer, than those who enrolled in 1978 or later.\n  In other words, those who signed up before 1978 get the same benefits \nbut have to pay a much higher price. This arrangement is unfair on its \nface and should be corrected.\n  My bill, the Military Survivors' Fairness Act of 2004, simply takes \nthe ``Paid-Up Provision''--already established by Congress in 1999, and \nmoves its effective date ahead four years, from October 1, 2008 to \nOctober 1, 2004. That is the only change it makes.\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\n  This bill, if approved, would benefit some ninety-two thousand \nmilitary retirees nationwide, those who enrolled in SBP between 1974 \nand 1977. The Military Officers Association of America has estimated \nthat the cost would be $2.7 billion over ten years.\n  Under my bill, ninety-two thousand military retirees participating in \nthe SBP program, from every State and congressional district, will no \nlonger be forced to pay more for their retirement than military \nretirees who enrolled in SBP in 1978 or later. This is only fair--the \nbenefits for which these 92,000 are paying are identical, and their \nservice was just as worthy.\n  The 1999 legislation establishing the ``Paid-Up Provision'' was a \ngood idea with the wrong effective date--it was given a 2008 effective \ndate because that Congress wanted to defer any budgetary impact. \nAccounting conventions and budgetary targets, however, should not \ndetermine whether we are going to keep faith with our military men and \nwomen. Any arrangement that treats them with any trace of unfairness or \nlack of appreciation for their service is not right, is not in our \nnational interest and should be fixed.\n  The Military Survivors' Fairness Act of 2004 is such a fix it--\ncorrects a significant inequity among an important group of military \nretirees, and I urge its adoption.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2177\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Survivors' Fairness \n     Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE FOR PAID-UP COVERAGE UNDER SURVIVOR \n                   BENEFIT PLAN.\n\n       Section 1452(j) of title 10, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking ``October 1, 2008'' and inserting ``October 1, \n     2004''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2180. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to exchange \ncertain lands in the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests in the \nState of Colorado; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today \nthat would effect a small land exchange to help the city of Golden, CO \nin its efforts to augment its water supply, that it might better \nprepare for a resumption of the drought which has plagued our State in \nthe past several years. The bill I am proposing would direct that the \nU.S. Forest Service complete a land exchange with the city of Golden at \nthe earliest possible date.\n  In the land exchange, the city would receive approximately 10 acres \nof National Forest land near Empire, CO. The city needs this land to \ncomplete construction of a 140-foot stretch of water pipeline \nconnecting the West Fork of Clear Creek with a brand new water storage \nreservoir, known as the Guanella Reservoir, which the city completed in \nDecember. The Guanella Reservoir will increase the city's existing \nwater storage capacity by approximately 40 percent, and better enable \nit to cope with future water shortages.\n  This legislation is critical, because while the Guanella Reservoir is \nnow completed, as is the diversion dam, penstock, and all but 140 feet \nof the connecting pipeline, the reservoir remains dry. In short, the \npipeline is completed up to the National Forest boundary, and \nauthorization is needed from either the Forest Service or Congress to \ncomplete the small remaining stretch of pipeline that must cross \nNational Forest land. Until that authorization is provided, the \nreservoir is sitting empty, and that is a situation we do not want to \nsee continued into the dry summer months. Unfortunately, the Forest \nService has indicated it would take quite some time, possibly several \nyears, to authorize the pipeline, and we have agreed with them that \nthis land exchange is the best approach to meet everyone's needs and \ntime frames.\n  For this reason, I am introducing this important legislation, and \nhave asked the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to expedite it \nin every way possible.\n  Additionally, I would like to note that while providing the city of \nGolden the ability to finish a critical water storage project, my \nproposal is also a beneficial deal for the United States. In return for \nthe 10 acres it will give up, the Forest Service will receive up to 80 \nacres of land near a popular trail and recreation area in Evergreen, \nCO, and will also receive 55 acres of land on and near the Continental \nDivide National Scenic Trail in Clear Creek and Summit Counties. The 55 \nacres are located along one of the most popular stretches of the Trail, \nand are one of the ways hikers and other users can access the popular \nGreys and Torreys Peaks, two of the most heavily-climbed 14,000 foot \npeaks in our State. Further, my bill provides that all land values will \nbe determined in accordance with Forest Service appraisal procedures, \nso we will be insuring that the United States will receive full market \nvalue for its land. In addition, the City is making a donation of \nContinental Divide Trail lands above which are required. I believe this \nis truly a ``win-win'' situation for all concerned, and commend the \nCity for making the additional donation to the Forest Service.\n\n  Finally, I would like to note that my proposal has been endorsed by \nthe County Commissioners of all three counties that have lands involved \nin the trade, the non-profit Continental Divide Trail Alliance, the \nCity of Blackhawk Public Works Department, the Georgetown Loop Scenic \nRailroad, and by numerous others.\n  Again, I would recommend this legislation for my colleagues' quick \napproval in order that the City of Golden can get on with its urgent \nneeds to supply adequate additional water to its residents this summer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2180\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Arapaho and Roosevelt \n     National Forests Land Exchange Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The exercise of \n     such right shall not require the City to secure any permit or \n     other advance approval from the United States. Upon \n     acquisition by the United States, such lands are hereby \n     permanently withdrawn from all forms of entry and \n     appropriation under the public land laws, including the \n     mining and mineral leasing laws, and the Geothermal Steam Act \n     of l970 (30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.).\n       (b) Conveyance by United States.--Upon receipt of \n     acceptable title to the non-Federal lands identified in \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     simultaneously convey to the City all right, title and \n     interest of the United States in and to certain Federal \n     lands, comprising approximately 9.84 acres, as generally \n     depicted on a map entitled ``Empire Federal Lands--Parcel \n     12'', dated June 2003.\n       (c) Equal Value Exchange.--\n       (1) Appraisal.--The values of the Federal lands identified \n     in subsection (b) and the non-Federal lands identified in \n     subsection (a)(1)(A) shall be determined by the Secretary \n     through appraisals performed in accordance with the Uniform \n     Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (December \n     20, 2000) and the Uniform Standards of\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\n     Professional Appraisal Practice.

A bill to adjust the boundary of Rocky Mountain National \nPark in the State of Colorado; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation that \nwould authorize the exchange of lands between the Muriel MacGregor \nTrust and the National Park Service, and to amend the boundary of Rocky \nMountain National Park to include the newly acquired land.\n  Rocky Mountain National Park was established by Congress on January \n26, 1915, for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United \nStates and to protect the natural conditions and scenic beauties of \nthis portion of the Rocky Mountains. The park currently encompasses \napproximately 266,000 acres and has some of the most beautiful mountain \nscenery to be found anywhere in our country. Each year the park draws \nover 3 million visitors.\n  The MacGregor Ranch, located near Estes Park, CO, was homesteaded in \n1873, which predates the establishment of Rocky Mountain National Park. \nIn 1917, shortly after the establishment of the national park, the \nNational Park Service built a residence for park employees just inside \nthe park boundary, with access via a one-lane dirt road which crosses \nthe MacGregor Ranch for about \\3/4\\ of a mile. This access was provided \nwith the permission of the MacGregor family, but no easement, right-of-\nway, or other legal document was ever recorded.\n  The MacGregor Ranch is listed on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces and is owned by the charitable Muriel MacGregor Trust. The \nmission of the trust is to support youth education through the \npreservation and interpretation of the historic buildings and \neducational tours of this working high mountain cattle ranch. In 1980, \nthe boundary of Rocky Mountain National Park was amended to include \nmuch of the MacGregor Ranch, and in 1983 the National Park Service \npurchased a conservation easement covering 1,221 acres of the ranch. \nWhile the ranch is located within the authorized boundary of the \nnational park, it remains private property.\n  In the early 1970s, hikers and rock climbers began using the access \nroad through the MacGregor Ranch to reach a small parking lot located \njust inside the park boundary. Known as the Twin Owls trailhead, the \npopularity of the area has grown steadily. In recent years, overflow \nparking has negatively impacted the ranch, and traffic on the one-lane \naccess road has negatively affected the character of the historic \nhomestead and has diminished the quality of the historic scene that \nvisitors to the ranch come to experience.\n  For several years, the National Park Service and the MacGregor Ranch \nhave been working to find a solution to the traffic and parking \nproblems. Several environmental assessments have been prepared to \nexamine various alternatives and gather public input. In 2003, based on \npublic input and an Environmental Assessment, the National Park Service \ndecided to relocate the Twin Owls parking lot to the east end of the \nMacGregor Ranch, some distance away from the historic homestead. A new \naccess road and a larger trailhead parking lot that can accommodate 80 \nto 100 cars will be built at the new location.\n\n  So that the rules and regulations governing Rocky Mountain National \nPark can be enforced at the new trailhead and along the access road, \nthe land needs to be incorporated into the national park. To accomplish \nthis, the MacGregor Trust and the National Park Service have agreed to \na land exchange. The National Park Service will acquire three parcels \nof land containing 5.9 acres from the MacGregor Trust for the \ndevelopment of the new parking lot and access road. In exchange, the \nMacGregor Trust will acquire up to 70 acres from the National Park \nService that will be used for\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\ngrowing hay and cattle grazing. A conservation easement will be placed \non the 70 acres that is transferred to the MacGregor Trust. The \nconservation easement will ensure that the property is used solely for \nranching.\n  The land exchange is intended to be an equal value exchange. One of \nthe three parcels currently owned by the MacGregor Trust is zoned for \nresidential development and has a high monetary value. A conservation \neasement will be placed on the 70 acres currently owned by the National \nPark Service, which will diminish its monetary value. If the lands \ncurrently owned by the National Park Service are of higher value, less \nthan 70 acres will be transferred to the MacGregor Ranch. If the three \nparcels owned by the MacGregor ranch are of higher value, the Ranch is \nwilling to accept the unequal value and will only receive a maximum of \n70 acres from the National Park Service.\n  This legislation is needed to authorize the land exchange, and to \namend the park boundary to include the new lands to be added to park.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2181\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rocky Mountain National Park \n     Boundary Adjustment Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Federal parcel.--The term ``Federal parcel'' means the \n     parcel of approximately 70 acres of Federal land near \n     MacGregor Ranch, Larimer County, Colorado, as depicted on the \n     map.\n       (2) Map.--The term ``map'' means the map numbered 121/\n     60,467, dated September 12, 2003.\n       (3) Non-federal parcels.--The term ``non-Federal parcels'' \n     means the 3 parcels of non-Federal land comprising \n     approximately 5.9 acres that are located near MacGregor \n     Ranch, Larimer County, Colorado, as depicted on the map.\n       (4) Park.--The term ``Park'' means Rocky Mountain National \n     Park in the State of Colorado.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to create \nteam nutrition networks to promote the nutritional health of school \nchildren; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Federal child nutrition programs have \nlong played a critical role in promoting healthy diets for American \nchildren. First conceived over 50 years ago in response to concerns \nabout the impacts of the diets of American youth on their fitness for \nthe armed forces, Federal child nutrition programs have since expanded \nand evolved to meet the needs of a diverse population.\n  However, alarming increases in obesity rates for children and \nadolescents indicate that we are not doing enough in terms of nutrition \neducation. The statistics are truly startling. Heart disease, cancer, \nstroke, and diabetes are responsible for two out of three deaths in the \nUnited States, and the major risk factors for those diseases and \nconditions are established in childhood through unhealthy eating \nhabits, physical inactivity, obesity, and tobacco use. In the last two \ndecades, obesity rates have doubled in children and tripled in \nadolescents, and today, one in seven young people are obese, and one in \nthree are overweight. Additionally, three out of four high school \nstudents in the United States do not eat the recommended five or more \nservings of fruits and vegetables each day. Finally, a recent report by \nthe Surgeon General estimated that obesity-related costs in the U.S. \nare close to $100 billion a year.\n  Unfortunately, nutrition education programs have been chronically \nunder-funded. We have authorized 50 cents for every child served \nthrough Federal child nutrition programs, which is equivalent to over \n$24 million. This amount refers not to 50 cents per day, per week, or \nper month--this is 50 cents per year! However, last year, the only \nnutrition education program specifically directed at our Nation's \nschool children, Team Nutrition, was funded at $10 million. This is \nequivalent to spending 21 cents a year on each child, a woefully \ninadequate amount. In addition, no funds were appropriated to nutrition \neducation programs specifically designed to help States implement Team \nNutrition materials.\n  The Early Attention to Nutrition (EATN) Act of 2004, which I am \nintroducing today together with Senators Lugar and Dodd, would raise \nthe total amount dedicated to nutrition education to $50 million a \nyear. The funds would be used by the USDA to develop Team Nutrition \nmaterials, and to support Team Nutrition Networks in the States. \nCurrently, only 21 States receive funding through Team Nutrition. This \nbill would allow all States to obtain Team Nutrition grants, and would \nfund a Team Nutrition Network in each State, which would be responsible \nfor disseminating and coordinating nutrition education initiatives. The \ngoal of the Team Nutrition Networks is to: instruct students with \nregard to the nutritional value of foods and the relationship between \nfood and human health; provide assistance to schools in the adoption \nand implementation of school policies that promote healthy eating; \nfoster community environments that support healthy eating and physical \nactivities; provide training and technical assistance to teachers and \nschool food service professionals consistent with this section; \nevaluate State and local nutrition education programs; disseminate \neducational materials statewide through the use of the Internet, \nmailings, conferences, and other communication channels; provide \nsubgrants to school and school food authorities for carrying out \nnutrition education activities at the local level; and provide \ninformation to parents and caregivers regarding the nutritional value \nof food and the relationship between food and health.\n\n  Now is the time to take action toward improving the health and well-\nbeing of our Nation's youth. The cost of improving the health of our \nchildren will be far less than the cost of the health consequences to \ncome if we do nothing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and two letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2183\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Early Attention To Nutrition \n     (EATN) Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes are \n     responsible for \\2/3\\ of deaths in the United States;\n       (2) the major risk factors for those diseases and \n     conditions are established in childhood through unhealthy \n     eating habits, physical inactivity, obesity, and tobacco use;\n       (3) obesity rates have doubled in children and tripled in \n     adolescents over the last 2 decades;\n       (4) today, 1 in 7 young people are obese, and 1 in 3 are \n     overweight;\n       (5) obese children are twice as likely as nonobese children \n     to become obese adults;\n       (6) an overweight condition and obesity can result in \n     physical, psychological, and social consequences, including \n     heart disease, diabetes, cancer, depression, decreased self-\n     esteem, and discrimination;\n       (7) only 2 percent of children consume a diet that meets \n     the 5 main recommendations for a healthy diet from the Food \n     Guide Pyramid published by the Secretary of Agriculture;\n       (8) 3 out of 4 high school students in the United States do \n     not eat the recommended 5\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\n     or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day; and\n       (9) 3 out of 4 children in the United States consume more \n     saturated fat than is recommended in the Dietary Guidelines \n     for Americans published by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n     SEC. 3.

ADA \n     believes that when fully funded this bill will provide \n     American children and their families with better nutrition \n     education, physical activity education, and an overall more \n     supportive environment that will help them develop healthy \n     eating and activity patterns for life.\n       The American Dietetic Association is the world's largest \n     food and professional association, and bases its work on \n     evidence-based science to make recommendations that can \n     promote optimal nutritional health and well-being. With that \n     commitment to the public, our members are particularly \n     pleased that this bill give due focus to nutrition education.\n       ADA supports the legislation's concept of the team \n     Nutrition Network. Once enacted, Congress will need to assure \n     funding for these programs so that they may genuinely \n     contribute to improved health for American children. Your \n     support for a funding level that would ensure that all 50 \n     states receive at least a minimum level of funding is highly \n     commendable and right on target as to what is needed. The \n     nutrition education programs funded by these grants should be \n     made available to both School lunch and breakfast sites as \n     well as the CACFP programs governed by the Child Nutrition \n     Act. Nutrition education and physical activity are key \n     components to promoting healthy lifestyles and must be \n     addressed across programs.\n       Thank you for introducing this very important legislation. \n     The ADA is pleased to endorse this important step toward \n     improving the health of our children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ronald E. Smith,\n     Director Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Center for Science in the\n\n\n                                              Public Interest,\n\n                                                    March 8, 2004.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Attention: Dr. Daniela Ligiero.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The Center for Science in the Public \n     Interest (CSPI) thank you for for your long-standing record \n     of leadership in promoting healthy eating among children. \n     CSPI is a nonprofit health organization specializing in \n     nutrition that has over 800,000 members and subscribers to \n     its Nutrition Action Healthletter. We are pleased to strongly \n     support your ``Early Attention to Nutrition Act.''\n       As obesity rates have doubled in children and tripled in \n     adolescents over the last two decades, the need for effective \n     nutrition education for children has become painfully \n     apparent. Your bill establishes a Team Nutrition Network that \n     would help educate children about the importance of healthy \n     eating to lifelong health. While the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture's current Team Nutrition education program has \n     been effective in helping states to develop innovative \n     nutrition education programs, it does not provide consistent \n     and reliable funding year-to-year, nor does it include a \n     central mechanism to facilitate information-sharing between \n     states on best practices and innovations. The Team Nutrition \n     Network that your bill would establish is needed as an \n     addition to the existing Team Nutrition program to develop \n     and deliver effective nutrition education programs and \n     activities in schools.\n       Again, CSPI applauds your efforts to help ensure that \n     schoolchildren are taught valuable skills for lifelong \n     healthy eating. We look forward to continuing to work with \n     you and your staff to promote children's health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Margo G. Wootan,\n                               D. Sc., Director, Nutrition Policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS:\n  S. 2185. A bill to simplify the process for admitting temporary alien \nagricultural workers under section\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\n101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, to \nincrease access to such workers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I introduce the Temporary Agriculture \nWork Reform Act of 2004.\n  American farmers are the most efficient farmers in the world. \nTechnologies have allowed farmers to produce higher quality products \nwhile increasing yields, and at the same time, reducing pesticide use. \nI applaud our farmers for their important role in our Nation's economy.\n  One obstacle that agriculture producers continually grapple with is \nlabor. For many years, migrant workers have been the main source of \nlabor for agriculture. In fact, today migrant workers make up about 56 \npercent of farm labor. A key issue for our American producers is having \nan efficient program to provide an agriculture workforce.\n  Reforms to the H2A program are warranted and needed. The program \nshould be user-friendly for both growers and workers with less \nbureaucratic hassle. The program should operate in such a way to ensure \nthat American producers can have their crops harvested in a timely \nfashion and that willing workers can get access to job opportunities. \nWe need a program that is easy to use and provides a stable, reliable \nworkforce for America's farmers.\n  My guest worker legislation reforms the cumbersome and uncompetitive \naspects of the H2A temporary agriculture worker program--without \nproviding amnesty to illegal aliens in the U.S. The bill gives farmers \nand workers a more functional program by simplifying the application \nprocess, providing a prevailing wage rate, and ensuring U.S. workers \nare not displaced.\n  The Adverse Effect Wage Rate, known by its acronym AEWR, has \nconsistently failed to provide competitive incentives for farmers to \nbecome users of the H2A program. Due to the current need for foreign \nworkers and job protections in place for domestic workers, the AEWR is \nno longer necessary. By replacing the AEWR with a prevailing wage rate, \nlegal workers will maintain a pay scale that is equal with their \ncounterparts.\n  The bill provides a labor attestation process to ensure that American \nworkers are not displaced. This labor attestation process replaces the \nburdensome labor certification process currently in effect, which too \noften causes delays that have a detrimental effect on the seasonal \nagricultural industry. A similar labor attestation process has worked \nwell for the H1B visa program, and I believe it can be used effectively \nfor the H2A program. The bill also mandates stiff penalties on \nemployers for misrepresentation and U.S. worker displacement. Bottom \nline, if a U.S. worker wants the job, under my bill he can have it.\n  But when foreign workers are needed, the bill encourages workers to \ncome to the United States through legal channels. A one-time waiver \nallows foreign workers to apply for the H2A program from their home \ncountry if that person is inadmissible to the U.S. due to prior \nauthorized entry--this will deter the cycle of illegal entry that \nendangers our national security. My bill does not provide amnesty or a \nnew way for illegal aliens to adjust to legal permanent resident status \nother than in accordance with current law.\n  Finally, the bill includes a few narrow provisions, including re-\nestablishing language that Congress has repeatedly passed on \nappropriations bills, to protect against frivolous lawsuits. Our \nfarmers should be providing for America's dinner table, not defending \nmeritless lawsuits.\n  There are a number of guest worker bills already introduced in the \nSenate, and in fact, my Subcommittee held the first hearing several \nweeks ago on the President's guest worker proposal. The bill I am \nintroducing today is a good first step to the kind of overall reform we \nneed. It meets our economic interests, protects U.S. workers, and \nrespects the rule of law without a broad amnesty for illegal aliens.\n  This legislation establishes a common sense and competitive H2A \nprogram so that these employers can continue to produce the highest \nquality food supply in the world. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to pass a much needed reform to the H2A program this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2186. A bill to temporarily extend the programs under the Small \nBusiness Act and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, through May \n15, 2004, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that \nkeeps the Small Business Administration and its financing and \ncounseling assistance available to small businesses. Small businesses \nneed us to act now to keep critical assistance available to our \nNation's biggest job creators.\n  There should not be any objections to this bill. It has broad support \nin the small business and the lending communities. The lending \nprovisions of the bill have the support of small borrowers that \ntestified before Congress over the past few weeks and the support of a \ncoalition of small business trade associations, including the trade \nassociations of 504 lenders and of 7(a) lenders, the American Bankers \nAssociation and the Independent Community Bankers Association, as well \nas the National Small Business Alliance and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and the women's business center provisions have the support \nof women's trade associations such as Women Impacting Public Policy and \nthe Association of Women's Business Centers.\n  This bill authorizes the SBA and most of its programs through the May \n15, 2004, which will allow time for the House to complete its work on \nthe SBA's 3-year reauthorization bill, passed by the Senate in \nSeptember 2003. In addition, this bill addresses several urgent issues \nthat are critical to keep SBA programs operating and helping small \nbusinesses across the country.\n  Let me outline these for you. The first provision authorizes the \ncontinued operation of the SBA's 504 loan guarantee program for the \nrest of fiscal year 2004. Unless we act, the authority to operate this \nprogram will expire on March 15, next Monday, and small businesses in \nneed of financing for fixed assets will be turned away. These loans are \nfor growing small businesses that need loans with long repayment terms \nand fixed interest rates to afford a new building or perhaps land to \nexpand their business and their workforce, or equipment to improve or \nincrease production. The lenders who make these loans serve a unique \nrole in our economy--they develop economic opportunities where \nconventional lenders are not willing to take a risk. They are not a shy \ngroup, and care deeply about the communities where they live. I am sure \nmost, if not all, Senators have received numerous calls and \ncommunications from them over the past few weeks. It is my hope that \nextending authorization will provide some stability to the industry so \nthat they continue to fund our growing businesses, and then in the near \nfuture, the House will consider our more comprehensive SBA \nreauthorization legislation, bill number S. 1375, that we passed in \nSeptember, to enact other important 504 program improvements that are \nsupported by the small business community. This loan program requires \nno appropriations because it is funded entirely by fees that borrowers \nand lenders pay.\n  The second provision keeps open the doors of our most experienced and \nsuccessful Women's Business Centers, again without added cost to the \nTreasury. This bill contains a small adjustment to the Women's Business \nCenter program that updates the current funding formula. The adjustment \nchanges the portion of funding allowed for women's business centers in \nthe sustainability part of the program to keep up with the increasing \nnumber of centers that will need funding this fiscal year. In short, \nthis change directs the SBA to reserve 48 percent of the appropriated \nfunds for the sustainability centers, instead of 30 percent, which will \ngive the most experienced centers the greatest opportunity to receive \nsustainability funding, while still allowing for new centers and \nprotecting existing ones.\n  Currently there are 88 women's business centers. Of these, 35 are in \nthe initial grant program and 53 will have graduated to the \nsustainability part of\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\nthe program. These sustainability centers make up more than half of the \ntotal women's business centers, but under the current funding formula \nare only allotted 30 percent of the funds. Without the change to 48 \npercent, all grants to sustainability centers could be cut in half--or \nworse, 23 experienced centers could lose funding completely. Cutting \nfunding for these, our most efficient and successful centers, would not \nonly be detrimental to the centers themselves, but also to the women \nthey serve, to their local communities, to their states, and to the \nnational economy.\n  As the author of the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of \n1999, I can tell you that when the bill was signed into law, it was \nCongress's intent to protect the established and successful \ninfrastructure of worth, performing centers. The law was designed to \nallow all graduating Women's Business Centers that meet certain \nperformance standards to receive continued funding under sustainability \ngrants. This approach allows for new centers to be established--but not \nby penalizing those that have already demonstrated their worth. It was \nour intention to continue helping the most productive and well-equipped \nwomen's business centers, knowing that demand for such services was \nrapidly growing.\n  Today, with women-owned businesses opening at one-and-a-half times \nthe rate of all privately held firms, the demand and need for women's \nbusiness centers is even greater. Until Congress makes permanent the \nWomen's Business Center Sustainability Pilot program, as intended in \nSenate-passed legislation, an extension of authority and increase in \nsustainability funds is vital--not only to the centers themselves, but \nto the women's business community and to the millions of workers \nemployed by women-owned businesses around the country.\n  The importance of the women's business centers to small business \nowners in communities across this country cannot be overstated. Take \nfor instance the story of Melanie Marsden and Shannon Lawler, who \nrecently opened A Better Place to Be Day Spa in Charlestown, MA. While \nworking on a business plan last summer, the two hopeful entrepreneurs \nhappened across the website of the Center for Women and Enterprise \n(CWE), a women's business center in Boston. Having just signed a lease \nand with a target opening for their spa quickly approaching, Melanie \nand Shannon were looking for help, and quick. At first, the process \nseemed overwhelming, but the experts at CWE were able to guide Melanie \nand Shannon through the complicated process--from business plan to \nlong-term financing and management. CWE helped Melanie and Shannon open \nA Better Place to Be Day Spa and already see a steady stream of clients \npass through their doors. Without CWE, Melanie and Shannon believe that \nthey would not have opened their business on time, or at all. Last year \nalone, women's business centers like CWE helped over 100,000 \nentrepreneurs just like Melanie and Shannon with their small business \nneeds. The majority of these women have few resources and little access \nto business development assistance, and without the women's business \ncenters, they might have none.\n  As I have said on more than one occasion, women business owners do \nnot get the recognition they deserve for the contribution to our \neconomy: Eighteen million Americans would be without jobs today if it \nweren't for these entrepreneurs who had the courage and the vision to \nstrike out on their own. For 19 years, as a member of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have worked to \nincrease the opportunities for these enterprising women, leading to \ngreater earning power, financial independence and asset accumulation. \nFor these women, in addition to the challenge and experience of running \ntheir own business, it means having a bank account, buying a home, \nsending their children to college, and being in control of their own \nfuture.\n\n  I want to again express my sincere and continuing support for the \ngrowing community of women entrepreneurs across the Nation and for the \ninvaluable programs through which the SBA provides women business \nowners with the tools they need to succeed. For years, I have fought \nfor increased funding for SBA assistance that helps women \nentrepreneurs, including measures that have sustained and expanded the \nWomen's Business Centers, and give women entrepreneurs their deserved \nrepresentation within the Federal procurement process.\n  The third provision makes temporary changes to the SBA's largest loan \nprogram, the so-called 7(a) program, in order to compensate for the \nadministration's budget gimmicks and program mismanagement that caused \na substantial shortage in funding. This shortage led to a temporary \nshutdown of the program in January, followed by lending restrictions \nthat created serious financial hardships for small businesses and \nreduced access to affordable capital for small businesses in general. \nFor the remainder of fiscal year 2004, a coalition of 7(a) lenders and \nsmall business groups have worked with Congress to come up with some \nlimited fees, paid by lenders and not borrowers, that will increase the \namount of lending available. That extra funding will increase from $9.5 \nbillion to more than $11 billion the amount of loan guarantees \navailable to small businesses. With more funding, Congress expects the \nSBA to lift the loan cap size of $750,000 and other restrictions, give \npriority in processing and approval to eligible small businesses that \nhave been shut out this year, and require the SBA to renew export \nworking capital loans to eligible small businesses.\n  Of course, these changes would not be necessary if the administration \nhad either requested adequate funding in its budget or used its \nauthority to reprogram money to compensate for the shortfall. It also \ncould have sent up a request for supplemental funding. On three \ndifferent occasions, I wrote to the administration urging these \nactions, with the support of Senators Levin, Harkin, Lieberman, \nLandrieu, Edwards, Cantwell, Bayh, and Pryor, urging any of these \nsolutions, but the administration refused to act. Instead, the \ninsufficient funding was compounded by mismanagement and the program \nwas completely shutdown from January 6 to January 14. When the \nadministration reopened the program, it was with extreme restrictions. \nThe restrictions were aimed at keeping the demand for the loans down \nwithout regard to their effect on the small businesses the Agency is \nintended to serve. Small businesses appealed to the administration and \nour committees for help because they were caught in the middle. For \nexample, one company in Pennsylvania has a $1 million export working \ncapital loan that needs to be renewed, but it can't because one of \nSBA's restrictions does not allow loans of more than $750,000. At risk \nis the home of one of the owners because it is part of the collateral \nsecuring the existing loan. This company is qualified; it's just \ntrapped by the SBA's restrictions. With your help in passing this bill \nimmediately, we can do the right thing for these small business owners \nand others who played by the rules. There is no cost to the Treasury in \nenacting these provisions.\n  Last, the fourth provision, addresses an urgent need for some firms \nin New York needing disaster loan assistance. Many have said we should \nwait until we address other SBA legislation in the next 60 days. \nHowever, hundreds of jobs are at stake and these businesses do not have \n2 months. This language is included at the bipartisan request of the \nHouse Small Business Committee leadership. Their staffs worked closely \nwith the SBA to develop this language, which is acceptable to all of \nthem. In addition to the support of House Committee Chairman Don \nManzullo and Ranking Member Nydia Velazquez, this provision is also \nsupported by Congresswoman Sue Kelly and Senator Charles Schumer.\n  All four provisions address circumstances that require immediate \naction. Let me remind everyone: Without this legislation, the SBA's \nloan program for growing businesses, commonly referred to as the 504 \nLoan Guarantee Program, would shut down next Monday, March 15, 2004. \nWithout this legislation, the future of counseling and training for \nwomen starting and growing their businesses, through the most \nestablished SBA's Women's Business Centers, would be compromised. \nWithout this legislation, small businesses with their homes and life \nsavings at stake may face financial and personal devastation because of \nprogram mismanagement. Without this\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\nlegislation, small business disaster victims may go out of business.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters relating to \nprograms affected by this legislation be printed in the Record. I thank \nmy colleagues for their support of small businesses and for considering \nimmediate passage of this important small business bill.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 A Better Place to Be Day Spa,\n\n                                                  Charlestown, MA.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: This past summer I had the opportunity \n     to work with the Center for Women & Enterprise when I was in \n     the beginning stages of writing a business plan for a small \n     day spa that had long been a dream. My business partner and \n     childhood friend and I were both born to working class \n     families and raised in Charlestown. I was educated in the \n     Boston Public School system and went on to attend Boston \n     University on one of their Boston Scholars full tuition \n     scholarships. While working full time after graduation, I \n     decided to enroll at the Muscular Therapy Institute in \n     Cambridge with the goal in mind of opening my own business \n     someday. My business partner held down a full time job and \n     attended The Elizabeth Grady School of Aesthetics in \n     preparation for our venture. While for many years we talked \n     about our dream, we know that making that dream become the \n     reality it is today, would not have been possible without \n     programs like the Center for Women & Enterprise and the Small \n     Business Administration.\n       For the last 2 years we had been keeping our eyes and ears \n     open about commercial space in Charlestown, which is not easy \n     to come by and generally not affordable. Our goal was to open \n     by May 2004 (when I will turn 30 and my partner will be 31). \n     We hadn't even begun the business plan writing when the ideal \n     location became available in August. The 1,500 square foot \n     commercial space is located at Mishuwam Park Apartments on \n     Maine Street in Charlestown which is an apartment complex \n     funded through the HUD Section 236 program and is managed by \n     Peabody Properties. We had to move quickly on the space and \n     before we knew it we had signed a lease and incorporated in a \n     matter of days. Our target opening date then became November \n     1st which didn't leave us much time to pull things together \n     but we didn't even know how overwhelming the whole process \n     might have been if we had not found the Center for Women & \n     Enterprise.\n       After contacting CWE, I received a call back within minutes \n     from Bea Chiem and she would prove to be an invaluable \n     resource to us during the following months. She took what was \n     very complicated and overwhelming for us and made it so much \n     easier to understand. Every time we would come to a part of \n     the financials that we thought we might never figure out, we \n     knew Bea was only a phone call away. I was most impressed by \n     her response time to each and every question I had. Her \n     patience, knowledge and belief in our vision played a major \n     role in us getting the financing we needed. CWE should be \n     proud to have such a caring and knowledgeable woman on the \n     team.\n       The closing on our loan with Sovereign finally took place \n     last week and we got a $60,000 term loan and the $40,000 line \n     of credit we requested from Sovereign through an SBA loan. \n     Shannon and I cannot thank the Center for Women & Enterprise \n     enough for all of their help. We have no doubt that without \n     CWE (and Bea) in our corner the financial institutions we \n     approached would not have taken us as seriously.\n       The way in which the center for Women & Enterprise reaches \n     out to help women in business inspired us to do the same. In \n     selecting suppliers and inventory for our gift shop within \n     the spa, we chose to carry products that were made by women \n     or by women owned businesses with a preference given to \n     Massachusetts or New England based businesses.\n       A Better Place to Be Day Spa, was received well by the \n     Charlestown community, we had 400 people at our grand opening \n     open house on November 1st and have a steady stream of \n     clients coming through our doors each day. And in the short \n     time we have been open we have seen many repeat clients \n     already. Our business got off to a great start because of the \n     Center for Women & Enterprise and as we continue to grow I \n     will be sure to let our clients know that A Better Place to \n     Be Day Spa is here because of the guidance we received from \n     the Center for Women & Enterprise and the support of the \n     Small Business Administration.\n       In closing I need you to know that what the Center for \n     Women & Enterprise and the SBA do for women in business is \n     truly incredible. I particularly enjoy the frequent \n     newsletters outlining upcoming events as well as educational \n     opportunities and workshops that I will be sure to take \n     advantage of in the future. A Better Place to Be Day Spa will \n     be represented at the upcoming State House Day and we will \n     continue to look for ways that we can give back to other \n     women in business through CWE.\n       Thank you.\n                                                  Melanie Marsden,\n                                                   Shannon Lawler,\n     Owners.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                        Women Business Owners,\n\n                                    Kansas City MO, March 9, 2004.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of the Kansas City chapter of \n     the National Assoc. of Women Business Owners (representing \n     200 members), I would like to request the following actions \n     be taken regarding the SBA 7(a) program.\n       Absent the SBA asking congress for additional funding, \n     NAWBO supports increasing fees on lenders as an approach to \n     adequately fund the SBA 7(a) program and to lift \n     restrictions.\n       Specifically, NAWBO would like the program to:\n       Allow piggyback loans, but charge a 0.50 percent lender fee \n     for each;\n       Raise lender fees by 0.10 percent; and\n       For loans that are under $150,000, have lenders pay the SBA \n     the 0.25 percent fee that lenders currently keep for \n     themselves. This only applies to these small loans.\n       Thank you.\n                                                  Elaine Hamilton,\n                                      Public Policy Chair.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2448-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2448-S2451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 312--COMMENDING THE BRAVERY OF THE INITIAL RESPONDERS \n      IN THE BALTIMORE HARBOR WATER TAXI ACCIDENT OF MARCH 6, 2004\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Sarbanes) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 313\n\n       Whereas many polls and studies have indicated that the \n     United States needs to do a\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\n     better job of building personal and institutional \n     relationships with peoples and nations around the world in \n     order to combat anti-American sentiment;\n       Whereas broad bipartisan consensus in favor of \n     strengthening United States public diplomacy emerged during \n     2003 in both Houses of Congress and in various reports, \n     including reports of the Council on Foreign Relations, the \n     General Accounting Office, the Advisory Commission on Public \n     Diplomacy, the Heritage Foundation, and the Advisory Group on \n     Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World;\n       Whereas in November 2003, NAFSA: Association of \n     International Educators warned that Americans' lack of \n     knowledge of the world represents a national liability in the \n     fight against terrorism;\n       Whereas international exchange programs, which have \n     assisted in extending American influence in the world by \n     educating the world's leaders, are suffering from a decline \n     in funding and policy priority;\n       Whereas the number of United States university-level \n     students studying abroad in 2001-2002 was 160,920, \n     representing just over 1 percent of United States students;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of United States students studying abroad \n     study in Western Europe (18.7 percent in the United Kingdom \n     alone), although 95 percent of the world population growth in \n     the next 50 years is expected to occur outside Western \n     Europe;\n       Whereas the number of scholarships for foreign students \n     studying at United States institutions has dropped from \n     20,000 a year in the 1980s to 900 in 2003;\n       Whereas there are 29,400,000 retired workers in the United \n     States as of June 2003, meaning that there are many older \n     Americans who have the talent, maturity, and time to \n     volunteer their services abroad;\n       Whereas the average American college graduate who has \n     studied 1 of the less commonly taught languages reaches no \n     more than an intermediate level of proficiency in the \n     language, which is insufficient to meet national security \n     requirements; and\n       Whereas there are hundreds of well-established \n     organizations in the United States that implement educational \n     and professional exchanges, international volunteering, and \n     related programs, and the efforts of those organizations \n     could readily be expanded to reach out to more Americans: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This resolution may be cited as the ``People-to-People \n     Engagement in World Affairs Resolution''.\n\n     SEC. 2 SENSE OF SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to urge the Secretary of State to coordinate with \n     implementing partners in creating an online database that \n     provides information on how Americans can take advantage of--\n       (A) international exchange programs of the Department of \n     State, the Department of Education, and other Federal \n     Government and non-government entities;\n       (B) volunteer opportunities with organizations that assist \n     refugees and immigrants in the United States;\n       (C) opportunities to host international students and \n     professionals in the United States;\n       (D) sister-city organizations in the United States;\n       (E) international fairs and cultural events in the United \n     States; and\n       (F) foreign language learning opportunities;\n       (2) to challenge Americans to become more engaged in \n     international affairs and more aware of peoples and \n     developments outside the United States; and\n       (3) to encourage Americans to seize 1 or more opportunities \n     toward this end, by such means as--\n       (A) participating in a professional or cultural exchange;\n       (B) studying abroad;\n       (C) volunteering abroad;\n       (D) working with an immigrant or refugee group;\n       (E) hosting a foreign student or professional;\n       (F) participating in a sister-city program; and\n       (G) learning a foreign language.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit the People-to-\nPeople Engagement in World Affairs resolution with my esteemed \ncolleague, Senator Chuck Hagel.\n  In the 1960s, during a troubled and divisive time for our country, \nPresident John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to ``ask not what your \ncountry can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.'' Today, \nthe need is even more urgent for Americans to be active participants \nboth in the United States and abroad.\n  This People-to-People Engagement in World Affairs resolution is a \ncall to Americans to look beyond our borders to engage with the wider \nworld at an individual, human level. It encourages Americans to seize \nopportunities to engage in the global arena--through participating in a \nprofessional or cultural exchange; studying or volunteering abroad; \nworking with an immigrant or refugee group in the United States; \nhosting a foreign student or professional; participating in a sister-\ncity program; and/or learning a foreign language.\n  It also asks the Secretary of State to coordinate with implementing \npartners in creating an online database that lists these opportunities \nfor Americans.\n  In today's world, our challenges and opportunities are global in \nnature. Terrorism, the greatest threat to our national security, \ncrosses all national boundaries and feeds off the gaps in intelligence \nand communication created by borders. Other important issues, such as \nthe proliferation of WMD, human trafficking, poverty, environmental \ndegradation, and diseases from HIV/AIDS to polio also have little \nregard for borders. These challenges require international cooperation, \nand Americans at all levels of society are instrumental in finding and \nachieving meaningful solutions.\n  This resolution encourages Americans to forge relationships with \npeople outside of the United States to change not only how Americans \nview and act in the world, but how others view Americans. Presently, \nanti-Americanism is growing at a startling rate. According to the Pew \nResearch Center, negative views of the United States among Muslims, \nwhich were once limited to the Middle East, have spread to populations \nin places like Nigeria and Indonesia. A growing percentage of Muslims \nsee serious threats to Islam by the United States. Majorities in seven \nof eight Muslim populations surveyed express worries that the U.S. \nmight become a military threat to their countries. And these disturbing \ntrends hold strong even beyond the Muslim world.\n  This is dangerous for a number of reasons. Anti-Americanism \nundermines our ability to work effectively with other countries on our \nglobal problems. In addition, in our fight against terror, anti-\nAmericanism can create a steady supply of recruits for terrorist \nnetworks, intent on our destruction. These terrorist networks have \nunfairly blamed the United States for the unemployment, the poverty and \nthe powerlessness that so many around the world experience on a daily \nbasis. They feed off erroneous perceptions of Americans, distorting our \nimage to achieve their own objectives.\n  Americans must combat these misperceptions and turn mistrust into \nunderstanding. If we don't define ourselves to the people of the world, \nwe run the risk that terrorist will continue to make America a \nscapegoat for other nation's ills. In order to show the world who \nAmericans really are, diplomacy must occur at all levels of society and \nnot only through U.S. government representatives. Artists, scholars, \nteachers, nurses, doctors, and business people all have a role in \nshaping this image and in presenting a different American face to the \nworld.\n  Many Americans have been engaged for decades. In my own State of \nWisconsin, my constituents have demonstrated altruism and curiosity \ndaily. They have worked in the Peace Corps, trained dairy farmers in \nSouth America and Eastern Europe, participated in sister-city exchanges \nwith the former Soviet Union, traveled to refugee camps in Thailand and \nhosted international students. Through these activities, my \nconstituents have fought stereotypes and created openings for greater \ntrust and cooperation. The need is greater now than ever before for \nmore Americans to become involved.\n  I have been approached by Americans of all ages and all economic \nbackgrounds to ask me how they can become more involved. This \nresolution is a response to those Americans and a challenge to many \nmore to define our times and to shape our world. The creation of the \nonline database as part of this resolution will assist Americans in \nfinding the best way for them personally to participate. Americans will \nuse their enthusiasm and curiosity to engage in the world where they \ncan--through tutoring children, through assisting refugees who come to \nour country, through professional training, and through showing concern \nfor the well-being of other outside of the United States.\n  This resolution is a challenge to Americans to make connections in \ntheir own way--to listen and show respect for others and their way of \nlife. Americans can bridge the gap between\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\nthis powerful nation and people around the world who feel frustrated \nand powerless. We can change perceptions, change minds, and change the \nworld we live in.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 314--COMMEMORATING AND HONORING PRESIDENT BORIS \n                               TRAJKOVSKI\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Biden) submitted the \nfollowing resolution which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 316\n\n       Whereas only 26 percent of 13- to 21-year olds reported \n     that their parents actively taught them how to manage money;\n       Whereas a 2002 survey by the National Council on Economic \n     Education found that a decreasing number of States include \n     personal finance in their education standards\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\n     for students in kindergarten through grade 12;\n       Whereas a 2002 study by the Jump$tart Coalition for \n     Personal Financial Literacy found that high school seniors \n     know even less about credit cards, retirement funds, \n     insurance, and other personal finance basics than high school \n     seniors did 5 years ago;\n       Whereas 55 percent of college students acquire their first \n     credit card during their first year in college, and 83 \n     percent of college students have at least 1 credit card;\n       Whereas personal savings as a percentage of personal income \n     decreased from 7.5 percent in the early 1980s to 2.3 percent \n     in the first 3 quarters of 2003;\n       Whereas today more than 42,000,000 people in the United \n     States participate in 401(k) plans;\n       Whereas a 2002 Retirement Confidence Survey found that only \n     32 percent of workers surveyed have calculated how much money \n     they will need to save for retirement;\n       Whereas only 30 percent of those surveyed in a 2003 \n     Employee Benefit Trend Study are confident in their ability \n     to make the right financial decisions for themselves and \n     their families, and 25 percent have done no specific \n     financial planning;\n       Whereas between 25,000,000 and 56,000,000 adults are \n     unbanked, i.e., not using mainstream, insured financial \n     institutions;\n       Whereas millions of people in the United States derive \n     great benefits from the wide variety of products and services \n     offered by the financial services industry in the United \n     States, and such financial products and services allow \n     individuals and families to build homes, start businesses, \n     finance educations, buy cars, and meet the everyday needs of \n     everyday life;\n       Whereas expanding access to the mainstream financial system \n     provides individuals with lower cost, safer options for \n     managing their finances and building wealth;\n       Whereas a greater understanding and familiarity with \n     financial markets and institutions will lead to increased \n     economic activity and growth;\n       Whereas financial education has been linked to lower \n     delinquency rates for mortgage borrowers, higher \n     participation and contribution rates in retirement plans, \n     improved spending and saving habits, higher net worth, and \n     positive knowledge, attitude, and behavior changes;\n       Whereas financial literacy empowers individuals to make \n     wise financial decisions and reduces the confusion of an \n     increasingly complex economy;\n       Whereas personal financial management skills and life-long \n     habits develop during childhood;\n       Whereas personal financial education is essential to ensure \n     that individuals are prepared to manage money, credit, and \n     debt, and become responsible workers, heads of households, \n     investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and citizens; and\n       Whereas Congress found it important enough to ensure \n     coordination of Federal financial literacy efforts and \n     formulate a national strategy that it established the \n     Financial Literacy and Education Commission in 2003 and \n     designated the Office of Financial Education of the \n     Department of the Treasury to provide support for the \n     Commission: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2004 as ``Financial Literacy Month'' \n     to raise public awareness about the importance of financial \n     education in the United States and the serious consequences \n     that may be associated with a lack of understanding about \n     personal finances; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, \n     and the people of the United States to observe the month with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 97--RECOGNIZING THE 91ST ANNUAL MEETING OF \n                       THE GARDEN CLUB OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. SARBANES (for himself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 97\n\n       Whereas The Garden Club of America is holding its 91st \n     annual meeting in Washington, D.C. April 24 through 27, 2004;\n       Whereas The Garden Club of America has 195 member clubs in \n     40 States and the District of Columbia, representing more \n     than 17,000 members;\n       Whereas since its founding in 1913, The Garden Club of \n     America has become a recognized leader in the fields of \n     horticulture, conservation, historic preservation, and civic \n     improvement, and an influential organization in the \n     protection of America's environment; and\n       Whereas in our Nation's Capital, The Garden Club of America \n     was instrumental in the founding of the National Arboretum, \n     the development of the Archives of American Gardens at the \n     Smithsonian Institution, and the creation and installation of \n     the Butterfly Habitat Garden which now graces The National \n     Mall at the National Museum of Natural History: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress commends The Garden Club of \n     America for the many contributions it has made in our \n     Nation's Capital and in communities across the United States, \n     and sends its best wishes on the occasion of its 91st annual \n     meeting in Washington, D.C., April 24 through 27, 2004.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am submitting legislation \ntogether with Senator Mikulski that would recognize the achievements of \nThe Garden Club of America on the occasion of its 91st annual meeting \nin Washington, DC, from April 24 through 27, 2004. This meeting in our \nNation's Capital is especially significant because it occurs here only \nonce every twenty-five years. This legislation recognizes and honors \nThe Garden Club and the work of its 17,000 members to improve our \ncountry.\n  Since its founding in 1913, The Garden Club of America has grown to \ninclude 195 member clubs in 40 States and the District of Columbia. It \nis a recognized leader in the fields of horticulture, conservation, \nhistoric preservation, civic improvement, and has significant influence \nin the protection of America's environment.\n  Right here in the District of Columbia we can witness the results of \nThe Garden Club's labor. Indeed it played an instrumental role in the \nfounding of the National Arboretum and the development of the Archives \nof American Gardens at the Smithsonian Institution.\n  Perhaps even more importantly, The Garden Club has become a \nsignificant impetus for community service across the United States. The \nscope of The Garden Club of America goes well beyond its numerous \npublications, its public plant and flower shows, and its national \nmedalists. It is a source for the exchange of ideas and a platform for \nthe betterment of our communities across this great country. The \npurpose of The Garden Club of America is to stimulate the knowledge and \nlove of gardening, but also to share the advantages of association \nthrough educational meetings, conferences, correspondence, and \npublications, and to improve the quality of the environment through \nconservation and civic improvement.\n  As a Marylander I know first hand of the contributions The Garden \nClub of America has made to our State. Ladew Topiary Gardens is a prime \nexample of the edification and enjoyment that stems from the support of \nThe Garden Club of America. Since 1971, Ladew Gardens has used its 22 \nacres of gardens to educate children, entertain families, and promote \nthe importance of beautiful landscapes within our communities. Every \nspring and summer, hundreds of families congregate in the gardens to \nenjoy the Sunday concerts, afternoon picnics, and self-guided \neducational nature walks. And every year, hundreds of families leave \nthe gardens with an exhilarated appreciation for America's outdoors, \nand an enriched desire to conserve that beauty.\n  The Garden Club of America has asked for very little in return for \nits dedication to America's beautiful landscapes. I am submitting this \nlegislation today in the hope that we in the Congress can recognize \nthis significant contribution as The Garden Club of America holds its \nannual meeting here in our Nation's Capital. I urge my colleagues in \nthe Senate to join me in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2451-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2451-S2452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2703.

Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Levin, \nand Mrs. Clinton) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill S. 1637, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \ncomply with the World Trade Organization rulings on FSC/ETI benefit in \na manner that preserves jobs and production activities in the United \nStates, to reform and simplify the international taxation rules of the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the \ntable; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                   TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 501. NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING CURRENCY VALUATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The currency of the People's Republic of China, known \n     as the yuan or renminbi, is artificially pegged at a level \n     significantly below its market value. Economists estimate the \n     yuan to be undervalued by between 15 percent and 40 percent \n     or an average of 27.5 percent.\n       (2) The undervaluation of the yuan provides the People's \n     Republic of China with a significant trade advantage by \n     making exports less expensive for foreign consumers and by \n     making foreign products more expensive for Chinese consumers. \n     The effective result is a significant subsidization of \n     China's exports and a virtual tariff on foreign imports.\n       (3) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     intervened in the foreign exchange markets to hold the value \n     of the yuan within an artificial trading range. China's \n     foreign reserves are estimated to be over $350,000,000,000 as \n     of September 2003, and have increased by over \n     $110,000,000,000 in the last 12 months.\n       (4) China's undervalued currency, China's trade advantage \n     from that undervaluation, and the Chinese Government's \n     intervention in the value of its currency violates the spirit \n     and letter of the world trading system of which the People's \n     Republic of China is now a member.\n       (5) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     failed to promptly address concerns or to provide a \n     definitive timetable for resolution of these concerns raised \n     by the United States and the international community \n     regarding the value of its currency.\n       (6) Article XXI of the GATT 1994 (as defined in section \n     2(1)(B) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. \n     3501(1)(B))) allows a member of the World Trade Organization \n     to take any action which it considers necessary for the \n     protection of its essential security interests. Protecting \n     the United States manufacturing sector is essential to the \n     interests of the United States.\n       (b) Negotiations and Certification Regarding the Currency \n     Valuation Policy of the People's Republic of China.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding the provisions of title I \n     of Public Law 106-286 (19 U.S.C. 2431 note), on and after the \n     date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, unless a certification described in paragraph (2) has \n     been made to Congress, in addition to any other duty, there \n     shall be imposed a rate of duty of 27.5 percent ad valorem on \n     any article that is the growth, product, or manufacture of \n     the People's Republic of China, imported directly or \n     indirectly into the United States.\n       (2) Certification.--The certification described in this \n     paragraph means a certification by the President to Congress \n     that the People's Republic of China is no longer acquiring \n     foreign exchange reserves to prevent the appreciation of the \n     rate of exchange between its currency and the United States \n     dollar for purposes of gaining an unfair competitive \n     advantage in international trade.

If at \n     the end of the 180-day period the President determines that \n     China has developed and started actual implementation of a \n     plan to revalue its currency, the President may delay \n     imposition of the tariffs for an additional 12 months, so \n     that the People's Republic of China shall have time to \n     implement the plan.\n       (4) Negotiations.--Beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \n     the United States Trade Representative, shall begin \n     negotiations with the People's Republic of China to ensure \n     that the People's Republic of China adopts a process that \n     leads to a substantial upward currency revaluation within 180 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act. Because various \n     Asian governments have also been acquiring substantial \n     foreign exchange reserves in an effort to prevent \n     appreciation of their currencies for purposes of gaining an \n     unfair competitive advantage in international trade, and \n     because the People's Republic of China has concerns about the \n     value of those currencies, the Secretary shall also seek to \n     convene a multilateral summit to discuss exchange rates with \n     representatives of various Asian governments and other \n     interested parties, including representatives of other G-7 \n     nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2456-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 314) commemorating and honoring \n     President Boris Trajkovski.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, on Thursday, February 26, 2004, \nPresident Boris Trajkovski of Macedonia, whom I have known for many \nyears, was tragically killed when a plane carrying him and eight others \ncrashed in southern\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\nBosnia. His death is a tragic loss not only for his family and those \nwho knew him well, but for the people of Macedonia, the broader region \nof Southeast Europe, and, I believe the world at large.\n  I rise today to express my condolences and deep sympathy to the \npeople of Macedonia, the family of President Trajkovski, and the \nfamilies of the eight others who were killed. I submit a resolution, \ncosponsored by Senator Lugar and Senator biden, which honors the memory \nof President Boris Trajkovski and recognizes the significant \ncontributions he made as President of Macedonia.\n  President Trajkovski was a principled man, a courageous leader, and \nsomeone that I have come to call a friend since I first met him during \na visit to Stankovic refugee camp in Macedonia in 1999. His leadership \nwas instrumental following the crisis in Kosovo in 1999, as Macedonia \nworked with the international community to meet the needs of thousands \nof refugees fleeing the neighboring province. President Trajkovski's \ndeep respect for human rights and commitment to the rule of law played \na significant role in the signing of the Ohrid Framework Agreement in \n2001, which successfully secured peace in the country following an \noutbreak of violence earlier that year. Following the signing of the \npeace accord, he remained committed to the implementation of the \nagreement--a process that continues today.\n  I have had the privilege of visiting with President Trajkovski \nregularly during the last several years, when I traveled to Macedonia \nin May 1999, February 2000, and again in May 2002, and on several \noccasions when he traveled to Washington, DC--often in conjunction with \nthe National Prayer Breakfast. An ordained minister in the Methodist \nChurch, President Trajkovski was a man of faith, principle, and \ncharacter, and his leadership will be greatly missed as Macedonia \ncontinues to move toward membership in Europe's democratic \ninstitutions.\n  I extend my heartfelt condolences to President Trajkovski's wife, \nVilma, his children, Sara and Stefan, and the people of Macedonia. \nWhile Boris Trajkovski will be sorely missed, he leaves a legacy of \ncourageous and principled leadership, progress, and commitment to \ndemocratic reform that put Macedonia on a path toward membership in \nNATO and the European Union. That legacy lives on.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution, which \nhonors the life of a man deeply committed to working toward a peaceful \nand prosperous future for the people of Macedonia and Southeast Europe.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table \nen bloc, and any statements relating to the resolution be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 314) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 314\n\n       Whereas President Boris Trajkovski of the Former Yugoslav \n     Republic of Macedonia played a vital role in efforts to \n     promote peace, stability, and democratic reform in his \n     country and throughout Southeast Europe;\n       Whereas President Trajkovski was tragically killed on \n     Thursday, February 26, 2004, when a plane carrying the \n     President and 8 others crashed in southern Bosnia;\n       Whereas the people elected Boris Trajkovski to serve as \n     President in November 1999, and inaugurated him as the second \n     Macedonian President on December 15, 1999;\n       Whereas President Trajkovski led the country during a \n     tumultuous period in Southeast Europe, working with the \n     international community to accommodate refugees following the \n     crisis in neighboring Kosovo in 1999, and playing a \n     significant role in the signing of the Ohrid Framework \n     Agreement in 2001;\n       Whereas President Trajkovski promoted the rule of law and \n     respect for human rights, and encouraged economic, judicial, \n     and military reforms necessary to move the country toward \n     membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the \n     European Union; and\n       Whereas the Macedonian government continues to work to join \n     Europe's democratic institutions, and peace and stability in \n     the country is critical to the broader region of Southeast \n     Europe: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) offers its condolences and deepest sympathy to the \n     people of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the \n     family of President Boris Trajkovski, and the families of the \n     other crash victims during this difficult period;\n       (2) recognizes the courageous leadership and the \n     significant role that President Trajkovski played in efforts \n     to promote peace, stability, and reform, including his work \n     to secure the 2001 Ohrid Framework Agreement; and\n       (3) encourages the Macedonian government to continue \n     efforts to implement the Ohrid Peace Agreement, and to move \n     forward with reforms necessary to join the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization and the European Union.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2457-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2457-S2459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 315, submitted \nearlier in the day by Senators Biden, Lugar, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 315) designating March 8, 2004, as \n     ``International Women's Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceed to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support this resolution commemorating an \nextraordinary holiday, International Women's Day; a day that is \ncelebrated around the globe to mark women's achievements and to \nrecognize pressing gender inequities still to be erased.\n  There is no doubt that women have made tremendous strides toward \nequality and justice in the last century. International Women's Day \nprovides an important chance to acknowledge women who have pioneered \nchange and paved the way for millions of women and girls to access \nequal education, employment and opportunity. On the other side of the \ncoin, International Women's Day provides an opportunity for us to make \na new ``to-do'' list and highlight what remains to be done, both at \nhome and abroad.\n  Women's rights, or lack thereof, in the Middle East and South Asia \nassumed special prominence in the days and weeks after the tragic \nevents of September 11. Americans became familiar with the Taliban's \nhorrendous repression of Afghan women and girls. Two years after the \nUnited States removed the Taliban from power, Americans watched as the \nAfghan loya jirga, or grand council, met to adopt a new constitution--\nan opportunity to debate and create enforceable women's rights. Yet it \nremains to be seen whether the country's constitution establishes \ntangible improvements to the plight of Afghan women. In a similar vein, \nthe fall of Saddam Hussein has given Iraqi women an opportunity to \nengage in public life and seek equal rights. Indeed, the interim Iraqi \nconstitution sets aside 25 percent female participation in the interim \ngovernment. But the challenges to women's rights in that region of the \nworld abound, ranging from engrained religious and cultural norms to \npoverty from years of strife. I am convinced, however, that lasting \nstability and representational government depends upon the emancipation \nand full participation of women in the Middle East and South Asia. \nInternational Women's Day is a chance for us to reiterate that message, \nin those regions and around the world, that empowering women is the key \nto lasting peace and prosperity. And to that end, the United States \nshould provide critical resources to help support and empower women and \ngirls around the globe--an articulated priority to this administration, \nbut as of yet an unmet goal.\n  A fitting tribute to International Women's Day would be ratification \nof the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination \nAgainst Women, also known as the International Women's Rights treaty. \nIt sets out basic women's rights--such as the right to an equal \neducation and the right to own and inherit property. These rights are \nwell settled in the United States, but unfortunately, they are not the \nnorm in too many places around the globe. The treaty is stalled because \nof the administration's interminable treaty ``review.'' After first \ntelling the Committee on Foreign Relations that it supported the \ntreaty, it has commenced a review of the treaty that has now lasted \nnearly 2 years. To\n\n[[Page S2458]]\n\ndate, 174 countries have become party to the treaty. The United States \nstands with the likes of Iran, Afghanistan, Syria and Sudan as those \nfew countries that have yet to become a party. This is not the company \nthat our country--the place where the women's movement began--should \nkeep. An administration that cares about the promotion of women's human \nrights should declare its unwavering support for the International \nWomen's Rights treaty.\n\n  International Women's Day is also a perfect time for my Senate \ncolleagues to recognize and address the plight of refugee women. I urge \nthem to show their support for the Women and Children in Armed Conflict \nProtection Act of 2003, the ``Protection Act'', S. 1001. There are \nnearly 20 million people homeless today because of war and internal \nconflict--and the majority of them are women and children. A tragic \nirony is that women and kids who find their way into refugee camps \nsometimes face abuse and exploitation in the very place that is \nsupposed to provide security and safety. The Protection Act of 2003 \nrequires the United States government to develop a comprehensive \nstrategy to protect women and children in all stages of conflicts, and \nsets out specific codes of conduct for agencies running refugee camps. \nIn addition, the bill supports a variety of programs that are providing \nhelp to women in war-torn countries, programs that range from tracing \nlost relatives to providing legal aid for rape survivors. Most \nimportantly, the bill backs up all of its directives with money--$45 \nmillion per year--money that can make a real difference to women in \nsuch extreme crisis.\n  According to Government reports, some 800,000 to 900,000 people are \ntrafficked across international borders worldwide to be enslaved as \nsweatshop workers, prostitutes, agricultural workers, or domestic \nservants--up to 20,000 of them are trafficked into the United States. A \nrecent New York Times Magazine article profiled the gory details of sex \ntrafficking in America's towns and suburbs. The Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act is the first Federal legislation that attacked head-on \nthe very serious crime and aftermath of human trafficking. The \nlegislation is wide in scope, tackling among other items, Federal \npenalties for trafficking, international ramifications for trafficking \nand the immigration needs of trafficking victims. But there remains \nmuch to be done. I want to make sure that we have provided law \nenforcement all of the legal tools and financial resources they need to \ngo after criminals who engage in trafficking. I want to find out if \ncriminal penalties--both here and abroad--are sufficient to deter \ntraffickers. I want to explore if there are innovative things which can \nbe done with extradition and witness protection to encourage fearful \nvictims and witnesses to come forward to help make these cases. Women \nand girls are overwhelmingly the victims of trafficking. Stepping up \nour attention to this crime means speaking up for international women's \nrights--a perfect endeavor on International Women's day.\n  I will close my remarks on International Women's Day with a topic \nthat my fellow Senators know animates me--ending violence against \nwomen. One in three--that is how many women worldwide are raped, beaten \nor sexually abused in their lifetime. Violence against women is the \nquintessential global issue. It strikes in wealthy and poor countries, \nravages war-torn countries and peaceful ones alike, and plagues \ndisparate cultures. In a nationwide poll, women in the United States \nrecently named domestic violence as their number one concern--number \none. Guaranteeing women safety and immediate accountability for \nviolence is the first step towards creating equal opportunities in the \npublic realm--it is the sock that must go on before the shoes. Our \nattention and efforts to eradicate violence against women must not \nwane, and indeed, we need to redouble our efforts. Our International \nWomen's Day and every other day, women all over the world deserve \nnothing less.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this year marks the 95th anniversary of \nNational Women's Day and the 93rd anniversary of International Women's \nDay. Since the first decades of the 20th century, when women in the \nUnited States, Western Europe, and Russia fought for the right to vote, \ntremendous progress has been made in advancing women's rights. \nUnfortunately, many women here at home and abroad still suffer.\n  In the last year, through America's increased involvement in foreign \ncountries, our attention has been drawn to both the gains and \nshortcomings in the advancement of women's rights. In Afghanistan, \nalthough more girls are attending school than ever before in the \ncountry's history, tremendous security concerns remain. In rural areas \nespecially, many women and girls choose to remain indoors because they \nare frequently targeted by armed warlords. This makes it impossible for \nthem to attend school, go to work, or actively participate in the \ncountry's reconstruction.\n  Afghan women are also concerned with the widespread prevalence of \nforced marriage, and rape. In some cases, girls as young as 8 years old \nare forced into marriage with much older men. Although I am glad to see \nthat the new Afghan constitution guarantees equal rights for all, I \nrecognize the difference between putting high ideals down on paper and \nputting them into practice. Women's programs in Afghanistan have not \nbeen funded at proposed levels and it is unacceptable.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have been a \nstrong supporter of Afghan aid, especially for women. I worked very \nhard to include an amendment to provide $60 million for Afghan women's \nprograms in the fiscal year 2004 Iraq/Afghanistan supplemental \nappropriations bill, because it is of the utmost importance that women \nplay an active role in the country's political and economic \nreconstruction.\n  In Iraq as well, we must demand that the promises made to women \nbecome a reality. The interim constitution sets a 25 percent quota for \nwomen in the transitional assembly, and the preamble of the document \nmakes clear that Iraqis are equal without regard to sex, sect, religion \nor other considerations. However, this is far removed from what women's \ngroups initially asked for. The 25-member Iraqi Governing Council has \nonly three women members, only one women sits in the Iraqi Cabinet, and \nof the 18 provincial governors, none are women. This has resulted in a \nvast shortage of women from all the decision-making bodies in the new \nIraq.\n  In addition to following through with our commitment to women in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, we must also do a better job of drawing attention to \nthe other millions of women around the globe who suffer from legal and \npolitical discrimination, domestic violence, inadequate medical care, \nilliteracy, and other social injustices.\n  The worldwide theme for International Women's Day this year is \n``Women and HIV/AIDS.'' This is because the disease is having an \nincreasingly devastating impact on females. Throughout the world, girls \nand young women now make up nearly two thirds of those below the age of \n24 living with HIV, and new infections are rising fastest among married \nwomen infected by their husbands.\n  In order to stem this trend, women must be involved in the solution. \nThis will involve providing women with better education and better \nhealthcare. The U.N. properly recognizes that no enduring solution to \nany of society's social, economic and political ills can be found \nwithout the full participation, and the full empowerment of women.\n  In Africa alone, poor healthcare and poor education among women is \none of the greatest challenges to development. Because women are the \nprimary caretakers of children and the elderly, families face an \nadditional burden when mothers are in poor health and poorly educated. \nUnfortunately, it has taken a global pandemic to remind us how \nimportant it is to support education and healthcare improvements for \nwomen.\n  Domestic violence is another enormous problem facing women. Not only \nabroad, but here at home as well, countless women are the targets of \nbrutality simply because of their gender. The impact of domestic \nviolence toward women is profound and it is often overlooked.\n  The World Health Organization asserts that domestic violence causes \nmore deaths and disabilities among women between ages 15 and 44 than \ncancer, malaria, traffic accidents, and\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\nwar. Every day, thousands of women are made to be victims of rape, \ngenital mutilation, sexual assault, honor killings, sexual trafficking, \nfemale infanticide, forced sterilization, and forced abortion. These \nthings are very unpleasant to talk about, and for most of us, their \noccurrence is hard to comprehend. Many ask, how is it possible that in \nthis age of technology and global communication, so many still suffer \nfrom the barbaric practices of the past?\n  As a global leader, the United States has a responsibility to bring \nattention to these types of questions, because progress can only be \nmade by recognizing and addressing the unfortunate realities that still \nexist. In the upcoming year, as the international community seeks to \nrebuild Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as bring stability to other \ntenuous parts of the world, let us renew our focus on the importance of \nadvancing the causes of women.\n  Today, as we recognize International Women's day, I am reminded of \nthe inscription on the Women's Suffrage Monument in the Capital \nRotunda. The inscription reads:\n\n       Principle not policy, Justice not Favor, Men, their rights \n     and nothing more. Women, their rights and nothing less.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent the resolution and preamble be \nagreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and \nany statements be printed in the Record without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 316, submitted earlier in the day by \nSenators Akaka, Allen, Sarbanes, Corzine, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 316) designating April 2004 as \n     ``Financial Literacy Month.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am in support of this resolution \ndesignating April, 2004, as Financial Literacy Month, and asking the \nPresident to issue a proclamation calling on the Federal Government, \nStates, localities, schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, other \nentities, and the American people to observe the month with appropriate \nprograms and activities. I thank Senators Allen, Sarbanes, Corzine, \nSantorum, Kohl, Thomas, Johnson, Kennedy, Schumer, Levin, Lautenberg, \nMurray, Landrieu, Durbin, Inouye, and Crapo for standing with me in \nadvancing financial and economic literacy for our entire citizenry.\n  Last year, the Senate designated April, 2003, as Financial Literacy \nfor Youth Month by adopting my resolution, S.Res. 48, to highlight the \nneed for increased financial and economic literacy and education in our \ncountry. Since then, there has been wider recognition that we need to \nbroaden the spotlight to include problems resulting from pervasive \nfinancial illiteracy among adults of all ages as well, no matter in \nwhich region of the country they live, in which sector of the economy \nthey work, or for which side of the aisle they vote. All of us know at \nleast one person in our lives who has suffered the sometimes tragic and \noften unavoidable results of not knowing how to create and stick to a \nbudget,\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\nnot understanding the merits of maintaining good credit history, or not \nhaving the analytical skills to make decisions based on factors in the \neconomy.\n  We are witness to the cumulative results of these individual \ndecisions. Consumer debt rose at a greater rate than was expected in \n2003, increasing to nearly $2 trillion in September, 2003, as noted by \nthe Federal Reserve. The rate of foreclosures for FHA loans was the \nhighest ever recorded in the third quarter of 2003, according to the \nMortgage Bankers Association National Delinquency Survey. The \nCongressional Research Service reports that the percentage of income \nused for household debt payments, including mortgages, credit cards, \nand student loans, rose to the highest level in more than a decade in \n2001 and remained above 13 percent in 2003. Also, that personal savings \nas a percentage of personal income decreased from 7.5 percent in the \nearly 1980s to 2.3 percent in the first three-quarters of 2003. As \nreported in the Associated Press, personal bankruptcies nearly doubled \nin the past decade, including more than 1.6 million people who filed \nfor personal bankruptcy in fiscal year 2003. And a final sign of our \ntimes, despite technological advances that make it even more convenient \nand less costly to manage our money through accounts at banks and \ncredit unions, Fannie Mae reports that between 25 million and 56 \nmillion adults are `unbanked', or not using mainstream, insured \nfinancial institutions. All of this tells me that we cannot overlook \nour adult population and their need for financial literacy and \neducation.\n  Even so, prevention remains key, and education lies at the heart of \nprevention. We must continue to work in our schools to convey important \nand practical lessons personal finance and economics, so that our \nstudents may leave secondary and postsecondary, and even elementary \neducation, with age-appropriate tools and skills that they may continue \nto hone throughout their lives. In addition to learning and practicing \nthe essential basics in reading, writing, and arithmetic, they should \nunderstand how they can do their part toward helping their families \nstick to the budget constructed on the kitchen table, saving toward \ntheir college tuition, or helping to identify future opportunities that \nwill benefit everyone in their families in the long run.\n\n  As an example, the Hawaii Council on Economic Education, with \nassistance from the Securities Education Division within the Hawaii \nDepartment of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, is sponsoring the Hawaii \nStock Market Simulation, which is an interactive tool to help students \nlearn about how the U.S. financial market system works. By gaining an \nunderstanding of the securities markets, students in third grade \nthrough twelfth grade can learn about the importance of saving and \ninvesting to help provide a sound economic and financial base for their \nown future. Student teams invest a hypothetical $100,000 in stocks, \nbonds, and mutual funds and compete statewide. Last year, I met with \nsome of the winning teams who, in the short 10-week period, raised the \nvalue of their portfolio to as much as $130,273.49--an amount \naccomplished by a team from Kalani High School. In the Fall 2003 \ncompetition, a team from Keaau High School achieved a portfolio value \nof $129,930.42. Even in the elementary division in the most recent \ncompetition, a team from Moanalua Middle School invested successfully \nfor a portfolio of $117,877,73. This is just one example of the types \nof competitions held around the country that gets kids excited in \ninvesting and saving while cautioning them about speculation, pulling \ntheir parents and other family members into the exercise, and give them \nthe tools to analyze their own personal finance decisions, well into \ntheir adult years.\n  Support for economic and financial literacy efforts in our schools is \na worthwhile investment for our country to make in our future \ngenerations. I am highlighting this point in this resolution, as well \nas working to provide more resources through the Excellence in Economic \nEducation Act for K-12 education--rather than terminating this program \nas President George W. Bush recommended in his fiscal year 2005 budget, \nand working with my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, to strengthen \nthis investment in our students in colleges and universities through \nour bill, S. 1968, the Financial Literacy in Higher Education Act.\n  And once again, economic and financial literacy must reach adults in \nthis country, particularly to help those who are heads of households, \nworkers, and business owners plan for short- and long-term investment, \nsavings, and retirement, as well as avoid the grasp of predatory \nlenders that peddle products such as high-interest Refund Anticipation \nLoans, high-cost remittances, payday lending, and abusive financial \nmarketing practices. I call to the attention of my colleagues the \nestablishment of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission, and \nlook forward to its development of a national strategy that will \ncoordinate Federal efforts in financial and economic literacy. I also \nrecognize the efforts of organizations such as the Jump$tart Coalition \nfor Personal Financial Literacy, the National Council on Economic \nEducation, and others on the forefront of this movement for their \nparallel endeavors.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in commemorating all of \nthese efforts to forward financial and economic literacy in this \ncountry by recognizing April 2004 as Financial Literacy Month, and I \nurge that they support this resolution.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent the resolution and preamble be \nagreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and \nany statements be printed in the Record without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 316) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, Senator Bennett provided a view of the \neconomy and the status of the jobs recovery. Let me give an alternative \nview as to what he discussed.\n  In looking at the jobs record of this President, what I see is that \nhe is the first President who has lost private sector jobs in the last \n70 years. I know it disturbs our colleagues to refer to the last \nPresident who lost private sector jobs, who was Herbert Hoover.\n  In making that statement, we are not saying the economy is in the \nsame status as during the Great Depression. Obviously, that is not the \ncase. Joblessness in the Hoover administration was approaching 25 \npercent of the workforce. That is not the case today. But it is an \naccurate statement to say this is the first President in 70 years who \nhas lost private sector jobs. It is also true that something is \nhappening in this recovery unlike anything we have seen in recoveries \nsince World War II.\n  If we look at the average of the nine recessions since World War II, \nthat is the dotted red line on this chart. This chart shows months \nafter business-cycle peak on the bottom. What this shows is on average \nafter 17 months, after the business-cycle peak, you start to see very \nstrong job recovery. Here we are in this recession, 36 months past the \nbusiness-cycle peak, and we are still not seeing meaningful job \nrecovery. Something very different is happening. In fact, we are 5.4 \nmillion jobs short of a typical recovery. Something is wrong. Something \nis not working.\n  This shows the private sector job decline, and it shows 3 million \njobs have been lost since January of 2001 when this President came into \noffice. That is a fact.\n\n  This chart shows that we are also facing the longest average duration \nof unemployment in over 20 years; that is, when someone loses their \njob, it is taking them longer to find a new job than at any time in the \nlast 20 years. Again, I think it is telling us this recovery is \nfundamentally different, and there is something wrong in the economy.\n  We also see we have the smallest share of the population at work \nsince 1994. It is true we have millions of people at work. It is also \ntrue it is the smallest share of the population in a decade. Again, \nthis is a recovery that is very unlike previous recoveries.\n  When we look at real wages, we go back to 1996, the last 4 years of \nthe Clinton administration. We saw real wages increasing substantially. \nSince President Bush has taken office, we have seen real wages \nbasically flat.\n  The President in his economic report in February of this year told us \nwe could expect 2.6 million more jobs in\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\n2004 than in 2003. For that prediction to come true, 520,000 jobs would \nhave to be created per month. In the most recent month of February, \nonly 21,000 were created. That is 500,000 jobs short of meeting the \nprojection that was made on February 9 by the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers. Again, something is radically wrong.\n  I might say every one of those 21,000 jobs was in Government. They \nwere Government jobs, and not a single job was created in the private \nsector in the month of February.\n  If we look historically--this is from the New York Times of today, \n``Promises, Promises,'' an article by Paul Krugman, a noted economist \nwho went back and looked at what the administration has said would \nhappen with jobs--these are administration forecasts. In 2002, the \nadministration said we could expect 138.3 million jobs by 2005. In \n2003, they said, whoops, that 138 million jobs is not going to come \ntrue. Instead, we are predicting 135.2 million jobs by January of 2005. \nIn this year, they said, whoops again. Forget about not only 138 \nmillion jobs but forget about 135 million jobs as well. Instead, we are \nprojecting 132.7 million jobs by January of 2005.\n  You can see where we are. We are at 130.2 million jobs. That is 8 \nmillion jobs below what the administration said would happen. They have \nbeen wrong. It is simple fact. They have been wrong, and they have been \nwrong by a big margin.\n  Senator Bennett talked about the deficit. He acknowledged the deficit \nis now the largest it has been in dollar terms in our history. That is \nobviously the case. The deficit this year is expected to be $477 \nbillion. That is $100 billion more than last year and last year was a \nrecord. He is right, in dollar terms, this is the biggest deficit we \nhave ever had.\n\n  But then Senator Bennett said as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduction, this deficit is lower than others we have seen--at least \nsome of the others we have seen. That is where he and I would have a \ndisagreement.\n  He showed the unified deficit as a share of GDP. That is very \nmisleading. We have to look at the deficit and exclude Social Security \nfrom the calculation. When we do that, what we see is this deficit as a \nshare of GDP is nearly equal to what we had in 1983 and it is the \nbiggest deficit we have had going back all the way to World War II as a \npercentage of GDP.\n  Why the difference between my interpretation, my analysis of deficit \nas a share of the economy, and his? Very simply, he includes Social \nSecurity; I exclude it. Why? Go back to 1983. There was virtually no \nSocial Security surplus. It was several hundred million dollars. It was \nbetween $200 and $300 million--million with an ``M.'' This year, the \nSocial Security surplus is $160 billion. If we are analyzing our fiscal \ncondition, if we are analyzing where we are on an operating basis the \nway any company would, we do not throw the retirement funds of the \nemployees into the pot. Those are excluded. That gives the real \noperating deficit. As I say, as a percentage of GDP that is the second \nbiggest since World War II, only exceeded by the very substantial \ndeficits we had in 1983.\n  Going forward, the President says, yes, these deficits have been very \nlarge. But, he said, do not worry; they will get better. He said, we \nwill cut the deficits in half in the next 5 years.\n  No, we are not. The only way he gets to that conclusion is he leaves \nout things. He leaves out the cost of the war. He has no cost for the \nwar past September 30 of this year. No cost for the war in Iraq, no \ncost for the war in Afghanistan, no cost for the war against terror. \nDoes any person believe the right answer to those costs past September \n30 of this year, which is the end of the Federal fiscal year, is zero? \nThe Congressional Budget Office says that is not the right answer. They \nsay the right answer is $280 billion, the cost of the war, residual \ncost over the next 10 years.\n  When we add ongoing war costs and take out Social Security, we are \nlooking at an operating basis for the Federal Government, and we \ninclude the need to fix the alternative minimum tax, the old \nmillionaires' tax that is swiftly becoming a middle-class tax trap, we \nsee virtually no progress, virtually none is being made at reducing the \noperating deficit of the United States, not only for the next 5 years \nunder the President's plan but over the next 10 years. This is what to \nme is by far the biggest concern.\n  Yes, we ought to be worried about the biggest deficit in our history \nthis year. Frankly, deficits after a period of our being attacked, \nafter a period of economic downturn, should not be too surprising. What \nis alarming, what should worry us, are the massive sustained deficits \non an operating basis for as far as the eye can see with no improvement \neven when the President is forecasting strong economic recovery. All of \nthis is happening at the worst possible time, right before the baby \nboomers retire.\n  If we look at the debt of the United States, not just focus on the \ndeficits--that is the annual difference between what is spent and what \nis taken in, that is the deficit, the debt is the accumulation of those \ndeficits--what we see with the gross debt of the United States under \nthe President's plans with his tax cuts, with the additional war cost \nthe CBO tells us we will face, and the need to take on this alternative \nminimum tax crisis because it is becoming a middle-class tax trap, we \nsee what is happening. It is taking off like a scalded cat. This is \nreality talking. This is facts. This is where this is all headed. It \ndoes not add up.\n\n  What about the disappearance of that surplus, what is responsible for \nit? The Senator from Utah put up a chart that said 24 percent or 25 \npercent of the disappearance of the surplus is tax cuts. That is not \nwhat we find. When we look at the period of 2002 to 2011, which is the \nperiod when we had the first of the President's tax cuts, for that 10-\nyear-period, 33 percent of the disappearance of the surplus--remember, \nthey were projecting a $5.6 trillion surplus for that period and that \nhas now turned into a $3.5 trillion deficit--there is a turnaround, in \na negative sense, of $9.1 trillion. Our fiscal condition deteriorated \nby $9.1 trillion in the flash of an eye, in 3 years. Thirty-three \npercent of that disappearance is due to tax cuts.\n  The difference may be between the chart he showed and the chart I \nshow that I have included the debt service, the effect of the \nadditional interest we will have to pay because of the tax cuts and, \nappropriately, that cost ought to be assigned to the tax cuts. \nObviously, if we have less revenue, we have more debt, and that means \nwe have more interest payments. Mr. President, 30 percent of the \ndisappearance is technical changes. Eight percent is economic downturn. \nSenator Bennett put these two categories together and called it \nweakness in the economy and technical changes and then attributed--in \nhis chart it was 40 percent--it to weakness in the economy.\n  No, no, no, no. No, no, that is not right. Eight percent of the \ndisappearance of the surplus is weakness in the economy. Thirty percent \nis technical changes, mostly lower revenue, not as a result of tax cuts \nbut as a result of the mechanical devices that are used to project \ndeficits, that are used to project revenue being wrong.\n  The various models, the econometric models that are used to predict \nrevenue, have been wrong. They have overestimated revenue, not because \nof tax cuts but because the models were wrong. That has accounted for \n30 percent of the disappearance of the surplus.\n  Again, Senator Bennett put up a chart that put these two together--\nweakness in the economy and technical changes--and then attributed the \n40 percent to weakness in the economy. That is five times the result of \nweakness in the economy. Weakness in the economy only accounted for 8 \npercent of the downturn.\n  Other legislation is 29 percent; that is, increased spending. His \nanalysis and ours is pretty close on increased spending.\n  But where did the increases occur? Ninety-one percent of the increase \nin spending occurred in three areas: national defense, homeland \nsecurity, and the response to the attacks of September 11--rebuilding \nNew York, the airline bailout. Those three categories--defense, \nhomeland security, and the response to the attacks of September 11--\naccount for 91 percent of the increase in spending, and the increase in \nspending accounts for 29 percent of the disappearance of the surplus.\n  So the fact is, the tax cuts are the biggest single reason, for the \n10-year\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\nperiod, for the disappearance of the surplus.\n  Again, what is most alarming is where this is all headed. This is not \nmy chart. This is from the President's own budget analysis. What it \nshows is that the next 10 years is really the budget ``sweet spot.'' It \nis the budget ``sweet spot'' even though we are running record budget \ndeficits, the biggest in our history. But the President says if you \nadopt his spending plan and his tax plan, these are the good times, \nthat it is going to get much more serious when the baby boomers start \nto retire and the full effects of the President's tax cuts are phased \nin. Then you can see the President's policies are going to take us \nright over the cliff into massive deficits and debt, unlike anything we \nhave seen before. That is his projection of where his policies are \nleading.\n  Well, we do not just have to rely on his projections because they \nhave been wrong repeatedly. The Congressional Budget Office is telling \nus exactly the same thing. This is their long-term forecast of what \nhappens under the President's policies--his tax cuts, fixing the \nalternative minimum tax, his spending policies. This is what they say \nis going to happen.\n  This is where we are now. These are records: the biggest deficits, in \ndollar terms, we have ever had. This is where we are headed, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, if we adopt his policies--a sea of \nred ink. That is what we face as a nation under the President's \npolicies.\n  Now we look at Federal spending and Federal revenue because it is \nthat relationship that determines what happens to deficits.\n  This chart shows what has happened to Federal spending as a \npercentage of gross domestic product. Senator Bennett referred to using \na percentage of gross domestic product as an appropriate measure of \nlooking at debt and deficits. I agree because it takes out the effect \nof inflation so you can see real comparisons over time for Federal \nspending and Federal revenue.\n\n  What this shows us is, by 2001, we had gotten down to 18 percent of \ngross domestic product going for Federal spending, down sharply from \nwhere we were in the 1980s and the 1990s. In fact, you can see, in the \nClinton administration, President Clinton came in right here, and every \nyear thereafter spending, as a percentage of GDP, went down. I think \nthis is counterintuitive to many people, but under a Democratic \nPresident, Federal spending went down each and every year of his \nadministration measured against the national income.\n  President Bush came in, and we have had a spike up in spending. \nAgain, 91 percent of that increase has gone for defense, homeland \nsecurity, and a response to the attacks of September 11. Still, if you \nproject out this level of spending, what you see is we are still well \nbelow the spending of the 1980s and 1990s.\n  But let's look at the revenue side for the other side of this coin. \nThat is where we see a fairly stark picture. You can see that the \nrevenue side is where the whole Federal fiscal condition has collapsed. \nRevenues, as a percent of GDP for this year, are projected to be at the \nlowest level since 1950. Now look at that.\n  When President Bush came into office, we were at a high level of \nrevenue as a share of GDP. In fact, he used that as a reason to cut \ntaxes. He said, revenue is at a record level as a share of GDP, and \nthat told him we ought to cut taxes. But look at where we are now. We \nare now at a record low, the lowest revenue has been since 1950. And \nhis answer: Cut taxes some more.\n  It does not matter what the question is, his answer is the same. And \nI think any rational person, looking at this objectively, would say: \nWhat do we have to do to dig out of this? We have to restrain spending. \nWe have to get more revenue to balance this budget. Balancing this \nbudget is critically important before the baby boomers start to retire \nand increase the spending even more, and, unfortunately, under the \nPresident's plan, before the revenue dips even more because he is \nproposing deep tax cuts that explode in cost at the same time the baby \nboomers' cost to the Government increases.\n  Finally, Senator Bennett talked about the tax cuts as being the \nreason the economy is in recovery. I don't agree that that is the \ncorrect analysis. There are two things Government can do to affect the \neconomy. One is monetary policy. That is money supply, interest rates; \nthat is under the purview of the Federal Reserve. The other element of \neconomic policy that can be affected by the Federal Government is \nfiscal policy, the taxing and spending decisions by the Congress and \nthe President.\n  First of all, I would say the biggest reason for the economic \ncomeback is monetary policy. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted a \nvery accommodative monetary policy, the lowest interest rates in 40 \nyears. That gives enormous lift to the economy. That is, I believe, \nreason No. 1 for the economic comeback.\n  No. 2 would be the business cycle. We have seen for a very extended \nperiod the economic history of the country. When you have a slowdown, \nyou have an automatic recovery as the business cycle proceeds. We have \nseen typically 17 months after a business cycle peak, when you have a \nrecession, you start to see very strong job growth and recovery. In \nthis particular recovery, we have seen very weak job growth, even \nthough we are 36 months past the business cycle peak. Nonetheless, \nbusiness cycle is clearly the key reason for the rebound and stimulus.\n  Certainly, stimulus through tax cuts and Government spending has also \ngiven lift to this economy. After all, we have run nearly a trillion \ndollars in deficits in just the last 2 years. So we are spending more. \nIn fact, spending from 2000 to 2003 was up 20 percent. That is \nstimulative, that is more money moving in the economy. That is more \ngoods and purchases by the Government. That stimulates the economy. In \naddition, the tax cuts, without question, also provided stimulus. I \nwould say the rebate checks and the lower rates helped stimulate \nconsumer spending in the short run, but the tax cuts for the affluent \nwere largely saved. So the part of the tax cuts that were especially \nstimulative were those tax cuts that led people to spend money.\n  The problem with the President's tax cuts is he weighted them too \nheavily to the upper income who are the very least likely to spend the \nmoney and stimulate the economy.\n  Finally, there is the sinking dollar. The dollar has gone down now \nnearly 30 percent against the euro since 2002, making U.S. exports \ncheaper abroad, making it easier for others to buy our goods.\n  Those are the factors I believe have contributed to economic \nrecovery, not just the tax cuts. Certainly the tax cuts have played a \nrole, but they are just one factor in the five factors I have \nmentioned.\n  With that, I take this opportunity to thank my colleagues for the \ngood day we had today, the productive debate and discussion we had. I \nwelcome this opportunity to respond to Senator Bennett and his \nalternative view of what is happening with deficits and debt, what is \nhappening to the job circumstance in our country, and to give my view \nof what is occurring. I find people across the country are increasingly \ntroubled by a sense that something is wrong, something is amiss, \nsomething is not happening as it has happened in the past.\n  All of us have a responsibility to try to diagnose why that is \nhappening and come up with solutions that will make things better for \nthe future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/09/senate-section/article/S2464-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
