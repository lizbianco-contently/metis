Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Energy conference report. A number of Senators \ncame to the floor to speak on the Energy conference report yesterday. \nWe had a good debate, good discussion, and the Senate will continue \nthis debate throughout today's session.NOTICE\n\nIf the 108th Congress, 1st Session, adjourns sine die on or before \nNovember 21, 2003, a final issue of the Congressional Record for \nthe 108th Congress, 1st Session, will be published on Monday, \nDecember 15, 2003, in order to permit Members to revise and extend \ntheir remarks.\nAll material for insertion must be signed by the Member and \ndelivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of \nDebates (Room HT-60 or S-410A of the Capitol), Monday through \nFriday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through \nFriday, December 12, 2003. The final issue will be dated Monday, \nDecember 15, 2003, and will be delivered on Tuesday, December 16, \n2003.\nNone of the material printed in the final issue of the \nCongressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any \nevent that occurred after the sine die date.\nSenators' statements should also be submitted electronically, \neither on a disk to accompany the signed statement, or by e-mail to \nthe Official Reporters of Debates at ``Record@Sec.Senate.gov''.\nMembers of the House of Representatives' statements may also be \nsubmitted electronically by e-mail, to accompany the signed \nstatement, and formatted according to the instructions for the \nExtensions of Remarks template at http://clerkhouse.house.gov/\nforms. The Official Reporters will transmit to GPO the template \nformatted electronic file only after receipt of, and authentication \nwith, the hard copy, and signed manuscript. Deliver statements to \nthe Official Reporters in Room \nHT-60 of the Capitol.\nMembers of Congress desiring to purchase reprints of material \nsubmitted for inclusion in the Congressional Record may do so by \ncontacting the Office of Congressional Publishing Services, at the \nGovernment Printing Office, on 512-0224, between the hours of 8:00 \na.m. and 4:00 p.m. daily.\nBy order of the Joint Committee on Printing.\n                                                                \nROBERT W. NEY, Chairman.\n  \n\n\n[[Page S15212]]\n\n  I do remind my colleagues that a cloture motion was filed on the \nconference report during yesterday's session, and that cloture vote \nwill occur on Friday morning.\n  As we all know, we are scheduled to consider several major pieces of \nlegislation over the next few days. In addition to the appropriations \nmeasures and the Medicare reform package, there will be other \nconference reports that will become available for Senate consideration, \nand we will attempt to clear those measures for Senate action as they \narrive.\n  In addition to that, we will also continue to work through \nnominations on the Executive Calendar. There are some roadblocks right \nnow, but we are doing our very best to address those. There are a \nnumber of important nominations that are ready for confirmation, \nincluding judicial nominees who should be cleared, the Department of \nHomeland Security positions, a number of ambassadors, Health and Human \nServices officials, and the list goes on and on. They are ready for \nconfirmation.\n  I understand there are Members who are objecting to all of those \nnominations. I urge my colleagues to allow us to schedule votes on at \nleast the noncontroversial nominations. Some of these nominations are \nbeing held up by colleagues who say nothing is going to go through. At \nleast let the noncontroversial nominations proceed. It is clear we \ncan't, in these final few days, be held hostage to unrelated matters on \nthese important nominations.\n  I mentioned the Senate will need to work this weekend in order for us \nto finish all of our business. We will have a clearer picture as to \nwhat to expect over the course of the weekend as this day progresses. I \ndo alert everyone that the likelihood of being in Saturday is very high \nand possibly for a period of time on Sunday as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15212-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader has been consulting \nwith us with regard to the schedule. I share his view that there is an \nopportunity here for us to complete our work, if we can find a way to \nresolve the remaining issues before the Senate. We have a lot of work \nto do on conference reports, on the omnibus legislation, and on certain \nnominations.\n  I will say there are a number of holds on the nominations in part \nbecause of a misunderstanding perhaps with the White House on a \nparticular nominee that has to be resolved if we are to move forward on \nthese nominations. I am hopeful that can be done perhaps as early as \ntoday. That is one of the major obstacles to addressing successfully a \nnumber of other nominees.\n  This is going to be a busy week. I certainly urge our colleagues not \nto make plans for Saturday or Sunday until we know better what the \nscheduling entails. I think it would be important for us to give our \nMembers adequate notice with regard to the schedule, perhaps once or \ntwice a day updating people as to what the schedule may hold. We will \ncertainly work with the majority leader in attempting to address the \nmany challenges we face with regard to the legislative schedule yet \nbefore us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Democratic leader and I have been in \nconsultation and will continue to be in consultation over the course of \nthe day--as he suggested, pretty much every few hours--to facilitate \nwhat is going to be a challenge in moving in a reasonably orderly way \nall that we have on the table.\n  I do want to mention in my opening comments that we are very close to \naddressing Healthy Forests. I plead with everyone, hopefully over the \ncourse of this morning, to resolve whatever remaining issues there are \nin terms of holding up that legislation. If we go to conference \nquickly, that very important legislation will be addressed. I think we \nare just about there. We were just about there last night. If we can \nget that over the goal line this morning, that would be helpful.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased the majority leader \nmentioned Healthy Forests. I would have done it if I had remembered. Of \ncourse, Senator Cochran and I had a very good conversation yesterday. \nBased on that conversation and his assurances that extraneous material \nwould not be included in conference, we are prepared to go to \nconference now.\n  We have had good success in reaching agreement on the forest health \nprovisions of the bill. There are other issues that still remain to be \naddressed. I share the view of the majority leader that we are now at a \nmoment where I think we ought to try to complete our work. It would be \ngreat if at the end of the day we could set aside the pending \nlegislation and pass that conference report. I think we are going to \nget a good broad bipartisan vote on the legislation. I applaud those \nwho have taken us to this point. This is good legislation. It deserves \nsupport. I look forward to finishing work on that bill as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15212-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. 6, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 6, an act to enhance \n     energy conservation and research and development, to provide \n     for security and diversity in the energy supply for the \n     American people, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair is in doubt. Under the previous \norder, the Senator from New Mexico was to be recognized first.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from California is now \nrecognized for 60 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we received word Senator Domenici would not \nbe here this morning. Of course, he is managing this bill. Whenever he \ncomes, we will work him into the order.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair thanks the Senator from Nevada.\n  (Mr. SMITH assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor as a \nCalifornian to say there is very little in this Energy bill for \nCalifornia. There is very little to prevent future blackouts. There is \nnothing to protect consumers from manipulation and gaming of the system \nthat we experienced a few years ago.\n  There is nothing to improve our Nation's energy security by \nincreasing fuel economy standards. In short, from a California \nperspective, I see this bill as one giant giveaway to special \ninterests, particularly the ethanol, the MTBE, the oil, the gas, and \nthe nuclear power industries of this country.\n  I had hoped that this Congress, and in particular the Energy \nCommittee on which I serve, following the Western energy crisis and \nlast summer's blackout in the Northeast, would pass a sensible bill \nthat would improve our Nation's energy supply while protecting \nconsumers, the environment, and the economy. But as I read this bill, \nthat is not the case. This Energy bill was drafted behind closed doors, \nwithout any input from Democratic conferees or from those of us on my \nside of the aisle on the Energy Committee. Simply put, it is one of the \nworst pieces of legislation I have seen in my time in the Senate.\n  It is interesting that today on every Member's desk is a summary of \neditorials. There are over 100 editorials from newspapers, large and \nsmall, all across this great country saying ``oppose this bill.'' In \nfact, 100 newspapers around the country have come out opposed to the \nbill and editorialized against it. I will quote from one of them. Let \nme begin with the newspaper whose editorial policy is generally very \nconservative, and that is the Wall Street Journal. Let me read what the \nWall Street Journal says about this legislation:\n\n       We realize that making legislation is never pretty, but \n     this exercise is uglier than most.\n\n[[Page S15213]]\n\n     The fact that it's being midwifed by Republicans, who claim \n     to be free marketers, arguably makes it worse. By claiming \n     credit for passing this comprehensive energy reform, \n     Republicans are now taking political ownership of whatever \n     blackouts and energy shortages ensue. Good luck.\n\n  Now I will go to yesterday's Denver Post. The editorial is entitled \n``Energy Bill Full of Pork.''\n\n       The bill does include funds for energy conservation, \n     including some incentives for ``green'' construction, but \n     some sound suspicious. Some $180 million will pay for a \n     development in Shreveport, LA. That project will use federal \n     tax money to subsidize the city's first-ever Hooters \n     restaurant. What a new Hooters has to do with America's \n     energy situation may be best known to U.S. Rep. Bill Tauzin, \n     a Louisiana Congressman and key player in the secret \n     conference committee talks.\n       The bill provides no real vision, represents no real \n     improvement in policies and laws. It is vexing that Congress \n     did not seize an opportunity to improve the national energy \n     picture. Congress should start over next year.\n\n  Let me now go to the Northeast, a large newspaper, the New York \nTimes:\n\n       The oil and gas companies were particularly well rewarded--\n     hardly surprising in a bill that had its genesis partly in \n     Vice President Dick Cheney's secret task force. Though they \n     did not win permission to drill in the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge, they got a lot of other things, not only tax \n     breaks but also exemptions from the Clean Water Act, \n     protection against lawsuits for fouling underground water and \n     an accelerated process for leasing and drilling in sensitive \n     areas at the expense of environmental reviews and public \n     participation. Meanwhile, the bill imposes new reliability \n     standards on major electricity producers, but it is not clear \n     whether it would encourage new and badly needed investment in \n     the power grid.\n\n  Now let me go to the Midwest to the Chicago area, the Chicago \nTribune.\n\n       Despite all the years of partisan haggling that preceded \n     it, the approximately 1,400-page energy bill that Republicans \n     unveiled over the weekend, and which Congress is expected to \n     vote on this week, is no masterpiece of compromise or even \n     effective legislation.\n       It is more like a jigsaw puzzle with hundreds of unrelated \n     pieces crammed together. A few initiatives are worthwhile, \n     most look more like a laundry list of special-interest \n     subsidies. Together, they don't add up to a policy that will \n     promote energy self-sufficiency or stable prices.\n\n  Then let's go to one of the Chair's own newspapers, the Anchorage \nDaily News, which states:\n\n       What's left is a grab bag of lesser measures and pet \n     projects patched together in hopes of gaining enough votes to \n     pass in the House and Senate. The result is an energy bill \n     that likely will pass--but not a coherent energy policy for a \n     nation critically dependent on imported energy supplies.\n\n  Then let's go to the Houston Chronicle, and I will not read it all:\n\n       The most pressing problem facing the Nation is its \n     increasing reliance on imported oil and gas. Yet the bill \n     ignores several obvious avenues for progress.\n       The Republican draft of the bill set no standard for \n     renewable sources of power, such as solar and wind. The \n     latter will provide 2 percent of Texas' electricity supply \n     and one day could spell the difference between air \n     conditioning and brownout. There is no reason for Congress to \n     ignore these pollution-free, alternative energy sources, and \n     the conference committee should adopt a Senate amendment \n     requiring expanded production of renewable energy.\n\n  Now, let me take a moment here to elaborate on this point. On Monday, \nduring the Energy Conference, I was pleased an amendment requiring \nutilities to generate 10 percent of their energy from renewable sources \nwas included in the bill. Unfortunately, this provision was stripped \nout of the conference report by the House just hours later. Although \nthe bill does have requirements for renewable energy in government \nbuildings, that is not enough. We need to encourage the use of this \nclean technology at a national level.\n  Finally, I would like to move to the west coast, to the largest \nnewspaper, the Los Angeles Times. Their editorial is entitled ``An \nEnergy Throwback.'' They say:\n\n       It's clear why Republican leaders in Congress kept their \n     national energy policy bill locked up in a conference \n     committee room for the last month, safe from review by the \n     public. Taxpayers, had they been given time to digest the \n     not-so-fine print in the pork-laden legislation, would have \n     revolted.\n\n  Let me begin my impression of the bill with its costs. The editorials \nfrom around the country show that this bill increases energy production \nat the expense of both the taxpayers and the environment. A group \ncalled the Taxpayers for Common Sense has estimated that this bill will \ncost $72 billion in authorized spending, and $23 billion in tax \ngiveaways. That is $95 billion in spending over the next 10 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that report printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Taxpayers for Common Sense points out that there is \nnearly $13 billion for the oil and gas industry, $5.4 billion for coal, \n$1.4 billion for the nuclear power industry, $4.16 billion for ethanol, \n$4.9 billion in energy efficiency, $1.7 billion for auto efficiency and \nfuels--that includes ethanol--$11 billion for LIHEAP and \nweatherization, $21 billion for science research and development, $2.15 \nbillion for freedom car and hydrogen research, and $764 million for \nmiscellaneous provisions.\n  Now, I am in favor of some of these programs, but the cost of this is \nenormous. The Senate should think twice about these massive spending \nincreases, especially given our rising Federal deficit. I do not want \nto leave my children and my grandchildren saddled with these debts.\n  Let's also consider the fact that this bill does not deal with global \nwarming, does not deal with fuel efficiency standards, does not deal \nwith consumer protections, and does not deal with energy security.\n  From a western perspective, and particularly a California \nperspective, we have to look at the western energy crisis and ask the \nquestion: Will this bill help in the future? My analysis of the bill \nleaves me with the conclusion that the answer is no.\n  I have often pointed out in this Chamber that the cost of energy \ndirectly before the crisis was $7 billion. That was in 1999. It rose to \n$27 billion in 2000, and $26.7 billion in 2001. In 1 year, the cost \nwent up 400 percent in California. There are Members of this body who \nsaid: Oh, California, it is your fault, you have a broken system, you \ndon't have adequate supply to meet demand. A 400 percent increase is \nnot the product of supply and demand, it is the product of gaming and \nmanipulation.\n  Now, 3 years later and after $45 billion in costs, we have learned \nhow the energy markets were gamed and abused. In March of 2003, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission issued its final report on price \nmanipulation in the western markets, and what did it find? It confirmed \nthat there was widespread and pervasive fraud and manipulation during \nthe western energy crisis.\n  The abuse in our energy markets was in fact pervasive and unlawful. \nSo you would think an Energy bill coming out a few years after this \ncrisis would take a look and say we ought to prevent this from ever \nhappening again, we ought to put policies and those procedures in this \nbill to prevent it, we ought to strengthen the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission's ability to produce just and reasonable rates \nand ensure that rates remain just and reasonable across this Nation. \nBut this bill does not do this. Rather, this bill actually impedes the \nability of Federal and State agencies to investigate and prosecute \nfraud and price manipulation in energy markets. These provisions would \nmake it easier to manipulate energy markets, not harder to manipulate \nenergy markets.\n  This bill sends this country in the wrong direction. Rather than \npreventing Enron-type schemes, such as Fat Boy, Ricochet, Death Star, \nand Get Shorty, this bill weakens the oversight over energy markets. It \nguts the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's ability to enforce just \nand reasonable rates.\n  Between now and 2007, the FERC will be in court, litigating the \nmeaning of this electricity title rather than enforcing the State \nadministration of just and reasonable rates to electricity customers. \nFERC will be powerless to respond to market crises like the one that \noccurred in the West between 2000 and 2001.\n  I am also particularly concerned about the provision in the bill \nwhich directly affects the so-called sanctity of contract provision. \nCalifornia was overcharged by as much as $9 billion for the cost of \nenergy as a result of long-term electricity contracts that were entered \ninto under desperate circumstances at the height of a gamed\n\n[[Page S15214]]\n\nenergy crisis. These contracts were not based on just and reasonable \nrates, they were based on rates that were inflated as a result of \ngaming and manipulation. California has filed at FERC for refunds.\n  This sanctity of contract provision, however, would mean FERC would \nnever provide any further refund in the California case. So it shuts \nout California from any further recourse. No one from California should \nvote for this Energy bill. The provision places the importance of the \nphysical contract above the importance of enforcing just and reasonable \nrates. In other words, it says even if you signed a contract in a \nsituation that has been gamed and manipulated by fraud, you are still \nbound to that fraud-inspired contract. That is what we are doing in \nthis bill.\n  In my view, this is simply absurd. We need to be strengthening FERC's \nability to enforce just and reasonable rates, particularly in a \nderegulated market, not weakening it. And the irony is that FERC \nrecently announced a settlement in which El Paso Corporation and its \nsubsidiaries would pay $1.6 billion to resolve a complaint that the \ncompany withheld supplies of natural gas into California, driving up \nprices for gas and electricity during the State's energy crises in 2000 \nand 2001.\n  This was precisely the incident about which I tried to see the \nPresident--he wouldn't see me at that time--because we knew that the \nprice from San Juan, NM, to southern California, which should have been \n$1 per dekatherm, was $60 per dekatherm, which was a manipulated price \nbased on the withholding of space in the El Paso pipeline. We now know \nthat that was correct because El Paso has paid $1.6 billion: Fact.\n\n  This bill does nothing to prevent gaming and manipulation in the \nnatural gas market. The bill does increase penalties for electricity \ngaming and fraud, but does nothing to increase the low penalties for \nmanipulation of the natural gas market. It is estimated that El Paso's \nprice manipulation cost consumers and businesses $3.7 billion, yet this \nbill fails to give the FERC the power it needs to ensure that this kind \nof price manipulation does not happen again.\n  Now I would like to speak about what should be for the east coast and \nthe west coast one of the most egregious provisions in the bill, and \nthat is this ethanol mandate. This mandate is essentially a hidden gas \ntax. It will increase automobile emissions in the most polluted areas \nof the country and will not reduce our dependence on oil. Not only is \nthis mandate unnecessary but it may have serious unintended \nenvironmental consequences because the environmental studies on ethanol \nhave not been done. Yet this bill forces consumption of ethanol beyond \nthat which is needed. So this bill is pushing an untested product that \nStates such as mine don't need to meet clean air standards.\n  There are several reasons I am adamantly opposed to mandating the \nincrease in ethanol consumption from 3.1 billion gallons a year to 5 \nbillion gallons over the next 7 years. Not only do I believe the \nmandate is unnecessary but I am concerned about unintended \nenvironmental consequences. Let me tell you why. This is not just off \nthe top of my head. This summer, for the first time, 70 percent of \nsouthern California's gasoline was blended with ethanol. Partially as a \nresult, southern California endured its worst smog season since 1998. \nWhy? Ethanol produces smog.\n  For the first time in 5 years, southern California experienced a \nstage 1 smog alert. As of September, the greater Los Angeles \nmetropolitan area had experienced 63 days of unhealthy air quality, \nwhen ozone levels exceeded Federal standards. That number far exceeds \nthe 49 days of unhealthy air quality during 2002 and the 36 days in \n2001.\n  That is with 70 percent of its gasoline blended with ethanol. So the \nair got worse; it didn't get better.\n  The number of unhealthy days this year was almost more than twice \nthat of two other of the smoggiest areas of the country, the San \nJoaquin Valley and Houston, TX, which exceeded the Federal health \nstandards for 32 days and 25 days, respectively. What ethanol has done \nfor southern California is make it more smoggy, not less smoggy. It is \na culprit. It is worsening smog. I think we are mandating it in this \nbill willy-nilly because of greed.\n  The Secretary of the California EPA concluded, and this is his direct \nquote:\n\n       Our best estimate is that the increase in the use of \n     ethanol-blended gasoline has likely resulted in a 1-percent \n     increase in emissions of volatile organic gases in the South \n     Coast Air Quality Management District in the summer of 2003. \n     Given the very poor air quality in the region, and the great \n     difficulty of reaching the current Federal ozone standard by \n     the required attainment date of 2010, an increase of this \n     magnitude is of great concern. Clearly, these emission \n     increases have resulted in higher ozone levels this year than \n     what would have otherwise occurred and are responsible for at \n     least some of the rise of ozone levels that have been \n     observed.\n\n  Not only does this bill do harm to California, it increases the use \nof ethanol-blended gasoline, and that will threaten my State's long-\nterm trend toward cleaner air. It will make it more difficult, and it \nmay well make it impossible.\n  Without major emission reduction in the next several years, air \nquality officials warn that the region may miss a 2010 clean air \ndeadline to virtually eliminate smoggy days. If the deadline isn't met, \nthe Los Angeles region could face Federal sanctions amounting to \nbillions of dollars.\n  That is why I oppose this ethanol mandate. That is why I say to those \nwho are supporting it that you are doing us grievous injury.\n  Furthermore, the bill as written threatens the highway trust fund, \nthe funding stream that allows States to construct and maintain our \nroads.\n  Let me tell you how. Gasoline taxes generate about $20 billion per \nyear for the highway trust fund, and they comprise about 90 percent of \nthe overall money for the fund. Because this bill subsidizes ethanol \nwith transportation dollars, any increase in the use of ethanol will \nmean a decrease in the amount of money going into the highway trust \nfund. In fact, California will lose approximately $900 million over the \nnext 7 years just because of this provision. The loss of highway funds \nfor the entire country will amount to $10 billion over the next 7 years \nbecause of this ethanol mandate. It is egregious public policy.\n  I am also concerned about the price impact this mandate will have on \nthe cost of gasoline at the pump.\n  Proponents of the ethanol mandate argue that gas price increases will \nbe minimum, but the projections don't take into consideration the real \nworld infrastructure constraints and concentration in the marketplace \nthat can lead to high price hikes. We all know that when one entity \ncontrols most of the marketplace, that entity can move price as it sees \nfit. And that is the situation we have here.\n  Everyone outside of the Midwest will have to grapple with how to \nbring ethanol to their States in amounts prescribed and mandated since \nthe Midwest controls most of the ethanol production. California has \ndone more analysis than any other State on what it will take to get \nethanol to our State. The bottom line is that it can't happen without \nraising gas prices. Our analysis shows that we can't bring ethanol to \nour State without increasing gas prices.\n  As I said, California has done more analysis on what it will take to \nbring the required amount of ethanol to our State than any other State, \nand has found that it will have cost consequences at the pump. \nProponents of the ethanol mandate argue that gas price increases will \nbe minimal. But the projections don't take into consideration the \ninfrastructure and strength and the concentration in the marketplace \nthat exists. Everyone outside of the Midwest will have to grapple with \nhow to bring ethanol to their States since the Midwest controls most of \nthe production.\n  I am also concerned about the limited number of ethanol suppliers in \nthe market today. This high market concentration will leave consumers \nvulnerable to price hikes as it did when electricity and natural gas \nprices soared in the West because of a few out-of-State generating \nfirms dominating the market.\n  As I have watched all of this, every time you have out-of-State \ncompanies dealing with an unregulated energy-related marketplace you \nhave problems. I don't know why. But I suspect there really isn't the \nconnection with the consumer. Many of the companies driving the energy \ncrisis in California\n\n[[Page S15215]]\n\nweren't in California. I wonder if they would do the same thing to \ntheir State that they did to our State. I am not a fan of the way the \nmarketplace is structured today. And into this lack of structure and \nlack of price responsibility, we bring a whole new component. That \ncomponent is that one company is the dominant producer in the highly \nconcentrated ethanol market.\n  ADM today controls 46 percent of the ethanol market. That is only \nwhat is produced today. The company has an even greater control over \nhow ethanol is distributed and marketed. ADM does not have a sterling \nrecord. It is an admitted price fixer and three of its executives have \nserved prison time for colluding with competitors. I cannot look at ADM \nand say we have a pristine corporate citizen who controls this \nmarketplace, its production, its distribution and will have any \ncompassion for price responsibility. I do not believe giving firms such \nas this, this kind of control, is good public policy.\n\n  One could ask, Do I have any more grievous complaints? The answer is \nyes. The list goes on and on.\n  Let me take up MTBE. In this bill, there is a liability waiver so \nnobody can sue for the fact that MTBE has been found to be defective by \na court of law. Not only that, it is a retroactive liability protection \nfor MTBE producers. This provision offers them immunity from claims \nthat the additive is defective in design or manufacture. It makes this \nliability protection retroactive to September 5 of this year thereby \nwiping out hundreds of lawsuits brought by local jurisdictions all \nacross America. This retroactive immunity is a perverse incentive to \nthose who pollute because it says to them, OK, you have done all of \nthis damage; nonetheless, it does not really matter. You do not really \nhave any liability. All these suits will be wiped out.\n  This bill does not ban MTBE nationwide despite what has happened in \nhuge numbers of States, including my own. It gives MTBE producers $2 \nbillion in what is called ``transition assistance'' to transition out \nof a product they are allowed to continue to produce and export. So \nthey can accept $2 billion and continue to produce a flawed product \nthat we know contaminates ground water, that we know leaches out of \nground water wells, creates plumes of benzene, could possibly be \ncarcinogenic, and pollutes drinking water so it is undrinkable and what \ndo they get for doing this? $2 billion in this bill. Now I ask, is that \ngood public policy? Remember, the courts have already found it to be a \ndefective product. This is not me speaking; it is the courts.\n  I first learned about MTBE when the mayor of Santa Monica came to see \nme and told me that one-half of their entire water supply was \ncontaminated with MTBE and could not be used. As I delved into it and \ninvestigated the claims further, I came to learn there were at least \n10,000 sites contaminated in California. Since then, about a year ago, \nit is now 15,000 sites in California.\n  California is not alone. Last year the EPA estimated there are 15,051 \nsites in California. Nationally there are 153,000 contaminated ground \nwater sites.\n  The States with the most pollution include California and Florida. \nFlorida has 20,273 contaminated ground water sites--more than \nCalifornia. Florida is heavily impacted with MTBE pollution. Illinois \nhas 9,546 contaminated sites. Michigan has 9,087 sites. Texas has 5,678 \nsites. Wisconsin has 5,567 sites. New York has 3,290 polluted sites. \nPennsylvania has 4,723. It is State after State after State. They total \n153,000 polluted drinking water sites. This bill does not make MTBE \nillegal; this bill gives MTBE $2 billion, and they cut out the ability \nof local jurisdictions to sue to be able to clean up these sites with \nthe money. If that is not perverse public policy, if that does not \ncreate an incentive to do bad things, I don't know what does.\n  As I said, the courts ruled that MTBE is a defective product. \nActually, this relates to a case in my State so I think it is relevant \nto mention this case. It is a case brought by the South Lake Tahoe \nPublic Utility District. The court held Shell, Texaco, Tosco, Lyondell \nChemical, which is ARCO Chemical, and Equilon Enterprises liable for \nselling a defective product, gasoline with MTBE, while failing to warn \nof its pollution hazard. The court forced these MTBE producers to pay \nthe water district of South Lake Tahoe $60 million to clean up the \nmess.\n  The industry, in fact, knew of the problems with MTBE yet decided to \ninclude it in gasoline. They deny all of this, but a court has found it \nto be the case. In fact, let me read a comment from Exxon employee \nBarbara Mickelson from 1984:\n\n       Based on higher mobility and at the same time/odor \n     characteristics of MTBE, Exxon's experience with \n     contaminations in Maryland, and our knowledge of Shell's \n     experience with MTBE contamination incidents, the number of \n     well contamination incidents is estimated to increase three \n     times following the widespread introduction of MTBE into \n     Exxon gasoline.\n\n  This is 1984. The company went ahead and included it in their \ngasoline. Now, no one can sue them for a defective product in this \nbill.\n  Let me also give you an excerpt from a 1987 memorandum circulated \nwithin the Environmental Protection Agency:\n\n       Concern about MTBE in drinking water surfaced after the \n     Interagency Testing Committee report was published. Known \n     cases of drinking water contamination have been reported in 4 \n     states. These cases affect individual families as well as \n     towns of up to 20,000 people. It is possible that this \n     program could rapidly mushroom due to leaking underground \n     storage tanks at service stations. The tendency for MTBE to \n     separate from the gasoline mixture into ground water could \n     lead to widespread drinking water contamination.\n\n  That is what indeed happened as illustrated by the fact that today we \nhave 153,000 drinking water sites contaminated with MTBE across this \nNation. This bill does not make its use illegal. It gives the companies \n$2 billion, and it prevents water districts from suing because the \nproduct was knowingly defective. There is no way you can look at a \nprovision like this and not say this is a bad bill.\n\n  What adds insult to injury is this bill says they can continue to \nproduce MTBE and export it to other countries so the drinking water of \nother countries can be polluted. How perverse can public policy be?\n  I am also disappointed that the conference report does nothing to \nincrease fuel economy standards of our Nation's fleet of automobiles. \nWe have an Energy bill. The largest contributor to global warming is \ncarbon dioxide. The largest producer of carbon dioxide is the \nautomobile. This bill does nothing to make automobiles more fuel \nefficient. What kind of an energy policy is that? In fact, the bill, \nagain, perversely, makes it more difficult for the Department of \nTransportation to encourage fuel efficiency standards in the future by \nincluding a new list of criteria the Department must consider when \nrevising standards.\n  I believe increasing the fuel economy of SUVs and light trucks is the \nsingle easiest step the Nation can take to reduce the emission of \ncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It is the biggest single shot at \nreducing global warming. Yet we refuse to do it.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Snowe and I introduced bipartisan \nlegislation to close what is called the SUV loophole. We were unable to \noffer this legislation as an amendment to the Senate version of the \nEnergy bill when it was on the floor.\n  But our bill had been evaluated by the National Academy of Sciences, \nthat has released a study on this issue, and said it was \ntechnologically feasible to do this, and that over the next 10 years it \nwould save the United States a million barrels of oil a day and reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil by 10 percent. It said it would prevent \n240 million tons of carbon dioxide, the top greenhouse gas, as I have \nsaid, from entering the atmosphere each year, and it would save SUV and \nlight-duty truck owners hundreds of dollars, ranging anywhere from $300 \na year to $600 a year at the pump in the cost of gasoline.\n  CAFE standards were first established in 1975. They were fought by \nDetroit, just as seatbelts were fought by Detroit. At that time light \ntrucks made up only a small percentage of the vehicles on the road. \nThey were used mostly for agriculture and commerce. Today they are used \nmostly as passenger cars. Our roads look much different. SUVs and \nlight-duty trucks comprise more than half of new car sales in the \nUnited States.\n  As a result, the overall fuel economy of our Nation's fleet is the \nlowest it has been in two decades, largely because fuel economy \nstandards for SUVs\n\n[[Page S15216]]\n\nand light trucks are so much lower than they are for other passenger \nvehicles. They are 22 miles per gallon. We could have them equal to \nsedans and have all the savings I have just cited.\n  Additionally, what is interesting is that others are moving rapidly \nto retrofit automobiles with new fuel savings technology that is \navailable today for use by car manufacturers. Toyota recently announced \nimprovements in its hybrid vehicle, the Prius, making it more powerful \nand more fuel efficient. Toyota has announced a hybrid version of its \nLexus RX 330 SUV, which is scheduled to be released in early next year.\n  Meanwhile, instead of moving forward, some U.S. automakers are moving \nbackward. I was very disappointed by the announcement made by the Ford \nMotor Company stating Ford would not be meeting its self-imposed goal \nof raising the fuel economy in its SUVs by 25 percent by 2005. \nAdditionally, Ford announced it is delaying the sale of its hybrid SUV, \nthe Escape, another year until 2004.\n  Yet China has announced it is going to move quickly on imposing fuel \nefficiency standards on its automobiles. Of course, any American \ncompanies that produce for Chinese consumption will have to conform.\n  I am so disappointed to see this Energy bill does not address global \nclimate change. We are 5 percent of the world's population. We use 25 \npercent of its energy. We produce the world's most greenhouse gas \nemissions. We are the most significant culprit driving global warming.\n  Despite the fact that climate change threatens our environment and \nour economy, this bill does nothing to address it. I think that is a \nmajor mistake. Energy and climate are inextricably linked. A truly \ncomprehensive energy policy cannot ignore that issue. As a nation, we \nignore it at our peril.\n\n  The scientific evidence of global warming is real. The problem is \ngetting worse. People are seeing mosquitos in areas of the Arctic for \nthe first time. Glaciers are melting around the world, from Glacier \nNational Park to the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. The largest ice shelf \nin the Arctic is disintegrating. This ice shelf covers 150 square \nmiles. It is 100 feet thick.\n  The hole in the ozone layer, which decreased in size last year, grew \nto its largest level earlier this year.\n  Climate change is also affecting some of our most treasured places. \nOver a century ago, 150 magnificent glaciers could be seen on the high \ncliffs and jagged peaks of the surrounding mountains of Glacier \nNational Park. Today, there are only 35. The 35 glaciers that remain \ntoday are disintegrating so quickly that scientists estimate the park \nwill have no glaciers in 30 years.\n  Glaciers in the Sierra Nevada, in my State, are disappearing. Many of \nthese have been there for the last thousand years.\n  We are seeing similar melting around the world, from Mount \nKilimanjaro in Tanzania to the ice fields beneath Mount Everest in the \nHimalayas.\n  Dwindling glaciers offer a clear and visible sign of climate change \nin America and the rest of the world. We are seeing these changes. \nScientists tell us to expect more. Yet this bill is silent.\n  We have reports from the National Academy of Sciences, the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  Let me quote the CBO report in May:\n\n       Scientists generally agree that continued population growth \n     and economic development . . . will result in substantially \n     more greenhouse gas emissions and further warming unless \n     actions are taken to control those emissions.\n\n  The place to take those actions is in an Energy bill, and yet this \nconference report is silent.\n  Let me tell you what the actual effect is in my State.\n  Sea level has risen 6 inches in San Francisco since 1850, with the \ngreatest change happening since 1925. As sea level rises, the salt \nwater permeates into the delta, contaminating drinking water and ground \nwater further upstream.\n  Even without climate change, it would be a struggle to supply enough \nwater for all of the people that live in California. But report, after \nreport, after report indicates that climate change will further \nthreaten a water supply that is already tight.\n  Models from NASA, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and \nthe Union of Concerned Scientists all indicate that climate change is \nlikely to increase winter rain and decrease snowfall in my State.\n  More winter rain means winter flooding. Less snow means less water \nfor the rest of the year. California's water supply depends on gradual \nsnow runoff. We have spent billions of dollars on water infrastructure \nthat depends on this runoff, and yet we still have to struggle to \nprovide enough water for our farms, our cities, our fish, and our \nwildlife. This bill does nothing to help California's situation.\n  In 1910, half of the Sacramento River's annual runoff took place \nbetween April and July. Today that number is 35 percent, and it is \ncontinuing to decline. We can't count on this runoff. It is clearly in \nour best interest to address climate change. Our environment is clearly \nat risk. Our relations with our allies are at risk because of our \nreluctance to address it.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has recognized the need for the \nUnited States to act. We should do so in this bill. Yet we do not. How \ncan I, representing the largest State in the Union, support a bill that \ndoes nothing for my State--nothing?\n  Let me now deal with the sensitive issue of coastal protection. On \nthe positive side, the bill no longer includes another inventory of oil \nand gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. However, this \nconference report takes away the States' input into an important set of \nenergy development projects, including liquefied natural gas facilities \nand other oil- and gas-related projects. These States need input into \nthese decisions. For coastal States, this is a significant weakness in \nthis bill, particularly States such as Florida and California and for \nyour own State of Oregon, Mr. President. Time after time, we have said \nwe do not want offshore energy development. This bill opens that door, \nand it reduces the States' input into decisions which directly affect \nour coastal zone waters.\n  The Energy bill also fails to include the renewable portfolio \nprovision which was included in the Senate-passed bill. I heartened \nwhen the ranking member, the Senator from New Mexico, announced earlier \nthis week that it was in. Apparently, it is now out. Solar, wind, \ngeothermal, and biomass are generating electricity for homes and \nbusinesses nationwide. It is working in California. We need an energy \npolicy that not only provides tax incentives for their continued \ndevelopment but also requires their use. I believe it is in the public \ninterest for our Nation to require a greater development of renewable \nresources.\n  The tax provision of this bill implies that nuclear power is a form \nof renewable power, and it places this form of power on an equal \nfooting in the Tax Code with traditional renewables. This production \ntax credit for nuclear power is the largest energy tax credit in the \nbill and would be the largest one in the code, equaling $6 billion. As \na nation, we still can't properly dispose of nuclear waste. This waste \nhas a half-life of an eternity, yet we are going to produce more of it. \nI strongly believe this is a mistake.\n  This bill also weakens the Clean Air Act. Upon reviewing the bill, I \nwas most disappointed to learn that the legislation that has really \ncleaned up our air, the Clean Air Act, is weakened. The 1990 amendments \nto the Clean Air Act, signed by the first President Bush, implemented \ntimelines for cities to clean their air. This bill undermines the \nintent of those amendments by no longer requiring communities to clean \nup their air if they can claim that part of its pollution is a result \nof transported air pollution.\n  Most of California--all the inland areas--is a product of \ntransported, to some degree, air pollution. Seventy percent of our \nState does not meet national air quality standards. So California is \nprobably more adversely impacted by this than any other State because \nof strong prevailing westerly winds which drive the pollution from the \nbig coastal areas into the valley areas. This will result in a major \nweakening of the Clean Air Act. Huge areas of the State, such as the \nCentral Valley and the Inland Empire, will have reduced cleanup \nrequirements.\n  Our Nation needs an energy policy that will protect consumers, reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil, and produce\n\n[[Page S15217]]\n\nnew energy development while protecting our environment. This bill does \nnot do that. This bill deserves to be defeated. This bill is a bad \nbill.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this poorly crafted \nlegislation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       TAXPAYERS FOR COMMON $ENSE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Type or industry                   Authorized spending\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOil and Gas (including MTBE/LUST)........  $12.971 billion (includes\n                                            $414 million scoring of\n                                            royalty provisions).\nCoal.....................................  $5.434 billion.\nNuclear..................................  $5.735 billion.\nUtilities................................  $1.355 billion.\nRenewables (including R)...............  $4.164 billion.\nEnergy Efficiency (including R)........  $4.931 billion.\nAuto Efficiency and fuels (including       $1.698 billion.\n Ethanol).\nLIHEAP and Weatherization Assistance.....  $11.425 billion.\nScience Research and Development.........  $21.850 billion.\nFreedom CAR and Hydrogen Research........  $2.149 billion.\nMiscellaneous............................  $764 million.\n    Total Authorization..................  $72.476 billion.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      Breakdown of Cost Estimates\n\n     Oil and Gas\n       Title III--$949 million (direct and royalty exemptions).\n       Title IX Research and Development--Fossil Fuel $1.997 \n     billion.\n       Title XIV Miscellaneous, Subtitle B Coastal Programs-- $5 \n     billion.\n       Title XV Ethanol--MTBE and other provisions--$5.025 \n     billion.\n\n     =$12.971 billion.\n     Coal\n       Title IV Coal--$3.925 billion.\n       Title IX Research and Development--Fossil fuels $1.509 \n     billion (specifically allocated to coal).\n\n     =$5.434 billion.\n     Nuclear\n       Title VI Nuclear Matters--$1.186 billion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15217-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HEALTHY FORESTS RESTORATION ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I see no other Senators seeking \nrecognition so I will speak for a few moments about one aspect of this \nbill.\n  First, I thank my colleague from California for her statement. She \nhas been extremely involved in these issues from the beginning as a \nmember of the Energy Committee. She has taken a leadership role on many \naspects of the legislation in trying to see that the provisions we came \nup with were good for her State and good for the country.\n  Let me try to talk about one part of the bill. There are 16 titles to \nthe legislation. It does go on for 11 or 12 hundred pages. I want to \ntalk about one of those 16 titles; that is, title XII, which relates to \nelectricity generation and transmission and distribution.\n  That is a very important part of the bill and one that is complicated \nand difficult for us to understand but one we need to focus on because \nof the extreme importance it has to our economy. In my view, some of \nthe biggest changes in law that are contained in the bill are located \nin the electricity title. I would also argue that the biggest retreats \nwe are making from consumer protections are perhaps in this section as \nwell.\n  During the last few years, there have been three very notable \npublicized developments or events in the electricity industry that have \ncome to our attention as a nation. Not in chronological order, but \nfirst, at least in what is on the front page today and what is most \nimmediately in mind when we think about electricity, is the blackout we \nexperienced in the eastern part of the United States and some of the \nMidwest that shut down nearly a third of our Nation; the problems of \nhow to have a reliable system for transmitting electricity and ensuring \nthat if there is a failure somewhere, it does not cascade to the 18 \nStates that were affected by this blackout, for example. So reliability \nis a serious issue, and we were made very aware of that. The \nPresident's phrase was that this was a wake-up call. I would suggest \nthat this was a wake-up call we have not heeded adequately in the bill. \nI will go into why I believe that.\n  A second issue, of course, is what happened in California and the \nwest coast, Oregon and Washington in particular, a couple of years ago \nwhen they had the market meltdown there and prices spiraled out of \ncontrol and people saw their utility bills go up very substantially. \nUnfortunately, those bills have remained very high. It has had a \nsignificant impact on the economy of that part of our country. Some of \nthat, of course, was due to manipulation of those markets, ineffective \nmarket rules. That is another area of concern that clearly should be \naddressed in this legislation.\n  The third area of concern that I cite is the financial collapse of \nmany utilities, due in large part to the investments they have made in \nmarkets that are not central to the business of producing and selling \nelectricity. That financial collapse has become a serious problem for \nmany in our country as well.\n  This bill, in my opinion, fails to adequately address each of these \nproblems, whether it is a liability or protection of the consumer. In \nthe conference report before us, it blocks implementation of market \nrules that could prevent market manipulation. There, I am thinking \nabout the provisions in the bill that delay FERC's ability to act not \nonly to issue a standard market design rule, but to issue other orders \nof general applicability within the scope of that standard market.\n  It also addresses only one form of market manipulation--round-trip \ntrading. I will get into more of a description about that, but there \nare other types of market manipulation we should be prohibiting in this \nbill. It\n\n[[Page S15218]]\n\nfails to do so, and it repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act, \nwhich was passed back in the 1930s, without providing the necessary \nlevel of protection for consumers, by strengthening the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission's authority to oversee mergers and acquisitions \nof other entities. It makes the likelihood of blackouts greater by \nstalling the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's attempts to create \nregional transmission entities through the delay of this standard \nmarket design, or any other order of general applicability within the \nscope of that rule, it discourages the construction of needed \ntransmission, and it discourages regional transmission organization \nformation by imposing an unwise pricing policy called participant \nfunding. I will try to explain the effect of the language related to \nparticipant funding and why that has become such a central part of the \nconcern about the bill.\n  First, let me talk a little about the effects the bill would have on \nreliability; that is, the blackout problem. The United States-Canada \nPower System Outage Task Force yesterday released its interim report. \nThe report dealt with the causes of the August 14 blackout both in the \nUnited States and Canada. Secretary Abraham had a press conference. I \nsaw him last night on Jim Lehrer's show explaining it again. He has \nbeen very aggressive in trying to explain what this report includes.\n  The report contains no recommendations at this point. It is the first \nof several reports. It is an interim report. It is primarily technical \nin nature. It tries to establish a timeline for the events that led up \nto the blackout and then during the blackout. The report tells the \nstory of a day when the power system was not unusually overloaded, but \non which a series of events that you could expect to be controllable \nled to an outage that cascaded through 18 States in the United States \nand a number of Canadian provinces. It shut down power to tens of \nmillions of customers, paralyzed our major cities--New York, Cleveland, \nDetroit. Some areas were blacked out for as long as 3 days, and the \neconomic cost of this was enormous, as we would expect it to be.\n  I could go into some detail about what the report found, but I am \nsure everybody can read that in their morning paper. The report doesn't \ndraw many conclusions or make many recommendations. In my reading of \nit, it is clear that the lack of communication, the lack of \ncoordination of response, the lack of consistency of rules and \nequipment were major causes of what occurred. If anything is clear, it \nis that the major transmission system that we depended upon is a large \nregional machine that is not bound by political borders but is only \nbound by physics and by commerce. What happens in one part of the \ncountry has far-reaching effects on areas that are very far from the \ninitial occurrence. That fact leads to the inescapable conclusion that \nthe control and management of that transmission system needs to be on a \nregional basis if it is going to respond to events that happen across \nthese regions.\n\n  This event cascaded across two countries, 18 States, 4 transmission \nregions, 4 reliability councils, and it did all of that in 7 minutes. \nThe FERC, which is the Federal agency that is authorized to oversee \nthis enormously complex part of our economy, has been trying to \nencourage voluntary regional control and management of the transmission \nsystem for nearly 6 years now, since the issuance of order No. 888 in \n1998. If the Midwest ISO--independent system operator--is the result of \nthe voluntary process that has been going on over this period--and it \nis--then it is clear that voluntary process has not worked as it \nshould.\n  The Midwest ISO is the best that could be negotiated in the voluntary \nprogram for this region. It still has 23 different control areas, \ninadequate communication, inadequate coordination to respond to a \nseries of events such as those that occurred during a 7-minute period \non August 14. The FERC has more recently tried to take some stronger \nsteps to be sure that the regional transmission organizations, such as \nthe Midwest ISO, are up to the task of ensuring the reliability of the \nsystem. The standard market and design rule that was proposed by the \nFERC proposed that we have mandatory regional transmission \norganizations; that is, that FERC could require utilities to join these \nregional transmission organizations. This bill stops that effort in its \ntracks. This bill doesn't have any suggestions as to what should be \ndone to accomplish regional transmission control, except further \nencouragement of these utilities to do it on a voluntary basis. But it \nstops the effort that is underway today to require utilities to take \nthese steps.\n  I think the report gives one more strong piece of evidence that the \nelectricity title, as proposed, is unwise and inadequate. The \nparticipant funding provisions--let me talk about those because that is \nan abstruse but important part of this legislation. It is one about \nwhich there is substantial controversy. When we wrote the Energy bill \nin the last Congress, there was substantial controversy about it in the \ndevelopment of this conference report. It is an issue that we need to \ntry to do right.\n  In my view, provisions in the bill related to participant funding \nwill also have a negative impact on reliability. Let me explain how I \nconclude that.\n  This provision in the bill would require that the Commission, FERC, \napprove participant funding for the expansion of transmission by a \nregional transmission organization, or by any utility. Now, what \nparticipant funding means is that the participant in the market who \nwants the transmission constructed, or the expansion of transmission \nconstructed, has to pay the full freight for getting it done. The \nCommission may not authorize the recovery of costs on a rolled-in \nbasis, or it may not rule that the costs should be shared among those \nwho will benefit from the upgrade in transmission, or the expansion of \ntransmission. Unless the native load ratepayers have stated they \nrequire the transmission, they are not to be charged for it. This \namendment takes the mantle of consumer protection by supposedly \nprotecting retail ratepayers from bearing the costs of transmission \nsystem expansions that are built in order to ship power to a far \ndistant region of the country. In reality, there are very few \ntransmission system expansions that are for the benefit only of one \nuser.\n  In a properly planned system, expansions that take place are ones \nthat support the entire load in the region, including the need to \nexport power from the region where that exists. This provision has \nthree problems.\n  First, it would cause customers to have to pay for costs they did not \ncause and for benefits they are not receiving.\n  Second, it would deprive local customers of the rights to the lines \nthat are built in their area.\n  Third, it is not always clear or true that only one participant is \ncreating the need for new transmission and benefiting from that \ntransmission.\n  The restriction on allocating costs to Native load ratepayers sounds \ngood at first blush. The effect, however, is to shift the cost to other \nratepayers for facilities that the Native load ratepayers in question \nare able to use and, in many cases, are benefiting from without having \nto pay.\n  One simple example, to try to bring this home to people, is each of \nus has a couple of filling stations we go to, to fill up our vehicles. \nIf we were asked, Do you need another filling station in your part of \nthe city, most of us would say: No, we don't; we found a way to do \nthis. But if one is built that is convenient for our use, we will use \nit; we will benefit from it.\n  The question is, Does everyone hold back and say, I will not suggest \nthe need for expansion of a transmission facility because I am going to \nbe stuck with the whole bill; I will wait until someone else suggests \nthe need and then, of course, I can get the benefit without having to \npay my share?\n  This is supposed to be aimed at generators who want to sell into the \ncompetitive market. The real victims, in my view, are the consumers who \nbuy electricity from municipal or cooperative utilities or from \nutilities other than the ones that are required to pay under this \nparticipant funding language.\n  The likely effect of this policy is that needed transmission would \nnot get built. If customers who need transmission expansion have to pay \nfor the full cost of the expansion, those who need the transmission \nexpansion may\n\n[[Page S15219]]\n\nnot be able to finance either the purchase or the sale they are \ncontemplating because it becomes prohibitively expensive.\n  The transmission either doesn't get built or, if it does, it is at a \ncost that gives the incumbent utility a competitive advantage.\n  The second effect is the utilities would be encouraged not to join \nregional transmission organizations or, if they are already members of \nregional transmission organizations, to leave those, and they are \nperfectly free to do so under the legislation. This is not my \nconclusion. This is the conclusion of many experts who have written to \nus in opposition to this participant funding language.\n  If the utilities gain this kind of competitive advantage and get \ntheir transmission built at no cost to themselves, why should they join \na regional transmission organization and talk to others about the need \nto cooperate and share costs?\n  This proposal on participant funding is anticompetitive and it is \nantireliability, in my view. If transmission construction is needed to \nrelieve bottlenecks to prevent blackouts, this provision discourages \nthat.\n  Under current policy, which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nissued in 1995, new transmission is paid for by those who benefit from \nthe transmission. If there is a single entity or single group of \nratepayers who benefit, then they are the ones who pay. If the system \nas a whole benefits, then everyone shares in the cost. Often, there is \na combination of the two and there is a sharing of the cost. The single \nbeneficiary pays for part of the cost; the rest is rolled into the \nrates for all of those who use the system.\n  This provision that is in the bill assumes there is always a single \nbeneficiary rather than there is a benefit to many, as is the case in \nmost circumstances. The provision requires something FERC already has \nthe authority to do. As I said, it can allocate the total cost to one \nparticipant. But we should not be legislating the way FERC has to deal \nwith these issues. They should be able to deal with them on a case-by-\ncase basis. The provision prevents them from doing that.\n  We have letters in opposition to this participation funding language \nfrom a great many people. I will cite a few: Public service commissions \nof Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and many \nother States; utilities in California, Indiana, Ohio, Maryland, \nPennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, New Jersey, Oregon, Utah, \nArizona, Colorado, and many other areas of the country. We have many \norganizations that have come out in opposition to this provision-- from \nAPPA, NRECA, Elcon--Electric Consumers Resource Council, the large \nindustrial customers group including General Motors, Dow Chemical, Air \nProducts, steel companies, aluminum companies--Louisiana, Energy Users \nGroup, the American Chemical Council, the American Forest and Paper \nAssociation, American Iron and Steel Institute, Council of Industrial \nBoiler Owners, Portland Cement Association, Electric Power Supply \nAssociation, Consumers for Fair Competition National Grid, American \nTransmission Company, International Transmission Company, Electric \nPower Supply Association, many individual municipal and cooperative \nutilities, and many others.\n\n  Congress, in my view, should not be meddling in this area. It is too \ncomplex. It is too dependent upon the facts of individual cases for us \nto try to be writing legislation directing how FERC allocates cost. We \nshould not legislate what they do in this area. In my view, that is \ncounterproductive.\n  The bill also contains a delay in the issuance of the standard market \ndesign rulemaking which I mentioned before. The delay is until January \nof 2007. That is a much longer delay than I think is wise. That is over \n3 years from now. Clearly, in my view, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission may well have circumstances to which they need to respond. \nThey may well identify problems for which they need to issue rules of \ngeneral applicability in that period, and we should not be tying their \nhands.\n  The bill would prohibit under its current language ``rule or general \norder of applicability on matters within the scope of the standard \nmarket design rule.''\n  The truth is, the standard market design rule covers everything but \nthe kitchen sink. So if you are saying you cannot issue rules of \ngeneral applicability on matters that are within the scope of that \nrule, you are basically saying you are blocked from issuing orders for \nthe next 3 years.\n  What kind of actions could this prevent? It could prevent the \nCommission from doing its job in many respects. FERC currently has a \nrule in process on interconnections to the transmission grid. No matter \nwhat that rule said, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would be \nprohibited from issuing it.\n  Other matters that are dealt with in the rule that FERC would be \nprevented from dealing with in a generic manner are such things as \nmarket oversight, market mitigation, transmission pricing, scope of the \nregional transmission organizations, the adequacy of rules for \ntransactions across regional transmission organization boundaries, and, \nin short, just about anything the Commission does about transmission or \nmarkets, because this standard market design rule, which we are \nblocking the implementation of, touches on all of those items. All of \nthose subjects are within the scope of that rule, and we are \nlegislating a prohibition not only against the rule but against any \nrule of general applicability within the scope of standard marketing.\n  I also believe some of the orders FERC issued in the western market \ncrisis would be defined as orders of general applicability and would \nhave been prohibited had this language been on the books at the time \nFERC was trying to deal with that crisis.\n  If another crisis occurs in the next 2 or 3 years, would we not want \nFERC to bring order to the market to deal with the crisis? Hopefully, \nwe will not wind up legislating a prohibition on their doing that.\n  I offered amendments to try to correct this language on the Senate \nfloor. They failed. I offered another amendment when we had our one \nmeeting of the conference on Monday of this week.\n  That was agreed to by a majority of Senate conferees but was rejected \nby the House. Then, of course, the Senate conferees receded to that. So \nI think this is a serious problem that undermines our efforts as a \nnation to ensure reliability of the system.\n  Let me go on to this issue of the crisis in western markets, and any \npossible future market crises that we may face. It is surprising to me \nhow soon we can forget. Just over a year ago, maybe 2 years ago now, we \nwere in the middle of a daily diet of newspaper stories and headlines \nabout the excesses of Enron and other power marketers and their \nmanipulation of California and other western markets. Now it seems as \nthough those shocking stories, that public outcry for Government to do \nsomething about that, is all gone, and we are on to other matters.\n  We have outlined many times before, and many of my colleagues in \ntheir statements have outlined, a parade of horrible schemes, deceitful \nschemes, that were put in place to defraud utilities and to ultimately \ndefraud consumers. The names are well known to all of us: Get Shorty, \nDeathStar, Ricochet, Black Widow, wash trades. This conference report \nprohibits wash trades or roundtrip trades, and that is good. I favor \nthat prohibition.\n  By doing so, the bill acknowledges that the Federal Power Act should \nprotect consumers against fraudulent and deceptive practices, but we \nonly mention one such practice: Roundtrip trading, these wash trades. \nThat is a circumstance where two participants in the market sell to \neach other the same amount of electricity at the same price in order to \nmake it appear they have more volume of transactions than they really \nhave; there is more going on. This also creates a sales volume for both \nthe sellers. This can be used to pad the reports of stockholders and \nanalysts and make the company look as if it is a better place to \ninvest. This practice should be prohibited.\n  The other practices involve creating artificial congestion on \ntransmission lines so that one can claim to have relieved the \ncongestion in order to collect a congestion rent. There were a number \nof colorfully named practices that were of this nature. Those clearly \nshould be prohibited as well.\n  Some would argue that we do not need to prohibit those; they are \nprohibited elsewhere. I do not believe that.\n\n[[Page S15220]]\n\nWhen FERC commissioners came before the committee last year, they told \nus these practices were not prohibited, that there was not much they \ncould do to deal with them. When other Senators seemed not to be \nconcerned about giving this authority, I could not really understand \nthat point of view. Clearly, there can always be other prosecutions for \nfraud, general fraud and all, but FERC, the agency with responsibility \nfor overseeing this sector of our industry, should have the authority \nto impose penalties and prohibit these practices. We need to give \nregulators who are charged with controlling these markets the tools \nthey need to do the job that needs to be done.\n  Senator Cantwell from Washington offered, and the Senate approved by \na vote of 57 to 39, an amendment that bans all forms of manipulation. \nUnfortunately, the conference report does not contain that language \nnow, language which was strongly supported in the Senate.\n  The other problem I mentioned when I started my comments, that I want \nto say a few more words about, is the problem of the financial \nmeltdowns that we saw as a result of unwise investments by utilities in \nnonutility ventures and the risk that brings to ratepayers.\n\n  The conference report repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act. \nI have supported repealing the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and \nI will explain why. But this conference report repeals that act without \nproviding adequate protection for consumers to replace the necessary \nprotections that were in that act. I have always taken the position \nthat we should repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act because it \nis no longer a useful device, but at the same time we should add \nauthority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to review mergers \nand to review dispositions of property by utilities so we can be sure \nconsumers and ratepayers are protected.\n  The conference report purports to contain such strengthening of \nauthority, but I would argue that, in fact, it weakens the authority of \nFERC to review mergers.\n  There are three problem areas that I see with this language. One is, \nthe jurisdiction over mergers; second, the failure to guard against \ncross-subsidies, which I think is very important and which was in the \nbill we passed through the Senate earlier; and third, the language \nwhich shifts the burden from the company to the Government if a merger \nthat is occurring is going to be stopped. It automatically occurs if \nthe Government does not act to keep it from occurring under this \nlanguage, and I think that is bad public policy.\n  FERC's merger authority is essential in this industry, which has been \nbased on a system of local and regional monopolies but which is moving \ntoward depending almost entirely on a competitive wholesale market for \nelectricity generation.\n  The industry is highly concentrated. Consolidation of generation and \ndistribution of transmission can prevent the development of a \ncompetitive market. One of the key failures in the bill, as I see it, \nis that the bill does not make the generation of energy or power a \nsubject that is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission. Without authority over this generation of power, FERC would \nhave to stand by and watch while this industry or parts of it \nreconcentrate. A single company could acquire every generator in the \nUnited States and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would have \nno authority under this act to deal with that problem. Or a single \ncompany could acquire every generator in a particular region and the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission would be unable to deal with it. \nThis is surely incompatible with the idea that we want to develop \ncompetitive markets.\n  Even when the transaction is only the sale of a facility, there are \nserious issues at stake. Many of the utilities that are in the \nheadlines lately are there because they are facing deep financial \nproblems that have come as a result of the utilities spinning off their \ngeneration capacity, their powerplants, to affiliates which then are in \nthe unregulated electricity market. Companies such as Xcel and \nAllegheny are experiencing extreme financial distress because of the \nactivities of their generation and marketing affiliates.\n  A second failure of the proposal is that it does not require FERC to \ncreate real protections against cross-subsidy and encumbrance of assets \nin the new merged company. In the bill that we passed in the Senate, we \nhad protections against cross-subsidy. We said the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission must determine that if someone is going to buy \nsomething that is not part of their utility business, they are not \ngoing to be cross-subsidizing some kind of nonutility activity.\n  Now, that is an essential protection for ratepayers. Otherwise, the \nratepayers find their electricity rates going up because the company is \nlosing money in some unrelated business. Clearly, we should protect \nconsumers against that.\n  The provisions we had in the Senate bill, the one we sent to \nconference, required that the transaction do no harm either to \ncompetition, consumers, or the capacity of regulators to regulate, and \nit required that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission determine \nthat there would not be a cross-subsidy to an affiliate company and \nthere would not be an encumbrance of the assets of the utility for the \nbenefit of some affiliate. That is a very important provision which, \nunfortunately, has been dropped from the bill.\n\n  In the past, all generation was owned by utility companies. Clearly, \nthat was under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission. If a utility merged with another utility, the merger was \nunder the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nunder the Federal Power Act.\n  But we are in a new world now, and generation can be separated from \nthe utility company, either sold to a stand-alone generation company or \nspun off to an affiliate of a holding company that owns the utility, \nand such sales or spinoffs would not be under their jurisdiction either \nunder the Federal Power Act, since the generation facilities are not \nunder the jurisdiction of FERC, or of course under PUHCA, since we are \ngoing to repeal PUHCA, the Public Utility Holding Company Act. So \nmergers of stand-alone generation companies would not be something FERC \ncould look at.\n  A third key weakness of the proposal is that it requires FERC to act \non a merger within a certain timeframe. It says that within 180 days, \nFERC needs to act. If FERC determines that is not enough time, it can \nextend that for another 180 days. But if it does not rule against the \nmerger at the end of the second 180 days, then the merger is approved. \nThat is putting the burden on the wrong end, in my view. I favor \nrequiring FERC to issue an order approving the merger, as is current \nlaw. This is a major weakening of current law we are being presented \nwith here.\n  These are only some of the problems in the electricity title. I have \nalso expressed concerns about the provisions that give the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission a role in monitoring markets that cut the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission and States out of such activities; \nalso, over a provision that raises the bar for the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission review on whether contracts are resulting in \nrates that are just and reasonable. I know others are going to address \nthose problems in their comments.\n  We have tried, at every opportunity during the long course of this \nlegislation, to correct these problems. We tried to offer amendments \nthat would strengthen the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's merger \nauthority, amendments to ban all forms of market manipulation, \namendments to clarify FERC's authority and to strike participant \nfunding language. We have not succeeded in making those changes. As a \nconsequence, we have a bill that in my view, I regret to conclude but I \ndo conclude, weakens consumer protections and reliability protections \nwith regard to electricity.\n  There are others here seeking the floor, wishing to speak. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to take some time on this \nbill. I think we should perhaps divide the time up a little bit here.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, if I may? I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to follow the Senator from Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S15221]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think we need to take a little time to \ntalk about the purpose of this bill. All we have heard, frankly, is \ncriticism. All we have heard is people being negative about the things \nthat are there. The fact is, what we need in this Congress, and in this \ncountry, is a policy. We had a policy last year, you will recall, that \nhad almost all the things about which the Senator from New Mexico \ntalked. It did not pass. We do not have an energy policy with all those \nthings he insists upon getting in there.\n  We hear from the Senator from California about the problems that \nhappened there. We need to go back and recollect some of the reasons \nthey happened in California. That was because the State didn't allow \nfor the development of energy, it didn't bring any transmission to get \nit into California, and they had some price controls on the retail but \nnot on the wholesale.\n  We need to go back and focus a little bit on what our real \nopportunity and obligation is here, and that is to have an energy \npolicy, a policy that deals with conservation, that deals with \nalternative sources of energy, that deals with research, so we can \ncontinue to use the energy we have now, but which also focuses on \ndomestic production.\n  We can talk all we want about where we are going to be in the future, \nand I hope we are with more alternatives and more renewables, but the \nfact is we will not have those for several years. The immediate need is \nto make sure we do not become even more dependent on imported oil and \ngas from places such as the Middle East and Iraq.\n  I want to take a minute and talk about some of the things that are \nvery positive here because there are very positive aspects to this \nenergy policy, keeping in mind it is an energy policy, keeping in mind, \nalso, that most of us would like to recognize the differences between \nthe regions in the country.\n  The idea of having FERC control all the details of operations doesn't \nwork. It is not acceptable. That is why it has changed this year, so we \ncan put emphasis on regional organizations so States can concentrate on \nhaving things work the way they work in one region that don't work in \nanother region.\n  That is one of the reasons that standard market design was not \nacceptable to most people. It has been modified in this bill so it is \nnot laid on the country originally. There are certainly opportunities \nfor FERC to exercise their responsibilities, as they should, but after \nthe States have had an opportunity to work as States and then to work \nas regions. This is the direction we are seeking to go.\n  Let me go back just a moment to some of the things we seldom hear \npeople talking about in the Chamber about which, it seems to me, we \nshould be talking. One is energy efficiency. We require a 20 percent \nreduction in Federal building energy use by 2013. There is an effort to \ndo something about it in the conservation area. The bill authorizes \n$3.4 billion for low-income housing, to be able to assist that housing \nin being more energy efficient. Our demand for energy--the production \nof coal, for example, in the last 5 years has doubled our energy. We \nare continuing to increase our demand, yet we are becoming more \nrestrictive on our production.\n  We have to balance these things. That is what is done here, is to \nseek to get more energy efficiency. We seek to establish new energy \nefficiency standards for commercial and consumer uses of products, such \nas stoves and refrigerators and those kinds of things. We need to do \nthat.\n\n  We also emphasize renewables. The talk here is we don't give enough \nattention to renewables. As a matter of fact, we do. There are \nincentive programs authorizing $300 million for solar programs with the \ngoal of installing 20,000 solar rooftop systems in Federal buildings.\n  It authorizes over a half billion dollars for biomass projects. These \nare things that have potential but have not been moved. This is \ndesigned to provide incentives so those things can move forward. It \nauthorizes $100 million in increased hydropower production to increase \nefficiency of dams.\n  So we have goals of increasing renewables by 75 percent over just a \nfew years.\n  Clean coal technology--coal is our largest resource of fossil fuel. \nIt now produces nearly 60 percent of the electricity in this country. \nIt ought to be used as opposed to gas, for example, because we are \ngoing to have more of that and gas is more flexible for other uses. But \nwhat we want to do is perfect and increase and make better the \ngeneration facilities so we can have clean air, so we can protect the \nenvironment at the same time that we use this fuel.\n  The Senator from New Mexico was talking about transmission. Certainly \nyou are going to have to have more of that. You have to start where the \nfuel is and go to the marketplace. That takes transmission. That takes \nmovement of that kind. So we need to prepare for that, and that is what \nregional transmission organizations are for, so you can move interstate \nas you move in regions.\n  The States can agree on what we do there.\n  We talk about vehicles and fuels. Advanced vehicle programs: $200 \nmillion for that; and clean schoolbus programs. We are putting a great \ndeal of money into the development of hydrogen for use in automobiles \nand elsewhere.\n  This idea that all we are doing is giving credits for production of \ncoal, oil, and gas is not true. That just isn't the case. There are \nlots of other things in here, as a matter of fact.\n  We continue to increase funding for the Department of Transportation \nto work on improving CAFE standards so we will get better mileage out \nof the cars. I mentioned hydrogen. It is one of the real opportunities.\n  As I said, this is a broad policy. It follows what the administration \nbegan several years ago to have a policy for the future of energy \nproduction for this country. We need to deal with it in a broad way. \nThis bill does.\n  I understand the people who seem to be concerned about it pick out \nthose little things, and that is all they talk about. But we need to \ntake a look at the broad bill and what it does. One of them, of course, \nis it gives some incentives for increasing production. That is what we \nneed to do if we are going to continue to have the lights on and \ncontinue to drive our cars in the years to come.\n  We have to have production. We have ways to do that. I happen to come \nfrom a production State. We can produce more. At the same time, we can \nprotect the environment.\n  These are issues that we talk about here in terms of transporting. \nFor instance, we can produce more natural gas in Wyoming, and we can \nhave a pipeline to get it to the marketplace. We are in the process of \ndoing that. This helps considerably. The same thing is true with \nelectric transmission.\n  There are a great many details which we could go into here. A lot of \npeople have talked about the cost. There is a cost.\n  Let me tell you very briefly, from a conservation standpoint, that \nthere are tax credits for energy efficiency. That is a pretty good \nthing to be doing--tax credits for producing electricity from certain \nrenewables. I believe that is the direction we want to move--and fuel-\nefficient vehicles. Some of these tax credits are going to create more \nconservation.\n  We have talked about reliability in relation to the California \nsituation.\n  There are some incentives for accelerating depreciation; and natural \ngas-gathering lines so we continue to produce.\n  These are a great many things of that kind.\n  Production by marginal wells is one of the areas that needs to be \nvisited. A lot of older wells only produce a few barrels a day. There \nhas to be some incentive to continue to do that. But it is a very \nimportant production aspect so we are not totally reliable on imports.\n  I see others on the floor who are going to be more positive than we \nhave heard for a while. So I will slow down here. But I do suggest that \nwe take a look at our demand for energy and take a look at the growth \nof demand for energy. Look around in your own family, in your own \nbusiness, and in your own place where you are sitting right now. How \nmuch increased demand do we have for energy? Then take a little look at \nwhere we are going to be in 10 or 15 years from now. How are we going \nto deal with that? That is really what policy is about.\n\n[[Page S15222]]\n\n  Take a little look at this bill and you will find we are talking \nabout conservation, renewables, and domestic production so we can meet \nthe needs on which all of us would agree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand Senator Jeffords will follow \nthe Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The chairman of the full committee has just come to the \nfloor. Senator Cornyn is on the floor ready to speak. Senator Jeffords \nhas such time as he will consume. I was going to offer a unanimous \nconsent to allow Senator Cornyn to speak, to be followed by Senator \nDomenici. Is there any objection to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on Monday, I addressed the Senate to \nshare my concerns about the environmental impact of the Energy \nconference report. These provisions are a direct reflection of the \nmanner in which this bill was developed and the flawed conference \nprocess used to produce it.\n  Nearly 100 sections of this bill are in the jurisdiction of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. We were not consulted on any of \nthese provisions--not on any of them.\n  In some cases, such as on the issue of nuclear security, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee reported legislation on a \nbipartisan basis. The Senate could have taken up the reported bill and \npassed it.\n  Instead, they stuck the provisions of the original introduced version \nof this bill in this report. Now my committee will likely have to go \nback and clean up this language if the bill becomes law. This could \nhave been avoided, if the conferees had spoken to my committee in the \nfirst place.\n  I am deeply concerned that the conference report before us does not \nrepresent the kind of forward-looking, balanced energy policy that our \nNation needs. As I mentioned earlier this week, it does not go far \nenough in reducing our reliance on imported oil. Further, the bill \nfails to provide appropriate and adequate remedies to prevent a \nrecurrence of the electricity blackout the Northeast experienced this \nsummer or the crisis that the West experienced 3 years ago.\n  The Energy legislation fails to address other important issues such \nas a renewable portfolio standard or climate change.\n  The bill contains waivers of environmental laws, and it provides for \nunjustified subsidies and porkbarrel programs. But, worst of all, this \nbill seriously harms our environment.\n  On November 7, 2003, I wrote all Members of the Senate listing seven \nof what I believe to be the most troubling environmental provisions of \nthis conference report. The Environment and Public Works Committee has \njurisdiction over all of these items. Six of the seven items outlined \nin my letter are now in the bill. The bill has not one but two \nprovisions extending compliance deadlines for Federal ozone pollution \nstandards.\n  I also mentioned in my letter that I was concerned the bill would \ndelay our new Federal mercury emission standards for utilities. It \ndoesn't do that. Instead, it authorizes $1.5 billion in compliance \nassistance grants for the utilities. Instead, the bill proposes to pay \nup to 50 percent of these compliance costs. This is poor policy.\n  I would like to review the status of some of the other provisions I \ndescribed in my November 7 letter in more detail.\n  First, I would like to let colleagues know that the renewable fuels \ntitle in the conference report differs significantly from the language \nreported by the Environment and Public Works Committee in the 107th \nCongress. The provisions that my committee reported were ones contained \nin the energy legislation that the Senate passed this year and last \nyear.\n  This conference report will shield companies that make, use, or \nmarket toxic gasoline additive MTBE from Federal and State product \nliability lawsuits.\n  Let me repeat that. It will shield companies that make, use, or \nmarket the toxic gasoline additive MTBE from Federal and State product \nliability lawsuits.\n  MTBE has contaminated ground water in every State of this Nation. \nThis provision was not included in the Senate-passed bill. This \nprovision shifts an estimated $29 billion in cleanup costs from oil and \nchemical companies to State and local American taxpayers.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that there are at least \n150,000 MTBE-contaminated sites nationwide.\n  Vermont has 851 of those sites. Public and private drinking water \nsystems in my State have been polluted by MTBE. If the water right here \nin the Capitol building was contaminated with MTBE, we would ban this \ntoxin today.\n  Even though we know MTBE is environmentally harmful, the conference \nreport dramatically extends the time that this product can be added to \nour gasoline before we pull it off the market. In fact, it may be \nextended forever.\n  Besides the MTBE problem, the renewable fuels provisions in this \nconference report are deeply flawed.\n  The Senate's renewable fuels title was a carefully drafted package \nwhich balanced regional interests. Now, it is unbalanced in so many \nways.\n  For instance, the Senate put positive environmental provisions into \nour renewable fuels package. One provision allowed Northeastern States \nto require reformulated gasoline statewide.\n  We also provided the Environmental Protection Agency with the \nauthority to better regulate fuel additives to prevent future MTBE-like \nsituations.\n  We provided States with authority to reduce the emissions from fuels \nif too much ethanol was being used. These are all gone.\n  Although I support renewable fuels and ethanol, this package has \nchanged so dramatically that it is harmful to the air and water. I \ncannot support using the fuels provisions of the Clean Air Act to \ndamage air quality.\n  A second item from my letter is the treatment of ozone pollution \nstandards in the conference report.\n  The conferees have agreed to include an extraneous new provision \namending the ozone nonattainment designation process in Title I of the \nClean Air Act.\n  This is the part of the act that officially tells the public how \ndirty or clean the air is. It tells the public whether their area meets \nthe health-based ozone standards and it determines what must be done to \nhelp clean up the air in that area and for its downwind areas.\n  This is an entirely new provision, it was not considered by either \nthe Senate or the House of Representatives.\n  This provision, inserted in the secret conference, would allow \npolluted areas off the hook for controlling ozone pollution for years \nat a time. It would extend the deadline for compliance with the ozone \nstandard almost indefinitely for many areas.\n  It would also reach back in time and declare some cities with serious \nair quality problems as ``clean.'' This whole provision is a direct \nattack on the Clean Air Act and bad for public health.\n  As a result, people downwind will suffer. The air of the communities \ndownwind of these ``extended compliance'' or ``reclassified'' areas \nwill get dirtier. There will be more asthma and more respiratory \nproblems.\n  This provision is not the answer to transported pollution. The answer \nis for this administration to get cracking on protecting air quality.\n  Changing cities' ozone compliance deadlines under the Clean Air Act \ndoes not increase our Nation's alternative energy supplies.\n  This provision is not an energy policy measure. It does not offer an \nenergy-related solution to compliance with ozone pollution standards, \nand does not belong in this bill.\n  The changes put in here by a Congressman from Texas are also unfair \nto States and cities that have already achieved compliance with the \nnational ozone standards. These States and cities have worked hard and \ninvested resources in controlling their pollution.\n\n[[Page S15223]]\n\nAll their work will have been for naught.\n  There are other cities that have been ``bumped up'' or classified as \nhaving more serious ozone problems. EPA has already asked them to \nundertake more stringent ozone control efforts.\n  These stronger measures are already required and being implemented in \nnumerous cities throughout the Nation including: Chicago, Milwaukee, \nBaltimore, Philadelphia, New York, Wilmington, Trenton, Los Angeles, \nand Sacramento.\n  Mr. President, in addition to this general assault on public health, \nthe conferees have included one other little gem. EPA is prohibited \nfrom imposing any requirements of the Clean Air Act on an area of \nSouthwest Michigan for 2 years.\n  Obviously, this provision was also not contained in either the Senate \nor House bills. Nor is it good public health policy.\n  Not only is the Clean Air Act substantially amended in this bill, but \nthe Clean Water Act is as as well. The conferees have included language \nsimilar to a provision in the House-passed bill that exempts oil and \ngas exploration and production activities from the Clean Water Act \nstormwater program.\n  The Clean Water Act requires permits for stormwater discharges \nassociated with industrial activity. The conference report exempts oil \nand gas construction sites from stormwater pollution control \nrequirements.\n  The scope of the provision is extremely broad. Stormwater runoff \ntypically contains pollutants such as oil and grease, chemicals, \nnutrients, metals, bacteria, and particulates.\n  According to EPA estimates, this change would exempt at least 30,000 \nsmall oil and gas sites from clean water requirements. That is a \nterrible rollback of current law.\n  Another troubling section of this bill is the leaking underground \nstorage tank provisions. This issue is also in the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee jurisdiction.\n  This is another case where my committee unanimously passed a bill \nthat is stronger than the provisions in this conference report.\n  The conference report's inspection provisions are so lax that a tank \nlast inspected in 1999 may not be reinspected until 2009. The bill my \ncommittee passed, and that I supported, would require inspections of \nall tanks every 2 years.\n  While the underground tank program needs reform, the conference \nreport takes a step backward. It allows leaking tanks to remain \nundetected for years. And, in many cases, it allows the polluter off \nthe hook for cleaning up his own mess.\n  Let's review what we are debating today: An energy bill. Actually, it \nis an energy producers' bill; an energy polluters' bill; an energy \nprofiteers' bill.\n  The three Ps: Producers, polluters, profiteers.\n  I would like to focus briefly on the polluters.\n  A senior member of the conference committee reported that, yes, this \nbill will not reduce our reliance on polluting sources of energy. But \nit will secure our energy independence.\n  I agree with the first statement, that with this bill our Nation \nbecomes more addicted to energy sources that pollute. In fact, I would \nsay that this energy bill equals pollution.\n  Four words and a numeric symbol say it all here on my chart.\n  Energy bill equals pollution.\n  This bill pollutes our surface and groundwater by exempting oil and \ngas development from provisions of the Clean Water Act.\n  This bill pollutes our drinking water by allowing MTBE, a toxic fuel \nadditive, to seep into our public and private drinking water systems.\n  This bill pollutes our land by allowing unlimited development of \nenergy installations on public lands, including parks, wildlife \nrefuges, and sensitive areas.\n  And this bill pollutes our air in so many different ways; primarily \nby extending pollution compliance deadlines and continuing to avoid \nserious progress in cleaning up our air.\n  Pollution, that is what we are voting on in this legislation.\n  A vote for this bill is a vote for greater pollution.\n  This is wrong. The American people do not want energy security at the \nexpense of the environment. The word ``conservation'' and the word \n``conservative'' are closely related. I am an independent Senator, but \nI consider myself to be a careful legislator.\n  I seek to be conservative. I try not to support legislation that \nexploits our natural resources and pollutes our environment. This bill \nabandons that approach. It is an aggressive, overreaching measure. I \noppose this bill, and all other Senators should as well.\n  Mr. President, one last thing I should note for interested Members is \nthat this Barton ozone provision is not the same as the former Clinton \n``bump-up'' policy. That policy was a case-by-case basis and it applied \nonly to the outgoing 1-hour ozone standard.\n  Also, the areas receiving the benefit of not being ``bumped-up'' to a \nhigher nonattainment status under the Clinton policy had to demonstrate \nthat their emissions did not cause problems downwind. That protection \nappears nowhere in Barton.\n  This Barton provision completely disrupts the Clean Air Act's \ndesignation process and appears to do it indefinitely.\n  I hope the Congressman from Texas is willing to pay the hospital and \ndoctor bills of all the children whose health he and his Congress will \ndamage if this bad bill becomes law. Every person who votes for cloture \nand for this bill should also be held responsible.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a one-page \nexplanation of how the Barton provision is different from the former \nClinton policy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Barton's Ozone Extension Provision Is Far Different Than 1994 Clinton \n                           ``Bump-Up'' Policy\n\n       The 1994 policy explicitly states that the policy should \n     apply only where ``transport from an area with a later \n     attainment date makes it practicably impossible to attain the \n     standard by its own attainment date.''\n       The 1994 policy says that in this situation where it is \n     ``impossible'' to meet clean air standards due to transport, \n     the attainment date may be extended, but the new attainment \n     date must be ``as soon as practicable based on the maximum \n     acceleration practicable for emissions reductions in the \n     downwind area and in the upwind area.''\n       Barton's provision (Section 1443 of H.R. 6) is not limited \n     to situations where transport makes attainment of clean air \n     ``impossible.'' It applies wherever there is a ``significant \n     contribution'' due to transport.\n       What does ``significant contribution'' mean? It is \n     undefined in Barton's provision, but typically significant \n     means ``able to be detected or measured.'' That is a much, \n     much less restrictive standard than the approach under the \n     Clinton administration's 1994 policy.\n       And unlike the 1994 policy which discusses ``maximum \n     acceleration practicable for emissions reductions'' in upwind \n     areas, section 1443 does nothing to address upwind sources of \n     air pollution.\n       Another big difference between the Clinton administration \n     policy and Section 1443 is that Section 1443 is not limited \n     to the one-hour ozone standard. Section 1443 also applies to \n     the eight-hour ozone standard.\n       In 1998, when EPA revised their transport policy, they knew \n     it would be short-lived. EPA had promulgated a new eight-hour \n     standard in 1997. By applying this policy to the eight-hour \n     ozone standard, Section 1443 will likely have adverse affects \n     on air quality for years and years to come.\n       EPA has done no analysis regarding the public health \n     impacts of expanding this policy from the one-hour standard \n     to the eight-hour standard.\n       However, Abt Associates, a leading air pollution consulting \n     firm, found that delaying action meet the 8-hour ozone \n     standard for even one year would result in: Over 387,400 \n     asthma attacks; almost 4,900 hospitalizations due to \n     respiratory distress; and over 573,300 missed school days.\n       Rep. Barton has contended that this provision would just \n     give EPA the discretion to grant a deadline extension if \n     appropriate and that it would not require a deadline \n     extension. However, the language is mandatory. If section \n     1443 is enacted, then it creates a new section 181(d)(2) of \n     the Clean Air Act which says EPA ``shall extend the \n     attainment date'' for downwind areas.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes about \nthe Energy bill conference report that is before this body, and \nspecifically address some of the criticisms that have been made against \na clean fuel additive that was mandated by Congress under the Clean Air \nAct, and which was specifically certified for use by the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  But, first, let me just speak more generally about the need for a \nnational\n\n[[Page S15224]]\n\nenergy policy in this country. We are a country that likes to consume a \nlot of energy--whether it is gasoline, natural gas, coal--because it \nimproves our quality of life and because it is key to growth in our \neconomy and our prosperity, which, in turn, creates jobs so people can \nprovide for their families.\n  At the same time, we are a country that loves and cherishes our \nenvironment, whether it is clean water or clean air. We know that by \nconsuming energy we need to also take necessary steps to protect our \nair and our water and our environment at the same time. We do not want \nto be forced to choose one or the other. We want, and I believe we can \nhave, both. We can have the energy we need in order to maintain our \nquality of life and our prosperity and to fuel our economy, and we can \nalso have that energy supply produced and consumed in a way that \nprotects the environment against unreasonable damage.\n  The reason I support this Energy bill is not because I believe it is \nperfect. I do not believe there is such a bill, unless the person \ntalking happens to be the author of that bill. That is probably the \nonly bill any of us would agree was perfect, the one that we were able \nto write by ourselves. But, of course, that is not the way it happens. \nThat is not the way the Founding Fathers conceived of legislation \npassing.\n  So what we have is a bill that has some strengths and some \nweaknesses. But, on the whole, I support this bill because I believe, \nfor the first time in at least 10 years, it means America has the hope \nfor a national energy policy that not only serves our economic \ninterests but serves our national security interests as well.\n  About 60 percent of the fuel we consume in this country is imported. \nOver the years, as we have consumed more and more energy, we have also \nbecome more and more dependent on imports from other parts of the \nworld. We know one of those locations in the world is the Middle East, \nwhich is the subject, of course, of daily news reports. We know how \ntroubled it is. We know how volatile that area of the world is. It \nmeans our energy supply is in jeopardy. Thank goodness we have been \nable to secure a steady supply of fuel, but it is at risk--as much at \nrisk as the next headline, the next news flash, where we learn that \nsome terrorist activity or some disruption of our energy supply is \ncaused by other governments and other people beyond our control.\n  So I think what we need to do, and what this Energy bill does, is \nencourage innovation and increase productivity here in America so we \nare less dependent on imported energy. I think that is a good thing.\n  What we have right now is a schizophrenic energy policy in this \ncountry, one that squanders our strength in terms of our natural \nresources. It discourages innovation, and it leaves consumers too \nvulnerable.\n\n  There are specifically some interests that relate to my State of \nTexas in this bill that I want to talk about, but this is a bill that \nis not just good for Texas, this is a bill that is good for the entire \nNation. It moves us one step forward, and it is one that I believe is \nin the best interests of the American people.\n  There has been some criticism of the provisions of this bill as they \nrelate to a chemical called MTBE. The technical term is methyl \ntertiary-butyl ether.\n  Now, people may wonder why we are talking about MTBEs, and why it is \nso important. Well, the truth is, this was mandated, the use of \nreformulated gasoline, in the Clean Air Act about 20 years ago because \nwhat Congress recognized was that unless we could find ways to burn \ngasoline in a cleaner, more environmentally friendly way, then we were \ngoing to have dirtier air.\n  So Congress mandated the use of reformulated gasoline. American \nenterprise, as it does so well, innovated, created this product, which \nhas then been used over the last 20 years and has enabled literally \nmillions of people with lung disease, asthma, and the elderly to \nbreathe easier. In other words, this oxygenate, as it is called, this \nchemical compound, has improved the public health in this country over \nthe last 20 years. We are a better and healthier Nation for it.\n  As a result of this Federal mandate that reformulated gasoline be \nused, and that something be innovated and created to allow gasoline to \nburn cleaner so we may breathe easier, people in my State and around \nthe country began to produce MTBE. And you do not do that overnight. It \ntakes a lot of infrastructure. It takes a lot of investment to produce \nthis particular product.\n  Indeed, 70 percent of MTBE is produced in the State of Texas and, not \ncoincidentally, it creates a lot of jobs in our State. It is used in \nparts of the United States which are among the most polluted because we \nuniversally recognize that the use of reformulated gasoline and this \nparticular oxygenate is important to reducing pollution and improving \nthe public health.\n  Well, the problem is--that this Energy bill seeks to identify--in \nsome places we have seen that people who store MTBE in storage tanks \nhave not kept those tanks in good repair and they have leaked this \noxygenate into the surrounding environment.\n  But rather than address their ire and their concern--a concern which \nI share--at those who maintain leaking tanks, we have people focusing \non this chemical compound--which has not been shown to be harmful to \npublic health but which, indeed, has improved the quality of the air we \nbreath over these last 20 years--people who want to opportunistically \nclaim that this chemical is somehow dangerous, when, in fact, the fault \nlies with those who do not maintain the tank in which this chemical is \nstored.\n  We realize--and common sense would tell us--that whether it is \ngasoline or whatever the product is, if it is in a leaky tank, once it \ngets out of that tank into the surrounding environment, it can cause \nsome harm. Common sense tells us that. But rather than focus on the \nleaky tanks and the people who have negligently allowed those tanks to \nleak, we have people who want to aim their crosshairs at the people who \nproduce MTBE, which has improved public health and air quality.\n  What this bill simply does is provide a safe harbor provision for \nthose who have produced this product, which has improved the public \nhealth, and says: We are not going to stab you in the back for doing \nwhat the Federal Government asked you to do in the first place.\n  In other words, the Federal Government said: Please invest your \nmoney, Mr. Businessman. Please create this infrastructure to produce \nthis reformulated gas additive that allows our air to be cleaner.\n  We are not going to let that happen and then years later, when \nperhaps memories dim and when someone has another idea, to say: Yes, we \nhave you. Now you are going to be liable for money damages because you \nhave done what Congress and the EPA asked you to do. We don't care \nabout the benefit to the public health by producing clean air because \nnow all we are concerned about is getting the people who have, perhaps, \nthe deep pockets.\n  What we are discussing, in terms of the safe harbor, is a provision \nthat ensures fairness, that preserves the trust that is so important to \nguaranteeing that we in this country have the benefits of the \ninnovation that the free enterprise system provides and that improves \nall of our lives.\n  I hope we are not going to say to those who place their trust in \nUncle Sam, when Uncle Sam says, please, Mr. Businessman, innovate and \ncreate a product that is going to improve public health, we are not \ngoing to allow that to be turned into a liability. There are some who \nwant it to turn into a liability. In fundamental fairness, as well as \nour collective interest in the innovation that comes in the free \nenterprise system, when people step up and produce a product from which \nwe all benefit, we should not let that innovation and we should not let \nthat commitment and that trust suffer as a result of this legislation.\n  I congratulate Chairman Domenici and the conference committee for \nstanding strong in the interest of fairness. It is true that over the \nnext 15 years, MTBE will be phased out. There will be other products \nthat will step in to provide cleaner burning gasoline, those that are \nbased on ethanol. But, frankly, unless the safe harbor provision stays \nin this bill, if I were someone who was going to produce an ethanol-\nbased gasoline additive to produce a cleaner burning fuel, I would be \nvery skeptical about investing the money, about developing a product \nthat will clean our air, because I would worry that just as those who \nare targeting MTBE, we would be back here 10 or 15\n\n[[Page S15225]]\n\nyears from now, saying: We caught you. And what are you guilty of? You \nare guilty of trusting Uncle Sam and Congress. Now we are going to let \nentrepreneurial lawyers and others make claims regarding the very \nproduct that you designed in order to meet the needs of the American \npeople. They are going to sue you for it and try to take everything you \nhave and more.\n  I don't think that would be fair. I don't think that would be right. \nFrankly, I wanted to come out here and talk a little bit about how we \ngot to this place because I think anybody who understands the complete \nstory would understand that while this bill phases out MTBE use over \nthe next 15 years, it also, at the same time, preserves the trust that \nis so important to getting investment in innovative products that make \nthe public health better.\n  Manufacturers will be extremely reluctant to invest in other \nadditives without some confidence that the Federal Government will not \nallow those investments to become the basis of future liability.\n  In short, the bill Chairman Domenici and the conference committee \nhave crafted ensures that clean alternative fuels will not be regarded \nas unreasonably dangerous simply because they comply with Federal \nmandates. It is important to say, though, that if someone is negligent, \nwhether it is maintaining a leaky tank that contains MTBE or any other \nproduct, and it causes harm, they are not protected by the language in \nthis bill in any way. There is no defense or immunity from a suit for \nnegligent conduct.\n  I have heard some say that MTBE is a threat to public health. As I \nsaid, MTBE on the whole has benefited public health. The truth is, it \nis one of the most widely studied chemicals in commerce, including the \npharmaceutical industry. The overwhelming majority of scientific \nevaluations to date have not identified a single health-related risk \nfrom the intended use of MTBE in gasoline. Numerous government and \nworld-renowned independent health organizations to date have found no \ncompelling reason to classify MTBE as even a possible cause of harm to \nhuman beings. Because MTBE manufacturers have complied with the \nrequirements of the federally mandated program, MTBE should receive the \nequivalent legal treatment as ethanol for the reasons I have mentioned: \nfor reasons of fairness and sound energy and consumer policy, and to \nencourage the kind of investment that ultimately will improve and \nmaintain the public health.\n  The facts that demonstrate the need for a comprehensive energy policy \nthat this bill represents are overwhelming. Gas prices are at $1.50 and \nabove in most areas of the country. Natural gas prices at the burner \ntip are more than $9 per 1,000 cubic feet. This summer, as we will \nrecall, 20 percent of the Nation faced a total blackout which lasted \nmore than 8 hours. If now is not the time to pass comprehensive energy \nlegislation, I ask my colleagues: When is? If now is not the time to \npass comprehensive energy legislation where America can again have a \ncoherent and comprehensive energy policy that protects our economy and \nour national security, when will we pass such a bill and embrace such a \npolicy? We should do so without any hesitation and without any further \ndelay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was going to go next, but I note the \nattendance of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. He would like \nto speak, and I will yield to him.\n  Let me make one or two observations regarding the speech just \ndelivered. First, I thank the Senator from Texas for the \nreasonableness, the rationality of his discussion. He would not \nbelieve, the people who have listened to the debate over the last \ncouple of days would not believe the facts as you have described them, \nwhich are the facts, with reference to MTBE. This bill does not say if \nsomebody misuses MTBE, negligently spills it, if they have tanks that \nleak, if they are not careful to keep it where it is supposed to be, it \ndoesn't say those kinds of actions are rendered nonactionable in tort \nliability.\n  The safe harbor is very narrow. It says the producer of the product, \nwhich has been determined by the Government and to date determined by \nscientists to be totally safe and very effective, it says those who \nmade the product are not liable for the mere fact of making it and \nselling it. They are not liable. If it causes harm because of other \nactions with reference to it, then the hold harmless does not apply. \nThat is what the Senator has been telling us today; plus, he has \nenlightened us that, even as we speak today, contrary to the elaborate \nstatements regarding people who have been damaged and hurt, the \nscientists in the Government still say, as a product, it is safe; as a \nproduct, it is tremendously effective; and as a product, the Government \nisn't even considering doing anything about it. They are not out there \nsaying we want to stop it. I have not heard that from the EPA or anyone \nelse--I think because they would have no evidence--that there is \nanything wrong with the product.\n\n  I say to everybody in this country who wants ethanol, ethanol may \nprove, as an additive, in 15 years to cause some damage. Are we going \nto go back 15 years and say to the farmers who grew the crops that went \ninto ethanol: You are collectively, as the farmers of America, liable \nfor producing the corn that produced ethanol that produced a problem 15 \nyears later? I doubt it, because I don't think anybody would be down \nhere saying we want to stick all these hundreds of thousands of \nfarmers. But right now we are saying: Have at it, trial lawyers, we \nhope you can get after these guys because somebody got hurt. Sue the \ncompanies that produced it. People are saying: After all, they are rich \ncompanies.\n  That is not the American judicial system. Liability is not based on \nwhether you have a successful company. As a matter of fact, one of the \nreasons some people are upset about this safe harbor is that they think \nthe ones with money are the ones that are going to be in this safe \nharbor; namely, those that produced a product. They don't think there \nis going to be enough money for them out there in the marketplace where \nother things have gone wrong. They don't want to have to look for \npeople who had leaky tanks and sue them and their insurance companies. \nThey want to leave that to somebody else, right? They want to go after \none of these companies--I don't know which one--and a number of them \nare in Texas. People will say: There is that old Texas again.\n  Well, Texas has about 13 companies that produce various products \nrelated to this whole area, not just this. Some of them produce this \nproduct. If I were the Senator from Texas, I would be right here doing \nwhat he is doing. The Senator is not opposed to those companies, right, \nor embarrassed by them? He is saying: Good luck. He is not embarrassed \nthat they are making money. I assume they pay a salary to people in his \nState. I assume these towns like them. They are not doing anything to \nthese towns. There is no pollution in the towns where it is being \nproduced.\n  Those who would kill this bill over this issue have said to the \nfarmers of the United States who want to use their crops to produce \nethanol--if you vote this bill down based on this MTBE issue, you are \nsaying to the farmers in your States--there are 12 or 15 of them--that \nhave lots of corn and soybeans: We are taking the trial lawyers over \nyou. You are saying: We have a choice to make and tomorrow morning we \nwill make it, and we will choose the trial lawyers; we want to help \nthem and forget about the farmers. That is the issue, as I see it. This \nwill not end because we are going to go into MTBE today in a little \nmore detail.\n  I yield to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  (Mr. GRAHAM from South Carolina assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for the work he has \ndone on this legislation. It has been difficult and time-consuming, and \nit has occupied a great deal of his time. It seems to me that \neverything the Energy bill does in terms of traditional oil and gas \nexploration and development, and what it does in geothermal, \nencouraging wind power and alternate fuels, has sort of become \nsecondary to the question of MTBE.\n  I guess Americans who are watching this debate where we are talking \nabout an Energy bill might say the whole thing will rise or fall on \nwhat Congress does with MTBE. They would say:\n\n[[Page S15226]]\n\nWhat are you talking about? Energy security, energy efficiency, and \nlessening our dependence upon foreign imports; that is all part of this \nlegislation. It does a good job in that area. Could it do more? Of \ncourse. But it does a good, solid job in working with the issues of \nelectricity and traditional oil and gas development and alternative \nfuels.\n  So the question now comes down, for many on my side of the aisle, to \nwhat Congress is doing with MTBE. I thought I would try, in a limited \nway and in a limited amount of time, to explain what I think the issue \nis.\n  The legislation establishes for MTBE--which is a fuel additive, to \nmake fuel burn cleaner, like ethanol--the same standards for liability \nfor one who produces it and misuses it as it does for ethanol. What \ndoes it mean? The legislation simply says you cannot sue a manufacturer \nof this fuel additive because it is a defective product if it is made \naccording to the standards to which the Government told them to make \nit. Congress mandated that people produce MTBE to be a fuel additive so \nthat gasoline would burn cleaner. You can add ethanol or you can add \nMTBE, and the results are that you have a cleaner product.\n  Some in this country say: Well, if MTBE gets into the drinking water, \nthe ground water, we ought to be able to sue the manufacturers because \nthey have produced a defective product--even though they have nothing \nto do with the injuries or the damage that occurred.\n  What I mean by that is this. Here is an example. Suppose somebody \ngoes down to the local Exxon station and they buy 100 gallons of \ngasoline, and then that person takes the 100 gallons of gasoline and \ndumps it into the drinking water system of their hometown. Should \nsomeone be able to sue Exxon because they have made a product that this \nperson dumped into the river system or the drinking water system? Of \ncourse not. They would be laughed out of court. If the Exxon service \nstation took the 100 gallons of their gasoline and dumped it into the \nriver system, then Exxon, the seller and manufacturer of that product, \nwould be negligent and would be responsible, and you could sue them.\n  But there are numerous lawsuits brought against the manufacturers of \nMTBE, not because they did anything wrong with the product they make; \nthe product is made to be put into gasoline to make it burn cleaner. It \nis made according to the standards set up and required by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  So the legislation says: Wait a minute, you cannot sue the \nmanufacturer for doing what Congress told them to do in making a \nproduct that, if used in a correct manner, is very efficient, \neffective, and helps clean up the environment.\n  Some say: No, we want to sue them because it is a defective product. \nThe product is only defective if someone misuses it. Then they ought to \nbe able to be sued. They should be responsible.\n  Somebody gave me the analogy of a company that makes baseball bats. \nIf somebody buys a baseball bat and takes it home and beats up his wife \nor his children, or the wife beats up her husband, then someone should \nnot be able to sue the manufacturer of the baseball bat. Of course not.\n  The bat, if used for its intended purpose to play the game of \nbaseball, is not a defective product. That is the purpose for which it \nwas manufactured. If someone uses it to cause harm, they should be \nresponsible, not the manufacturer of the bat, not the manufacturer of \nthe product.\n  If MTBE is used as it is supposed to be used and made according to \nthe standards Congress told it to be made by, it is not a defective \nproduct; it is a very valuable product. The legislation simply says if \nthe product is used according to how it should be used, you can't sue \nthe manufacturer because someone else misuses it.\n  The important thing is that it does not deny an injured person \nredress or the opportunity to sue if damage is done. The proposed \nlanguage in the chairman's bill makes it abundantly clear that any \nclaims of negligence or spills or drinking water contamination can go \nforward in the judicial process. That is part of the chairman's \nlegislation. The only claim that is restricted is suing someone who \nmakes a product according to the formula they are supposed to make it; \nthey cannot be sued for making something that we told them to make in \nthe first place. Not only is that common sense, it is good judicial \nsense. That is what the bill says.\n  I read the legislation. I said: What is everybody talking about? \nBecause it can't possibly be true. Guess what. It is not. The lawsuits \nthat are still available to proceed against misuse of these areas are \nsubstantial. It specifically maintains claims for environmental \nremediation costs. You can still sue for drinking water contamination. \nYou can still sue for negligence, for spills, or other reasonably \nforeseeable events. You can still sue for public or private nuisance. \nYou can still sue for trespass. You can still sue for breach of \nwarranty. You can still sue for breach of contract. And you can still \nsue for any other liability, other than a liability based on the claim \nthat you made a bad product and, therefore, you ought to be liable for \ndamages. I think that is something no reasonable person would say is \nneeded or necessary.\n  I was reading the language. You can talk about papers and this group \nsent out this piece of paper and that group sent out this piece of \npaper, and we get all this material about ``vote against this'' and \n``vote for it.'' Every now and then it becomes important, I say to the \nchairman, to actually read the legislation. You cannot put a spin on \nthe words of the legislation. Legislation is not a political document \nfrom the Democratic Policy Committee nor a political document from the \nRepublican Policy Committee. It is the language on which we are going \nto be voting.\n  The language says very clearly that ``nothing in this subsection''--\nin the bill--``shall be construed to affect the liability of any person \nfor environmental remediation costs, for drinking water contamination, \nfor negligence, for spills, or other reasonably foreseeable events, \npublic or private nuisance, or trespass, or breach of warranty, or \nbreach of contract, or any other liability other than the liability \nbased on the fact that it is a defective product.''\n  MTBE is not a defective product. If you misuse it, it can cause \nproblems. If you drink it, it could kill you. That is not its intended \npurpose. If you drink gasoline, it will kill you. That is not its \nintended purpose. Its intended purpose is to run engines for the \neconomy of this country.\n  I am well satisfied that we have crafted a section on MTBE liability \nthat is reasonable; it makes legal sense, and it just makes common \nsense. There may be other reasons not to be for the Energy bill, but it \nshould not be on this particular issue which has been misconstrued by \nthose who say they have concern.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I struck an agreement with a couple of \nSenators who have been waiting to speak. Senator Nickles would like to \nfollow me. I ask unanimous consent that he follow me. Secondly, the \nSenator from California, who was just here a bit ago, asked that she \nproceed next, and I ask unanimous consent she proceed next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Let me see what this means. Are we doing this under a \nparticular time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, we are not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Vermont would like to speak on two \ndifferent issues: the energy issue and wants his experiences here in \nWashington at the time of President Kennedy's assassination. I want to \nget some idea of time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator can speak after the Senator from \nCalifornia. That is fine. She is right here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Domenici was saying the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma and then the Senator from California. Might I ask the \nSenator from Oklahoma--I am not going to object--how long will the \nSenator speak?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Twenty or thirty minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from California?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Fifteen to twenty minutes.\n\n[[Page S15227]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And I am going to speak for 20 minutes now.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder if I might ask, to make sure in case Senators \nwish to speak longer, to amend the unanimous consent request so the \nsenior Senator from Vermont could be recognized at a quarter of 2 for \nup to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection, but I would like to add, with that \nagreement, that the distinguished Senator from the State of Kentucky \nwould like to speak, and he will either speak before the Senator from \nVermont, if the quarter of 2 has not yet arrived, or after the Senator \nfrom Vermont speaks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. But at quarter of 2, the Senator from Vermont is to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is the junior Senator from Kentucky who is asking \nfor time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I sure hope the people in this country \nand those who have written about MTBE were privileged to hear the few \nremarks that took place this morning about the issue from the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Texas and the Senator from Louisiana. \nI don't plan to speak anymore about MTBE now, but before the afternoon \nis finished, I will speak to it with a little more detail so people \nwill understand that the House asked us to do this, and they didn't ask \nus for anything unreasonable. This is a very valid approach to a \nproblem that cries out for a solution, other than to turn it loose and \nlet anybody sue however they would like and see what happens.\n  Having said that, I wish to talk about this bill that is before us \nfrom the standpoint of what is going to happen if those who have come \nto the floor and been so critical of the bill prevail and we don't have \nthis bill.\n  I don't want to go back and spend a lot of time duplicating the words \nthat have been used about this bill. Suffice it to say, there have been \nenough negative words used about this bill that one might consider it \nis the worst thing that ever happened.\n  I would like to tell each and every one of the Senators and each and \nevery American who is concerned what is going to happen if this bill \ndoesn't pass.\n  The impression is this is just a big bill that somebody put together \nthat has a lot of pieces to it. We don't like some of them and some of \nthem we think are giveaways, so we ought to just kill it. I am going to \nuse the word ``kill'' for a little while because I assume those people \nwho have gotten up and talked that way would like to kill the bill.\n  First, if we kill this bill, fuel diversity efforts that will help \nreduce our dependency on foreign oil and gas will be killed along with \nit. In other words, this bill is a conscientious effort to help \nAmerican industry, large and small, produce alternative sources of \nenergy for America and, in many instances, to do that, they have been \ngiven a tax incentive. All of those alternatives will be dead when this \nbill is killed, if it is.\n  The ethanol program, which many have wanted for years--a few in this \nbody don't like it, but let's just take it for what it is--everybody \nshould know the ethanol program is dead, killed, gone, out the window.\n  Now, there are some who would applaud it, but the overwhelming number \nof people, and the entire agribelt of America, is cheering that we pass \nit, not that we defeat it. I, frankly, do not see any way, I say to all \nthe farmers in this country, of ever getting an ethanol bill anywhere \nlike this if this bill is killed.\n  So to repeat, for those who think we need ethanol to provide an \nalternative 5 billion gallons a year to the use of crude oil gasoline, \nand for farmers who want an alternative crop, kill the bill and you \nhave killed that forever.\n  The renewable fuels provision would replace 5 billion gallons of oil \nwith 5 billion of domestic-produced ethanol. I have alluded to it. It \nwill die with the death of this bill.\n  Over 800,000 job opportunities for our citizens will go out the \nwindow, dead, killed, for those who relish speaking about killing this \nbill.\n  Clean coal initiatives, which for the first time say to America, \nAmerica, you are king, K-I-N-G, King Coal, and we want to provide some \nincentives so you might use some of that coal. Well, for those who want \nto kill this bill, ``King Coal'' will remain a dead product. We can \ninventory it, we can take note of it, and we can brag that America has \ncoal that will run the country for--I do not know how long. The last \ntime I read something, it would run it for 500 or 600 years. Out the \nwindow, no chance to use it because we will be using every other fuel \nled by natural gas and we will soon be importing liquefied natural gas \nbecause there is no way we are going to use our coal.\n  So let me repeat in simple phrases, ``King Coal'' will remain dormant \nbut for the small amount being used. Not a new powerplant will be built \nusing coal. It is dead.\n  Yesterday there was a report by a commission. The commission worked \nsince the Northeastern blackout. They issued a report, and the summary \nof the report is two or three pages long. What they have concluded, I \nsay to my colleagues, is that the principal reason for the Northeast \nblackout is that some companies were not following the voluntary \nreliability standards. Then those who made the study conclude that if \nthis bill is passed, there should not be another blackout because the \nreliability standards are made mandatory and they will be enforced by \ncriminal penalties. So nobody is going to run around taking a chance \nwith overloading and breaching the reliability standards. Reliability \nmeans that one is doing what is prudent and there is no more reference \nto the use of these lines.\n  So let us summarize that one. For the time being, and I think for \nsome time to come, the blackouts in America will remain alive and \npossible because we will have thrown out the window the reliability \nstandards that are in this bill because some want to make the case on \nan issue such as MTBE or the like which we are talking about today.\n  There is regulatory certainty required for the utility industry. If \nwe fail to provide that, FERC, with congressional direction on issues \nsuch as standard market design and transmission pricing, will be gone. \nThey will be dead. The repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act \nwill be killed.\n  Some people have said if nothing else was in this bill, the repeal of \nPUHCA, a 1935 vestige that hangs around over the utility industry, \nprohibiting investment over some kind of fear that is no longer a \nreality--and look how long we have been waiting to get rid of PUHCA--I \nthink it would be fair that I could say if this bill is killed, PUHCA \nis here forever. So industry that is waiting for an injection of money, \nthey can sit by and eke out investment because the principal impediment \nwill still be there. The repeal will have been killed.\n\n  There are some who say because their States have had some unlucky or \nunfortunate situations, such as Enron, that consumer protections are \nnecessary and then, of course, they look at this bill and say, I know \nwhat protections I want and they are not exactly the way I want them in \nthe bill, so they come to the floor and say there are no protections. \nBut I say if this bill is killed, you kill the consumer protections in \nthis bill which are against fraud, manipulation, which force increased \ntransparency, which increase penalties for violation of the Federal \nPower Act and Natural Gas Act, and they close the Enron fraud loophole.\n  Now, you can throw all of those out the window for people who want to \nfind fault and want to talk about a turkey and want to talk about the \ngoodies in this bill, but I am telling you what you lose when you lose \nthis bill. I am ready for anybody to come and say it is not true.\n  How are we going to get these if this bill dies? Will the House come \nmarching down the aisle, just having gone through this exercise, and \nsay, oh, well, let's just start next week and do another one? Does the \nChair think so? I think not. Do my colleagues think this Senator spent \nthe better part of a year on it, and do they think I am going to march \nto my committee and start hearings and saying, oh, well, we did the \nbest we could but we better just start over again because we heard so \nmany speeches? Not on your life. The speeches had little to do with the \nimportant provisions in this legislation.\n\n[[Page S15228]]\n\nThey had to do with things that were put in the legislation, as \neveryone knows, when it is run through both the House and the Senate \nand individual bodies and then through a conference.\n  Tax credits--let me say I am aware of the tax credit game, and this \nbill is filled with tax credits that people wanted and needed and on \nwhich I am sure some of my good friends are quite certain we were too \ngenerous. I note the presence of my great friend Senator Nickles and I \nam sure he is not going to get up and speak about MTBE and we ought to \ntake it out, but he is going to wonder whether we put in too many tax \ncredits.\n  For every newspaper article and editorial that said: let's kill this \nbill, it is no good, there are hundreds of letters of support from the \npeople affected. They do not write editorials. They write and tell us \ntheir problem.\n  The people who build and sell windmills and have giant windmill \nprojects going, they are very clear. This is the best thing that ever \ncould have happened to them. We have made permanent the production tax \ncredit that is sending windmills soaring in the United States, and I do \nnot mean soaring in the air, I mean soaring in numbers.\n  Some ask: Do you really want those, Senator? And I sometimes chuckle. \nI drive around and see some of them, and I am not sure. But they will \nbuild them pretty before they are finished. They will even be good \nlooking. Right now, some people write us letters and say: We don't want \nany more of those. Some people in Massachusetts wanted us to put \nsomething in this bill saying the local community could stop them if \nthey didn't want them. We couldn't get that done if we tried. In any \nevent, the credits for that are gone. If we pass the bill, we will see \nit soar.\n\n  Regarding solar, we received all kinds of congratulations and support \nfrom the solar industry, saying it will finally go now. It will go, but \nit is dead in its tracks when this bill dies, if it dies. I don't think \nit is going to. At least I hope not.\n  You can go right on through. Biomass and all the others are anxiously \nwaiting so they can begin to produce alternatives, adding to the \ntotality of what we will use for energy in America.\n  We have been so bold that we say the next generation, economically \nspeaking, will be the hydrogen generation. I am not sure about that, \nbut this bill starts us down that path. I don't know where we are going \nto pick up a bill that will put together the kinds of things that are \ninvolved, such as $1.6 billion to start joint ventures with the \nautomobile companies to build this.\n  Then there is nuclear. France leads the world. While we tremble, they \nbuild. While we worry, they have 78 percent of their electricity from \nnuclear power. While we run around worrying where are we going to put \nthis waste product, do you want to take a trip to France? They will \nshow you where they put theirs. It is a building that looks just like a \nschoolhouse.\n  You walk into it and look around and you ask: Where is the spent \nfuel?\n  They say: You are standing on it.\n  What?\n  It is right there. It is encased and they put in solvent and put in \nwater, glass put upon it, and they are smart enough to say that will be \nsafe for 50 to 100 years. Guess what. They say: We will find a solution \nor a use for it in that period of time.\n  We stopped producing nuclear powerplants, one of the reasons being we \ndon't know what to do with the waste. An engineering problem, and \nnothing more, has killed nuclear power in America. We have said maybe \nsomebody would like to try it and we will give them some incentive to \nget around the difficulties involved. I hope we do it this way. Because \nif we don't, I think we can probably say, during my lifetime--I am not \nsure about the lifetime of the occupant of the chair, who is a very \nyoung Senator and very much waiting around to see this happen. You may \nsee it, but I don't think I will, because you have to give some \nincentives to get started and then the public will see the new \ngeneration, something we ought to have going on in our country.\n  I could go on. Before I stop, though, I want to talk about Alaska and \nnatural gas. First there was a program--it is not in this bill--to \ncapture crude oil that is in ANWR. We were told: If you put it in the \nbill, it will be filibustered. Isn't that interesting, Senator Nickles? \nYou weren't for taking it out; you wanted it in. Now we have left it \nout and we have somebody filibustering because of the MTBE hold \nharmless clause.\n  I wish we had known we were going to have cloture votes down here. \nMaybe we should have put it in and had cloture on a lot of things, \nincluding ANWR. But we didn't put it in, in good faith, because the \nminority leader said he had enough votes to kill it. So we left it out.\n\n  Alaska is loaded with energy. What do we do in this bill if we can't \nutilize some of their energy? We tried very hard to assure the delivery \nof natural gas to the lower 48 because it will not be longer than 10 \nyears until we will be short of natural gas and we will be using it \nfrom other countries. Won't it be interesting? With a State of ours \nloaded with natural gas, America, which is using natural gas like it \nwent out of style, will be importing LNG from all over the world. We \nwill say: Here we are again. Instead of getting independent, we are \ngetting dependent.\n  But we did try our best. This bill says bring it down through a \ncertain area and bring it to Chicago. We said we will help the \ncompanies that will build it. We did what we could by way of credits \nand accelerated depreciation, but as of today we have no assurance that \nit will be done. We have hope, and at least we have done what we could, \nand it may happen. If you throw this bill out, that is not going to \nhappen either. I don't know how long before you get anything going in \nAlaska, with the kind of fear and trepidation that happens every time \nyou mention capturing some of their resources.\n  There are many other provisions in this bill. There are all kinds of \ngreat research programs. They are misunderstood because they are not \npaid for; they are authorized. They are saying if, in the future, \nCongress wants to pay for some additional research in--let's just pick \none--nanotechnology, this gives them authority but doesn't pay for it. \nThat is one. If you add it up, you will say this bill costs all these \nthings, but it doesn't cost those things, because those are part of--\nlike when you fund an education bill, you fund it for a lot more than \nyou need and later on you pay for what you can afford.\n  I could go through some more, but my good friend Senator Nickles \nwants to speak. He will be to the point. He will cite some problems \nwith the bill, I am sure, and will also tell us some of the things that \nare reasonably good about it.\n  I am glad people have not come down here and made a lot of noise \nabout the whistleblower protection because we did continue protection \nof whistleblowers, contrary to what some of their main groups are \nsaying. They just wanted more, not continued protection. But we have \ncontinued them.\n  There are at least 10 other major issues we have done that I truly \ndon't believe will get done in the near future. They are more or less \nmoribund--that means dead--if we finish this bill by not voting for \ncloture and voting for the bill.\n  I thank the Senator for listening. To the extent there are programs \nin here that others have worked hard to get in here and are very proud \nof and I haven't mentioned, please understand I did not mention \neverything. I mentioned what I could. What I didn't, I am glad, in our \nspare time, to get on the phone and suggest to others the rest of the \nthings that are here.\n  I close by saying there are a lot of ways we could have done this \nbill. We have been chastised, we have been ridiculed, we have been put \nupon because of the way we put the bill together. All I want to say to \nmy fellow Senators is we got a bill. We tried this before. We have gone \nthrough a year, year and a half and got nothing. I started this with \nthe idea we would get a bill and it would be reasonably close to what \nwe would have gotten had we spent much more time collaboratively with \nmany more scriveners, many more writers, than we had. I think that is \nthe case. Most people who were interested saw the product long before \nit came to the floor.\n  You notice I did not mention electricity reform, other than \nindirectly. But I will say for those who want FERC to run the entire \ngrid, they will have that if this bill fails. For States\n\n[[Page S15229]]\n\nthat think we ought to have FERC doing it, they can be gleeful.\n  We thought we ought to phase it in and we thought we ought to let \nsome States provide differently for themselves, but we made sure they \ncouldn't close out investors who wanted to come into their States and \nput in utilities. We didn't make it simple, but we let it happen and we \nlet them get their money back, too.\n  Those are tough issues. You don't get the bill, and you might get \nwhat some people like, or you might get that chairman over there who \nthinks he knows how to run it all by himself. You might get that. I \ndidn't think that is the right way to go. But I didn't have the luxury \nof writing four versions. We had to write one version the best we could \nfor everybody. We did that.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment Senator Domenici, the \nchairman of the committee. He stated at the beginning of the year that \nhe was going to produce a very comprehensive Energy bill, and he has \ndone it. I have been in the Senate for 23 years. I have been on the \nEnergy Committee with Senator Domenici for 23 years. This is the most \ncomprehensive piece of energy legislation we have had in that entire \ntime. We have had a lot of people say we need a comprehensive bill, but \nuntil now, that hasn't happened.\n  A couple of years ago, there was an Energy bill on the Senate floor, \nbut the Energy Committee didn't have a markup. Senator Domenici, as \nchairman, decided that wasn't the way to go. He rightly felt the entire \nEnergy Committee should be involved in marking up this bill. We marked \nit up over a period of months, and took several weeks in committee to \nreport it out. For this open and inclusive committee process I \ncompliment Senator Domenici for his methodology in reporting out this \nlegislation which helped insure a solid and bipartisan product. I know \nhe has been criticized for the way the Conference process, but he did \nallow the committee to work its will, and now we have brought back a \nvery comprehensive piece of legislation to the Senate floor.\n  I tell my very good friend from New Mexico that I agree with a lot \nthat is in the bill. But I disagree with some of the things in the \nbill. I am going to support the bill on the whole because I think \npositive energy legislation is very critical if we want to have a \ngrowing economy. You cannot have a growing economy if you do not have \nviable, sustainable and reasonably priced sources of energy. It is very \nimportant that we pass a good bill.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues that I ran for the Senate \nback in 1980 because of misguided energy policy that passed the \nCongress during the Carter administration which I found personally \ninfuriating. In the midst of an energy crisis, the Carter \nadministration proposed and passed, under a Democratic controlled \nCongress, several energy measures at that time which only served to \nworsen the energy related problems afflicting our nation. As a business \nman living in Ponca City, OK, I thought: What in the world is Congress \ndoing? Everything they were doing, in my opinion, was very \nshortsighted. Maybe they had good, laudable goals, but they were very \nshortsighted if you happen to believe in free market principles. The \none bill they passed that probably had more to do with me running for \nthe Senate than anything was the windfall profits tax, which Congress \npassed in 1980. I was a State senator who happened to believe in free \nmarkets. The knowledge that my government would pass a law which so \ndisincentivised the production of the very commodity we were most in \nneed of at that time led me to conclude these people were completely \nout of touch with reality.\n  Then Congress passed a bill that said we are going to tax domestic \nproduction, but we do not tax imports. The net impact of that is you \ndiscourage domestic production and you encourage imports. That was \nabout as anti-free enterprise as any piece of legislation I could \nconceive.\n  I was so irritated that I ran for office, and ended up serving in the \nSenate.\n  I might mention that one of the highlights of my legislative career \nwas when we repealed the windfall profits tax in 1988. Frankly, I was \nembarrassed it took so long to get it repealed. I introduced \nlegislation every year I was in the Senate to repeal the windfall \nprofits tax. We didn't get it repealed until after it robbed the \ntaxpayers of $79 billion, but we got it repealed.\n  We repealed several other pieces of the mistaken energy policy of the \nCarter era.\n  In a short sighted attempt to artificially incentivise renewables \nwhile ignoring market principals the fuel use tax said you couldn't \nburn natural gas in utilities and big powerplants. It passed in 1978. \nWe repealed it in 1987.\n  The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 had dozens of different class \ncategories for natural gas. I was pleased to be the principal cosponsor \nof the 1987 legislation to basically deregulate natural gas. That was a \nvery significant piece of legislation that some people had worked on \nfor decades, and we were finally able to get it through.\n  I might mention that at that time Bennett Johnson was chairman of the \ncommittee. He and Wendell Ford worked in bipartisan ways to basically \nderegulate natural gas.\n  I also might tell my colleagues that many people on this floor and \nmany people who have not retired from this Senate said if we do \nderegulate natural gas, terrible things will happen; natural gas prices \nwill explode. They did just the opposite. Gas prices went down. Oil \nprices went down after we deregulated oil.\n  Also, during the Carter administration they passed the bill creating \nthe Synthetic Fuels Corporation to subsidize the creation of synthetic \nfuel from coal and shale oil. That was passed in 1980, and it expired--\nthank goodness--I believe in the 1986, but not before it wasted \nbillions of the taxpayers dollars.\n  It is important that we not pass bad legislation. But it is very \nimportant that we pass energy legislation. We are far too dependent on \nunreliable sources that can choke and strangle our economy. We have \nseen that happen in 1993. We have seen it happen in other years. We \ncan't allow that to happen. We have become far too dependent on foreign \noil. We import over 50 percent, and it is growing towards about two-\nthirds dependency on foreign oil. That is not acceptable. What can and \ncould and should be done?\n  The bill that we have before us has a blend of a lot of things. It \nencourages production and it encourages conservation. It also does a \ncouple of other things--talking about some fixes on the books that need \nto be replaced.\n  It reforms PURPA, the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act. I believe \nthat passed in 1978 as well. We are finally going to repeal it. That \nrequired utilities to pay for avoided costs for energy and basically \nincreased utility prices, in many cases by--I was going to say hundreds \nof millions of dollars. It might be hundreds of millions of dollars for \none powerplant over the life of that powerplant or those contracts. I \ncompliment Senator Landrieu who worked with me on that. If there is \ncompetition, we will repeal it. I appreciate her work.\n\n  We are also finally getting rid of PUHCA, the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act. This passed in the 1930s. Maybe it made sense in the \n1930s. It makes no sense, and, frankly, it hasn't made sense for the \nlast couple of decades. We are finally going to get rid of it. By \ngetting rid of that, we will open up, frankly, investment for utilities \nand energy projects in the billions of dollars. It received almost no \nattention and no debate. But anybody who has looked at it--it has been \nmentioned by, I think, everybody from Alan Greenspan to many of the \nregulators--said get rid of PUHCA. We are finally going to get rid of \nthat regulatory maze that is long overdue.\n  It is also notable to see what we didn't do in the bill that many of \nour friends, primarily on the other side of the aisle, wanted to put in \nthis bill. We don't have renewable portfolio standards. If we did, the \nprice of electricity would go up dramatically all across the country. \nThey tried to do it even in the markup earlier this week. We were \nsuccessful in defeating that. That is a real win for consumers. They \nforgot to tell you that if you had the renewable portfolio standards of \n10 percent, if you do not meet the standard, there is tax. It says you \nhave to pay a tax of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour--about 50 percent of\n\n[[Page S15230]]\n\nthe wholesale price of electricity, if you do not meet this standard. \nThat means if you don't make 10 percent, you could have your \nelectricity prices go up by 5 or 10 percent. We defeated that.\n  We defeated a very onerous corporate average fuel economy standard \nthat people wanted to enact. It would have mandated automobiles to \naverage 40 miles per gallon. That would have eviscerated consumer \nchoice and resulted in our citizens being forced to buy an economy-\nsized automobile which could prove very unsafe. It would have been a \nvery expensive provision as well in terms of consumer costs and lost \njobs in our auto industry. We didn't do that.\n  We didn't put in the global warming provision that would have greatly \nincreased every person's utility costs, devastated our economy and \nwould have made us uncompetitive internationally. We didn't do those \nthings. I am pleased about that.\n  We did do some positive electricity provisions that will encourage \nregional transmission organizations, that will mandate reliability \nstandards which will help us avoid curtailment in the future. It is not \nfail-safe, but it certainly is a positive step in the right direction.\n  Senator Domenici mentioned several other things in the nuclear field \nand other provisions in coal that should help us broaden and diversify \nour energy sources. He mentioned the tax provisions. I voted against \nthe tax portion of this bill when it came out of the Finance Committee. \nIf we were voting on the tax portion of this bill standing alone, I \nwould vote against it now.\n  On the tax provisions, the administration requested $8 billion. The \nSenate Finance Committee reported out $15 billion, and this bill is \n$23.5 billion.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question on \nthat point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I was wondering if the tax provisions as scored violate \nthe budget on that point.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To answer my colleague's question, the budget points of \norder lie against the spending, and I expect the tax provisions as \nwell.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we scored in the budget, I believe, $18 \nbillion for this bill. This bill will score close to $30 billion, for \nthe information of the Senator. It scores that way for a couple of \nreasons.\n\n  One, the tax provision. Also, there is a provision that says \nbrownfield projects can be funded by bonds that cost about $2 billion, \nwhich I think is a terrible way to be financing projects. This is not \nan appropriations bill.\n  Senator Domenici also mentioned a lot of things are authorized. I \nhope and pray not everything will be spent that is authorized. I will \ntell my colleagues that is always the case. We authorize a lot more \nmoney than we appropriate, and thank goodness for that.\n  I'll mention just a couple of other things. There is also direct \nspending in this bill. I tell my friend from New Hampshire that this \nSenator, at least, questions the wisdom of doing it. By direct spending \nthere are new entitlements for two or three items that are created. \nCoastal impact has an estimated cost of $1 billion. I predict it will \ncost a lot more than $1 billion over the next 10 years. I am \nsympathetic with those who live on the coast and they have drilling \noffshore and say they do not get anything. That money goes into general \nrevenue. It should be subject to appropriation. The coastal State \nshould receive some consideration, maybe some compensation. But to have \nit set up as an entitlement for 10 years and then subject to \nappropriation is a very poor manner of doing it.\n  There is deepwater research, $150 million that is direct entitlement \nspending for the next 10 years. Again, I don't think that is the way \nthis committee should operate. This is not an Appropriations Committee. \nThe same thing for Denali. They get about $500 million over the 10 \nyears. That is $3 billion of direct or entitlement spending that, \nfrankly, should not be in this bill.\n  Let me touch on a couple of other things that are in the bill that \nare critically important, and at least in my opinion, if you add this \ntogether, make the bill worthwhile. One is the Alaska natural gas \npipeline. If you go back historically and read the debates that \noccurred in this Congress, this Senate, for the Alaska oil pipeline, it \nwas one of the most contentious issues this body had seen in a long \ntime. This Alaska gas pipeline could have been as contentious, but it \nis not. It is in this bill. It is a $20 billion project, maybe the \nlargest project in the United States in our history, certainly one of \nthe largest projects ever. It is in this bill with expedited procedures \nwhich make that pipeline viable, in my opinion.\n  We also have a provision that allows the pipeline to be amortized \nover a shorter period of time, 7 years. That will encourage the \nconstruction of the pipeline. That is jobs. That is energy. We have a \nvery significant serious natural gas challenge or shortage or potential \nshortage and deliverability shortage, getting the product to the \nconsumers in the next several years. Getting this gas that basically is \nstuck in the northern plains of Alaska to the lower 48 will help \nalleviate that shortage to the tune of trillions of cubic feet of gas. \nIt is absurd to leave that gas in Alaska, in northern Alaska, untapped, \nunutilized. This bill will authorize and expedite the construction of \nthat pipeline.\n  That, to me, is probably the best thing we have in this bill, the \nmost pro-energy item in the bill. We also have some other things that \nmake good sense, that do encourage production. I compliment our \ncolleagues for putting those in the bill.\n  On balance, we need an energy package. The administration should be \ncomplimented for the fact that Vice President Cheney led a task force \nand recommended many of these things. They are now in this bill. He has \ntaken a lot of heat for it but, frankly, this country for decades has \nneeded a comprehensive energy package. Vice President Cheney and \nPresident Bush have led the effort to make that happen. Now we are \nwithin a day or so of actually passing a bill to do that.\n  While this bill is far from perfect, while this bill actually does \ncost too much, while the tax provisions in this bill are far too \nnumerous, in this Senator's opinion, with way too many tax credits--I \nbelieve there are 19 new tax credits in the code, and I hate to see the \nTax Code cluttered and confused and complicated, substituting the \nwisdom of tax writers over the free market--I still think on balance \nthe country needs a bill, needs an energy package. I believe this is \nthe best one that this Congress can write, at least at this time. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that it works better \nif people know when they are supposed to come. The order locked in now \nis Senator Leahy will be recognized at 1:45; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Boxer has 15 to 20 minutes by \nunanimous consent.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There is no particular time set.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Boxer, Senator Leahy, 1:45, and \nSenator Bunning, either before or after Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. REID. That is now the order before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The only other Senator I know, either Democrat or \nRepublican, who wishes to speak is Senator Durbin. I ask that he follow \nSenator Bunning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is so much to say about this Energy \nbill, I hope I am able to be coherent on why I think it ought to be \ndefeated.\n  It is a bill, first of all, that is a tax giveaway to the biggest \ncorporations in this country. Actually, the multinational \ncorporations--$30 billion is the size of the giveaway; $30 billion of \ndebt. When this administration came into power, we had a surplus. Now \nwe are reaching a $500 billion deficit. This is adding $30 billion to \nit.\n  The attitude around here is, just let our kids and grandkids pick up \nthat deficit. It is absolutely the wrong policy for right now.\n  This bill is an unfunded mandate because it gives a free ride to the \nmakers of a poisonous chemical called MTBE that never was mandated by \nany government and was the oxygenate of\n\n[[Page S15231]]\n\nchoice of the oil companies. They knew it was poisonous and they kept \non putting it into the gasoline. It has contaminated water systems all \nover this country. By walking away from this problem and giving a pass \nto the people who polluted our areas, in my opinion--and this is just \nmy own words--I think it is immoral. That is why we have the cities of \nthis country against this bill, the counties of this country against \nthis bill, the water agencies of this country against this bill.\n  The more we let this bill hang out there, the more it smells. MTBE \nsmells. This bill has a similar smell, a sour smell, a bad smell, a \npoison smell.\n  The chairman of the committee wrote this bill with one other person \nin a locked room. It is extraordinary. I thought when I went to school \nthat I learned a bill becomes a law this way: They pass a bill in the \nHouse, they pass a bill in the Senate. If they are different, there is \na conference committee. The conference committee is made up of people \nfrom both sides of the aisle, both bodies. They cannot add new and \nextraneous things into the bill that were not at least in one of the \nbodies--the Senate or the House. Then it goes back to each respective \nHouse of Congress. If it is passed, it goes on to the President's desk. \nWe have a bill, therefore, that would be a compromise, that would be \ngenuine, which would reflect the broad views of the conferees and, \ntherefore, by extension, all sides of the debate reflected among the \nAmerican people.\n  What did we have in this case? Two people of the same party from big \noil States sitting in a room having a party. And what we are going to \nhave if this bill passes is one huge party, with the biggest \ncorporations in this country, the oil companies, nuclear--believe me, \nthey will not be drinking water tainted with MTBE. They will be \ndrinking the bubbly stuff, and it might even be imported. But it will \nbe expensive. This bill is expensive. Thirty billion dollars is added \non to our debt from the very people who say we have to be fiscally \nresponsible.\n  Then the chairman of the committee says, in a most angry fashion, and \nit is his right--I am angry, a little bit different type of anger--says \nin his angry way: If you do not take this, you will never have another \nEnergy bill because I am not going to do it.\n  This is a government of laws, not men. We can have a good Energy bill \nif we defeat this bill. We can have one that looks toward the future. \nWe can have an Energy bill that is a 21st century Energy bill, not an \nEnergy bill that is a 20th century Energy bill.\n\n  So the sky will not fall for my friends who want ethanol. And I \nunderstand they want that. By the way, there are some good provisions \nin there for my State regarding making ethanol out of rice straw. I \nworked for those provisions.\n  I am going to go through this bill: What is good in the bill, what is \nbad in it, and what is left out. I worked hard to examine this bill. \nBut when all is said and done, it is an Energy bill that is a giveaway \nto the special interests of this country. It is an Energy bill which \nturns its back on people on the west coast who suffered from companies \nthat ripped us off and owe us $9 billion just in California alone. It \nis an Energy bill that really just gives a wink and a nod to some of \nthe possible ways that we can work ourselves out of dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  Now, again, the chairman of the committee is very ecstatic about this \nbill, and it is his right. Why wouldn't he be? He wrote it. He likes \nbig oil. He is defending the makers of MTBE. He loves nuclear energy. \nThe last I checked, we still do not have a safe way to dispose of the \nwaste from nuclear powerplants. The last time I checked, in some places \nin Europe they are beginning to close down nuclear powerplants. Oh, but \nwe are going to build a new one--we, the taxpayers, $1 billion, as I \nunderstand it--in Idaho.\n  Now we have reports--we were going to send all of our nuclear waste \nto Yucca Mountain--and now we hear, in Nevada, a new scientific report \nsaying, watch out, that material can leak.\n  So this is not the time to be subsidizing the building of nuclear \npowerplants. My God, you would think this is the 1940s after World War \nII, ``Atoms for Peace.'' It does not work.\n  By the way, I hope taxpayers understand that what is also in this \nbill is a 20-year extension of the Price-Anderson Act. What is that, \nyou ask? That takes the nuclear companies off the hook if there is a \nnuclear accident. They pay for some of the damage but the mammoth \namount of damage, which could go escalating to God knows where, you \ntaxpayers are picking up the tab. So first you are building them the \nnuclear powerplant. Then, if there is an accident, you have to pick up \nthe tab.\n  This is some Energy bill. This is the worst bill. I cannot think of \nthe names--let's hear what some of the editorials are saying from \naround the country for this great Energy bill.\n  USA Today: ``Congress forgets promises made in blackout's wake.'' The \nBrattleboro Reformer: ``It's time to shift gears.'' The Billings \nGazette: ``Energy bill lacks critical balance.'' The Boston Globe: ``A \npolluted energy bill.'' The Brunswick Times Record: ``This energy bill \nis appalling.'' That was their word.\n  The Buffalo News: ``Oil and grease. Energy bill fails country as it \ndispenses favors to the industry.'' The Cape Cod Times: ``Misused \nenergy.'' Des Moines Register--now imagine, this is in a place where \nthey love the ethanol issue, and even with that, this is what they say: \n``The MTBE outrage.'' And I will go into how the MTBE outrage impacts \nmy State.\n  The Fort Worth Star Telegram: ``Coming up short.'' The Great Falls \nTribune: ``Senate should stall Energy Policy Act of 2003.'' Absolutely \nthey are right. Count me in. I am going to try to stall this bill. I am \ngoing to try to kill this bill. I am going to try to stop this bill in \nevery single way I can because it is bad for the people I represent and \nit is not the kind of bill we want for this country at this time.\n  Jackson Clarion-Ledger: ``A `P' Perfect Bill: Pork, Politics, \nPollution.'' That is a good one. Lakeland Ledger: ``Senate, derail the \nenergy bill.'' The Los Vegas Sun: ``Mixed bag on national energy \nplan.'' The Lewiston Sun: ``Proposed law is lousy legislation.'' Their \nwords.\n  Memphis Commercial Appeal: ``Pork barrel bill, not worth the \nenergy.'' Missoula Missoulian: ``Energy bill uses tax dollars for fuel. \nLegislation larded with massive subsidies is a parity of effective \nenergy legislation.'' That is from the Deep South.\n  The Nashua Telegram: ``Rushing energy bill is a bad way to set \npolicy.'' New Jersey Star Ledger: ``Defeat GOP energy bill.'' Orange \nCounty Register--and this is in a part of my State that is \npredominantly Republican--do you know what they write? ``Energy bill is \na waste.''\n  Palm Beach Post: ``A powerless public.'' The Phoenix Arizona \nRepublic: ``Energy overload. Overstuffed bill has it all, except \ncoherent national policy.''\n  I just have to say, the more this bill is subjected to the light of \nday, out of that closed-door conference committee, with two people from \nthe same party, from big oil States--the longer that bill sees the \nlight of day, the more people will see it.\n  Now, yes, there are a few good things in this bill. I am going to \ntell you what they are. I am going to show you what they are. Then I am \ngoing to show you what was left out of it. And then I am going to talk \nabout the bad things in the bill.\n\n  A good thing: Drilling in the Arctic Refuge in Alaska is not in this \nbill. As the person who wrote the amendment that stopped it before, I \nsay thank you to all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who stood \ntall and said: We will never allow this to be put in an Energy bill. \nThank you. That is a good thing.\n  No offshore inventory of oil--I thank the House on that one. My \nfriend Lois Capps over there was fighting hard. You cannot go into a \npristine coastline that is supposed to have a moratorium on it and then \ndrill to see how much oil there is in it. Either it is pristine and it \nis left alone, and there is a moratorium to keep it left alone, or you \nmight as well just go in and destroy it. The conferees said no to that \nbecause that would have been a poison pill, too. So thank you. It is \nnot in there.\n  Something that is in there that I wrote has to do with incentives for \nmaking ethanol from agricultural waste. Now, this is something that is \nforward looking because we have rice straw and biowaste and sugar waste\n\n[[Page S15232]]\n\nfrom beets and we know we can use that waste to compete with corn \nethanol. We think it is exciting. If we can develop those industries in \nour State, then we do not have to ship that corn ethanol all the way \nacross from the Midwest. That kind of shipping is going to add to the \nprice of gasoline for my people who need to have their cars to go to \nwork.\n  Energy efficiency by the Federal Government--I am very pleased we \nhave that in this bill. That is an important thing to undertake.\n  Hybrid car tax credit--ditto. It is good.\n  Increased funding for energy assistance in LIHEAP--for the poorest of \nthe poor. That is good.\n  I understand there are some solar tax credits in there, which I think \nare very important, to put solar energy on some kind of equilibrium. \nThese provisions are very small.\n  Now, this is what is missing from this bill which would have made it \nat least relevant to what has happened in our country.\n  There are no refunds for the people of my State. We have been told by \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that we have been ripped off, \nrobbed. They have stolen our money with phony schemes to create \nartificial shortages. You all remember some of those schemes. The fact \nis, FERC, which can order these refunds, has refused to do so. This \nadministration refuses to order FERC to get those refunds back to our \npeople. Our new Governor has his hands full with tremendous deficits. \nThat is our money, and we want it back. No, they would not go there.\n  No. 2, there are no long-term contract renegotiations for my State or \nother States on the west coast. What does that mean? These thieving \ncompanies, as they were robbing us blind, and had us over a barrel, \nnegotiated long-term contracts for the future. They said: Oh, we are \ngiving you a good deal. We are going to charge you a lot less than the \nspot price. Well, we were negotiating with them under duress. It was a \nphony price. A phony price was out there, and our Governor was trying \nto get the best deal.\n  Yes, he got a lot lower than the current price, but it was way over \nwhat the market is today. So we are asking for new long-term contracts. \nWe want to do away with those. No, they didn't do that.\n  No end to electricity market manipulation schemes: Ron Wyden was very \ngood on that point. We had schemes that had every name in the book. \nThey made up names that you can't even believe. The one I hated the \nmost was Get Shorty. Because I am a little person, I hated the name. \nBut they were shorting us of electricity. They were doing all these \nthings, and they were giving them all these names. By the way, why \nisn't someone in jail on all of that Enron stuff? No, we didn't go \nthere.\n  No CAFE standards: Unbelievable. It has been pointed out that even \nChina, that has a bad environmental record--I went there; they are \nbuilding dams that are destroying mountains and homes and valleys,\n  I just got sick to see it--has set CAFE standards because they know \npollution is bad for their people.\n  When cars pollute, kids get asthma, workers get sick. And if you \ncan't work, that hurts productivity. It is just common sense. Forget \nthe fact that it is the right thing to do to have CAFE standards and \nspare the air. No, they couldn't do this.\n  There is a huge SUV loophole. It was about $25,000, and in the last \ntax bill it went up to $100,000. The Senate tried to bring it back to \n$25,000 but the House rejected that effort.\n  No increased use of renewable sources for electricity: They walked \naway from the formula that Senator Bingaman had gotten into the Senate \nbill.\n  By the way, any resemblance between this Energy bill that is before \nus and the Energy bill the Senate wrote is purely coincidental. This is \na completely different bill, written by two people from big oil States, \nwho love nuclear energy and have walked away from fighting for the \nconsumer. It is a sad thing. This is what is missing from the bill.\n  Now let me tell you what is bad about the bill. Unfortunately, it is \na long list. We talked about giveaways to the oil industry. I want to \ngive you a few examples of that: $10.5 billion in tax breaks would be \nprovided to the oil and gas industries. The bill provides millions of \ndollars' worth of subsidies to the oil industry by reducing the amount \nof royalties--that is kind of like rent--that they have to pay to drill \noff our coasts and on our Federal lands. So they use our Federal land \nthat all the American people own. They are supposed to pay royalties \nwhen they find oil there.\n  This bill provides royalty relief for marginal oil and gas wells or \nwells that are relatively less productive. They give this royalty \nrelief to oil and gas development off the coast of Alaska as well as \ndeep wells and deep water operations in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Wake up, America. If you want to count, listen to these things. One \nof the things that I find happens, I went on TV and I did an interview \non one of the issues we are going to be talking about, MTBE. The person \ninterviewing me said: I know this is very complex but let's discuss it.\n  It isn't complex. It is pretty simple. This bill is a giveaway to the \nbiggest companies. It walks away from the consumers. It lets the \npolluters go free. It is a 20th century Energy bill.\n  People say it is confusing; it is complicated. It is not so \ncomplicated. That is the way to say to people: You better tune out the \nargument; it is too complicated.\n  America, tune in. It is your future. It is your kids who are going to \nhave to pay this $30 billion. It is your kids who are going to have to \nbreathe the dirty air. It is your kids and your cities that are going \nto have to pick up the tab to clean up MTBE. So listen.\n  The bill would also reimburse energy companies for their costs to \nreclaim abandoned wells on Federal lands under a new program forcing \ntaxpayers to pay these costs rather than industry. It would provide a \nbroad liability waiver to oil and gas operators reclaiming sites on \nFederal lands. So they go on the Federal lands. They mess them up. They \npollute them. They walk away.\n  These are our lands. The bill will take $150 million from royalties \nand fund research on ultradeep wells, unconventional natural gas \npetroleum, and the Federal Government may well give $50 million extra \nto this fund. This research would be done to benefit the industry.\n  You know what, let them pay for their own R They get a great tax \nbreak. I am all for it. I give big tax breaks for R We don't have to \ngive them cash on the barrel.\n  Giveaways to the nuclear industry: I mentioned before the Price \nAnderson Act. If there is a nuclear catastrophe, don't worry about it, \nwe will pick up the tab. Your children will pick up the tab, my \nchildren, my grandchildren. Not the nuclear industry, a 20-year \nextension.\n  If it is so safe, why can't they get insurance in the private sector \nfor the possible damage it would do? I believe in checks and balances. \nThe insurance companies are checks and balances. If a nuclear person \ncomes in to an insurance company and sits down and says: Well, I might \nhave an accident.\n  What would it cost?\n  Oh, $100 billion.\n  Well, I won't cover you for more than $10 billion. It would just \nbreak our back.\n  Oh, OK.\n  Maybe that is a signal, Uncle Sam, that this isn't safe yet. No, we \nare going to back up the nuclear industry for another 20 years. It \nraises the cap, which is a good thing, but it is still a cap \nnonetheless. They don't have to pay full insurance premiums. Why should \nthey? This bill is for them. It is not for us.\n  If there were an accident, nuclear companies don't have to pay the \ncosts of the damages because the taxpayers are on the hook. That is a \ngreat idea.\n  A $6 billion production tax break is in here for utility companies \nthat operate new nuclear reactors. So while they are closing down \nnuclear reactors in Europe and while we are reading reports that Yucca \nMountain is not safe, we are going to give tax incentives for new \nnuclear reactors.\n  It goes on on the nuclear side, but I will move on to one more point \nhere: public health and the environment.\n  The placing of these nuclear plants is just not going to live up to \nthe highest level of protection. There is concern to me in terms of \ndumping the waste and\n\n[[Page S15233]]\n\nthe injuries that could occur due to the fact that we don't know what \nto do with the waste. These people want to give tax breaks for dirty \nindustry--$29 billion in tax incentives for the energy industry, and \nmore than 70 percent of the tax breaks go to polluting and mature \nindustries, including coal, oil, gas, and nuclear.\n  Yes, we gave some tax benefits to some of the new and clean energy \nbut very small in comparison. It is $1.8 billion for the clean \ntechnologies versus $28 billion; it is about 28 to 1. That is a 20th \ncentury Energy bill. Now, we repealed consumer protections in the \nelectricity market. That is another thing that is bad. The most \neloquent Senator I have heard on this of all time is Senator Maria \nCantwell. I am sure if she hasn't spoken already, she will explain to \nyou what this means. I have to say that the Senator from New Mexico, \nwho wrote this bill, with the Congressman from Louisiana, a big oil, \nbig nuclear power State--he said: This is your last chance. You will \nnever get to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act if you don't \ndo it today.\n  I have one word for that: Wrong. We are going to be here every day. \nIf he doesn't like PUHCA, you can try to do it another day, just like \nhe can try to get his nuclear money another day, just like he can do \ntax giveaways another day, just like he can give a liability waiver to \nhis big oil friends another day. You don't have to pass this bill \ntoday. That is the biggest bunch of baloney I have ever heard. We are \nsupposed to be working here all year. We don't have to pass this today \nor tomorrow or the next day. I hope we will not because this Public \nUtility Holding Company Act is the main law to protect consumers from \nmarket manipulation and fraud and abuse in the electricity sector.\n  It is unbelievable that we have uncovered evidence about what Enron \ndid, and we are repealing the one law that could help us in the future. \nIt is, to me, outrageous. Again, I will leave that for Senator Maria \nCantwell to talk about.\n  We see drilling and development of our public lands. In my State, I \nhave to tell you that this bill has a special interest provision to \nsite a high voltage electricity transmission line through the Cleveland \nNational Forest. The State of California, through the PUC, said, no, it \nis not needed and not wanted. I wonder why, in the midst of the \nterrible fire that we just had, we are now going to put a high voltage \nline through a national forest. Can someone tell me why? Can someone \ntell me why we would permit the siting of a high voltage electricity \ntransmission line through a national forest?\n  I will tell you why. It is a special interest provision, and the \nState didn't want it and the local people didn't want it. The State \nsaid no, but somebody put that into the bill. The more you read the \nbill, the more you learn. The bill would also put the Department of \nEnergy in charge of permitting rights of way across public lands for \nutility corridors.\n  The bill would require the Department of the Interior to process \napplications for permits to drill for oil and gas on Federal lands \nwithin 30 days, even though people said we need more time to look at \nthe facts.\n  So the USGS would be required to identify restrictions and \nimpediments to oil and gas development. They are allowed to look at \nfish and wildlife, cultural and historic values, and other public \nresources. In other words, they can call these things ``restrictions'' \nand ``impediments'' when, in fact, the law has always said they should \nbe respected. Now they are impediments.\n\n  Diminished protection for our coasts: The first provision would grant \nthe Secretary of the Interior broad new authority to permit energy \ndevelopment and support facilities anywhere on the Outer Continental \nShelf. Authorized facilities would include those that support \nexploration, development, production, transportation, or storage of oil \nand gas. There are no standards for issuing or revoking easements, and \nthe provision does not require consultation with the Secretary of \nCommerce.\n  There is no requirement that the Secretary of the Interior even \nconsult with the States before making this decision on the Outer \nContinental Shelf.\n  I will explain the Outer Continental Shelf. The first 3 miles off of \nthe coast are State waters. Where does the Outer Continental Shelf \nstart? It starts after that. So you can, as a State, put all the \nrestrictions on damaging projects that would occur because you believe \nyour coastline is God-given. You believe your coastline is also an \neconomic resource. You believe that your coastline and your ocean is \nimportant to protect the fish because, in fact, it is a big industry in \nmy State. You do all these protective things.\n  Now they are going to say it is 4 miles out, or 3 miles plus an inch, \nand they are going to start looking on that Outer Continental Shelf and \ndestroying it. This is what is in there.\n  They weaken the coastal zone, which is important to weigh in on what \nshould be done.\n  Section 325 of the Energy bill erodes States' rights to review and \nrespond to Federal decisions affecting coastal waters. Section 330 \nwould also reduce States' rights to review and comment on pipelines and \nother energy-related projects off their coast by limiting appeals.\n  It is taking me a long time to tell you what is bad in this bill. \nThere are more things, but I want to give you a sense of some of them.\n  Clean air rollbacks: Actually, they have amended the Clean Air Act. \nThey have amended the Clean Air Act in this Energy bill. ``Great news'' \nfor the American people. I am sure they are dancing in the streets that \nthe Clean Air Act has been rolled back in this bill that was written by \ntwo people of the same party from big oil States, behind closed doors, \nwho are threatening that we will never see the light of day on any \nEnergy bill if we don't pass their ``masterpiece.'' The last I heard, \nevery Senator is equal to every other Senator.\n  There is a provision tucked into this conference report designed to \ndelay cleaning ozone pollution in some of the most polluted areas of \nour country. Under the Clean Air Act, the schedule is established for \nareas to clean up their air. How much they have to do, and in what \ntimeframe, depends on how dirty or clean their air is. If these \ndeadlines are missed, an area is bumped up into the worst air quality \ncategory. When this happens, a greater amount of air pollution must be \nreduced and additional requirements are imposed, but on a longer \ntimeframe.\n  This provision will allow areas to avoid the additional requirement \nif some of the air pollution comes from upwind areas. Why this \nprovision and why now? Because the Republicans are trying to overturn \nseveral court decisions holding that this type of an extension is \nillegal under the Clean Air Act. Their argument says it is unfair for a \ncommunity to be forced to clean up air pollution coming from somewhere \nelse.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that every community with poor air quality \ncan meet this test because ozone pollution travels in the air. Somebody \nis going to be able to say we don't have to clean up our air because it \nis coming from somewhere else. Who gets hurt? The people who breathe \nthe air.\n  Why would we delay cleaning up the air as it gets worse and worse? Do \nyou think a child who is in a hospital because of asthma--do you think \nthe mom will say: Why does my kid have asthma?\n  And the doctor will say: Because the air is filthy dirty.\n  And she will say: Oh, my God. That is awful. I am going to write my \nSenator.\n  Then the Senator writes and says: Your kid has asthma from dirty air, \nbut it wasn't coming from your community. It came from another \ncommunity, so please forgive us.\n  Wrong. This is what is done in this bill. Remember, this was written \nby two people of the same party from big oil States.\n  (Mr. SUNUNU assumed the Chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the net result of this could be that no \none will ever have to clean up the air until someone else cleans it up. \nIt is unacceptable. Ozone pollution must be cleaned up. There are 130 \nmillion Americans living in communities that violate ozone smog clean \nair safeguards. Inhalation of smog is linked to respiratory illness, \nsuch as asthma, especially for children.\n  There you have that mother, as a matter of fact, in the hospital with \nher child because hospital admissions for children due to asthma alone \nincreased 30 percent between 1980 and 1999. Overall admissions for \nrespiratory problems\n\n[[Page S15234]]\n\nincreased 20 percent in the same time period. We had a 30-percent \nincrease in asthma admissions in hospitals, but only a 20-percent \nincrease for other things.\n  Let me say to all my colleagues who might be listening, and even to \nthose who might read my remarks, go to any school in your State--it \ncould be a public school, it could be a private school, it matters \nnot--ask the children to raise their hands if they have asthma. Ask \nthem to keep their hands up or new hands for someone who knows someone \nwho has asthma or someone in their family, and you will see almost 40 \npercent of the children in that classroom respond.\n  In California alone, there will be 42,000 additional asthma attacks, \n499 additional hospital admissions, and 68,000 lost schools days. What \nare we doing in an Energy bill to help those children? Are we going to \nclean energy? Of course not. Are we even moving to increase the fuel \neconomy of our cars by 2 miles per gallon or 3 or 4 or 5? Are we? No, \nof course not. This is a bill for big oil. We do a little bit for \nhybrid vehicles. I am glad. We do a little bit for solar. But $28 \nbillion to $1 billion in favor of big oil, big nuclear--big, big, big, \nbig, dirty.\n  Clean water rollbacks: This might surprise you. This is an Energy \nbill. We have clean water rollbacks in this bill. The oil and gas \nindustry is exempted from storm water runoff cleanup. This conference \nreport contains language exempting oil and gas construction activities, \nincluding roads, drill pads, pipelines, and refineries from obtaining a \npermit and controlling their pollution runoff as required under the \nClean Water Act.\n  Explain to me why this is necessary. Are these some poor startup \ncompanies that need our help and, oh, for a while we will let them be \nfree of these requirements? No, these are multinational big companies \nthat have fought so hard that we no longer have a real, important \nSuperfund Program anymore because they don't even want to be taxed a \ntiny bit to clean up the mess they made. This bill gives them more \nrollbacks. They don't have to worry about clean air and clean water.\n  What is going on here? Then the chairman of the committee says: Oh, \nthere will never be another bill; kill this bill and you will never see \nanother Energy bill. Forget about ethanol. Forget about tax breaks for \nthe things you believe in that might work because you will never get \nthem. You are going to have to swallow all this bad stuff to get a \nbill.\n  I want to talk about some more of the bad items, and I will close on \nthe MTBE issue.\n  Here is a picture of our country. All the States in black--and, Mr. \nPresident, I know this is an issue that is near and dear to you--all \nthe States in black are the States that have either ground water \ncontamination from MTBE or drinking water contamination. The ones with \nthe little orange stickers have drinking water contamination.\n\n  Sad to say, my State has an orange sticker. When this came to me, I \nwas stunned to hear that my town of Santa Monica in southern California \nhad lost one-half of its drinking water. When the town tried to figure \nout what to do about it, they found out it would cost millions of \ndollars--$200 million to $400 million to clean up. This is a small \ncity, relatively speaking in terms of California. We are a big State, \nbut it is a relatively small city--$200 million.\n  They said: Oh, my God, what are we going to do? They did what every \nother city, every other county, every other water agency is going to \nhave to do, be they in New Hampshire, be they in Minnesota, be they in \nIowa, be they in Nebraska, be they in Nevada. They went to court. They \nfiled a lawsuit, and they made a claim and said: Please, to the people \nwho put this in our gasoline and it got into our water, please, help us \nclean it up. That is Santa Monica.\n  Many of you know of Lake Tahoe. It is a magnificent lake and a \nbeautiful lake. It was getting polluted with MTBE. MTBE was leaking \nfrom the boats that were on the water into the lake. They went to \ncourt. They tried to sue under three grounds--nuisance, negligence, \ndefective product liability. The judge in that case said on the \nnuisance claim: You haven't proved nuisance because you have to prove \nwho did what to whom, when, and what day. Negligence, same thing. You \nhave to find the people, you have to track the people. But defective \nproduct liability, that makes sense because in discovery they learned--\nthat is a legal term when they are getting ready for the court case--\nthey learned that the makers of MTBE knew this product was bad. As a \nmatter of fact, they joked about it. I forget what exactly they said. \nOne of them said: Major threat to better earnings, MTBE, because they \nknew some day the truth would come out. They joked about it. We found \nthat out.\n  Here is the jury verdict on the Lake Tahoe case. They found the \nmakers of MTBE knew beforehand that this was bad. This is the verdict: \nMTBE was defective in design because they failed to warn of its \nenvironmental risks. Gasoline containing MTBE refined by the other \ndefendants at trial was defective in design because the environmental \nrisks from MTBE outweighed the benefits and refiners failed to warn of \nits known risks. The refiners failed to warn, failure to warn. There is \nclear and convincing evidence that the companies acted with malice--\nacted with malice--as they developed, promoted, and distributed their \ndefective MTBE product.\n  I say in the strongest of terms, when you are told and I am told that \nthese companies acted with malice, why on God's green Earth would we \ngive them a get-out-of-jail-free card in this bill? They acted with \nmalice. They knew it was poison, and now this bill is saying, this bill \nthat was written by two people of the same party behind closed doors \nfrom big oil States: You are off the hook.\n  I also want to tell you that the cost of MTBE contamination--this is \na 2-year old estimate--is $29 billion. That is what this cost 2 years \nago. We are looking at probably 50, 75, to 100 because all those States \nI showed you before are just now beginning to understand how dangerous \nthis contamination is.\n  This bill is an unfunded mandate on New Hampshire. This bill is an \nunfunded mandate on California. This bill is an unfunded mandate on 43 \nout of our 50 States that have MTBE contamination.\n  Now, you can dress it up, you can make it look pretty, you can put \nlipstick on it and rouge, but the bottom line is, it is ugly. It is an \nugly thing to do to the people.\n  I will show my colleagues our little ``get out of jail free card.'' \nHere it is: MTBE producers not responsible for pollution, get out of \njail free.\n  Is this why I came to the Senate? No. It certainly is not why the \nSenator from New Hampshire came, and it should not be why any of us \ncame--to give a ``get out of jail free card'' to the very polluters who \nhave harmed our people.\n  Senator Domenici talks about how many people are for this bill. I \nunderstand that. But the fact is that the League of Cities are against \nthis bill, the National Association of Counties are against this bill, \nthe Water Agency is against this bill, the Association of Metropolitan \nWater Districts, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the list goes on.\n  This bill should not be passed. This bill should never be passed. \nThis bill is a giveaway to the biggest multinational corporations, to \nencourage them to do things they should not be doing. This bill rolls \nback environmental laws.\n  In summation, there were jokes on the floor about those of us who \nwant to stop this bill because of MTBE, that we are taking some small \nstep here, that this is not important. Well, this is important. When \npeople cannot drink the water coming out of their tap and they have to \ngo buy bottled water, this is important. This is important when people \nare fearful that their kids are going to get cancer from MTBE.\n  Remember, no matter what they say, the Government never mandated \nMTBE. The Government mandated an oxygenate. The oil companies picked \nMTBE and they kept using it after they knew it was dangerous. By the \nway, they even used it before an oxygenate was mandated.\n  If we can just put up that map one more time, I would like the \nSenator from Vermont to see this because he has not seen it as clearly \nas this. His State of Vermont has MTBE, as he knows, in the ground \nwater; luckily, we do not think in the drinking water\n\n[[Page S15235]]\n\nyet, but who knows. The orange shows the States where it is actually in \nthe drinking water. My friend from Vermont, who stands every day for \njustice, for the people of this country, understands why we have to \nstop this bill.\n  I thank the Chair for his hard work in representing his State so well \non this really tough issue, and I hope we have a chance to stop this \nbill in its tracks, send it back and have it come back without some of \nthese provisions that are so harmful to the very people we are supposed \nto help, the people of the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 1:45 \nhaving arrived, the Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair, my neighbor across the Connecticut \nRiver in the great State of New Hampshire.\n  Those of us who have wiled away the time sometimes on long airplane \ntrips reading a bad book, we know a lot of bad books have ghostwriters. \nWell, a lot of bad bills that come before the Congress also have ghost \nwriters.\n  If one reads through this 1,100-page Energy bill, they can tell \nactually who the ghostwriters were: The oil, the gas, the coal, and the \nethanol industries that--surprise, surprise--are going to get almost \n$200 billion in tax subsidies from this bill. The voices of those \nghostwriters echo throughout the bill.\n  The cost to the taxpayers does not stop there. If taxpayers feel \ntheir wallets are getting lighter this week, it is because this bill \nwill cost them another $70-plus billion in other subsidies over the \nnext 10 years. Unfortunately, the 1,100 pages of this bill are full of \nspecial interest giveaways, but they are empty of innovative and \nsustainable energy policy, a policy that would ensure Americans a \nclean, reliable, and affordable policy in the future.\n  Some of our colleagues are trying to sell this bill to the American \npublic as a balanced energy plan, something that would give our Nation \nenergy security over the decades to come. It is not that. It only \nincreases our reliance on unsustainable petroleum-based energy sources. \nIt undercuts recent progress in developing renewable energy sources and \ntechnologies that reduce pollution. It undermines the reliability of \nour electricity markets by opening the door to more manipulation and \nmergers in stalling regional efforts to improve the transmission grid.\n  The Senate sent a decent Energy bill to conference. What did we get \nback? We got a frog. We went from the prince to the frog, not the other \nway around. The roster of squandered taxpayers' dollars and squandered \nopportunities in this bill is breathtaking to behold.\n  Now the American people might have expected us to learn from this \nsummer's blackout. After all, it should be fresh in our experiences and \nour minds. It cost governments and businesses billions of dollars. We \ncould have used this bill to address what went wrong. We could have \nused it to build upon what is right. Incredibly, the bill does the \nopposite.\n  New England, where we rely on energy--as all parts of the country \ndo--is also a part of the country where we can get 10, 20, 30 below \nzero sometimes. We have already created a regional organization to \nincrease reliability of our transmission lines. In fact, that was able \nto stop the blackout from cascading further into Vermont and other \nStates. Instead of using an organization that we know works as a model, \nthis bill actually discourages utilities in other regions of the \ncountry from joining regional organizations. It would also discourage \nbadly needed new investment in the transmission grid.\n  Apparently, we can only invest in transmission grids if they are in \nIraq. We cannot invest in them when they are in our own country.\n  There is also no prohibition on the price gouging schemes employed by \ncompanies such as Enron, even though the Senate, on a wide margin, \nvoted for that.\n  The bill repeals a 70-year-old law to restrict mergers of utility \ncompanies with other companies where they have no expertise. In the \npast, that has caused financial troubles for utilities and consequently \nthe ratepayers.\n  One might have hoped the bill could have done more to emphasize \ntechnological innovation, promote clean and sustainable energy, but it \ndoes not. Instead of working to advance technologies to create jobs and \nreduce pollution, we have a bill that gives oil, gas, ethanol, and \nnuclear companies enormous subsidies.\n  One of the things it does, in my own State of Vermont, is it hands \nVermont drivers a double whammy by mandating the use of 5 billion \ngallons of ethanol by 2012 while threatening deep revenue losses in the \nhighway trust fund. Under this bill, Vermonters and drivers in other \nStates can expect higher prices at the pump due to this mandate and \nmore potholes in the road due to the trust fund cuts.\n  We have heard talk about MTBE producers. We know this protects \nproducers of the gasoline additive MTBE from liability, but in Vermont \nand around the country States and communities face multimillion-dollar \nbills for cleaning up the MTBE that is already in the ground \nwater. And, to stop the cases filed, the Energy bill makes the \nprovision retroactive. It wipes out cases filed in September by several \nNew York communities, cases filed by the State of the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, New Hampshire. The list goes on and on but so do the \nechoes of the ghostwriter's voice in this bill.\n\n  This turkey would waive environmental analyses for energy projects on \npublic lands, exempt them from the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water \nAct, open coastal areas to oil and gas development, reduce support for \nclean coal technology, and this bill will simply mean that more toxic \npollutants like mercury will get dumped on Vermont's forests and our \nlakes and our rivers.\n  Shortly after the administration entered the White House, it closed \nthe doors to the public and they started to put together the energy \nindustry's wish list of subsidies--environmental and consumer \nprotection rollbacks. If we pass this bill, we are going to say \nChristmas came before Thanksgiving for these special interests.\n  I don't see how, at a time when we are justifying drastic cuts to \nvital social programs, we can push through a $100 billion \ncounterproductive budget buster for the energy industry.\n  As I said, many a bad book has a ghostwriter, and so do many bad \nbills. When you read through this 1,100-page energy bill, it is clear \nwho the ghostwriter were: the oil, gas, coal and ethanol industries \nthat--surprise, surprise--would reap almost $20 billion tax subsidies \nfrom this bill. The voices of these ghostwriters echo throughout this \nbill.\n  But the cost to taxpayers does not stop there. If taxpayers feel \ntheir wallets getting lighter this week it's because this bill will \ncost them another seventy-plus billion dollars in other subsidies over \nthe next 10-years.\n  Unfortunately, the 1,100 pages are full of special interest giveaways \nbut empty of innovative and sustainable energy policy that will ensure \nAmericans clean, reliable and affordable power in the future.\n  Some of our Republican colleagues are trying to sell this bill to the \nAmerican public as a balanced energy plan to give our Nation energy \nsecurity over the decades to come. It is not.\n  It will only increase our reliance on unsustainable, petroleum-based \nenergy sources. It undercuts recent progress in developing renewable \nenergy sources and technologies that reduce pollution. It undermines \nthe reliability of our electricity markets by opening the door to more \nmanipulation and mergers and stalling regional efforts to improve the \ntransmission grid.\n  The Senate sent a decent energy bill to conference, and we got back a \nfrog. The roster of squandered taxpayers' dollars and squandered \nopportunities in this bill is breathtaking to behold.\n  The American people could have expected that we could have learned \nfrom this summer's blackout--still fresh in our experience and on our \nminds--and used this bill to address what went wrong and build upon \nwhat went right.\n  Incredibly, this bill does the opposite. In New England, we have \nalready created a regional organization to increase reliability of our \ntransmission liens. It was able to stop the blackout from cascading \nfarther into Vermont and other States. Instead of using this \norganization as a model, this bill actually discourages utilities in \nother regions of the country from joining regional organizations. It \ncould also discourage badly needed new investment in the transmission \ngrid.\n\n[[Page S15236]]\n\n  The bill also does not do enough to protect consumers and ratepayers \nfrom manipulation of energy markets. There is no prohibition on the \nprice-gouging schemes employed by companies like Enron, even through \nthe Senate supported such protections by a wide margin.\n  The bill repeals a 70-year-old law to restrict mergers of utility \ncompanies with other companies where they have no expertise. In the \npast, this practice has caused financial troubles for utilities and \nconsequently, the ratepayers.\n  The American people could have hoped that this bill would do more to \nemphasize technological innovation that would promote clean and \nsustainable energy. Instead, it barely holds on to the status quo in \nincentives for renewable and energy efficiency. If we are going to \navoid future blackouts, we have to decrease demand on the electricity \ngrid as well as make improvements to it.\n  But instead of working to advance technologies to create jobs and \nreduce pollution, we have a bill that gives oil, gas, ethanol and \nnuclear companies enormous subsidies.\n  At the same time, this bill fails to address one of the biggest \nenergy and environmental issues facing our country: how to improve fuel \nefficiency standards for cars and trucks. In fact, the bill actually \nwould enlarge a loophole for huge SUVs that will actually encourage \nmore people to buy these gas guzzlers. We all have heard of the SUV \ndealerships that actually use the existing tax loophole in their TV \nads.\n  The bill also hands Vermont drivers a double whammy by mandating the \nuse of 5 billion gallons of ethanol by 2012, while threatening deep \nrevenue losses to the Highway Trust Fund. Under this bill, Vermonters \nand drivers in other States could expect higher prices at the pump due \nto this mandate, and more potholes in their roads due to the Trust Fund \ncuts.\n  While the bill fails to take any steps forward on energy policy, it \ntakes a giant step backward on environmental protections. When the \nClinton administration strengthened the requirements for reducing smog \naround cities, it was hailed as a major step toward reducing asthma and \nother chronic illnesses. Well, by postponing these ozone attainment \ntargets, no one will be breathing easier after this bill except the \nspecial interests.\n  Although you won't be able to see much through the smog when you're \nlooking up, you might see more when you're looking down, and what you \nsee will be unwelcome.\n  This bill includes several new provisions that let polluters off the \nhook when it comes to reducing contaminates in groundwater and drinking \nwater. It protects producers of the gasoline additive MTBE from \nliability if their product is found to be defective. In Vermont and \naround the country, States and communities face multi-million dollar \nbills for cleaning up the MTBE that already has leached into the \ngroundwater.\n  At least one court has already found MTBE producers liable for these \ncleanup costs because of product defects, and several other cases are \npending. To make sure these cases are stopped, the energy bill makes \nthe provision retroactive, wiping out cases filed in September by \nseveral New York communities and New Hampshire.\n  The list goes on and on, and so do the echoes of the ghostwriters' \nvoice in this bill. This turkey would waive environmental analysis for \nenergy projects on public lands. It would exempt oil and gas drilling \nfrom requirements of the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. \nIt would open coastal areas to oil and gas development. It also would \nreduce support for clean-coal technology in favor of the conventional \ndirty power plants.\n  This will simply mean that more toxic pollutants like mercury will \nget dumped on Vermont's forests, lakes and rivers.\n  Days after this administration entered the White House, they closed \nthe doors to the public and started to put together the energy \nindustry's wish list of subsidies and environmental and consumer \nprotection rollbacks. Well, Christmas came early this year for the \nspecial interests.\n  The energy bill now before Congress is stuffed with everything on \nthat wish list, plus just about everything else that these special \ninterests could dream up when they were given the chance.\n  The bill before us now costs three times more than the proposal that \nthe administration first put on the table 2 years ago.\n  When you look at the list of special-interest giveaways, it is no \nwonder the bill was written behind closed doors.\n  The President and the Congress had a real opportunity to produce a \nbill that would lead the Nation toward balanced, sustainable, clean \nenergy production. This bill fails on all counts.\n  Instead, we have 1,100 pages worth of policies that will increase our \ndependence on fossil fuels, prop up wealthy energy corporations, repeal \nconsumer protections and threaten environmental and public health. I do \nnot see how my Republican colleagues can any longer justify their \ndrastic cuts to vital social programs while pushing through this $100 \nbillion, counterproductive budget-buster for the energy industry.\n\n\n                   Tribute To John Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\n  I would like to talk for a moment about a more personal matter. Here \nwe are today, November 20, 2003, just two days away from November 22. I \nthink back to 40 years ago on November 22, 1963. I was living in \nWashington, D.C., at that time, as a young law student. My wife, \nMarcelle, and I were living in a small basement apartment. She was \nworking as a nurse at the VA hospital, then called Mount Alto, up on \nWisconsin Avenue, where the Russian Embassy is now. I was going to \nGeorgetown Law School downtown here in Washington.\n  They say that anybody who was old enough to remember on that November \n22 remembers exactly where they were when they heard the news about \nPresident Kennedy's assassination. That is true of anybody I have ever \nspoken with.\n  I was in the law school library and one of my classmates, who was not \na supporter of President Kennedy, came in and told me the President had \nbeen shot. I told him this was really not funny, and then I realized he \nwas crying. He was a person who had never voted for President Kennedy \nbut realized the enormity of what had happened. When I saw his tears, I \nknew it had to be true.\n  My wife and I did not own a car at the time. I went outside and \nhailed a cab to head back to our apartment. My wife had worked the \nwhole night before, and she was home asleep. I did not want to call \nher. I wanted to tell her in person what had happened.\n  I think I probably got in the only cab in all of Washington that did \nnot have a radio. You can imagine my frustration as we started through \nthe Washington traffic. As we drove down K Street, where many \nstockbrokers have their offices, we could see the screen that normally \ndisplayed stock prices was blank. That was an obvious signal that they \nhad closed the markets in New York.\n  I saw Mrs. Kennedy's brother-in-law. As he would be chauffeured in a \nRolls-Royce to his brokerage house each morning, I would watch with \nenvy from the bus as I went to work. I saw him running into the street, \nfrantic, trying to hail a cab. I saw a police officer directing traffic \nwith tears coming down his face.\n  When I got to our apartment, I banged on the door and woke up my \nwife. We turned on the television to see the now famous announcement by \nWalter Cronkite--taking off his horn-rimmed glasses, announcing the \nPresident was dead.\n  Just a short time before, President Kennedy had given a speech at \nAmerican University, a speech that I thought laid out his focus for \nthat term and what most people believed would be a second term. That \nwas the speech in which he said, ``We must make the world safe for \ndiversity.'' I would like to include a copy of this speech with my \nstatement.\n  We should think about this quote these days. President Kennedy said, \n``make the world safe for diversity.'' He did not say we should make \nthe world an exact copy of the United States. If everybody knew they \ncould follow their beliefs and they could follow their system of \ngovernment, it would be a safer world. But that was not to be.\n  I remember the next day when my wife and I stood on Pennsylvania \nAvenue with a half a million people watching as the cortege went from \nthe White\n\n[[Page S15237]]\n\nHouse up to the Capitol. It was silent. It was so silent that as we \nstood there, we could hear the traffic lights. Even though the street \nwas blocked off, the traffic lights were still operating, and from \neight lanes away, you could hear the click of the lights as they \nchanged. This is with half a million or more people on that street.\n  Where we were standing, near the National Art Gallery, almost from \nthe moment the cortege left the White House, we could hear the noise of \nthe drums and the horses. I remember vividly the riderless horse, the \nboots turned backwards. It was a very spirited horse. I recall his name \nwas Blackjack. He was skittering, his feet dancing on the pavement. I \ncan still hear the click, click of his hooves. I remember a car going \nby with then-Attorney General Robert Kennedy in it, his chin on his \nhand, just staring straight ahead, not seeing any of the crowd. And, of \ncourse, I remember the coffin being brought here to lie in state in the \nRotunda.\n  We heard the distinguished majority leader at that time, Mike \nMansfield, a very close friend of John Kennedy, give a eulogy. He spoke \nof President Kennedy's and Jacqueline Kennedy's wedding rings. She took \nher husband's ring from his finger. It was 40 years ago, but I remember \nit so well.\n  I did not meet Senator Mansfield until more than 10 years later when \nI was the Senator-elect from Vermont. I got to know him well and \nrealized the depth of his affection and his friendship for President \nKennedy, with whom he had served in the Senate. It must have been so \ndifficult for him to give that eulogy.\n  For two days, there were people--not just officials from Washington, \nD.C., but people from all over the country--who were stretched \nliterally for miles, waiting to pay their respects. I can still see \nthem huddled in their coats with frost from their breath in the air as \nthey stood in line all night.\n  We stayed at our apartment to watch the funeral, because we were \nexpecting our first child. We felt the crowd would have made it too \ndifficult to go back downtown.\n  At the funeral, there were heads of state marching from 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue to St. Matthews. There were Prime Ministers, \nPresidents, Kings, Princes, and dictators. Someone came up with the \nidea of having the representatives march based on the name of their \ncountry. The head of France marched next to head of Ethiopia. Emperor \nHaile Selassie of Ethiopia marched next to Charles de Gaulle.\n  The interesting thing about this is the way the world came together. \nIn fact, for a while there was a rumor that Premier Khrushchev might \ncome. Remember, this was the height of the Cold War. This was when \nPresident Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev had stared across oceans at \neach other during the Cuban missile crisis. Khrushchev was dissuaded \nfrom coming by security considerations. Instead, he personally went to \nthe American Embassy to sign the book of condolences. This was the kind \nof unity that was felt around the world.\n  Actually, I cannot think of any time when we felt that kind of unity \nand support for the United States, until the tragedy, 38 years later, \nof September 11.\n  Everybody watched the television, listened to the radio, or stood \ndowntown to watch the funeral. We saw on television planes fly by in a \nmissing man formation followed by Air Force One tipping its wing in \nsalute. We ran outside just in time to see the planes which we had seen \nseconds before on television fly over our heads.\n  Looking around, everybody else had run outside too. We stood there, \nneighbors and strangers.\n  At that time, there was so much optimism, so much hope, even though \nit was at the height of the Cold War, and even though we had just \nexperienced the Cuban missile crisis. After the death of President \nKennedy, we felt so much of this optimism was lost.\n  I saw the unity come back after September 11. I don't know if the \noptimism will ever came back fully. We were optimistic of many things.\n  In my lifetime, we have seen so many wonderful advances in science. \nWhen I was young, we had to worry about polio. Our children and my two \ngrandchildren will never have to worry about those kinds of things. Our \ncountry has had many wonderful advances and much to be optimistic \nabout. There was unity and support from around the world for the United \nStates right after that event, as there was right after September 11. \nWe are now in a time where that unity is missing. I hope it will come \nback.\n  I hope this weekend all Members of this body--most of us are old \nenough to remember that day--I hope we stop and think what is best for \nthis country. It is time to start working together more closely, with \nmore support for each other and the country, and it is time to help \nrestore some of the optimism. We are a great country. We have survived \nworld wars, civil wars, Presidential assassinations, and terrorist \nattacks. We can survive much more--if not for ourselves, for our \nchildren and for our grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print President Kennedy's \n1963 commencement address delivered at American University.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Remarks of President John F. Kennedy, Jr. at American University, \n                     Washington D.C., June 10, 1963\n\n       President Anderson, members of the faculty, Board of \n     Trustees, distinguished guests, my old colleague, Senator Bob \n     Byrd, who has earned his degree through many years of \n     attending night law school, while I am earning mine in the \n     next 30 minutes, ladies and gentlemen:\n       It is with great pride that I participate in this ceremony \n     of the American University, sponsored by the Methodist \n     Church, founded by Bishop John Fletcher Hurst, and first \n     opened by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914. This is a young \n     and growing university, but it has already fulfilled Bishop \n     Hurst's enlightened hope for the study of history and public \n     affairs in a city devoted to the making of history and to the \n     conduct of the public's business. By sponsoring this \n     institution of higher learning for all who wish to learn \n     whatever their color or their creed, the Methodists of this \n     area and the nation deserve the nation's thanks, and I \n     commend all those who are today graduating.\n       Professor Woodrow Wilson once said that every man sent out \n     from a university should be a man of his nation as well as a \n     man of his time, and I am confident that the men and women \n     who carry the honor of graduating from this institution will \n     continue to give from their lives, from their talents, a high \n     measure of public service and public support.\n       ``There are few earthly things more beautiful than a \n     University,'' wrote John Masefield, in his tribute to the \n     English Universities--and his words are equally true here. He \n     did not refer to spires and towers, to campus greens and \n     ivied walls. He admired the splendid beauty of the \n     University, he said, because it was ``a place where those who \n     hate ignorance may strive to know, where those who perceive \n     truth may strive to make others see.''\n       I have, therefore, chose this time and this place to \n     discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the \n     truth is to rarely perceived--yet it is the most important \n     topic on earth: world peace.\n       What kind of peace do I mean? What kind of peace do we \n     seek? Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American \n     weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of \n     the slave. I am talking about genuine peace--the kind of \n     peace that makes life on earth worth living--the kind that \n     enables man and nations to grow and to hope and to build a \n     better life for their children--not merely peace for \n     Americans but peace for all men and women--not merely peace \n     in our time but peace for all time.\n       I speak of peace because of the new face of war. Total war \n     makes no sense in an age when great powers can maintain large \n     and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to \n     surrender without resort to those forces. It makes no sense \n     in an age when a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten \n     times the explosive force delivered by all of the allied air \n     forces in the Second World War. It makes no sense in an age \n     when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would \n     be carried by the wind and water and soil and seed to the far \n     corners of the globe and to generations unborn.\n       Today the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on \n     weapons acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need \n     to use them is essential to keeping the peace. But surely the \n     acquisition of such idle stockpiles--which can only destroy \n     and never create--is not the only, much less the most \n     efficient, means of assuring peace.\n       I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end \n     of rational men. I realize that the pursuit of peace is not \n     as dramatic as the pursuit of war--and frequently the words \n     of the pursuer fall on deaf ears. But we have no more urgent \n     task.\n       Some say that it is useless to speak of world peace or \n     world law or world disarmament--and that it will be useless \n     until the leaders of the Soviet Union adopt a more \n     enlightened attitude. I hope they do. I believe we can help \n     them do it. But I also believe that we must re-examine our \n     own attitude--as individuals and as a Nation--for our \n     attitude is as essential as theirs. And every graduate of \n     this school, every thoughtful citizen who despairs of war and \n     wishes to bring\n\n[[Page S15238]]\n\n     peace, should begin by looking inward--by examining his own \n     attitude toward the possibilities of peace, toward the Soviet \n     Union, toward the course of the Cold War and toward freedom \n     and peace here at home.\n       First: Let us examine our attitude toward peace itself. Too \n     many of us think it is impossible. Too many of us think it is \n     unreal. But that is dangerous, defeatist belief. It leads to \n     the conclusion that war is inevitable--that mankind is \n     doomed--that we are gripped by forces we cannot control.\n       We need not accept that view. Our problems are manmade--\n     therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can be as big \n     as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human \n     beings. Man's reason and spirit have often solved the \n     seemingly unsolvable--and we believe they can do it again.\n       I am not referring to the absolute, infinite concept of \n     universal peace and good will of which some fantasies and \n     fanatics dream. I do not deny the values of hopes and dreams \n     but we merely invite discouragement and incredulity by making \n     that our only and immediate goal.\n       Let us focus instead on a more practical, more attainable \n     peace--based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but \n     on a gradual evolution in human institutions--on a series of \n     concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the \n     interest of all concerned. There is no single, simple key to \n     this peace--no grand or magic formula to be adopted by one or \n     two powers. Genuine peace must be the product of many \n     nations, the sum of many acts. It must be dynamic, not \n     static, changing to meet the challenge of each new \n     generation. For peace is a process--a way of solving \n     problems.\n       With such a peace, there will still be quarrels and \n     conflicting interests, as there are within families and \n     nations. World peace, like community peace, does not require \n     that each man love his neighbor--it requires only that they \n     live together in mutual tolerance, submitting their disputes \n     to a just and peaceful settlement. And history teaches us \n     that enmities between nations, as between individuals, do not \n     last forever. However fixed our likes and dislikes may seem \n     the tide of time and events will often bring surprising \n     changes in the relations between nations and neighbors.\n       So let us persevere. Peace need not be impracticable--and \n     war need not be inevitable. By defining our goal more \n     clearly--by making it seem more manageable and less remote--\n     we can help all peoples to see it, to draw hope from it, and \n     to move irresistibly toward it.\n       Second: Let us re-examine our attitude toward the Soviet \n     Union. It is discouraging to think that their leaders may \n     actually believe what their propagandists write. It is \n     discouraging to read a recent authoritative Soviet text on \n     Military Strategy and find, on page after page, wholly \n     baseless and incredible claims--such as the allegation that \n     ``American imperialist circles are preparing to unleash \n     different types of wars . . . that there is a very real \n     threat of a preventive war being unleashed by American \n     imperialists against the Soviet Union . . . (and that) the \n     political aims of the American imperialists are to enslave \n     economically and politically the European and other \n     capitalist countries . . . (and) to achieve world domination.\n       Truly, as it was written long ago: ``The wicked flee when \n     no man pursueth.'' Yet it is sad to read these Soviet \n     statements--to realize the extent of the gulf between us. But \n     it is also a warning--a warning to the American people not to \n     fall into the same trap as the Soviets, not to see only a \n     distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see \n     conflict as inevitable, accommodations as impossible and \n     communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats.\n       No government or social system is so evil that its people \n     must be considered as lacking in virtue. As Americans, we \n     find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal \n     freedom and dignity. But we can still hail the Russian people \n     for their many achievements--in science and space, in \n     economic and industrial growth, in culture and in acts of \n     courage.\n       Among the many traits the peoples of our two countries have \n     in common, none is stronger than our mutual abhorrence of \n     war. Almost unique, among the major world powers, we have \n     never been at war with each other. And no nation in the \n     history of battle ever suffered more than the Soviet Union \n     suffered in the course of the Second World War. At least 20 \n     million lost their lives. Countless millions of homes and \n     farms were burned or sacked. A third of the nation's \n     territory, including nearly two thirds of its industrial \n     base, was turned into a wasteland--a loss equivalent to the \n     devastation of this country east of Chicago.\n       Today, should total war ever break out again--no matter \n     how--our two countries would become the primary targets. It \n     is an ironical but accurate fact that the two strongest \n     powers are the two in the most danger of devastation. All we \n     have built, all we have worked for, would be destroyed in the \n     first 24 hours. And even in the Cold War, which brings \n     burdens and dangers to so many countries, including this \n     Nation's closest allies--our two countries bear the heaviest \n     burdens. For we are both devoting massive sums of money to \n     weapons that could be better devoted to combating ignorance, \n     poverty and disease. We are both caught up in a vicious and \n     dangerous cycle in which suspicion on the other, and new \n     weapons beget counter-weapons.\n       In short, both the United States and its allies, and the \n     Soviet Union and its allies, have a mutually deep interest in \n     a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race. \n     Agreements to this end are in the interests of the Soviet \n     Union as well as ours--and even the most hostile nations can \n     be relied upon to accept and keep those treaty obligations, \n     and only those treaty obligations, which are in their own \n     interest.\n       So, let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also \n     direct attention to our common interests and to means by \n     which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end \n     now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe \n     for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic \n     common link is that we all inhabit this plant. We all breathe \n     the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we \n     are all mortal.\n       Third: Let us re-examine our attitude toward the Cold War, \n     remembering that we are not engaged in a debate, seeking to \n     pile up debating points. We are not here distributing blame \n     or pointing the finger of judgment. We must deal with the \n     world as it is, and not as it might have been had history of \n     the last eighteen years been different.\n       We must, therefore, preserve in the search for peace in the \n     hope that constructive changes within the Communist bloc \n     might bring within reach solutions which now seem beyond us. \n     We must conduct our affairs in such a way that it becomes in \n     the Communists' interest to agree on a genuine peace. Above \n     all, while defending our vital interest, nuclear powers must \n     avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a \n     choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war. To \n     adopt that kind of course in the nuclear age would be \n     evidence only of the bankruptcy of our policy--or of a \n     collective death-wish for the world.\n       To secure these ends, America's weapons are non-\n     provocative, carefully controlled, designed to deter and \n     capable of selective use. Our military forces are committed \n     to peace and disciplines in self-restraint. Our diplomats are \n     instructed to avoid unnecessary irritants and purely \n     rhetorical hostility.\n       For we can seek a relaxation of tensions without relaxing \n     our guard. And, for our part, we do not need to use threats \n     to prove that we are resolute. We do not need to jam foreign \n     broadcasts out of fear our faith will be eroded. We are \n     unwilling to impose our system on any unwilling people--but \n     we are willing and able to engage in peaceful competition \n     with any people on earth.\n       Meanwhile, we seek to strengthen the United Nations, to \n     help solve its financial problems, to make it a more \n     effective instrument of peace, to develop it into a genuine \n     world security system--a system capable of resolving disputes \n     on the basis of law, of insuring the security of the large \n     and the small, and of creating conditions under which arms \n     can finally be abolished.\n       At the same time we seek to keep peace inside the non-\n     communist world, where many nations, all of them our friends, \n     are divided over issues which weaken western unity, which \n     invite communist intervention or which threaten to erupt into \n     war. Our efforts in West New Guinea, in the Congo, in the \n     Middle East and in the Indian subcontinent, I have been \n     persistent and patient despite criticism from both sides. We \n     have also tried to set an example for others--by seeking to \n     adjust small but significant differences with our own closest \n     neighbors in Mexico and in Canada.\n       Speaking of other nations, I wish to make one point clear. \n     We are bound to many nations by alliances. These alliances \n     exist because our concern and theirs substantially overlap. \n     Our commitment to defend Western Europe and West Berlin for \n     example, stands undiminished because of the identity of our \n     vital interests. The United States will make no deal with the \n     Soviet Union at the expense of other nations and other \n     peoples, not merely because they are our partners, but also \n     because their interests and ours converge.\n       Our interests converge, however, not only in defending the \n     frontiers of freedom, but in pursuing the paths of peace. It \n     is our hope--and the purpose of Allied policies--to convince \n     the Soviet Union that she, too, should let each nation choose \n     its own future, so long as that choice does not interfere \n     with the choices of others. The communist drive to impose \n     their political and economic system on others is the primary \n     cause of world tension today. For there can be no doubt that \n     if all nations could refrain from interfering in the self-\n     determination of others, then peace would be much more \n     assured.\n       This will require a new effort to achieve world law--a new \n     context for world discussions. It will require increased \n     understanding between the Soviets and ourselves. And \n     increased understanding will require increased contact and \n     communications. One step in this direction is the proposed \n     arrangement for a direct line between Moscow and Washington, \n     to avoid on each side the dangerous delays, \n     misunderstandings, and misreadings of the other's actions \n     which might occur at a time of crisis.\n       We have also been talking in Geneva about other first-step \n     measures of arms control, designed to limit the intensity of \n     the arms race and to reduce the risks of accidental war. Our \n     primary long-range interest in Geneva, however, is general \n     and complete disarmament--designed to take place by stages, \n     permitting parallel political developments to build the new \n     institutions of peace which would take the place of arms. The \n     pursuit of disarmament has been an effort of this Government \n     since the 1920's. It has been urgently sought by the past \n     three Administrations. And however dim the prospects may be\n\n[[Page S15239]]\n\n     today, we intend to continue this effort--to continue it in \n     order that all countries, including our own, can better grasp \n     what the problems and possibilities of disarmament are.\n       The one major area of these negotiations where the end is \n     in sight--yet where a fresh start is badly needed--is in a \n     treaty to outlaw nuclear tests. The conclusion of such a \n     treaty--so near and yet so far--would check the spiraling \n     arms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place \n     the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively \n     with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the \n     further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our \n     security--it would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this \n     goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, \n     yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole \n     effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital \n     and responsible safeguards.\n       I am taking this opportunity, therefore, to announce two \n     important decisions in this regard.\n       First: Chairman Khrushchev, Prime Minister Macmillan and I \n     have agreed that high-level discussions will shortly begin in \n     Moscow looking toward early agreement on a comprehensive \n     test ban treaty. Our hopes must be tempered with the \n     caution of history--but with our hopes go the hopes of all \n     mankind.\n       Second: To make clear our good faith and solemn convictions \n     on the matter, I now declare that the United States does not \n     propose to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere so long as \n     other states do not do so. We will not be the first to \n     resume. Such a declaration is no substitute for a formal \n     binding treaty--but I hope it will help us achieve one. Nor \n     would such a treaty be a substitute for disarmament--but I \n     hope it will help us achieve it.\n       Finally, my fellow Americans, let us examine our attitude \n     toward peace and freedom here at home. The quality and spirit \n     of our own society must justify and support our efforts \n     abroad. We must show it in the dedication of our own lives--\n     as many of you who are graduatng today will have a unique \n     opportunity to do, by serving without pay in the Peace Corps \n     abroad or in the proposed National Service Corps here at \n     home.\n       But wherever we are, we must all, in our daily lives, live \n     up to the age-old faith that peace and freedom walk together. \n     In too many of our duties today, the peace is not secure \n     because freedom is incomplete.\n       It is the responsibility of the Executive Branch at all \n     levels of government--local, state and national--to provide \n     and protect that freedom for all of our citizens by all means \n     within their authority. It is the responsibility of the \n     Legislative Branch at all levels, wherever that authority is \n     not now adequate, to make it adequate. And it is the \n     responsibility of all citizens in all sections of this \n     country to respect the rights of all others and to respect \n     the law of the land.\n       All this is not unrelated to world peace. ``When a man's \n     ways please the Lord,'' the Scriptures tell us, ``he maketh \n     even his enemies to be at peace with him.'' And is not peace, \n     in the last analysis, basically a matter of human rights--the \n     right to live out our lives without fear of devastation--the \n     right to breathe air as nature provided it--the right of \n     future generations to a healthy existence?\n       While we proceed to safeguard our national interests, let \n     us also safeguard human interests. And the elimination of war \n     and arms is clearly in the interest of both. No treaty, \n     however much it may be to the advantage of all, however \n     tightly it may be worded, can provide absolute security \n     against the risks of deception and evasion. But it can--if it \n     is sufficiently effective in its enforcement and if it is \n     sufficiently in the interests of its signers--offer far more \n     security and far fewer risks than an unabated, uncontrolled, \n     unpredictable arms race.\n       The United States, as the world knows, will never start a \n     war. We do not want a war. We do not now expect a war. This \n     generation of Americans has already had enough--more than \n     enough--of war and hate and oppression. We shall be prepared \n     if others wish it. We shall be alert to try to stop it. But \n     we shall also do our part to build a world of peace where the \n     weak are safe and the strong are just. We are not helpless \n     before that task or hopeless of its success. Confident and \n     unafraid, we labor on--not toward a strategy of annihilation \n     but toward a strategy of peace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I rise to talk about the Energy conference report and urge my fellow \nSenators to support this bill. We have waited for a comprehensive \nEnergy bill for too long. I am pleased that we have before us a good \nenergy policy bill which we can send to the President of the United \nStates.\n  The conference bill is not perfect. I don't believe I have voted for \na perfect bill in the last 17 years. But no bill we ever pass around \nhere is perfect. But it is a good compromise that will help our country \nmeet its future energy needs. This agreement will mean more jobs and \nmore money in American's pocketbooks and create more than a million \njobs across this country. We are already on the upturn of an economic \nrecession. This bill will help kick our economy into high gear.\n  A good energy policy must strike a balance between energy production \nand conservation. This bill does just that by including increased \nenergy production while also doing more to encourage conservation and \nsmarter energy use.\n  I know this bill was difficult to get out of conference. I watched my \nchairman for almost 2 months suffer with this bill. Under his \nleadership and the leadership of Senator Grassley, we have before the \nSenate a solid piece of legislation that provides energy policy and tax \nincentives to promote production and energy efficiencies throughout and \nthe use of cleaner burning fuels.\n  In the wake of our ongoing problems in the Middle East, now more than \never a sound energy policy is a critical part of our national security. \nWe must have a reliable source of energy and we must cut our reliance \non foreign oil. Presently we depend on foreign nations, including the \nMiddle East, for nearly 60 percent of our Nation's oil supply. While we \nappear to be moving away from combat in Iraq, we still have many \nproblems there. There is still a lot of uncertainty in the Middle East. \nWe need to increase our own production of energy because it is more \nimportant than ever right now. It is too important and there is too \nmuch instability in the world not to pass this bill. We do not want the \nUnited States of America at the mercy of other countries just to keep \nour engines running and our lights on. This Energy bill will help \nincrease our energy independence by increasing domestic production of \nenergy and reducing our reliance on foreign sources.\n  This bill allows for and encourages through tax credits more oil and \nmore natural gas exploration. The bill also includes clean coal \nprovisions that I helped write, to increase domestic production, while \nalso improving environmental production soundness. In my home State \nthis means jobs, a lot of jobs, and a cleaner place to live.\n  Clean coal technology will result in a significant reduction in \nemissions and a sharp increase in energy efficiency.\n  I am proud to be from a coal State. Generations of Kentuckians have \nmade their living in the coal fields and coal mines of Kentucky. For \nthe last decade, coal in Kentucky was on the downturn because of \nlegislative and regulatory policies from the Federal Government which \nforced electricity generation to invest in natural gas-fired facilities \ninstead of coal.\n  I am glad to see we have turned things around and are taking steps to \nmake sure coal continues to play a vital role in meeting our future \nenergy needs. This focus on clean coal is good for the environment. It \nis certainly good for the economy and for putting folks back to work.\n  The Energy bill encourages research and development of clean coal \ntechnology by authorizing nearly $2.6 billion in appropriations for the \nDepartment of Energy to conduct programs to advance new technologies. \nAlmost $2 billion will be used for the clean coal power initiatives \nwhere the DOE will work with industry to advance efficiencies, \nenvironmental performance, and cost competitiveness of new clean coal \ntechnologies.\n  The energy tax package includes $2.5 billion for coal-fired companies \nto invest in clean coal technologies and pollution control equipment. I \nam pleased to see that the bill also authorized an additional $2 \nbillion for clean air programs which will encourage the use of \npollution control equipment and the next generation of clean coal \ngenerators.\n  The 21st century economy will require increased amounts of reliable, \nclean, and affordable electricity to keep our Nation running. This bill \nrecognizes that coal must play an important role in our energy future.\n  Today, more than half our Nation's electricity is generated from an \nabundant low-cost domestic coal. We have over 275 billion tons of \nrecoverable coal reserves. This is nearly 30 percent of the world's \ncoal supply. That is enough coal to supply us with energy for more than \n250 years.\n  This Energy bill also includes fuel provisions that I pushed hard for \nthat will help make fuel burn cleaner. The bill requires the use of 5 \nbillion gallons\n\n[[Page S15240]]\n\nper year of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel in gasoline \nby the year 2012. The bill also provides tax credits to encourage the \nuse of these fuels. Increasing the use of alternative fuels will help \nfarmers while also increasing domestic energy production and lessening \nour dependence on foreign oil.\n  The bill also addresses electricity. Kentucky is the second lowest \nelectric rate State in the Union. It just fell below Idaho. Much of \nKentucky's low rates come as a result of our coal production. The low \nrates also come from Kentucky's decision to put Kentucky consumers \nfirst before consumers outside of the State.\n  I do not believe this bill goes far enough to prevent FERC from \nimplementing SMD permanently or preventing mandatory RTOs. I do believe \nthis bill is a good compromise. The bill delays until 2007 FERC's plan \nto create its SMD and allows companies to participate in RTOs \nvoluntarily.\n  Some of the electric provisions are especially good for Kentucky. \nMore than one-third of Kentucky's electricity comes from rural electric \ncooperative distributors. This bill will help the consumer-owners of \nKentucky's 26 electric cooperatives to stay in business and maintain \nthe State's status as having the lowest residential or second lowest \nresidential rates in the country.\n  I worked hard in the Senate Energy Committee to ensure that the small \nrural electric cooperatives in Kentucky are not subject to expensive \nFERC jurisdiction that could raise consumers' rates without improving \nthe reliability of the electric utility system. This is a big issue for \nour cooperatives in Kentucky that serve only a few thousand customers \nand do not have bulk transmission.\n  This bill specifically codifies RUS borrowers' existing exemption \nfrom FERC regulation and expands the exemption to include small \nelectric cooperatives that sell less than 4 million megawatts of \nelectricity per year. This is also called the small utility exemption.\n  The bill also minimizes other new regulatory burdens on cooperatives. \nI am pleased to see this bill does not include new regulatory programs \nsuch as environmental mandates that would have raised consumers' \nelectric rates.\n  I hope the Senate passes the Energy bill this week so we can make our \nenvironment, economy, and national security stronger.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for the time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is to be recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nNew Mexico, who has asked permission to speak for a few moments.\n  I say to the Senator, whatever time you would like, I would be happy \nto yield for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, Mr. President. I will not take too long.\n  I wish to speak a moment to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  First, I say to the Senator, I chair the Energy Committee, and I am \nvery pleased that Kentucky has contributed you to the committee. You \nbring to us an enthusiastic approach to America's self-sufficiency, not \nthe gloom and doom of: We can't make it, we can't do it. You are always \nthere saying: We ought to do it. Why don't we do it?\n  I am very pleased we were able to put in this new law a series of \nprovisions that permit the Senator to come to the floor and speak with \noptimism about coal of the future, coal and America's future. Of course \nit is parochial but it is national.\n  The Senator's State is a coal producer but it is a part of America. \nKentucky is a State in the Union. Your State does not want to go down \nin coal. As I understand it, you want coal to go up. You do not want \n``King Coal'' dead. You want ``King Coal'' alive.\n  The first thing I want to do is say to the Senator, it is very \ninteresting to see how you interpret this and how others interpret it--\nthat all these coal provisions are a giveaway to big business. I did \nnot hear the Senator mention big business once, not because they are \nnot going to be involved, but I think it is because the Senator \nunderstands you are not going to produce new, clean coal generators \nwith nonprofit organizations.\n\n  I guess the Senator assumes, as I do, that some coal company is going \nto apply to the Department of Energy to do this. Is that not right, I \nask the Senator?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Absolutely. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So one can stand up and say: There must have been great \nlobbying from the coal companies.\n  Well, the coal companies did not have to lobby. All we had to do was \nhave a brain and to know there is coal and say: Well, what are we going \nto do so somebody will invest money in coal, servicing our country in a \nbigger and better way?\n  If it turns out some choose to come to the floor and label that \nindecent lobbying by a big company, I am sorry, we could have done this \nif no coal company ever visited us, I assure you.\n  I say to the Senator, we have Senators like you who told us about it.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I assure the Senator from New Mexico that I was not \nlobbied by coal companies. But I sure was lobbied by the small electric \nproducers in Kentucky.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely. The truth is, whatever you lobbied for as a \nSenator, that is your privilege. Nobody could say you should not work \nfor coal in this bill, that you ought to just abandon it, that you \nshould not do that because that is representing an interest. Of course. \nWell, if there are no interests, there is nothing going on. Right? We \njust as well might go to sleep and forget about it.\n  Another thing that is interesting, we have had at least three \nSenators come to the floor, including my cohort from New Mexico, saying \nthey are against electricity provisions because they wanted FERC to \nhave more power.\n  Now, I did not have the luxury of making speeches about FERC. I had \nto write something. And here we have one Senator saying FERC should \nhave run the whole electric system in the country. Right?\n  Then we have this Senator. He is over here saying: You almost went \ntoo far, where we skinnied back on FERC's power. We said it can phase \nin over time. Right?\n  You were not sure of that. If you had been writing it, and did not \nhave anybody else pressuring you, you would have written it more in \nfavor of your State. But, you see, I did not have the luxury of writing \none for each State, one that affects you up the road.\n  Then there is another State--such as Pennsylvania--saying: We don't \ndo business like they do. We want a whole different electricity \nprovision. I heard that. I could not write one for them, too. Right?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Fifty different ones.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The last time they used to write two was before the \nCivil War. They wrote one for the South and one for the North. But I \ntold them: Why don't you cut it in four pieces and we will write four \nof them? Right? But there aren't four countries; there are just the \nStates. So we did the best we could. I think it is a good provision.\n  Now, what else about it? I share with you, right now, on the electric \nprovision that here is the study. So everybody can see it--it is the \nfirst time it has been on the floor of the Senate. It is entitled \n``Interim Report: The Causes of the August 14th Blackout in the United \nStates and Canada.'' I do not think I will ask that it be printed in \nthe Record. I will refer to it. We have gone through it and we have \nlooked at what they said.\n\n  Let me say to my friend, it says that the principal reason we had a \nblackout was that all of the States, with their various utility \nsystems, had what are called reliability standards.\n  Now, I am not a technician, but reliability means something pretty \ncommon and ordinary. I can talk reliability at home in an evening with \nmy wife. We talk a lot about this, and she should know what that is. \nReliability standards means that you appropriately and prudently load \nyour electric wires so they are not so overloaded that something \nhappens, or that they are clean and they do not have things imposing \nupon their reliability.\n  This said it was nothing dramatic. It was not that we have an old, \nwornout system. Somebody said we had a Third World system. No, no, we \ndo not. We have a first world system, not a third\n\n[[Page S15241]]\n\nworld system. When we have a blackout, it is big news. That is because \nwe have a first-rate system. You know the third-rate systems nobody \ncares about because they are not working anyway.\n  So the truth is, this little report says the biggest reason it went \nout was reliability.\n  Well, guess what. For all the things we did so wrong in this bill, \none of the principal things we provided was mandatory reliability \nstandards. No more cheating, fudging, hiding a little, and overloading \nthe lines during heavy use, and saying: Well, nobody will do anything--\nexcept when it blows out. Then we all find out.\n  So I say to everybody, we did the report. You wondered what happened. \nYou got the study. You got a bill. The bill says, if you pass this \nbill, it is fixed. Right?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Contrary-wise, do what some have suggested, throw the \nbill out, and you are right back where we were. You are right back \nwhere we were. You can sit around and wait for a blackout, just playing \nwith your hands, worrying, sweating, saying: When will it occur?\n  At least this bill says we know why it occurred, and we are not going \nto let it occur again. The Feds are going to fine anybody who is lazy \nand loafs around and doesn't clean up the lines. In fact, the report is \npretty good that they are going to be on them to get the trees off the \nlines. That would be good news; we don't have to go out there line by \nline. But that is part of the reliability.\n  The point I make is, for every issue people have raised on the floor \nthat this bill doesn't do or fails to do, on the other hand it does and \nit doesn't fail to. Every time people say ``we don't like it because,'' \nthere is something in it to say, ``but we do like it because.'' I \nregret that it can't be every single Senator taking the floor and \nsaying: Everything in it is precisely what I want.\n  I am glad we have people such as the Senator from Kentucky who knows \nthat can't happen.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, obviously, I am in opposition to this \nEnergy bill. The Senator from New Mexico is my friend. We go nose to \nnose and toe to toe and fight on a lot of issues. We are in real \ndisagreement over this bill. But I respect him and like him very much. \nWhen we do come together on issues such as mental health parity, it is \na wonderful feeling for us to be on the same side fighting together. \nUnfortunately, today that may not be the case, but tomorrow I hope it \nis. I have a great deal of respect for him and for all the hard work he \nand his staff and so many others put into this legislation.\n  What I like about Senator Domenici--I guess most of all--is his \ncandor. He tends to play cards with the cards face up. You know what \nyou are dealing with. He is very honest and plain-spoken. That is a \nrefreshing virtue and quality in this world of politics. He was quoted \non the floor the other day, talking about this Energy bill:\n\n       We know that as soon as you start reading the language, we \n     are duck soup.\n\n  That is what he said. I have to say to the Senator from New Mexico \nthat I have read some of the language. It looks like a duck, it walks \nlike a duck, and it sounds like a duck. It is a duck. And we are in the \nsoup if we enact it.\n  There are provisions in this bill that are very good for America and \nvery good for my home State, provisions which I have long fought for \nthroughout my congressional career: Expanding the use of ethanol, \nexpanding the use of biodiesel. These are positive steps to help \nfarmers, rural communities, to clean up air pollution in a sensible \nway, to provide energy resources which are not being used as much as \nthey should. You might not expect to hear that from a Senator from \nIllinois because we have the largest ethanol production in the Nation. \nI have been honored to represent a congressional district that includes \nDecatur, IL, home of Archer Daniels Midland, the largest single ethanol \nproducer in the Nation.\n\n  I came to this issue with some knowledge and with an inclination to \ntry my best to expand ethanol. Throughout my public career, I have done \nit. I have been chairman of the congressional alcohol fuels caucus. I \nhave introduced legislation, sponsored it. I have led efforts with \nletters and speeches, just about all you can do to promote ethanol. If \nit is enacted, the ethanol provision in the bill will be the most \ndramatic expansion in the Nation's history. I certainly support it.\n  To all of my friends in the farm community back home who are \ndisappointed because I oppose this bill, trust that my commitment to \nethanol is not going to change. I am just going to hope that the next \nvenue, the next opportunity to discuss ethanol, will be in a much \ndifferent bill, a much better bill.\n  Sadly, what is included in this bill, beyond the ethanol provisions \nand the biodiesel provisions and efforts to look for new ways to burn \ncoal in an environmentally safe way, many of the provisions are very \nbad, very troublesome.\n  Tomorrow we will have a vote. That vote will decide whether this bill \ngoes forward to final passage. It really is the key vote. It is going \nto be close, probably within one or two Senators' votes. They will \ndecide what happens to this Energy bill. It is my hope that the \nSenators who are on the fence now or worried about the vote will \nconsider several things.\n  First, we can do better. If this is supposed to be an Energy bill for \nAmerica's future, we can do so much better. Take any family in your \nState, wherever you are from--Tennessee, Illinois, New Mexico, or \nDelaware--sit down with them and say: When it comes to the energy \nfuture of America, what is the first thing we ought to look at? My \nguess is that most of those individuals, with no particular scientific \nor technical knowledge, will say: How about all the gasoline we are \nburning in our cars and trucks? That is the most obvious use of energy \nin America.\n  It is the No. 1 use of imported petroleum products, conversion into \ngasoline to fuel our cars and trucks. So you would assume that in this \nlengthy bill, the first chapter of the bill would relate to how we can \nburn this gasoline more efficiently, how we can reduce our consumption \nof gasoline, how we can make our cars and trucks more fuel efficient so \nthere is less pollution and less dependence on foreign oil.\n  Most Americans would assume that.\n  Well, there is bad news. You can search this new law that is being \nproposed, page after page after page for 1,400 pages, and find precious \nlittle, if any, reference to fuel efficiency and fuel economy of \nAmerica's cars and trucks. Why? How can we in good faith say to the \nAmerican people that we are concerned about our energy security and \nenergy independence without addressing the fuel efficiency of our cars \nand trucks?\n  There was a time, in 1975, when the average fuel efficiency was about \n14 miles a gallon. Congress passed a law that almost doubled that fuel \nefficiency to 27.5 miles a gallon by 1985. That was 18 years ago. You \nask yourself: How good are we today? Have we improved on that mark? Are \nwe doing better than 27.5 miles a gallon on average? The answer, sadly, \nis no. We have gone in the opposite direction. We are closer now to 22 \nmiles a gallon.\n\n  What has happened in 18 years? No leadership--not from Congress, not \nfrom the President--no leadership that leads us to more fuel \nefficiency. Instead, we have left it to the forces of the marketplace. \nThere are many here who believe that is all we need to worry about; let \nthe market work its will.\n  The market has worked its will and, as a result, we are selling cars \nthat are less and less fuel efficient. We are importing more oil from \noverseas and burning it to fuel heavier, less fuel-efficient vehicles. \nIn fact, this Congress, if it has shown any leadership, has gone in the \nopposite direction. We have created tax incentives for people to buy \nthe most inefficient cars and SUVs in America, these monstrous Humvees \nthat come rolling down the highway. We are going to give you a great \nbig tax credit if you will buy those. Do you know why? Those big old \nmonsters get between 9 and 15 miles a gallon. We will give you an \nincentive to buy those.\n  Yet when it comes to incentives to buy fuel-efficient cars, hybrid \nvehicles, we are going to have to phase that out. We do have a deficit.\n  Isn't that upside down? Shouldn't we be thinking about encouraging \nmore\n\n[[Page S15242]]\n\nfuel-efficient vehicles if we truly want to lessen our dependence on \nSaudi Arabia and Middle Eastern oil? That is obvious to most people in \nthe State I represent. It is obvious to most Americans. It certainly \nwas not obvious to the sponsors of this Energy bill. They wrote this \nbill listening to Detroit. The automobile manufacturers in Detroit--I \nhave worked with them on a number of issues--are just plain wrong on \nthis. They have fought tooth and nail every proposal to bring more \nfuel-efficient vehicles to America.\n  Do you want to hear the irony of this situation? The irony was \nbrought out by a disclosure--quoting here from the Baltimore Sun of \nNovember 19, 2003. Listen to what they wrote:\n\n       Chinese leaders are worried about their nation's growing \n     dependence on imported oil. What's more, pollution from such \n     fossil fuels threatens to become a parallel concern as \n     China's booming economy matures.\n       So they've hit upon an obvious energy strategy that somehow \n     has eluded U.S. lawmakers: conservation.\n       In what should be an embarrassing juxtaposition for leaders \n     here, China is moving to impose tighter fuel-efficiency rules \n     on cars and SUVs than the U.S. requires, while Congress is \n     adopting an opposite approach--boosting domestic \n     production of fossil fuels to meet all-but-unchecked \n     demand.\n       . . . adds insult to injury by subsidizing the purchase of \n     monster gas-guzzlers, such as the Humvee.\n\n  They conclude:\n\n       The Senate still has a chance to stop this monstrosity [the \n     Energy bill]. It should take a cue from China and prepare for \n     the future, instead of squandering precious resources trying \n     to maintain an unsustainable past.\n\n  Chinese thinking on energy is very clear, I might say. It is the \nthinking of American politicians that is inscrutable. How in the world \ncan we be talking about energy independence and ignore fuel efficiency \nfor the cars and trucks we drive? That, sadly, is the reality of this \nlegislation. That is why it cannot be taken seriously. You cannot \nbelieve this is the best the Congress in America can produce to deal \nwith energy, without addressing that issue.\n  There is another issue here which I think goes to questions of \njustice and fairness, maybe even morality. I hate to raise that \nquestion, but we hear a lot about morality and virtue and values on the \nfloor of the Senate. Occasionally, we should apply those same words to \nthe legislation we consider. That relates to section 1502 of this \nlegislation.\n  Section 1502 of this legislation has created a ``get out of jail free \ncard'' for the producers of MTBE. What is MTBE? It is a substance that \nhas been added to gasoline for years in America to reduce the tailpipe \nemissions and to make your engine run more smoothly. It is what is \ncalled an oxygenate. You probably didn't even know it was there. But it \nis blended with gasoline for those purposes, as an oxygenate. It is a \nproduct of waste products of the oil-processing procedure. So it is a \npretty cheap commodity. It has been blended, for years, with gasoline \nin the United States. Other oxygenates include ethanol, which I \nreferred to earlier, and, like alcohol, it is benign and doesn't really \nthreaten the environment.\n  But MTBE--this additive--turns out to be extraordinarily dangerous. \nIt is a poison, a toxic substance which, if it leeches into a water \nsupply, can make it undrinkable, at best, and dangerous, at worst, \nleading those who consume it to a greater likelihood of serious illness \nand disease, even the potential of cancer.\n  So what has happened across the United States is that the oil \ncompanies that use MTBE as an additive learned that when the \nunderground storage tank at your gas station started to leak--little \ndrips day after day--ultimately, that MTBE-blended gasoline would reach \nthe water table under the ground, and the water supply of the community \nwhere the gas station was located. As it reached the water supply, it \ndidn't biodegrade but continued to be toxic and lethal. As a result, \nthe consumers, the families, the children, and the schools that consume \nthis water were at a public health risk.\n  Well, this contamination has now spread across the United States. It \nis in Illinois and in many other States. Let me show you how bad this \nis.\n  Here is a map showing States with MTBE contamination in ground \ndrinking water. The Presiding Officer's State of Tennessee does not \nhave contamination in drinking water but does have contamination sites. \nTennessee has 1,394 MTBE contamination sites. Illinois, where I live, \nhas 9,546 MTBE contamination sites. Look at this map of America. You \ncan see that where MTBE has reached the ground water, and now the \ndrinking water, we have the public health hazard that has swept across \nAmerica. Only six States in the continental United States have not been \ntouched by this. Hawaii has not but Alaska has. Alaska's drinking water \nhas been contaminated as well.\n\n  Why is this important? Because, for the first time in my memory, and \nI have asked my legal staff to keep looking--I may be wrong--we have \ndecided to put into legislation protection from liability for product \nliability cases that are filed against MTBE producers. If you are an \noil company that had MTBE blended with your gasoline and it ended up \ncontaminating drinking water, causing a public health hazard, this \nbill, in section 1502, says, for you, you are in luck, you get a ``get \nout of jail free card.''\n  How can we do this? How can we, in all fairness, say the corporations \nand businesses that made a conscious decision to use this additive, and \nbecause of the use of this dangerous substance are endangering the \npublic health and lives of Americans, will somehow be free of \nliability?\n  One of the first things we decided in America--those who sat down \nand, in their wisdom, created our Constitution--was that we would do \naway with royalty; we weren't going to give people titles such as \n``princes'' and ``viscounts'' and whatever it happened to be in the old \ncountry. No, in America it is different. There is no royalty. We are \nall the same. People are treated the same. The highest and the lowest \nin rank in America are held accountable.\n  But that is not the case when it comes to this Energy bill because if \nyou happen to be an oil company with MTBE contamination, we are going \nto treat you like royalty with a ``get out of jail free card.'' We are \ngoing to say that you are not going to be held responsible as will the \nbusiness next door selling another product. That is just plain wrong.\n  Senator Domenici came to the floor and said repeatedly--understand, \nhe turns the cards over so there is no doubt what is going on. He says: \nUnderstand what this bargain was. If you want ethanol, you want to sell \nmore ethanol--the oil companies hate ethanol; they don't make ethanol. \nIn order for them to go along with this bill, in order for the oil \ncompany giants to agree to promoting ethanol in America, we had to give \nthem this MTBE waiver of liability. Those are not my words. I think \nthey are an accurate paraphrase of Senator Domenici's words, repeated \nmany times on the floor of the Senate. He said: If you don't give the \noil companies this protection from liability for their own wrongdoing, \nfrom product liability lawsuits, frankly, there is going to be no \nethanol in your future.\n  Isn't it a sad outcome that we would turn our backs on 153,858 MTBE \ncontamination sites in America and say to the communities, to the towns \nand cities, the subdivisions and the families, to the individuals who \nare harmed by this MTBE: We are sorry, you will not have a day in \ncourt. You will not be able to hold the people accountable who ended up \nendangering your family. Why? Because we had to strike a political \ndeal. We had to say that when it came to using ethanol--which is a \nbenign substance, environmentally acceptable--we had to swallow hard \nand say to the makers of MTBE and the oil producers that we are going \nto let them off the hook.\n  Do you know what else is in this bill? It is not just a protection \nfrom liability. Imagine this, if you will. We provided in this bill \nthat you can continue to sell MTBE in the United States until 2014. \nNow, here is a substance that we know is damaging the environment in \n153,858 contaminated sites, and this bill gives the companies the \nexpress permission to continue to sell it in America. It goes on to say \nthat any Governor or the President can stop the MTBE ban for any State \nor region, which means 2014 is not a real deadline. Then, to add the \nultimate insult, it gives to the industry $2 billion to transition away \nfrom MTBE.\n  My mind is spinning to think that Congressman DeLay of Texas, who \nsupposedly is the author of this, was so audacious as to walk into the \nconference\n\n[[Page S15243]]\n\nand say: Here is the deal, my friends. This lethal chemical in gasoline \ncan continue to be sold in this country for 11 or 12 more years, and \nany Governor or President can extend the sale of that beyond that \nperiod; any company that wants to stop selling it is going to get a \nFederal subsidy to a total tune of $2 billion; and, furthermore, while \nthis MTBE additive continues to contaminate water supplies and endanger \npublic health, we are going to make sure that those who are injured, \nthe innocent victims across America, cannot go to court and sue under a \nproduct liability claim.\n  How can we do this? How can we in good conscience do this? How can we \nignore this section of the bill, this outrageous section of the bill?\n  Frankly, this is good reason to say to our friends who have worked \nlong and hard on this conference report: Enough; send this bill back \nfor more work. Remove this outrageous section about MTBE. Protect \ninnocent American families and communities, and do it now.\n  There are those who argue, frankly, that there are other lawsuits \nthat can be filed, that you don't have to use the product liability \ntheory. Here is a lawsuit that was filed in Lake Tahoe, CA, South Tahoe \nUtility District v. ARCO, Atlantic Richfield Company. Here is what the \njury verdict was in the case.\n  Lyondell--the maker of the MTBE additive--Lyondell's MTBE was \ndefective in design because Lyondell failed to warn of the \nenvironmental risks.\n  They went on to say: Gasoline containing MTBE refined by the other \ndefendants at trial was defective in design because the environmental \nrisks of MTBE outweigh the benefits and the refiners failed to warn of \nits risks.\n  They went on to say: There is clear and convincing evidence that \nLyondell and Shell acted with malice as they developed, promoted, and \ndistributed their defective MTBE products.\n  What this tells us is that the companies which were sued knew they \nhad a dangerous product, they continued to make it, continued to sell \nit, and continued to endanger people. Not only are they clearly guilty \nunder a product liability standard, they are guilty, I think, in the \nworst scenario. As I recall from law school, it is whether they knew or \nshould have known. This is not a ``should have known'' situation. The \nwrongdoers with MTBE actually were found, in this case, to have known \nit was a dangerous product.\n  Yesterday, I came to the floor and talked about this MTBE issue. I no \nsooner left the floor than the oil industry decided to put out a \nrebuttal to the remarks I had made on the floor. It is a lengthy \nrebuttal, but I would like to address the elements in it.\n  Frankly, they were plain wrong and the record should be set straight. \nI stated in my floor statement yesterday and I repeat again today, \nthere were alternatives to MTBEs in the 1990s. Some would have you \nbelieve we had no choice when it came to oxygenate; it was MTBE or \nnothing. But listen to this: The MTBE manufacturers knew conclusively \nby 1984 that MTBE was a dangerous product that could contaminate water \nwells throughout the United States. They misled the Environmental \nProtection Agency in direct responses to inquiries in 1986 when they \nclaimed they were unaware of MTBE water contamination.\n  Because of this deception by the MTBE companies about the dangers of \ntheir product and their efforts to discredit anybody who said \notherwise, the industry increased its production at the expense of the \nalternative oxygenate, ethanol.\n  It should be noted, MTBE, as I said earlier, is a waste product, \ncheaper than ethanol. Had the manufacturers of MTBE disclosed the truth \nabout MTBE contamination, the ethanol industry would have done quite \nwell, and Congress might or could have prohibited this product at a \nvery early stage. But because of the active deception of the MTBE \nindustry, starting with their knowledge in the 1980s of the danger \nof their product, this didn't happen.\n\n  I went on to say that MTBE was found to be a probable cause of \ncancer. I spent a lot of my years on Capitol Hill fighting the tobacco \ncompanies. I know how they work. The MTBE gang is up to the same bag of \ntricks. They are now starting to dispute medical evidence as to whether \nMTBE is dangerous.\n  The industry, in rebuttal to my remarks, said:\n\n       MTBE is one of the most widely studied chemicals in \n     commerce, including pharmaceuticals, and that the \n     overwhelming majority of scientific evaluations to date have \n     not identified any health-related risk to humans from the \n     intended use of MTBE in gasoline.\n\n  Then they go on to cite ``numerous government'' and ``world-renowned \nindependent health organizations'' having found no sufficiently \ncompelling reason to classify MTBE as carcinogenic.\n  Let me tell you, the MTBE industry, like the tobacco industry, when \nit comes to playing games with medical evidence, is plain wrong. The \nUniversity of California at Davis concluded that MTBE is a known animal \ncarcinogen.\n  In addition, the director of the General Accounting Office's Office \nof Natural Resources and Environment testified before Congress in May \n2002 and stated:\n\n       An interagency assessment of potential health risks \n     associated with fuel additives to gasoline, primarily MTBE, \n     concluded that while available data did not fully determine \n     risk, MTBE should be regarded as a potential carcinogenic \n     risk to humans. . . . A primary rule in epidemiology is \n     ``Absence of evidence of risk is not evidence of absence of \n     risk.''\n\n  The data has been coming in leading community after community, jury \nafter jury, to conclude that this dangerous product might or could have \nendangered the health of Americans.\n  The removal of MTBE, as I said yesterday, is a growing problem. Their \nindustry spokesman said:\n\n       It's more water soluble and can be transported more readily \n     in soil and water than other gasoline constituents.\n\n  I will tell you this: The largest MTBE manufacturer in the United \nStates, Lyondell, has already been forced to revise its product safety \nbulletin and state, in their own industry safety bulletin:\n\n       A relatively small amount of MTBE, less than 1 part per \n     billion, can impart a displeasing taste and odor to water.\n\n  The U.S. Geological Survey has determined MTBE is the second most \nfrequently detected pollutant in the United States, second only to \nchlorine, which is intentionally added to water, to give you an idea of \nhow pervasive this issue is.\n  I also stated that the defective product claim is the most effective \nto secure relief against MTBE. The industry denies it. Yet what we have \nfound is this: We have had to, in most communities across America, dig \nup gasoline storage tanks because they leaked. It was through the \nLeaking Underground Storage Trust Fund--the LUST fund--that a lot of \nthis was paid for. We did it because we found this leaking gasoline was \ncontaminating underground wells and aquifers.\n  The point I make is this: Despite our best efforts to dig up these \nunderground storage tanks, the problem across America has not abated. \nAbout half of the States have reported finding MTBE they can still \nattribute to leaking tanks and suspect it came from other sources, even \nabove-ground tanks to store fuels.\n\n  The point I would like to make is this, for those who are attempting \nto rebut my remarks of yesterday: The problem with MTBE has not gone \naway and is not likely to go away soon. What this legislation is \ndesigned to do is to hold those wrongdoers, those producers of MTBE, \nharmless from liability in product liability lawsuits for selling an \ninherently dangerous and defective product, a product which the \nindustry has known since 1984 would contaminate water supplies and \nendanger public health.\n  This, in my mind, is the ultimate in irresponsibility. Frankly, I \nwould like to say to my friends in the farm community who have said to \nme, You have to look the other way; we have to allow ethanol to expand \neven if it means endangering the lives of people from contaminated \nwater in public water supplies--I would like to say to them, remember \nwhat you said yourself.\n  The president of the Illinois Farm Bureau, Ron Warfield, a good \nfriend of mine, called and spoke to me about this issue. He has \ntestified before Congress, and he said:\n\n       We recognize the urgency of ending MTBE use to protect \n     drinking water supplies.\n\n  Mr. Warfield went on to state:\n\n       MTBE has adverse human health and environmental impacts.\n\n\n[[Page S15244]]\n\n\n  He went on to state:\n\n       The farm bureau's belief--\n\n  This is the Illinois Farm Bureau--\n\n       that any legislation that addresses MTBE must be national \n     in scope. Allowing States that have different programs will \n     not allow us to achieve our national energy goals.\n  This bill goes directly against the Illinois Farm Bureau's position. \nThis bill says, when it comes to MTBE we are going to allow them to \nescape liability. We, who have said for years that MTBE was a dangerous \ncontaminant, cannot forget our own word.\n  My colleague in the Senate, Senator Fitzgerald, I believe in 2002, \nintroduced legislation to ban the use of MTBE and to move toward the \nuse of a safer oxygenate, specifically the use of ethanol. My \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives, Congressman Shimkus from \nIllinois, and Congressman Ganske, introduced similar legislation.\n  Senator Fitzgerald said in his press release, March 6, 2000: Despite \nrelatively limited MTBE use in Illinois, the Illinois EPA reports that \nat least 25 communities across the State have detected the chemical in \ntheir water supply, and three towns have had to discontinue use of \nwells as a result of MTBE contamination.\n  That is a quote from Senator Fitzgerald's press release in March of \n2000. He understood the seriousness of this risk. He understood the \ndanger to Illinois and its communities. Frankly, the situation has not \ngotten better. It is worse.\n  Taking a look at this chart, we can see that in Illinois we have \n9,546 contaminated MTBE sites, including drinking water sites. So for \nmy colleagues, Senator Fitzgerald, Congressman Shimkus, my friends at \nthe Illinois Farm Bureau, and other farm organizations, I hope they can \nunderstand how this bill, frankly, makes a mockery of what we have said \nin the past.\n  If we have said, under oath at times, that MTBE is dangerous to the \npublic health, how can we in good conscience now support this bill, \nwhich includes section 1502, which lets the producers of MTBE off the \nhook? How can we say to the communities and families of Illinois, or \nany other State affected, that we are going to limit their opportunity \nto come to court?\n  Yesterday, Senator Domenici likened lawsuits against MTBE producers \nto lawsuits against McDonald's because a woman was scalded when hot \ncoffee was spilled on her lap. I might say to the Senator, there is all \nthe difference in the world between the two of them. The lawsuit \nagainst the MTBE producers is a lawsuit based on the fact that this \nindustry had knowledge, almost 20 years ago, that what they were \nselling was environmentally dangerous. They continued to sell it. They \ndeceived the Government. They secreted information away from the \npublic, and now they are trying to escape liability for their fraud and \ntrickery.\n  Why should we be party to their fraud? Why should we say that they \nwill not be held accountable for their wrongdoing? Is it not a premise \nof law and the rule of law in America that each and every individual \nand business will be held accountable for their wrongdoing? Why, then, \ndo we cut this wide swath and say that these contaminants, the \ncompanies that made them, and the lawsuits that might come from them, \nshould somehow be changed by this law? That is fundamentally unfair. \nWhy would we do that at the same time that we offer $2 billion in \ntaxpayer money to these companies as they phase out the use and \nproduction of that product?\n  I can think of plenty of businesses in my State of Illinois, or the \nStates of New Mexico, West Virginia, and Texas, that are struggling to \nsurvive, that could use a Federal subsidy to get through a transition. \nWe are not giving them a subsidy, but we are giving a subsidy to the \noil and chemical companies that make MTBE a $2 billion subsidy. That, \nto me, is unconscionable, unreasonable, and indefensible. It is good \nreason for us to stand and oppose this bill.\n\n  When we look at the States that are affected by this--New Mexico, \n1,126 contaminated sites; the State of West Virginia, 1,333 \ncontaminated sites; Texas, 5,678 contaminated MTBE sites, and the list \ngoes on and on--it says to each one of us that this crisis is not over. \nThis crisis will continue. If we fail to hold the wrongdoers \naccountable, others will pay the price. There will be injured \nindividuals and families who will have to bear the brunt of this \nenvironmental crime. There will be cities, towns, villages, and States \nwhich will have to pay to put infiltration systems in, new water \nsystems and cleanup because of these polluters.\n  Why is it that this administration, and its friends in Congress, are \ndedicated to polluter protection instead of the basic principle that \npolluters should pay?\n  Polluters should pay for their own pollution. This is a classic \nexample. Section 1502, which absolves in product liability lawsuits \nMTBE manufacturers from their responsibility and their liability, I \nthink that is classic in terms of special interest legislation.\n  As I mentioned at the outset, Senator Domenici said there was a real \ndanger--and let me quote him directly: We know as you start reading the \nlanguage, we are duck soup. That is what Senator Domenici said on the \nSenate floor.\n  Well, we have read the language and, as we read it, we are saddened \nand troubled that in the Senate we would have such an egregious carve-\nout, such a blatant effort to reward one special interest group. I \nunderstand Congressman Tom DeLay's political strength, his persuasive \nability, but to think that he could walk into a conference and force \nthis provision into this conference committee is something that I do \nnot think we should accept.\n  This is what we have to face. Those of us from States with MTBE \ncontamination cannot walk away from our responsibility. We have to \nacknowledge that this bill, so long as it contains this provision, \nneeds to be defeated. This bill must be stopped in its tracks. We must \nsay to those who spent so much time on it, they need to go back and \ntell Congressman DeLay, the oil companies, and those who are pushing \nfor this provision, that this is patently unacceptable and it is, \nfrankly, unprecedented in American law that we would exempt one company \nfrom its own wrongdoing. But that is exactly what we are doing.\n  Once we have removed this offensive provision, we need to sit down \nand write a real Energy bill, an Energy bill which tries to encourage \nalternative fuels and renewable fuels, an Energy bill which focuses \nonce and for all on ``conservation,'' which seems to be a blasphemous \nword in this administration, in this Congress, but one that most \nAmericans understand. We need an Energy bill that deals with fuel \nefficiency and fuel economy. Sadly, this bill does not.\n  We need an Energy bill that looks to reducing our dependence on \nimported oil in the future. Maybe we should invite the Chinese to come \nover and give us some guidance on how we could move toward conservation \nand fuel economy and less dependence on foreign oil because, frankly, \nthey understand it far better than we do. We need an Energy bill that \ndoes not have to get passed by being larded up with a gusher of \ngiveaways. If one wants to talk about oil exploration, there is a \ngusher of giveaways in this bill, giveaways to cities, towns, States, \nCongressmen, and Senators. Is that what it takes to develop an energy \npolicy in America? I hope it does not.\n\n  I am no newcomer to Capitol Hill, and I understand that sometimes one \nhas to keep the process moving along and they have to help one State or \nthis region or one industry or that industry, but when it goes to this \nextreme, when it goes to the extreme of absolving a polluting and \ncontaminating industry from their legal liability in products liability \nlawsuits for contamination of 153,000 sites across America, then it has \ngone entirely too far.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the motion for cloture. \nIf that motion is stopped, this bill is stopped. When it is, it can go \nback to conference.\n  Let us hope that for the first time we will have an open process. \nThis whole energy policy started when Vice President Cheney created a \nsecret task force with secret meetings, producing a secret bill, \nleading to the administration's energy policy. It continued apace \nthrough the congressional process and returned to secrecy when two \nindividuals, my friend the Senator from New Mexico and the Congressman \nfrom Louisiana, Mr. Tauzin, sat down in a room without other Members \nand without anyone from the minority party and wrote this bill.\n\n[[Page S15245]]\n\n  The reason there is such resistance today is the fact that this was \nnot an open process. It should have been more open. Had it been more \nopen, I do not believe anyone could, in good conscience, have proposed \nthis MTBE exclusion from liability. You could not have brought this out \nin public with a straight face. But in private you can, and that is \nwhat happened.\n\n  Now the bill is on the floor and America gets a chance to read it. \nHaving read it, I urge those who happen to be from the States with \ncontamination of MTBE--and I put this map up here for those who are \nfollowing the debate, for my colleagues to note. If your State is in \nblack on this map, you know you have MTBE contamination. If it has one \nof those gold circles as well, it is contamination of drinking water.\n  If you vote for this legislation, you are saying to the people living \nin your State and your communities: We are closing the opportunity for \nyou to go and hold the people accountable who have created this \nenvironmental disaster in your State.\n  I wouldn't want to go home and try to explain that. And I am not, \nbecause, frankly, I am going to oppose this bill so long as it contains \nthis provision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Under the order, the distinguished Senator from Texas \nis next; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. She has been waiting. I assume she asks she be next. \nWill the Senator let me use 5 minutes before she proceeds?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to take 5 minutes on the issue my \ngood friend from Illinois raised here today. Has anybody thought how in \nthe world there would be MTBE being used in all these different parts \nof the United States even today, even today? Has anybody wondered why \nit is still being used? Because it is still valid according to the laws \nof our land, and it is approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. \nThis MTBE product was produced because the U.S. Government sought an \nadditive to be applied to gasoline so it would be cleaner than gasoline \nwithout it.\n  I want to assure everybody in this country. The Senator makes it \nsound as if the product is an illegal product. If he doesn't, then I \nwould sure say, if per se this product is this dangerous, it ought to \nbe banned. But isn't it interesting?\n  He could say it should be, but the truth is, it is not. It has not \nbeen, and there has only been a little ripple of talking around here \nabout perhaps shutting it down.\n  Why has there been none? Why is the Environmental Protection Agency, \nnot just this one, the one in the Clinton and the one before that--why \ndid they not do something about it? The reason is there is nothing \nwrong with the product. The product is being used. If it is used right, \nit is a good product. We are going to do better when we do ethanol.\n  But the good Senator from Illinois--I don't know how many times he \nwill come back to the floor, how many times the Senator from Illinois \nwill return to the floor to speak about MTBE. But his State is the \nsecond largest producer of corn in America, and the reason he is down \nhere talking about MTBE is because he is scared of his farmers because \nhe is not going to vote for the thing they want more than anything \nelse--ethanol. That is what they want. He has been working on it. I \nhave been working on it. Everybody has been working on it. And this \nSenator has decided, the Senator who just spoke, from Illinois, decided \nhe would rather defend the trial lawyers who want to go after the \ncompanies that produce MTBE.\n\n  I also assure you that the language in this bill does not say that \nanybody is immune from liability. It merely says you can't sue the \nproducer of the product just because they produced the product.\n  What is happening is it is being used improperly. When it is used \nimproperly, it is producing all these ill effects across the country.\n  Does that mean we sue the people who produced it? I repeat, it is a \nlegal product that has been approved by the Environmental Protection \nAgency. The United States of America approved it and now it is being \nused but people don't use it right. Underground tanks leak and it leaks \ninto the water system. Does that mean the company 2,000 miles away that \nmanufactured the product should be responsible to clean up those water \nsystems? Of course not.\n  But I guarantee they are chomping at the bit to do it--do what? Not \nto sue the people whose tanks leaked because they are not fat enough. \nThey are chomping to sue the big oil company that manufactured it for \nthe last 20 years.\n  Now I want to read the statute. The statute says: No product shall be \ndeemed defective--\n\n     if it does not violate a control or prohibition imposed by \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``Administrator'') under \n     section 211 of such Act, and the manufacturer is in \n     compliance with all requests for information under subsection \n     (b) of such section 211 of such Act. . . . If the safe harbor \n     provided by this section does not apply, the existence of a \n     claim of defective product shall be determined under \n     otherwise applicable law. Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to affect the liability of any person for \n     environmental remediation costs--\n\n  Clean up the water, sewer systems and water systems.\n  It says:\n\n       Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect the \n     liability of any person for environmental remediation costs, \n     drinking water contamination, negligence for spills or other \n     reasonably foreseeable events, public or private nuisance, \n     trespass, breach of warranty, breach of contract, or any \n     other liability other than liability based upon a claim of \n     defective product.\n\n  Frankly, there is no defective product. You can go on saying where it \nis all over America and that is because it is legal to use it. But it \nis not legal to abuse it. When people abuse it, should we really, as a \nnation, say the people who manufactured it are liable for all the \nconsequences? I think not. That is all we did in this legislation.\n  If the distinguished Senator is so worried about this, I suggest he \nought to vote for this bill and take care of the ethanol producers in \nhis State and other States. He may be the deciding vote that decides we \nare not going to have ethanol. I wouldn't like to be in that position, \nI tell you, not on a weak proposition that the reason I did it was to \nprotect the big lawyers who want to file these lawsuits. I say to all \nof them: File your lawsuits. When this thing is over with, file your \nlawsuits. It is just that you will not be able to sue the company that \nmade the product which is legal and allowed. You can sue anybody else \nwho caused the damage.\n  It is like somebody who drinks some soup in a restaurant and somebody \nin the restaurant, instead of putting soup in the bowl, they put some \npoison in it. You drank it and got sick.\n  Do you sue Campbell's Soup Company for producing the soup or do you \ngo look for the people who put the poison in it?\n  The truth is, maybe we would all like to see MTBE go away. But that \nis not the issue. The issue is whether or not we should deny the \npassage of an Energy bill and ethanol for the farmers of this country, \na great, giant substitute for the crude oil that we are going to use; \nwhether we are going to do that or not.\n  If we are not, we surely ought not do it based upon the excuse that a \nvalid product licensed by the United States improperly used is causing \ndamage to people and we don't want to let them sue the people who \nproduced the product but let them sue anybody else--the leaking tank \nowner, the distributor who distributed it wrongly, or anybody else who \ncaused this--just because you made a legal product and somebody got \nhurt later on down the line, go back and sue the company that made it \nlegally, validly, under what one might say is almost a license from the \nFederal Government.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for yielding. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico \nfor shepherding this very important and very complicated bill to the \nfloor.\n  I have to say I have been in the Senate for 10 years, and I have \ntried to get an Energy bill through the Senate during all of that time. \nWe have never been able to do that until the Senator from New Mexico \nbecame chairman of\n\n[[Page S15246]]\n\nthe committee. What he has produced is a balanced bill. There are many \nthings in it that I don't like. There are many things in it that I am \nsure every one of us in this Chamber would do a little differently. But \nwe are a legislative body, and people have the right to have differing \nviews and come together in compromises.\n  When we are making the decisions about how we are going to vote on \nlegislation, we have to determine if the good outweighs the bad and if \nthe bad is going to be unchangeable or more harmful than we should \nallow. I think the good definitely outweighs the bad in this bill.\n  I was going to talk about the MTBE issue. I couldn't talk about it \nany better than the Senator from New Mexico. People forget that MTBE \nwas a mandate from the Federal Government. It came as a result of a \nmandate to produce oxygenated gasoline to try to reduce smog in our \ncountry and reduce pollution. The manufacturers came forward with MTBE. \nIt is a perfectly safe product if used properly. In fact, it did have \nthe intended consequences of reducing pollution.\n  The reason it is going to be phased out is that it has been misused, \nit has leaked into water supplies, all of which is very bad. But I \ndon't think making the manufacturers of a product that was produced at \nthe insistence and mandate of the Federal Government is good public \npolicy. I think the MTBE issue has been used as a stalking horse for \npeople who do not like other parts of the bill.\n  In fact, I think this is a good Energy bill. We must have an energy \npolicy that addresses the issue of self-sufficiency for our country.\n  Between 1950 and 2000--50 years--overall energy consumption in the \nUnited States increased three-fold. We currently account for 24 percent \nof consumption worldwide. Yet, while demand has drastically increased, \ndomestic exploration and the development of renewable sources have not \nkept pace. What we are doing today and tomorrow and as long as it takes \nto pass this bill, I hope, is promoting conservation, promoting \nincreased efficiency, promoting reduced consumption, and promoting \nincreased production from traditional sources. Some forms of energy are \nlimited. They will exhaust themselves over time. But others are \nreplaceable.\n  In this bill, we encourage the replaceable sources. Geothermal \ntechnology offers a clean, sustainable energy created by the harnessing \nthe Earth's heat. Geothermal resources can be found in shallow ground \nor in hot water and rock miles below the Earth's surface. Hydropower, \ncurrently the largest source of renewable power in the United States, \nyields electricity from flowing water. Solar energy harnesses sunlight \nto generate electricity, provide hot water to heat and cool, and light \nbuildings. Wind energy is created by 16-ton turbine engines capturing \nthe wind with two or three giant blades to generate electricity. These \nturbines can be seen on hilltops where there is strong wind and not too \nmuch turbulence.\n  These are becoming increasingly a common sight in my home State of \nTexas, one of the Nation's leaders in wind energy production.\n  All of these sources are clean, natural, and renewable, and they can \nplay a greater role in our Nation's energy policy. This legislation \nprovides incentives for nuclear power. This has been overlooked in \nrecent decades.\n  Since 1978, no new nuclear plants have been built in our country. \nFear of accident and extraordinary insurance costs have made nuclear \nenergy a costly venture. While European nations have safely developed \nsophisticated nuclear capability, the United States has let development \nof this important source lag. By encouraging the development of nuclear \nenergy, we will give American companies a kick start that will create \nthe high-paying technology and construction jobs and provide probably \nthe biggest source of clean energy to meet our high demand.\n\n  One of the parts of the bill that I wrote is tax credits for marginal \nwells. Marginal wells are the 10-barrel-a-day wells, or less. When \nthere are wells that produce a million barrels, thousands of barrels, a \n10-barrel-a-day well is a small well. It takes a lot of capital to go \nout and drill a well. If a producer believes it is going to be a very \nsmall well, that producer is going to be less likely to incur the costs \nof drilling. But in fact, these little bitty wells, if they are going \nat full capacity in our country, and if we encourage them, can bring up \nthe same amount of oil and gas as we import from Saudi Arabia every \nday. These little wells can be drilled by small business people. They \ncan create jobs in the oil fields, and they can become a significant \nsource of oil and gas for our country.\n  We have tax credits for these small wells if the price goes below $18 \na barrel. These people will go out of business at $18 a barrel. They \ncannot make it. They can't break even. They will have to close the \nwell, which is also expensive, and let their people go. So you have a \nloss of jobs. With a credit for marginal wells, when the price goes \nbelow $18 a barrel, you can encourage these people to go ahead and \ndrill the well, put people to work and keep producing oil and gas for \nour country. Hopefully, the price goes back up--and, of course, the \nprice is up right now. So it wouldn't even take effect right now. But \nit gives that floor so that the little guys will take the chance to go \nahead and drill that well.\n  This provision was modeled after a Texas law that has also been quite \nsuccessful in waiving certain State taxes for the little guy to keep \nthose wells going.\n  The other thing it does is allow expensing for delayed rental costs, \nand G and G--which is the geological and geothermal exploration. These \nare expenses that are incurred, and in any other business they are able \nto be written off. They would be able to in this bill as well.\n  It encourages deep drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, which is quite \nexpensive. We have had incentives over the last few years for this deep \ndrilling. It has become the largest source of oil and gas we have in \nour country except for Alaska. Of course, we are not able to drill in \nANWR. So this is a very significant resource for us, the Gulf of \nMexico.\n  All of these are provisions I put in the bill because I believe that \nkeeping the small businesses in business is a very important part of \nenergy self-sufficiency in our country and creating jobs.\n  There is a national security issue. When 60 percent of our oil is \nimported--and we know how volatile the largest sources of those imports \nare in the Middle East--we know our country is going to be in a very \nbad fix if we lose those resources because of volatility or the war on \nterrorism. Our economy will be affected adversely. That will affect our \njobs. It will affect our factories. It will affect our small business \ncosts if we don't have our own sources of energy. That is why the \nSenator from New Mexico and the people on the committee who worked to \nforge this bill were addressing our national security interests as much \nas those who work on the defense issues.\n\n  If we are energy self-sufficient, that means our economy will not be \nin upheaval if we have a huge loss in the ability to import foreign \noil, and therefore the price goes up and it becomes prohibitively \nexpensive. We need to have our own sources of energy. We need to be \ndependent on ourselves. We need to keep the jobs for energy in our own \ncountry. That is why this bill is a good bill. It is not a perfect \nbill. No one said it is. I would not have written it this exact way, \nbut it is a good bill. It will make us more energy self-sufficient, \nwhich also means we will be more secure in our country, more secure in \nour economy, and we will keep the jobs coming which are so important to \nkeeping our economy strong and to have the recovery we have all been \nlooking for to occur in the next year.\n  I support this bill. I hope people will look at the big picture. I \nhope people will look at the rhetoric on MTBE and overlook some of the \nthings they do not like in the bill by looking at the good things that \nwill increase production, increase the renewable energy sources, \nincrease the clean energy, and decrease our consumption all at the same \ntime so we will have a better energy policy for our country.\n  We have been working on this for over 10 years. The time has come. We \nwill be able to fix things that do not work. We always do that with \nmajor legislation that is passed. The time has come. We have the \ncapability to act now. I hope we will not lose it.\n\n[[Page S15247]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, we have before the Senate the long-awaited \nEnergy bill. For the more than 3 years of its making, we have been led \nto believe this was to be the piece of legislation that would go a long \nway toward solving our Nation's energy problems. But instead of \nproviding for our Nation's energy security and stability, this bill \ndoes little more than codify back-room bargaining, underwrite the \nadministration's corporate contributions, and further deepen our \ndeficit ditch.\n  This bill is a monstrosity of gifts for special interests. Its \npassage will mean another lost opportunity to shore up our Nation's \nenergy security, provide for future economic growth, and protect \nconsumer interests.\n  The White House and Republican advocates may argue that this bill is \nnational, comprehensive, and strategic. It is not. Advocates argue that \nthis is a premier jobs bill and that hundreds of thousands of new jobs \nwill be magically created because of the Pixie dust that is sprinkled \nthroughout the bill. But these are empty assertions. This Energy bill \nwill be neither an economic shot in the arm nor a jobs booster.\n  The White House and its secretive energy task force have done their \nutmost to dictate the terms of energy legislation for more than 3 years \nnow. This energy conference bill is that dismal result. The Republican \nenergy bill negotiators took a page out of the Vice President's \nplaybook by not undertaking their deliberations in an open, \ntransparent, and bipartisan manner. When well-placed corporate heads \nhave a greater voice at the conference table than the minority Members \nof Congress, then we have truly sold our Nation's energy policy to the \nhighest bidder. This conference was a shameful example of how the big \nmoneyed interests who are bosom pals of this administration, continue \nto elbow out the best interests of the American people.\n\n  The American people should also know that the White House and \nRepublican proponents who have so often avowed the free market system \nand fiscal responsibility are essentially ignoring those policies in \nthis bill today. During the deliberations on energy legislation, the \nWhite House raised concerns about unrealistic authorizations and \nindicated its support for only $8 billion in tax incentives. But now \nthe Bush administration wholeheartedly welcomes and strongly supports \nthis bill regardless of its budgetary impact.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the deficit will be \ndeepened to the tune of $25.7 billion because of mandatory spending and \nunbalanced tax incentives. This Energy bill, like so many bills that \nCongress has passed, is another empty promise. The White House's only \nmajor goal is to tick off a campaign pledge, regardless of its contents \nor lack thereof.\n  Furthermore, this bill is replete with unrealistic new authorizations \nthat go far beyond the reality of our limited and shrinking budgetary \nresources.\n  Passage of this bill is far from a guarantee that the money will \nflow. How many authorization bills have been passed during the tenure \nof the Bush administration pledging huge sums of moneys that never came \ninto being? How easy it is to vote to authorize funding, to make a \nsplash in the headlines, and raise hopes about the funds that will flow \nfrom Washington, but when it comes to actually putting money in the \nbudget and supporting the promised funding levels in the appropriations \nbills, this administration jumps ship again and again and again. One \nneed only look at the No Child Left Behind program to see how this game \nof bait and switch is practiced and played.\n  What complicates the matter further is the number of new programs \nthat have been created in this bill. In a perfect world I would like \nnothing better than to be able to support a plethora of energy programs \nthat truly advance our neighbor's ability to produce and use energy \nmore cleanly and efficiently. But realistically, this legislation only \ncreates more programs that will have to compete for the same pot of \nmoney, and that pot of money is ever dwindling. Instead of focusing on \nour Nation's highest energy priority needs, longstanding programs--\nprograms that are working--could well be severely fractured and diluted \nfor years to come. That is not progress. In the end, this bill will \njust be another empty soapbox for the President to stand upon even \nthough the necessary resources to carry out our energy programs will \nnever materialize.\n\n  I certainly recognize that there are several important and useful \nprovisions that have been included in this legislation, including a \nnumber of specific clean coal programs which I have supported. These \nand several other provisions have had bipartisan support in the Senate \nin both the 107th and 108th Congresses. Yet, in the aggregate, this \nbill will not help us to achieve our energy, economic, and \nenvironmental goals and, in many cases, will create even bigger \nproblems down the road.\n  I have long advocated developing a complimentary approach toward our \nenergy and environmental policies. Yet I have serious concerns about \nthis bill's liability waivers, exemptions, and alterations to \nlongstanding environmental laws, and limited consumer protection \nprovisions. Furthermore, like several major tax cut bills and the \nhomeland security legislation, special deals have been stuffed into the \nnooks and crannies of this bill. Yet some of the matters that \nrightfully should have been dealt with in this legislation are \nglaringly absent.\n  I speak, for example, of the coal miners Combined Benefit Fund. \nNearly 50,000 retired coal miners and their dependents are facing an \nimminent crisis. These miners, who live in every State, are in danger \nof having their health care benefits cut due to a financial emergency \nin the fund, created by law, to pay those benefits. These are elderly \nmen and women--women for the most part. Most of these are elderly \nwidows who are truly among America's most vulnerable citizens. Yet \namong all the billions of dollars to help oodles of special, corporate \ninterests in this bill, I find not a penny--not one penny--to help \nthese elderly Americans, most of whom, as I say, are widows.\n  For the past 2 years, as the ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, as the Senator who has been on that Appropriations Committee \nlonger than any other Senator in history, I have come to the aid by \nproviding relief to that fund through several appropriations transfers \nof funds.\n  The Appropriations Committee was not the committee of jurisdiction. \nOther committees in the Senate are the committees of jurisdiction, not \nthe Appropriations Committee. But I have come to the aid, with the \nsupport of my friends on both sides of the aisle in that committee, and \nespecially I remember the support that was rendered on my behalf and on \nbehalf of the coal miners and retired miners by Senator Ted Stevens, my \nRepublican friend.\n  These were transfers that did not cost any State any money to clean \nup its abandoned mine lands. Yet these retirees and their dependents, \nmost of them probably in very ill health and frail health--I believe \nthe average age of these retirees is in the high seventies, probably \nnear eighty--are being held hostage in some cold-hearted game of \nchicken. There was a chance in this bill to help them. There was a \nchance to provide a fix for the program that Congress designed to \nfulfill our promise to them, but the conferees failed to make that fix. \nThe effort was killed by too many greedy hands grabbing for their own \npiece of the pie.\n\n  I hope the Senate and House committees of jurisdiction--not the \nAppropriations Committee; the Appropriations Committee has helped time \nand again--I will act next year to ensure that our Government keeps its \npromise to these retired miners. Certainly, compassion for the old and \nthe sick should prevail over greed.\n  It pains me to conclude that this energy conference report, in its \ntotality does not fully integrate four fundamental principles of good \nenergy policy; namely, energy security, fiscal soundness, consumer \nprotection, and environmental balance.\n  Despite its rhetoric, this White House's lip service and corporate \ncoddling have been the sum total of this White House's energy policy. \nIt began with the Vice President's National Energy Policy plan and \nconcluded with the exclusion of Democrats from the energy conference.\n  As the Sun begins to shine on this leviathan, I hope that Americans \nwill understand that this Energy bill will do\n\n[[Page S15248]]\n\nlittle to resolve our energy problems, and if it passes, it could very \nwell turn out to be a Pandora's Box.\n  Madam President, this legislation comes to us at the end of a \nsession, and the Republican majority is attempting to serve up this \nelaborate and expensive dessert. But these are just empty calories--a \ndelicious photo opportunity for the President, rich filling for \nindustry lobbyists, but, in the end, only empty calories and heartburn \nfor the American taxpayers. Sadly, when all is said and done, the \nAmerican people will continue to stand in the bread line, hungry for a \ncomprehensive national energy strategy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have listened very carefully to the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia and his characterization of \nthis legislation. I have to come to a different conclusion because I \nbelieve this legislation before us today is a first giant step. We have \nbeen talking about this now for not months but years. I can tell you \nright now that the problem we are having with energy in America is a \nvery serious problem.\n  I am from a State that is a production State. We have produced \nshallow and marginal wells for a long period of time. Sometimes people \ndon't realize how significant this source of energy is. Statistically \nthis is true: If we had all of the marginal wells that have been \nplugged in the last year flowing today, it would equal more than we are \ncurrently importing from Saudi Arabia. That is a huge amount.\n  I started out, before most of the people in this Chamber were born, \nin the industry, in the oil business. I was a tool dresser on a cable \ntool rig. That is the way we used to go after oil, particularly shallow \noil, where you would have to take a bit out. You would stand with it, \nwhite hot, and sledgehammers on both sides, sharpen it, and then go \nback and pound. We pulled a lot of oil out of the ground at that time.\n  If you think about the economy that resulted from all that \nproduction, there were good jobs. In the Osage area of my State of \nOklahoma, northeastern Oklahoma, we had a lot of shallow wells. I can \nremember going in to Pawhuska, OK, at noontime to eat lunch. You would \nhave to wait in line 15 minutes to pay your bill. It was because this \nindustry was so viable. Today it is almost a ghost town.\n  With the passage of this bill, there are incentives in here. Nobody \ntalks about them. There are some things I wish were in this bill. No \none is more familiar with the necessity to get into some of the \ndrilling at ANWR, and certainly we need to be doing that. But just look \nat some of the opportunities that are in the bill.\n  This bill has an incentive to get back into marginal well production, \nand that could open up a huge domestic supply of oil and lessen our \nreliance upon foreign countries. That reminds me of something I often \nsay: Our reliance upon foreign countries for our oil supply is not an \nenergy issue. It is a national security issue.\n  I remember back many years ago, during the Reagan administration, \nwhen Don Hodel was Secretary of Energy and later Secretary of the \nInterior. He and I had a little dog and pony show. We would go around \nthe country and talk to them about how the outcome of every conflict, \nevery war back to and including the First World War was dependent on \nwho was in control of the energy supply. We talked about the Malay \nPeninsula. We talked about the submarines coming into the Caribbean to \nknock down the ships so we could not get to our refineries.\n  This is something I thought surely people would understand. They \ndidn't understand it. By the way, the fact that we are looking at an \nenergy policy today, this should not really be a partisan issue. I kind \nof laugh when I hear some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle saying we don't need an energy policy. I tried to get Ronald \nReagan to have an energy policy. He didn't do it. I tried with the \nfirst President Bush. I said: Let's get an energy policy. Let's have, \nas a cornerstone of that policy, a maximum amount that we are willing \nto depend on foreign countries for our ability to fight a war. He \ndidn't do it. We didn't do it during the Clinton administration. But \nthis President is.\n\n  I talked to this President when he was running for office. I said: \nWill you commit to an energy policy so we can lessen our dependence on \nforeign countries for our ability to fight a war? Back when Don Hodel \nand I were going around, we were 38-percent dependent upon foreign \ncountries. Now it is approaching 60 percent. So it is very serious.\n  Why is it people wouldn't realize that after the Persian Gulf War in \n1991, why wouldn't it be indelibly imprinted upon the hearts of every \nAmerican that we could no longer be dependent upon the Middle East for \nour ability to fight a war? Yet it didn't seem to help. We picked up a \nfew extra votes but not enough to get a real policy.\n  I chair the Environment and Public Works Committee. There are a lot \nof issues that are within the jurisdiction of my committee that are \nvery significant and that are in this bill. One is, it allows hydraulic \nfracturing to be used by not just Oklahoma but by all States. This is a \nway of extracting oil out of tight formations. It is something we need \nto be addressing. It is addressed in this bill.\n  This clarifies the exemption for oil and gas production from storm \nwater discharge permits. Congress provided this exemption years ago, \nand a misinterpretation of the exemption had threatened to stop a lot \nof the small, local production. This clarifies that and will get us \nback into producing.\n  This provides a 5 billion gallon ethanol requirement for motor fuel. \nIf anyone ever says there is is not enough renewable energy in this \nbill, they have not really read this title of the bill. I started \nworking on this issue over 5 years ago, and I am glad to see that a \ncompromise was developed to increase the amount of renewables while \nensuring that our Nation's refineries are not adversely affected.\n  In my committee, we had the renewal of the Price-Anderson bill. We \npassed it. It is now a part of this bill. So a lot of the things that \nwould otherwise have been on individual bills or have been on a \ncomprehensive bill from my committee are in this bill.\n  It is necessary to have reauthorization of Price-Anderson in order to \nprovide the protections so we can go after the other sources of oil \nsuch as nuclear sources. This establishes a nuclear security program. I \nthink we all, after 9/11, recognize that.\n  In the committee I chair, we had all the security bills. We had a \nwastewater security bill. We had a nuclear security bill. We had a \nchemical security bill. They are all there for the purpose of \nprotecting those vital elements of our economy from a potential \nterrorist attack. We went ahead and put the nuclear security bill in \nthis. If we don't pass this, it is going to certainly heighten the risk \nthat is out there on something happening to a nuclear plant. So after a \nlot of effort, we finally have that in here.\n  This bill provides $300 million for the EPA's clean schoolbus \nprogram, another one that came out of my committee.\n  I am saying there is a lot more to this bill. It doesn't go far \nenough. I can't look at the lovely acting President in the chair \nwithout thinking about ANWR and about going up there. I just wish \npeople who are so concerned about disrupting the environment or \nsomething up there in those slopes would go up and look at it. It is \nnot a pristine wilderness. It is a mud flat. All the local people want \nit.\n  Here we are down here--we are a lot smarter here in Washington--\nsaying no, in spite of the fact it would alleviate some of our reliance \nupon foreign countries for our ability to fight a war. We are smarter \nthan they are up in Alaska. We know what is good for them in spite of \nwhat they want.\n\n  I am very proud of both Senators from the State of Alaska for \nunderstanding this, for explaining it. I feel sorry for them that we \nhave such arrogance in this body that we feel we know more about their \nbusiness than they do.\n  Our Nation is at the point where access is prohibited to almost every \nmajor reserve of oil and gas on our Nation's shores. Furthermore, \nextremist\n\n[[Page S15249]]\n\nenvironmentalists have declared war on oil and gas wells in the \ninterior of our Nation.\n  I have had occasion, as I am sure the manager of this bill, Senator \nDomenici, has had numerous occasions to debate people on the other \nside. We know we have a crisis in energy in this country. Yet there are \nthose on the other side who say: We don't want nuclear energy. We don't \nwant fossil fuels. We don't want oil. We don't want coal. Now they \ndon't even want windmills because they will disturb some migratory bird \npath.\n  We have to have it. Look at the flight of industry and business that \nis going overseas. Right now we have chemical companies that fear they \nare going to end up not being able to use coal as a source of energy, \none that we are depending upon for more than 50 percent of our energy \nin America today. They have gone over into other countries such as \nwestern Europe where they have nuclear energy, where some of the \ncountries, 80 percent of their energy comes from nuclear sources.\n  This bill is a modest start. But if we don't do this, after being \nrejected since 1980 and before having an energy policy in America, this \ncrisis we are facing right now is going to be even more serious. It is \na modest beginning and one on which certainly, at the very least--I say \nthis to the Republicans--we should at least have a chance procedurally \nto have an up-or-down vote.\n  Let's remember what we went through last week for some 39 hours. The \nbig debate there was, let's just get to the point where we can have an \nup-or-down vote. That is all we want on this, an up-or-down vote. I \nwould hope that some of those individuals who may not be in support of \nthis legislation will at least vote to allow us to have that up-or-down \nvote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wish to continue what I think has been \na fairly lively and informative discussion on the Energy bill which is \nbefore us. A lot of the time has been focused, of course, on the \nlanguage which exempts the manufacturers of MTBEs from liability and \nwhich does it in a retroactive way which is extremely penal to those \nStates that decided to use their rights to try to protect the ground \nwater of the populace by bringing lawsuits and, as a result, will now \nbe barred from those lawsuits, not only prospectively but actually ex \npost facto.\n  That seems to be an outrage in and of itself, of course, coupled with \nthe fact an additional $2 billion is going to be spent to subsidize the \ncompanies that are producing the MTBE. That just adds insult to injury. \nThe list of issues involving MTBE goes on and on, and they have been \nexplored at considerable length on the floor.\n  I want to return to another element of this bill that concerns me, \nand that is the fact that it is extremely profligate in its use of \nFederal tax dollars and especially the manner in which those tax \ndollars are used.\n  It would be appropriate to have an energy policy in this country. \nThat is absolutely necessary, in fact. If we are going to have an \nenergy policy, it ought to be based on three basic purposes: One, it \nshould be based on reducing consumption through, hopefully, \nconservation; two, it should be based on producing renewables that can \nbe used over and over and, therefore, reduce our reliance on \ninternational oil; and, three, it should be based on the need to create \nmore production of resources that can be used for energy.\n  All of those elements should have some sort of marketplace relevance. \nIn other words, you can't suddenly go out and pervert the marketplace \nby essentially saying you are going to pick a winner and that winner, \neven though it may not be commercially viable and even though it may \nnot be even environmentally viable, will be given a dramatic increase \nin support from the Federal Government simply because it happens to be \nthe item of the day for those folks who happen to be writing this bill.\n  Unfortunately, that is the way this bill is put together. It is a \nhodgepodge of little interests--some of them rather large interests, \nsome of them extremely large interests--that were able to get to the \ntable and get their interests taken care of but not in an orderly way, \nnot in a way that had an overarching theme, such as creating \nconservation, creating renewables, and creating production but, rather, \nin a manner that says we are going to pick winners and losers; certain \nsegments are going to be the winners, and certain segments are going to \nbe the losers; certain regions are going to be winners to the detriment \nof other regions; and essentially we are going to try to logroll this \nbill through the Senate even though on its face it has no relationship \nto national energy policy.\n  The list is quite long of items which you have to say, if you are \ngoing to try to be kind, are arbitrary--arbitrary at best--but they \ninvade the taxpayers' wallet.\n  Let me read a few of them: $2 billion for companies in Texas and \nLouisiana to compensate for their phaseout of the gasoline additive \nMTBE. I find that to be one of the most outrageous since those \ncompanies are also, at the same time, demanding they be held basically \nfree of any liability for having produced MTBE which is such a huge \ndetriment to the country--$2 billion in tax deductions for oil and gas \ncompanies for purposes of geological and geophysical expenditures; $500 \nmillion for a new loan program for the oil and gas industry to \ndemonstrate and encourage new technology. The program leaves it to the \ndiscretion of the Secretary and the loan recipients to establish \ninterest rates and loan repayment schedules.\n\n  You have to admit, that is creative. The last time I went into a \nbank, I, as the borrower, did not get to pick my loan payment rate and \nmy repayment schedule. These are very creative people who sat around \nthis table taking care of your tax dollars.\n  There is $2 billion in taxpayers' money to be used for cleaning up \ngasoline and chemical spills from leaking underground storage tanks, a \nworthy goal, until one learns this fund will even fund cases where the \npolluter can be identified, letting the polluting individual or company \noff the hook and putting the hook into the American taxpayer.\n  There is $2.9 billion in corporate welfare for some of the wealthiest \ncorporations in the fossil fuel industry; $800 million for a loan to \nbuild a coal gasification plant in Minnesota; $1.1 billion for the \nfirst-ever production tax credit for coal.\n  The bill expands the solar energy and geothermal investment tax \ncredit to include clean coal investment. That is a unique view of \nrenewables. That is creative use of the term ``renewables''--to throw \nsolar and geothermal in with clean coal; $1.5 billion for loan \nguarantees for coal plants, more than $1.4 billion over the next 5 \nyears.\n  The bill establishes a federally funded research and development \nprogram to ensure coal remains a cost-competitive source of electrical \ngeneration as a chemical feedstock and for transportation fuels. This \nis a classic example of trying to control the marketplace arbitrarily \nwith tax dollars.\n  Basically, what we are saying is even if it doesn't work \ncompetitively, we are going to subsidize it, and we are going to force \nit to work in the marketplace to the tune of these billions and \nbillions of dollars. That list goes on.\n  One of the most interesting ones is what they did with the abandoned \nmines land fund. This fund collects fees on all coal mines in the \nUnited States to clean up the dangerous mines abandoned before 1977. \nThat is an extremely worthy goal. Obviously, we don't want the mines \nout there, and the damage they do to the environment is significant.\n  Over $6 billion is needed to mitigate the environmental damage from \nthese abandoned mines, but there is only $1 billion in the fund today. \nThis proposal would reauthorize the fund for another 15 years, reduce \nthe fee to mining companies by 20 percent, and transfer $275 million \nfrom the fund to address the deficit in the United Mine Workers \nCombined Benefit Fund and direct 10 percent of the Federal mineral \nleasing moneys to address the money owed from the AMI fund to Wyoming \nand Montana.\n\n[[Page S15250]]\n\n  Over the next 3 years, the proposal would cost approximately $1.4 \nbillion, but the mines would not get cleaned up because the money would \nhave been siphoned off for these special projects. That is what is \ncalled special interest governance. Two billion dollars in the \nprovision could defray some of the costs incurred by utility companies \nin installing pollution control equipment in old coal-burning plants to \ncomply with the clean air bill. That sounds reasonable except for the \nfact we have to realize that these plants have been exempt from the \nClean Air Act now for over a decade and they were given the exemption \nso they could work their way into being clean.\n  Other plants have come online, with the consumer paying the costs of \nhaving those plants be clean-air-producing plants. So consumers are \npaying for new plants but now they are going to get to pay twice--not \nthe local consumers but the region of the whole country is going to get \nto pay twice for the old plants that do not meet the responsibility and \nhave refused to upgrade their responsibility. Picking winners and \nlosers again in the marketplace in a way that is extremely arbitrary \nand simply reflects the fact that certain interests were at the table \nthat had the ear of the people who were effective in developing the \nbill.\n  Ethanol is a program that has taken on a life of its own. \nRegrettably, that life is paid for by the whole country, especially by \nparts of the country which see no significant benefit from this \nproduct, at an extraordinarily high cost.\n  Since 1978, the U.S. Government has granted a multitude of tax \nincentives and subsidies to promote the growth of the domestic ethanol \nindustry. The industry and its supporters, including suppliers of \nethanol--the primary input, corn--maintain that ethanol is an effective \nand environmentally sound way to substitute for gasoline. However, the \nhuge subsidies given out year after year have benefited few besides the \ncorn growers and the ethanol producers, which are often very large \ncompanies.\n  Despite the claims, ethanol has neither reduced our dependence on \nforeign oil nor has it significantly reduced pollution. Taxpayers' \nrepeated payments in the form of subsidies to corn growers and ethanol \nproducers, and the opportunity it costs, serves no other purpose than \nto artificially prop up the price of corn and the ethanol industry.\n  The list of subsidies that have been developed over the years is \nrather staggering. In the last farm bill, we put $26 billion into that \nbill over a 6-year period to assist people who grow corn. This is \nindependent of the ethanol issue. That is $4.3 billion a year. Maybe \nthat is legitimate. The farm program has some serious problems, but \nmaybe that $4.3 billion was legitimate.\n  It turns out that is just the beginning, because this bill doubles \nthe mandate for the minimum use of ethanol to 5 billion per year, \ncosting the American taxpayer, because ethanol is not an efficient way \nto produce energy, an extra $6 billion. That means that $6 billion \ncomes from taxpayers across the country in the form of higher prices to \npay for an ethanol product which was already subsidized under the farm \nbill to the tune of $26 billion. Then on top of that, we have to pay to \ncreate two new research programs in this bill for ethanol.\n\n  One would think, after we had put $26 billion in the farm bill and $6 \nbillion out of the taxpayers' pockets through the direct subsidy of the \ngasoline, they would have at least had the courtesy to pay for their \nown research. That is what most market-oriented products do; they go \nout and they research and determine whether they can produce the \nproduct. And they do not charge that research to the Federal \nGovernment. They charge it to their end product users, which is us \nagain and we have to pay for it. But, no, that is not the case. We have \nto pay $12 million in this bill to create two new research initiatives.\n  Then, on top of the $5.9 billion in subsidies, and the $26 billion in \nfarm subsidies, we also have to give $750 million to the ethanol \nproducers for the cost of building their production facilities.\n  This is the most incredible program. First, we underwrite the raw \nmaterial with tax dollars, probably to a point where we actually see \nthe net income of the people who are actually producing the raw \nmaterials. That otherwise would be described as a national socialist \napproach to an economy, certainly not a market economy. Then we have to \nget people to pay to subsidize the purchase of the product to the tune \nof $6 billion, and then we have to pay $750 million to build the \nfacilities to produce the product. The list just goes on and on.\n  On top of all of this, there is another $2 billion of tax credit \nwhich goes to the producers of this product in this bill. They were not \nhappy with the fact that the small producers were going to get this tax \ncredit so they had to expand it, so they picked up a whole group of new \nproducers which are much bigger people in the way of income. They \nessentially doubled the small producer language in this bill. So we now \nhave fairly significant people getting this huge credit. On top of the \nfarm subsidy, on top of the subsidy for purchasing the gas, on top of \nthe subsidy for building the production facilities, on top of the \nsubsidy for researching the production facilities, we have a tax \ncredit.\n  It is truly an amazing act of largess on the part of the American \ntaxpayer. We all feel very good about this, I am sure. We have been \nable to pursue a policy in this bill that is essentially spending these \ntypes of dollars on our friends who produce this product and \nmanufacture this product. The problem is that by doing this type of a \ncommitment to this product and the producers of the product and the \nmanufacturers of the product, we have totally perverted the \nmarketplace.\n  We have essentially picked a winner, ethanol, and we have said that \nwinner is going to get so heavily subsidized, and then require that the \nproduct be used, plus used in a way that is extremely detrimental to an \narea such as New England because in New England ethanol cannot be \nshipped in. It does not transport through pipelines because it is too \ncorrosive in the pipelines. It does not transport by truck or train \nbecause it is too explosive. So it has to be put on a ship in the gulf \nand taken around the Gulf of Mexico and brought up the coast into the \nports in the Northeast. So on top of all of the other subsidy that is \nin this product, we pay a much higher price for this product which we \nare forced to buy under this bill. It is truly not energy policy. It is \nsimply an initiative to take care of an interest group that may be very \nlegitimate and they are very nice people, and they certainly have good \nrepresentatives in the Senate and in the Congress generally, but they \ncannot defend this product as being a competitive product in the arena \nof what we should be looking at for various options for fuel with this \ntype of subsidy level. There are no market forces at all involved in \nthis product. It is totally a subsidized event, subsidized by all the \ntaxpayers in the United States for the benefit of the few who produce \nthe product. Truly, it is a classic example of how not to do an Energy \nbill because it totally takes the market out of the exercise.\n\n  Then you get into the special interest projects in this bill. We have \nheard a little discussion of those. We have these green bond proposals. \nI think the Senator from Arizona pointed out that one of them would \nbuild a Hooters restaurant somewhere in Louisiana. That is paid for in \nthis bill with taxpayers' money. You have $1 billion for coastal \nimpact, almost all of which flows to Louisiana. That is basically a \nspecial interest initiative. You have a hydrogen research project for a \nFreedom Car, which is $2.1 billion. The President asked for $1.2 \nbillion, but the lobbyists and somebody decided that just wasn't enough \nto take care of this interest group.\n  That sort of reflects this whole bill. The President asked for $8 \nbillion in tax credits, a reasonable number. It was within the budget. \nI want to come back to that. Instead, we ended up with a $25 billion \ntax credit bill, three times the price the President asked, and we \ndon't end up with a better energy policy. We didn't get three times \nbetter energy policy than what the President proposed because those tax \ncredits are all being used basically to artificially manage the \nmarketplace and to create events within the marketplace which were not \nable to stand on their own, and as soon as the tax credit goes away, \nyou will not have that production capability because those products\n\n[[Page S15251]]\n\nare not viable and they are not competitive for the most part.\n  In a speech I earlier gave on this bill, I pointed out I went through \nthis once before. We all went through this in the 1980s. At the end of \nthe oil crisis and an embargo in the 1970s, we tried subsidizing \ndifferent forms of energy at extremely high levels to see if we could \nnot bring them on line and make them competitive commercially. We did \nshale oil and solar and wind and geothermal. We even did something, I \nforget the name of it, where we put a ship out in the ocean and ran a \npipe in the water and the pipe got cold and we piped it back around. \nThere was some technical name for that. We were building ships to do \nthat.\n  None of these technologies, except maybe solar and wind, survived, \nand solar and wind survived in a much different framework than the \ndirection the initial tax incentives pushed them. That is because they \nwere not competitive because, even with those subsidies, they could not \ncompete in the marketplace with the products that were out there beside \nthem.\n  So, once again, we are seeing that in this bill. It is not energy \npolicy. It is picking winners and losers for the purpose of gaining \neconomic advantage for one sector of the economy over another, one \ngroup of people over another, one manufacturing group over another. We \nhave the $1.1 billion proposal to construct an advanced reactor \nhydrogen cogeneration project in Idaho--$500 million is for the \nconstruction, and then we pay $635 million, or as much as is necessary, \nin order to operate the plant. It is bad enough that we are going to \npay to build the plant. But on the face of it, if you are going to have \nto spend $635 million to operate the plant, you have to conclude the \nplant isn't too viable as an exercise.\n  We went through this all, by the way. Idaho had another one of these \nprojects which I suspect is interrelated to this, although I don't know \nit, which didn't fly because it was too heavily subsidized.\n  The window is open at the bank of the American taxpayer and their \ncheckbook, with item after item of fairly questionable attempts to try \nto pick winners and losers in the nuclear industry and to do some \nthings which are of questionable value. I could go through the list, \nbut the list has become fairly public and it probably isn't necessary \nto review it.\n  There are a couple of other specific ones. It has been reported that \nthe bill for some reason effectively mandates permanent use of the \ncontroversial Cross Sound Cable between Connecticut and Long Island. \nYou tell me what that has to do with energy policy. That is an issue \nbetween Connecticut and Rhode Island, and Connecticut is a little upset \nthat we are suddenly stepping into their jurisdiction and making that \ndecision for them.\n  The Energy bill would build a project on the Iron Range, a $1 billion \nplus Excel Energy Powerplant for the Iron Range. Well, it is $800 \nmillion of loan guarantees for that project. It is probably a good \nproject, but it is hard to understand why we should have picked that \nproject, to put that level of tax dollars into this bill.\n  The list goes on and on, regrettably, to the point of excess in the \narea of picking winners and losers, and doing it in a way which has no \ncomprehensible relationship to what one might consider to be producing \nan energy policy that had a rationale behind it, versus an exercise in \nsimply going into a room and listening to the people who are whispering \nin your ear on the day when you are writing the bill.\n  That is a big problem, the fact that the bill is not structured very \nwell as an energy policy bill and doesn't address in a thoughtful way \nor a comprehensive way consumption of renewables or production.\n  There are some production initiatives in this bill which do make \nsense. I think the Alaska pipeline initiative would probably be very \ngood for this country. I wish they had included ANWR.\n  But overall this bill is just a hodgepodge, and it is excessive. The \nfact is that it exceeds the President's request by almost three times, \nwhich brings me to the next point. This bill is in violation of at \nleast four budget points of order. That is how excessive it is. The \nbill violates a spending point of order, it violates a tax point of \norder, it violates a pay-go point of order, to say nothing of the fact \nthat it violates rule XXVIII.\n  Why? Because it is totally out of touch with our own budget as a \nFederal Government. We put in place a Federal budget. We put in place a \nplan for how much we could spend in developing an energy policy, and \nthen we ignore it in this bill. There is no fiscal responsibility at \nall reflected in this bill but just the opposite in the way it spends \nmoney and in the way it treats the budget which we have passed as a \nCongress. It is hard for me to understand how the administration could \nendorse a bill which exceeds their level of spending and tax policy by \nsuch a significant number.\n  We have heard numerous complaints about Congress overspending in a \nvariety of areas. This bill just drives through that barrier as if it \nweren't even there and proceeds on down the road.\n  The bill has a lot of problems. It has the problem that it is an \nattack on a region, New England specifically, in the MTBE language. It \nhas the problem that it is not comprehensive in its approach, or at \nleast coordinated in its approach. It is a hodgepodge of various \ninterest initiatives, some of which may score well, some of which may \nnot, but there is certainly no coherence with them.\n  It is filled with initiatives which are clearly counterproductive to \nusing a marketplace approach, which I think should be the approach we \nas Republicans would want to use, where we test the product and \ndetermine whether or not it can compete in the market, and then we give \nit support to draw it into the market. But we don't say you don't have \nto worry at all about the market, as we do in this bill, with a number \nof different initiatives and production capabilities.\n  It is expensive. It exceeds the budget by a significant number.\n  It is hard to defend a bill like this, it seems to me. So that is why \nI hope when we get around to the issue of cloture, or even the issue of \npoints of order, people will take a very serious look at the failures \nof this bill on those various accounts.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and make a point of order a quorum \nis not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to share my concerns \nabout this Energy bill. An Energy bill is a serious matter. I strongly \nbelieve the country needs to achieve a balanced national energy policy.\n  I did not make my decision to oppose this bill lightly, but \nunfortunately this bill is even worse than the Senate version. I cannot \nsupport it.\n  Although my remarks will be very brief, my reservations about this \nbill run deep.\n  I oppose this bill for several reasons. For one thing, the price tag \nof this bill troubles me. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \nthis bill will cost the taxpayers $31 billion and is not offset \nanywhere else in the budget. Our national deficit has ballooned over \nthe past several years, so it is even more imperative that we be \nfiscally responsible with taxpayers dollars.\n\n  In addition to the bill's fiscal implications, I am deeply concerned \nthat the bill repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act. This \ncritical act protects consumers against abuses in the utility industry. \nRepeal of PUHCA would leave rate-payers vulnerable and spur further \nconsolidation in an industry that has already seen a number of mergers. \nTwo large holding companies have been created in Wisconsin alone in \nrecent years. Furthermore, the bill does not protect consumers from \nEnron-style electricity trading practices and market manipulation. The \nSenate recently went on record in support of an amendment by Senator \nCantwell to bar such abusive practices and I am disappointed that the \nbill fails to include similar protections. I also doubt that the bill \nwill prevent blackouts like that we experienced last August--this is \none of the country's most pressing energy problems, yet the bill does \nlittle to address it.\n\n[[Page S15252]]\n\n  In the area of boutique fuels, the bill also falls badly short. \nEveryone in my state of Wisconsin is familiar with price spikes during \nthe shift from the spring to winter fuel supply. Wisconsin has pushed \nfor national standards for federally mandated reformulated gasoline \nblends, or RFGs, to try to broaden the supply and reduce price hikes \nduring RFG shortages. The current bill will just authorize a study \nabout the problem, not solve it. We had a genuine bipartisan effort to \ntry to do this. I cannot understand for the life of me why this was not \nincluded in the conference report.\n  Also, the bill has serious and unwelcome environmental impacts. For \nexample, the bill undercuts the Clean Air Act by postponing ozone \nattainment standards across the country. This issue was never \nconsidered in the House or Senate bill, but it was inserted in the \nconference report. This rewrite of the Clean Air Act is not fair to \ncities like Milwaukee that have devoted significant resources to \nreducing ozone and cleaning up their air. And, as asthma rates across \nthe country increase, this provision could severely undercut efforts to \nsafeguard the air quality of our citizens.\n  In addition to undermining air quality protection, the bill allows \nfor siting of transmission lines in national parks, grants exemptions \nfrom the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act for oil and gas \ncompanies, and pays oil and gas companies for their costs of compliance \nwith the National Environmental Policy Act. I am also concerned that \nthe liability exemption for MTBE is retroactive to September 5, 2003, \nwhich will nullify about 100 ongoing lawsuits. MTBE is found in all 50 \nStates, and high levels are affecting drinking water systems all over \nthe Midwest, including 5,567 wells in 29 communities in Wisconsin, even \nthough the state only used MTBE gasoline for the first few weeks of the \nphase I program that began in January 1995. As a result of this bill, \ntaxpayers are going to have to foot the $29 billion bill for the \nnational MTBE cleanup.\n\n  This bill fails to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. The Senate \nenergy bill contained a requirement that power companies provide at \nleast 10 percent of their power from renewable energy sources like \nwind, water, and solar power. The technical term is a renewable \nportfolio standard. The current bill doesn't contain any renewable \nportfolio. standard. There's no doubt that we can and should do better \non renewable energy to reduce our dependence on foreign fossil fuels.\n  Although, I support many of the renewable fuel provisions in the bill \nregarding ethanol, I am troubled by the fact that the bill also \ndepletes vital highway funds for States by siphoning money from the \nvolumetric ethanol excise tax credit.\n  The content of the bill is problematic, but so is the process of how \nit was written. My Democratic colleagues who served on the conference \nhad only 48 hours to review the 1,700-page report before the Monday \nconference meeting. They were virtually shut out of the negotiation \nprocess. I regret that the manner in which the current bill was \ndrafted--in secret, closed meetings, without adequate time to review \nit. This is no way to come up with a balanced national energy policy.\n  For these reasons, I oppose this bill and I will oppose cloture. I \nappreciate the need to develop a new energy strategy for this country. \nI disagree strongly, however, with the measures taken in this bill. \nThis is a bad bill, it's bad for Wisconsin, and it's bad for the \nNation's taxpayers.\n  I thank my colleagues from Oregon and my colleague from New Jersey \nfor their courtesy in letting me give my remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, on behalf of myself, Chairman Grassley, \nChairman Lott, and Senator Byrd, I ask unanimous consent the Rules \nCommittee be discharged from consideration of S. Res. 216; that the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration; the resolution be agreed \nto, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject, this is mistimed to be considering this rule change on this \npiece of legislation. On behalf of some Senators on this side of the \naisle I will have to object to the Senator's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Has the Senator objected? I was under the impression you \nreserved the right to object.\n  Mr. BURNS. I reserved the right to object, and I did object.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in light of the objection, on behalf of \nmyself, Chairman Grassley, Chairman Lott, and Senator Byrd, I ask \nunanimous consent that no later than March 1 of 2004 the Rules \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 216, if \nnot reported, and that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. \nRes. 216 at a time determined by the majority leader following \nconsultation with the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. BURNS.

Madam President, my good friend from Montana and I have \nworked together on so many issues. He has objected to this bipartisan \nresolution which would give the Senate a chance to end one of the most \npernicious practices in Washington, DC, and that is the practice of \nsecret holds.\n  Walk down Main Street anywhere in the United States, and I bet you \nwould not find one out of a million Americans who know what a secret \nhold is. The hold does not appear anywhere in the dictionary. It is not \neven in the Senate rules. Yet it is one of the most powerful weapons \nthat any U.S. Senator has. It is, of course, a senatorial courtesy \nwhereby one Senator can block action on a bill or nomination by telling \nthe respective Democrat or Republican leader that he or she would \nobject. The objection does not have to be written down, and it does not \nhave to be made public.\n  It is a little bit like the seventh inning stretch in baseball. There \nis no official rule or regulation that talks about it, but it has been \nobserved for so long that it has become a tradition.\n  Now, the capacity to use this hold, which is in secret--there is no \ntransparency, no accountability--the prospect of using these secret \nholds is notorious and has given birth to several intriguing offspring: \nThe hostage hold, the rolling hold, and the May West hold. Suffice it \nto say, at this time of the year secret holds are more common than \nacorns around an oak tree.\n  Senator Grassley and I have been working on this for almost 7 years. \nI am extremely proud that the chairman of the Rules Committee, Senator \nLott, has joined us on this matter. Senator Byrd is a cosponsor. There \nis no one in this body who has a better understanding of the rules than \nSenator Byrd, and Senator Byrd has made it clear this practice is out \nof hand. It is out of hand because the rules are designed to expedite \nthe business of the Senate and not hold it up.\n  What we heard earlier in the objection to the effort to end secret \nholds is emblematic of what has happened. The objection was based on \nthe idea that now was not a good time for the Senate to address this. \nIt is never a good time to address it if you are in favor of doing \nbusiness behind closed doors. If you are in favor of doing the public's \nbusiness without accountability, it is never a good time. If you are in \nfavor of doing business in secret, of course, we are never going to \nbring it up in the Senate.\n  The minority leader, Senator Daschle, has been supportive of this \neffort from the very beginning. From the very first day I went to him \nto discuss this, he said: You are right. The hold is an important power \nfor a member of the Senate, but it ought to be exercised with some \naccountability.\n\n  So there was no objection from this side of the aisle. Unfortunately, \nwe had an objection from the other side. I\n\n[[Page S15253]]\n\nthink it is unfortunate because I have sought throughout--throughout--\nto make this a bipartisan effort.\n  Chairman Grassley and Chairman Lott deserve an extraordinary amount \nof credit for the effort to work with me and with others on this issue. \nThe fact is, during this time of the session, one Member of the Senate \ncan spend days asking all 99 other Senators whether they have a secret \nhold, only to find that Senator does not even know about the secret \nhold because it was generated by staff.\n  The Senator who can successfully track down and lift the last secret \nhold almost feels around here as if they have won the national title.\n  Every Senator has a favorite example of torturous search for the \nsponsor of a secret hold. My favorite was during the Rules Committee \nhearing on holds, Senator Dodd--by the way, who, is very supportive, \nlike Chairman Lott, of this proposal--we heard about the chairman \ntrying to call Senators in airports around the country, trying to find \nout who had a hold on a bill. Senator Dodd was concerned about this \nwhen he was faced with his election reform bill.\n  I went through the very same exercise on the spam bill where I had to \nliterally go from desk to desk in the Senate to find out who was \nholding up a measure that everybody was for. Everybody said they were \nagainst spam but there were holds, and we had to try to figure out \nwhere they were.\n  The same thing happened on the Internet tax bill. At one time there \nwere seven holds on the Internet tax bill. When I tried to find out \nwhich Senators had the holds, I was told that this information would \nnot be shared with me.\n  Think about the consequences of not dealing with that issue. I say to \nmy colleagues, we may have a virtual ``Grinch'' visiting the consumers \nof this country because the Senate has not dealt with the Internet tax \nissue. Come the holiday season, if some States and localities choose to \ndo it, they can go out and tax e-mail, they can go out and tax Internet \nservices that are delivered through wireless devices or DSL because the \nSenate has not updated the law. I believe it has not updated the law \nbecause there was not the opportunity to have a real debate, and we \nwere held up because there were secret holds.\n  I am very pleased that the distinguished chairman of the Rules \nCommittee has come to the Chamber to join me in this effort. Perhaps \nmore than any other Member of this body, he understands the \nimplications of this because of his service as chairman of the Rules \nCommittee as well as having served as the distinguished majority leader \nof this body. He has held hearings on this issue. He reached out to \nSenator Byrd and Senator Grassley.\n  We have been working on this issue for years and years. At this time \nof the session, the secret hold is all powerful. It is one of the most \npowerful weapons that a Member of Congress has. We do not seek to have \nit stripped from the Senate. We do not come together on a bipartisan \nbasis to say, let us outlaw the holds. We come together--Chairman Lott, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Byrd, and myself--to say: There ought to be \nsome sunshine.\n  Our proposal is for sunshine holds, for saying that the powers \nexercised by a Member of the Senate should be accompanied by some \naccountability. You ought to be straight with your constituents.\n  My good friend, the chairman of the committee, is here. I would like, \nwithout losing the remainder of our time, to yield to the distinguished \nchairman of the Rules Committee, who has been so supportive of the \neffort to end secret holds, so he could make his remarks, knowing he \nhas a very busy schedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, could I inquire about what time remains for \nSenator Wyden?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes twenty seconds are remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I believe this is an issue whose time has come in the Senate. It is \nan issue I am very familiar with because I have dealt with holds, both \nas a Senator as a leader. I have placed holds, and probably over the \nyears some of them have been anonymous, not so much out of intent, just \nthat is the way it was.\n  I remember talking to Senator Wyden years ago, and Senator Grassley, \nabout what we could do to have a better understanding of what a hold is \nand how it works and what could we do to stop the anonymous holds. \nSenator Daschle and I even got together on a letter and tried to \nclarify how holds should be handled, and what they mean, and how \nMembers should deal with them, by telling the committee chairman or the \nsponsor of legislation that they had a hold. But there was no \nenforcement mechanism, so it did not happen.\n  At this time of year, holds are particularly a problem for the \nleadership. Republican or Democrat, this is not a partisan issue \nbecause when they pop up right at the end of the session, it could be \nunrelated to the nominee, unrelated to the bill. They can be a part of \na rolling hold. But with all the warts of the hold, it is something \nSenators prize, maybe even treasure. But I do not see how anybody can \ndefend them being anonymous.\n  If there is a secret hold on a bill or a nominee, and it is just at \nthis time of year, it is almost impossible for the leadership to deal \nwith it. The leader, he tries to track down who has the hold, and \nsometimes the staff will not even tell you who has the hold because \nthey have a problem.\n  I can remember tracking down Senators in their hideouts, finding \nSenators in airports, saying: Please, this is the Deputy Secretary of \nState or this is a Commissioner who needs to be confirmed.\n  It is not good for the institution. I think someday we should even \nlook at the whole practice of holds. You have an institution where one \nSenator--one Senator alone--particularly at the end of a session, can \ndefeat a nominee or a bill anonymously. There is something wrong with \nthat. You are putting your constituency or the constituencies of others \nand 99 Senators at the mercy of one.\n  There is this feeling here in the institution that we cannot touch \nthe traditions or the precedents or the rules of the Senate. They are \nsacrosanct. They are holy. How do you think they got there? Changes \nwere made. Improvements were made. Or problems were created.\n  So that is why I do commend Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley for \nbeing doggedly persistent on this issue. I do not wish to be a part of \na process or an effort that causes difficulty for the leaders. They \nhave enough problems now. They are concerned with the Energy bill, the \nomnibus bill, the Medicare prescription drug bill, the FAA bill--you \nname it. So I do not want to contribute to their problems.\n  But I do think something needs to be done here. I think we need to \naddress the overall issue of holds, but at the very minimum we should \nhave some way to deal with secret holds.\n  When we sent the letter, as I suggested earlier, we required Members \nto notify the sponsor of the legislation, the committee of \njurisdiction, and the leaders of their hold. It had a little effect for \na little while. Senators sort of said: Oh, yeah. OK.\n  By the way, what is a hold? A hold is a notice by the Senator--to the \nstaff, usually--that before a nominee or bill is brought up, they want \nto be notified so they can debate it or so they can reserve all rights \nto amendments. That is all it really is.\n  Now, if it is anonymous, that makes it even more damaging. But it is \na problem for the leader because you try to get the work completed, and \nthe threat of a filibuster or endless amendments basically kills it. So \nsince there was no enforcement mechanism, it just did not accomplish \nwhat we wanted it to accomplish.\n  This resolution would place a greater responsibility on Senators to \nmake their holds public. It creates a standing order that would stay in \neffect until the end of this Congress. This is something that Senator \nByrd had suggested, that maybe was the solution that would do the job. \nWe can see how it works. Let's make it a standing order, not change the \nrules. Let's make it apply to the rest of this Congress, which would be \nnext year. If it works, great, we might want to build on it. If it does \nnot, it is dead.\n\n[[Page S15254]]\n\n  The order requires that the majority and the minority leaders can \nonly recognize a hold that is provided in writing. I put a hold on a \nnominee today. I said: Please put a hold on this nominee. Letter will \nfollow. So I put it in writing and it is not a secret thing.\n  Moreover, for the hold to be honored, the Senator objecting would \nhave to publish his objection in the Congressional Record three days \nafter the notice is provided to the leader. That is critical: notice. \nThat is all really we are looking for here: Understand what a hold is; \nput it in writing; and make it well known.\n  A hold should be left to the wrestling ring, not to the Senate, and \nit certainly should not be in secret.\n  I hope the leadership, Senator Frist and Senator Daschle, will work \nwith Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley to find a solution that will \nallow us to do this. The light of day always has a purifying effect. \nThis is getting to be very moldy. We need to deal with it. Again, I \nemphasize, I am for this because I think it would be good for the \ninstitution. I am for it because I think it is the right thing to do. I \nam not for it because I am trying to cause problems with the leaders. \nHeaven forbid, I don't want to do that. Actually, we are trying to help \nthem deal with a problem. They are hesitant to do it because I know \nSenators are going to slip up next to them and say: Wait a minute, you \nmay not want to change anything here. This is the way it has been done.\n  I challenge the Senators to stand up here and say they should not at \nleast make it public. We can't have cowardice on something that is \naffecting people's lives and on legislation that affects our country.\n  I guess I am getting a little carried away. I agree with the Senator. \nI am going to continue to work to try to find a way to be helpful in \ngetting this issue addressed because I think it is time we do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much time remains under my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes 20 seconds remain.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield without losing my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nSenator from Oregon, at the conclusion of his remarks, the order of \nspeaking be Senator Sununu for 15 minutes, Senator Lautenberg for 15 \nminutes, Senator Murkowski for 15 minutes, Senator Cantwell for 30 \nminutes, and Senator Kyl for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the Rules Committee for his eloquent \nstatement. He has been so supportive of this effort. Essentially what \nhe and I and Senator Grassley have been talking about is the quaint \nnotion that the public's business ought to be done in public. This is \nnot a complicated idea.\n  As I have mentioned earlier, I am sure the vast majority of Americans \nhave no idea what a secret hold is. It is not written down anywhere. \nThis is something you wouldn't find 1 of 1,000 people having any idea \nabout. But this is, in fact, one of the most powerful weapons, one of \nthe most significant tools a Member of this body could possibly have. \nIt is utilized without any accountability whatsoever.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee pointed out in \nhearings, and we heard it echoed by Senator Dodd, the bizarre kind of \nprocess of trying to track down Senators who are thousands of miles \naway from Capitol Hill and still claiming to have an objection when, in \na lot of instances, they may not even know about it; their staff will \nhave objected to it.\n  So what we have sought to do in this effort is to not limit the \npowers of any Member of the Senate but simply to say that power ought \nto be accompanied by responsibility. Yes, there should be rights. There \nought to be rights of every Member of the Senate to stand up and be \nheard on matters important to their constituents and to this country. \nBut there also ought to be responsibilities.\n  Chairman Lott has addressed this issue very eloquently by saying one \nof our most important responsibilities is to let the public see what we \nare up to. Yes, sunlight is the best disinfectant, but it is especially \nimportant, as Chairman Lott has noted, at the end of a session.\n  If someone exercises a hold in the beginning of a session, there is \nan opportunity, as the distinguished chairman of the committee has \nnoted, for the leaders to come together with the chairs and work out an \neffort to resolve a matter in a process that is fair to all sides.\n  When you are down to the last few days of a session and you are \ntalking about a measure that may involve billions of dollars, the well-\nbeing of millions of our citizens, someone can exercise the power to \nhold up the public's business without any accountability whatsoever. \nWhat happens is then the leaders and the chairs traipse all over here, \npractically going almost the equivalent of door to door, desk to desk \non the Senate floor. It got to a point, when I was trying to deal with \none particularly exasperating hold, where a Senator came up to me and \napologized because he was told there was a hold about which I was \nconcerned. He said: I knew nothing about it. It was put on by a staff \nperson. I asked for its removal.\n  There are a variety of technical issues on which Chairman Lott and \nChairman Grassley and Senator Byrd and I have worked. There is a \ndifference between a consult and a hold. A consult, in effect, is just \na request to be informed when a measure is going to be brought up. A \nhold is something different. A hold is when you want to shut down the \neffort to go forward and examine an important issue altogether. It is \nall powerful in the last few days of a session, as the distinguished \nchairman of the Rules Committee, Senator Lott, has noted.\n  There is something very wrong with the process when, in effect, you \nhave to traipse all over the Senate trying to figure out whether or not \nyour measure is going to see the light of day.\n\n  We have had an objection to our bipartisan effort today, but I think \nI speak for all of the sponsors when I say we are going to be back at \nit. Chairman Lott has initiated a very important process in the Rules \nCommittee to examine some of the antiquated practices of the Senate. \nThe holds is one that we see working great injury in the last days of a \nsession. But under the leadership of Chairman Lott, we are going to be \nlooking at other practices in the Rules Committee. I think that is long \noverdue. I have great confidence that the chairs, Chairman Lott, \nChairman Grassley, Senator Byrd, who knows more about the rules of the \nSenate than I could ever dream of knowing, are going to be able to work \nwith us on a bipartisan basis to address this responsibly.\n  We have done that. We have asked only that this be done for the rest \nof this session. I personally do not believe Western civilization is \ngoing to come to an end because a Member of the Senate has to be clear \nabout whether or not they are holding up the public's business. But to \nmake it absolutely clear what would transpire, we have in effect a test \nperiod, as Chairman Lott has described it, to examine the effect of our \nsunshine holds, a process that would end some of the stealth and \nsecrecy that surround this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Dayton as a cosponsor of S. \nRes. 216.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I see Senator Lott and other colleagues have other \nbusiness to attend to. I will wrap up only by quoting the foremost \nauthority on Senate rules who served as majority leader of the 95th, \n96th and 100th Congresses; that is, our friend and colleague, Senator \nRobert C. Byrd. In chapter 28, ``Reflections of a Party Leader,'' \nvolume 2 of his publication in the Senate, Senator Byrd wrote:\n\n       To me, the Senate's rules were to be used when necessary to \n     advance and to expedite the Senate's business.\n\n  Giving the sunshine hold a place in the Senate's rules, creating \nsunshine holds so as to ensure that there is new openness and new \naccountability in the way the Senate does its business, seems to me to \nbe an ideal way for the Senate to honor those eloquent words of Senator \nByrd.\n\n[[Page S15255]]\n\n  We have not been successful today, despite the best effort of \nChairman Lott, Senator Grassley, and others. But we will be back. This \npractice is continuing to increase. Even when I came to the Senate, I \nfound it used frequently but not to the extent it is being used today. \nIt is time to do the public's business in public. We will stay at this \neffort to accomplish just that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution to \nend secret holds in the Senate. Senator Wyden and I have worked long \nand hard on this issue and it is time for the Senate to act decisively \nto reject the practice of placing anonymous holds.\n  A hold, which allows a single Senator to prevent a bill or nomination \nfrom coming to the floor, is a very powerful tool. Holds are a function \nof the rules and traditions of the Senate and they can be used for \nlegitimate purposes. However, I believe in the principle of open \ngovernment. Lack of transparency in the public policy process leads to \ncynicism and distrust of public officials. I would maintain that the \nuse of secret holds damages public confidence in the institution of the \nSenate.\n  Our resolution would establish a standing order for the remainder of \nthis Congress that holds must be disclosed publicly. For my colleagues \nwho might be apprehensive of this change in doing business, I would \npoint out that this measure would only be in effect for the current \nCongress and would not formally amend the Senate rules. Nevertheless, a \nstanding order has essentially the same force and effect in practice as \na Senate rule. I have no doubt that, once instituted, this reform will \nbe found to be sound and no reason will be found why it shouldn't be \nrenewed in subsequent Congresses.\n  For several years now, I have made it my practice to publicly \ndisclose any hold I place in the Congressional Record, along with a \nshort explanation. It's quick, easy and painless, I assure my \ncolleagues. Our proposed standing order would provide for a simple form \nto fill out, like adding a cosponsor to a bill. The hold will then be \npublished in the Congressional Record and the Senate calendar. It is as \nsimple as that.\n  I am very pleased to have the support of Chairman Lott and Senator \nByrd on this initiative to require public disclosure of holds. Earlier \nthis year, Chairman Lott held a hearing in the Rules Committee on the \nGrassley-Wyden resolution to require disclosure of holds. Since that \ntime, my staff has worked together with staff members for Senators \nWyden, Lott, and Byrd to come up with what I think is a very well \nthought out proposal to require public disclosure of holds on \nlegislation or nominations in the Senate. I think it says a lot that \nthis proposal was written with the help and support of Senator Lott and \nSenator Byrd. As the chairman of the Rules Committee and a former \nmajority leader, Senator Lott brings valuable perspective and \nexperience. It is also a great honor to be able to work on this issue \nwith Senator Byrd, who is also a former majority leader and an expert \non Senate rules and procedure.\n  I am disappointed that we cannot move forward with this resolution \nnow, but I would urge my colleagues to join the growing coalition of \nSenators who are working to shed some sunlight on some of the most \nshadowy parts of this body so that we can ensure open and honest debate \non the issues before the American people. I believe that the more we \ntalk about secret holds, the more the consensus grows that this is an \nissue that must ultimately be addressed by the full Senate. You can be \nassured that we will keep pushing forward until that happens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15255-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15255-S15272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2003--CONFERENCE REPORT--Continued\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to the very \nspirited debate we have had about the Energy bill. A number of Members \nhave come to the floor to talk about specific provisions--the concern \nfor the liability waiver for MTBE, in particular.\n  I want to step back and talk about the bigger picture--about the \nfinancial health of our country and the impact that this Energy bill, \ngiven its enormous size, will have on the long-term health of our \nbudget, as well as our economy.\n  During the budget debates, we hear a great deal about fiscal \nresponsibility. People love to talk about fiscal responsibility in the \nabstract. When you are looking out 10 years and are talking about \nsurpluses or deficits, or more broadly about revenues or spending, it \nis all about fiscal responsibility. But they don't like to talk about \nit as much when we have a specific piece of legislation on the Senate \nfloor, as we have now, that will draw from the Federal Treasury and \nstart spending that money in a way that I don't think is very well \nthought out. I certainly don't think it will have a very positive \neffect on our economy.\n  In particular, if we look at the Energy bill and its scope and size, \nit not only breaks the budget that was agreed to just 6 months ago, it \nnot only violates the budget once or twice or three times, it is in \nviolation of the Budget Act in four different ways. In fact, in one \narea in particular, on spending, it violates the Budget Act three \ndifferent times. A point of order, as has been indicated by the budget \nchairman himself, lies against this bill. It violates the budget caps, \nbusts the budget by over $800 million next year alone, by more than \n$3.4 billion over the next 5 years, and by $4.3 billion over a 10-year \nperiod. It breaks the budget cap, breaks the budget agreement, and \nviolates the Budget Act. That is a lot of money--800 million dollars, \n$3.4 billion, and $4.3 billion over the next 10 years.\n  I think at a certain point we have to draw the line. We have to say \nenergy is important to the country, markets are important to the \ncountry, competitiveness is important to the country, but we can \nachieve these things without violating the budget agreement that was \njust put into place several months ago.\n  The bill includes new mandatory spending, which is effectively on \nautomatic pilot, where once the bill is signed into law, the spending \nwill take place automatically, without appropriations and without any \nnew legislation passed. So it is $3.7 billion in mandatory spending \nover the next 5 years, $5.4 billion in new mandatory spending over the \nnext 10 years. In addition to that, we have all the authorized spending \nin the bill--over $70 billion in spending is authorized over the next \n10 years.\n  Looking at the authorization language, the different programs--dozens \nand dozens of different programs--total over $70 billion. These \nprograms are effectively picking and choosing among different ideas and \ninnovations and areas of the energy industry, picking winners and \nlosers among the different competing forces. That is where we need to \nbe very careful about the impact a bill like this would have. Why \nshould any legislator, or bureaucrat, for that matter, be trying to \npick the winning or the losing energy technology or innovation 5 or 10 \nyears out into the future? We are not experts in this area. We are not \nscientists. We don't dedicate our lives to understanding the nuances of \nnew energy technology. We certainly should not be writing legislation \nthat picks those winners and losers in the marketplace.\n  If you read through--just to touch on a few to get a sense of what I \nam talking about--$250 million is in the bill for photovoltaic energy \ncommercialization, the use of photovoltaic energy in public buildings. \nPhotovoltaics is an interesting technology, perhaps a promising one. \nBut to spend $250 million to try to commercialize this in public \nbuildings suggests that we know, as Senators, that this is the right \nenergy source to use in public buildings for the foreseeable future.\n  Why not let the market compete? Why not let investors step forward to \nbuild or renovate or improve public buildings, to use energy more \nefficiently in public buildings, pick the best contractor, the best \nproduct, the product which delivers the best value for the public? Why \ndo we have to spend $250 million biasing the marketplace? There is $125 \nmillion for a coal technology loan. It turns out this particular one \nwill actually go to convert a clean coal technology plant into a \ntraditional coal-fired generation plant.\n  Elsewhere in the bill, we have a couple of billion dollars to \nsubsidize the clean coal technology industry. So this\n\n[[Page S15256]]\n\nis a case where maybe we are just not sure what the winner is going to \nbe, and we are trying to hedge our bets. There is nearly $100 million \nin the bill for the reduction of enginizing heavy-duty vehicles; reduce \nthe amount of heavy duty vehicles' idle--I suppose in traffic, or \nsitting at the truck stop, or wherever else it might be. Energy \nefficiency in heavy-duty trucks is a great idea. Somebody tells me that \nthose who build, manufacture, and own and operate heavy-duty trucks \nhave a financial incentive not to waste the diesel fuel they use to \ndrive the trucks all over the country. I don't think they need a \nsubsidy of $100 million for us to do the job that they ought to be \ndoing to make themselves more competitive and ultimately earn more \nmoney in the marketplace.\n  Engine testing program, $25 million. Why should we be subsidizing the \ntesting of commercial engines that companies or industries use to \noperate and earn a good living, as they should?\n  Here is another very interesting one. The next generation of lighting \ninitiative; $250 million for the next generation of lighting. We have \nnext generation Internet. I am still not sure why we put a billion \ndollars or $2 billion into that. The Internet is probably the one area \nof our economy that has attracted more capital faster than any other \nidea in our history. Why the Federal Government should be subsidizing \nthat, I don't know. Why we should be subsidizing new lighting \ntechnologies, I certainly don't know. There are wonderful companies \nthat make great lighting products, such as halogen lights, neon lights. \nI could name a few companies, but I am sure I will leave some out.\n  When we go to the Home Depot to buy lighting products or to the local \nhardware store or COSTCO and buy lighting products, we know who the \ncompetitors are. Why does the Federal Government need to spend $250 \nmillion to help develop better or newer lighting?\n  Somebody might say we are working on more efficient lighting. If you \nbuild a better light bulb that is less expensive to use and/or less \nexpensive to sell, I bet customers will recognize that value. It is a \nmature industry, a well-understood industry. You don't need a Ph.D. to \nunderstand why you would use a light bulb, how you use one, how much it \ncosts, and what the value is. That is the classic example of an \nindustry that certainly doesn't need a taxpayer subsidy.\n  Let's recognize that all of this spending--$250 million for lighting, \n$125 million for a coal loan, $2 billion for MTBE producers--is not \nmoney just being printed out in a back room somewhere. These are \ndollars that we are collecting from working families, men and women who \nwork very hard. We collect their Federal taxes and we have an \nobligation to be fiscally responsible and to do a thoughtful job in the \nway this money is spent in Washington.\n  We have new mandatory spending, we have authorized spending, and then \nwe get to the tax subsidies, some $25 billion. The President \nrecommended only $8 billion. The Senate recommended $18 billion. It \ncomes out of conference with the House and Senate at nearly $25 billion \nin tax subsidies, loan guarantees for diesel fuel plants, loan \nguarantees for three new coal plants. A loan guarantee to build any of \nthese new plants effectively puts the taxpayer on the hook for all, or \na very significant part, of that facility.\n  Again, I think the coal industry is a terrific industry, and also the \noil and gas industry, electricity generation, wind power, hydropower, \nsolar power. What we ought to be working toward, however, is a level \nplaying field where these competing ideas and competing technologies \ncan provide electricity, can provide power, can provide energy so \nconsumers and investors can make good decisions about where to put \ntheir money and which one of these competing technologies to buy.\n  There are certainly some good provisions in this legislation. I think \nthe electricity title takes important steps. I support repeal of the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act. We have better reliability \nstandards in this legislation for our electric grid. We have regulatory \nreform which I think is important for building out the electric \ninfrastructure and avoiding future crises, shortages, or blackouts. But \nwe can do all of these things without busting the budget. We can do all \nof these things without violating the Budget Act. We can do all of \nthese things without coming back with a bill that has three times the \ntax subsidies the President proposed.\n  Like so many Energy bills I have seen in my short time working in \nCongress, this bill is full of some very grandiose pipedreams. One of \nmy favorites is the hydrogen car--$2 billion for the hydrogen car. We \nare just coming off a $2 billion bender known as the Partnership for \nthe Next Generation Vehicle. Mr. President, $2 billion of taxpayers' \nmoney was spent to try to develop an electric car that was going to be \na hybrid electric car, a hybrid combustion engine and, at the end of \nthe day, it was a failure--$2 billion later. It had no material impact \non the delivery of more energy efficient vehicles into the marketplace.\n  Someone somewhere suddenly decided: It turns out the car of the \nfuture is not an electric car, the car of the future is really a \nhydrogen car. We must have gotten that whole electric car thing wrong. \nForget about that Partnership for the Next Generation Vehicle; it is \nreally the hydrogen car, and we only need $2 billion to do it.\n  I don't know if hydrogen is going to propel vehicles in the future. \nIt would be terrific if it did. I think the right way to get the answer \nis to let the marketplace decide, to let competing technologies and \nideas in the marketplace decide; put those ideas out, attract capital, \nattract investment, do the research and development, and, believe me, \nif somebody develops a cost-competitive electric car, let alone a \nhydrogen car, they are going to make a lot of money because there is a \ndemand for that in the marketplace.\n  People are willing to pay for a cheaper vehicle. People are willing \nto support initiatives that not only fulfill the needs in their daily \nlives traveling around but also help keep our environment a little \ncleaner by reducing emissions.\n  We have coal gasification, at $1 billion or so--nearly $1 billion for \na coal gasification initiative. Twenty years ago, it was all about \nsynthetic oil. That was clearly going to be the energy of the future--\nthe fossil fuel energy at least. I guess we must have gotten that one \nwrong because we spent $4 billion, $5 billion on that, and it turns out \nit is really not cost competitive. So we are going to go with coal \ngasification. Maybe that is what we meant to say or we learned a little \nbit since then.\n  Now we can see the future much more clearly, and we are going to \nstart out with a little bit less than $1 billion, but you can be \nassured that over time it is going to be a lot more than that.\n  These are pipedreams. These are important visions for scientists or \ntechnologists to have, and we want them to put some funding or risk \nsome capital for these ideas. The question isn't whether they are \ninteresting ideas or whether they are even worthy of investment but \nwhether they are worthy of taking Federal money, taxpayer money, and \nputting that money at risk in a marketplace that should be able to \nstand on its own, compete on a level playing field, and continue to \ndeliver the innovation and technology of which I think most Americans \nwould and should be very proud.\n  We can do a lot better than this bill. We can do better than a bill \nthat busts the budget. We can do better than a bill that has a $25 \nbillion grab bag of tax subsidies that distort the marketplace of ideas \nand the marketplace of capital. We can do better in terms of \nlegislation that should be promoting a very competitive environment \nand, therefore, a stronger, more robust economy, but instead, in \ndistorting the marketplace, I think we will do great damage to our \neconomy.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, we can do better than this legislation. \nFrankly, we need to do better than this legislation because if we \ndon't, I am afraid if we adopt this conference report, this will become \nthe standard method of operation, the standard way we approach science, \ntechnology, and energy: That\n\n[[Page S15257]]\n\nwe get together in a room in a conference or in a committee, and we sit \ndown as Senators and we try to pick the winners and the losers; that we \ndistribute subsidies in the way of spending or we distribute--in some \nways this is even worse--subsidies in the way of added complexity to \nthe Tax Code. Instead of ending up with an economy that is robust, an \neconomy that is the envy of the world, an economy that encourages new \nideas and innovation, we end up with some sort of variant of what has \nalready been defeated in the Eastern European countries and in the \nformer Soviet Union--a manipulated government-subsidized enterprise or \ngovernment-run economy where bureaucrats or elected officials try to \npull the strings, but to no avail, degrading the economy, making it \nless efficient, making it less robust, and not discovering those very \nentrepreneurs we know are the heart and soul of the prosperity we \nenjoy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe statement of Senator Kyl, Senator Graham of Florida be recognized \nfor 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join many of my colleagues \nin strongly opposing this Energy bill. The opposition is not reserved \nto only Democrats; the opposition is for those people who think about \nthe implications of this bill and the serious concerns it raises.\n  For one thing, it is terribly lopsided. It is out of balance. It is \nheavily weighted toward the industry because it was written by just a \nfew select individuals with almost no conference input by Democrats.\n  The bill is an embarrassing example of the public's worst fears about \nWashington power politics, and those power sources are the oil and gas \nlobbyists downtown. Though it is called the Energy Policy Act of 2003, \nthis bill promotes the outdated policies of a generation ago. It should \nbe called actually the Energy Policy Act of 1903. The policy here is \nsimple: Drill for oil, drill for natural gas, dig for coal.\n  While the country needs oil, natural gas, and coal, we also need \nleaders with a vision to promote clean sources of energy that won't \nharm the health of our children, our grandchildren, and future \ngenerations. It is the 21st century, and we have the technology to do \nbetter.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, between 1948 and \n1998 the Federal Government subsidized the energy industry by well over \n$100 billion. Unfortunately, less than $1 in $10 was used to promote \nrenewable energy, that which you can find relatively easily and without \nthe pollution that our present energy sources convey to the public.\n  Now, in this single bill, we are being asked to spend another $50 \nbillion to $100 billion on tax credits and loan guarantees to the oil, \ngas, and nuclear industries. How will all of those taxpayer dollars be \nspent? They will be spent on a long list of brazen giveaways to \npolluting uranium companies, Archer Daniels Midland, to MTBE producers, \nand for a smattering of goodies and pet projects.\n  Taking care of special interests has become a hallmark of this \nCongress. Peter Jennings highlighted it in a perfect example on the \nevening news the other night. He reported that taxpayers have so far \ncontributed $1.3 billion to subsidize wealthy individuals who buy the \nbiggest gas guzzlers sold in America. As he pointed out, one couple \nreceived $17,000 in tax breaks on their new SUV and boast: ``We have \ndecided to take two extra vacations this year with the money we \nsaved.'' But for the energy they used, they pose a whole different kind \nof issue.\n  Why is the answer around here always to hand over cash to rich people \nand successful companies? Can we really justify turning over the hard-\nearned tax dollars of Americans, who do not earn enough to benefit much \nfrom the Bush tax cuts, to companies flush with cash?\n  Here is an issue that was announced August 1, 2003: ``Chevron \nQuadruples Profits.'' It goes on to say:\n\n       Oil giant Chevron Texaco increased quarterly profits four \n     times to $1.6 billion.\n\n  Their revenues soared to $29 billion in the quarter. Do these \ncompanies really sound as if they need Government subsidies to do their \njob? Not to me.\n  We have the perfect opportunity to guide the country toward clean, \nrenewable energy. Yet most of the bill's tax credits for efficiency and \nrenewables last only 2 or 3 years. Any business person knows this is \nnot a sufficient time period to encourage significant investments and \ntechnology development.\n  We Americans have always set ourselves apart by our ingenuity and \ncreativity. Today, amid an avalanche of promising scientific \ndiscoveries in the field of energy, the majority can see no further \nthan the lobbyists' interests which this bill follows to the letter.\n  Recently, I read that in Amsterdam, a major European chip \nmanufacturer has discovered a new way to produce solar cells that will \ngenerate electricity 20 times cheaper than today's solar panels. ST-\nMicroelectronics, Europe's largest semiconductor maker, says that by \nthe end of next year it expects to have the first stable prototypes \nready. If a decade ago we had been serious about promoting renewable \nenergy, that discovery could have been made by an American company, but \nsuch breakthroughs are unlikely with the minimal incentives offered in \nthis bill for development of better ways to be less dependent on the \nenergy sources we have now.\n  It is also disheartening that this bill grants exemption after \nexemption to the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and other \nprotective laws. I do not really understand it. Is boosting the profits \nof giant companies really more important to the bill's authors than the \nhealth of the American people?\n  Let us talk about just one of the riders slipped in by House \nRepublicans without a vote from either the House or the Senate. This \nwas snuck in during conference. This rider amends the Clean Air Act, \ngives cities an easy out if they find meeting the new ozone standard is \ndifficult due to transboundary pollution. It requires EPA to grant them \nan automatic extension. It does not say for how long. It fails to \ndefine the conditions that would precipitate such an extension.\n\n  The result of this rider, of delaying implementation of the ozone \nstandard for just 1 year, is severe. That rider is estimated to cause \n390,000 more asthma attacks, 44,000 of those in my State, 5,000 more \nhospitalizations, and 570,000 more missed schooldays. That is the \nresult of just one of the many exceptions carved out of our \nenvironmental laws by this bill.\n  Among my nine grandchildren, I have two who are asthmatic. The rate \nof asthma among juveniles is growing substantially. I lost my sister to \nan asthma attack. It was obviously a devastating event in our family's \nhistory. To those who see kids with asthma get fatigued after \nparticipating in sports or otherwise, it is the kind of anguish that \ndrives parents to all kinds of anxieties.\n  The bill fails the American people on every level. It fails to boost \nour energy security, it fails to safeguard electricity consumers, and \nit fails to protect the environment.\n  It is astounding to look at what this bill does not do. While \nautomobiles account for a whopping 40 percent of our Nation's growing \noil addiction, the bill does not address fuel economy at all. The bill \ncomes at the very time when fuel efficiency has arguably never been \nmore important. America's fuel economy is at a 22-year low. Today, the \nUnited States spends $200,000 every minute on foreign oil. But the \neconomic costs of weak fuel efficiency requirements go far beyond just \nthe cost of oil. If we include the major oil price shocks of the last \n30 years and the resulting economic recessions, the cost goes up at \nleast $7 trillion.\n  Given these hard facts, one would naturally expect a national energy \npolicy to aggressively pursue decreases in oil. It does not. Just the \nopposite. It generously promotes increases in oil use while tossing \nwhat I would call petty cash toward energy conservation, energy \nefficiency, and renewable energy.\n  We never hear a word--and this has happened in Democratic as well as \nRepublican administrations--about sacrifice, conserve, think about what \nhappens when more fuel is ground into toxic emissions. It is terrible \nthat we cannot understand there is a mission attached to saving oil and \ngasoline use.\n\n[[Page S15258]]\n\n  It is amazing what this bill fails to do on electric policy. This \nbill contains only one of three provisions the country must enact to \nprevent another massive blackout such as the Northeast experienced last \nAugust. We are being asked to support a dirty Energy bill in order to \nget one of the fundamental regulatory reforms to our electric grid \nsystem. I say the bad outweighs the good, and I cannot support it.\n  Around here, it is often said that the perfect is the enemy of the \ngood, but I say the bad far outweighs the good as an alternative.\n  The administration's energy and environmental policies reflected in \nthis bill are so utterly transparent in their goal of more corporate \nwelfare that the consultant, Frank Luntz, warned the party:\n\n       Watch your language--\n\n  And here he is, the fat cat--\n\n       A caricature has taken hold in the public imagination: \n     Republicans seemingly in the pockets of corporate fat cats \n     who rub their hands together and chuckle maniacally as they \n     plot to pollute corporate America for fun and profit.\n\n  Unfortunately for many, that is no caricature. From where I am \nstanding, that picture is pretty accurate. If one wants proof, look at \nthis bill. It is filled with little but big breaks for those who need \nthem the least. Yet rather than change their policies, Luntz offers \nthem protecting language. He wrote a memo to Republicans instructing \nthem on how to use the language tested on focus groups to hide their \ndeplorable environmental record.\n  This Energy bill is a great disappointment. It might have been \nacceptable at the beginning of the 20th century, but it is indefensible \nat the beginning of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, you know true patriotism is more than waving flags. It \nmeans putting the interests of the American people before the powerful \nspecial interests, the very thing this Energy bill fails to do. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak also to the \nEnergy conference report. Unlike some of the previous speakers I \nlistened to in the past 2 hours that I have been in the Chamber, I \nstand in support of the agreement that was reached in conference. It \nhas been pointed out that this is not a perfect bill. I would be the \nfirst to chime in and say I agree with that. But in an effort to \nachieve the perfect, I don't think we should overlook the good in the \nconference report.\n  Because of the hard work of Chairman Domenici and his staff, working \nwith the others on the conference agreement, and spending many, many \nhours to reach the consensus we have before us, I think we can truly \nsay this is a good bill and a bill that should be signed into law. \nThere has been a great deal of talk, not just during this legislative \nsession but in years previous: We need to have an energy policy for \nthis country. We need to have the framework for an energy policy.\n  It seems to me that so often what we do is react to situations, \nwhether it is the blackout we experienced in August, or when the price \nof gasoline increases to a level where it gets our attention. We only \nrespond when there is something that gets our attention and focuses the \nNation on energy.\n  Quite honestly, most Americans don't pay attention to energy. They \ndon't pay attention to how they get their lights to turn on, or how we \nkeep the temperature cool or warm. I have said many times as I talk \nabout energy, most Americans ascribe to the immaculate conception \ntheory of energy: It just happens. We know that is not the case. It \ndoesn't just happen. It takes innovation. It takes incentives. It takes \ncapital. It takes the desire to do something.\n  But without the energy we have in this country, we would not have the \nfreedoms or the liberties we take for granted--the ability to do what \nwe want, to go where we want to go. We need to recognize that energy is \nsomething that has built our country and made us strong. We need to \ncontinue with that sound policy. I believe the conference report we \nhave in front of us is a good first step toward that sound policy.\n  As I say that in very general terms, I have to start off that this is \nnot my perfect bill. At the top of my list for an energy policy for \nthis country would be the opening of ANWR. We don't see that coming out \nof the conference report. Congress had the opportunity to include \nlanguage that would have generated over 1 million jobs for American \nworkers by allowing for oil and gas exploration on just 2,000 acres of \nAlaska's North Slope.\n  I know we tried to keep ANWR in the conference report. The chairman \nwas working hard. But we were threatened with that constant threat of a \nfilibuster. You can't put ANWR in the Energy bill or it will be \nfilibustered. It seems a little ironic to be standing here tonight. \nANWR is not in the Energy bill yet we are still slowed in the task of \ngetting to a vote on the Energy bill.\n  The House adopted ANWR and wanted it in the conference report but \nthere were continued objections, primarily from the environmental \ngroups, that have kept us and will keep us this year from moving \nforward with jobs that truly could have been promised with the opening \nof ANWR.\n  I have made the invitation to the Senators here on the floor and I \nknow my counterpart, Senator Stevens, has made the effort to invite all \nSenators to visit ANWR and see what this dispute over opening the \nCoastal Plain of ANWR to oil and gas exploration is all about. We want \nyou to see Prudhoe Bay. We want you to see the developments in Alpine \nand the technology we have utilized to provide for the exploration and \ndevelopment of oil up on the North Slope. We want you to see the \nminimal impact to the environment, and how technology has helped us to \nadvance.\n  I get a few takers, primarily in the summertime. But I encourage you \nto come up in the wintertime. This is when we do the production up \nthere. I know that is kind of a chilly invitation to some, but I think \nit would help to understand what we are dealing with in Alaska, how \nvast our spaces are, and just how small of an area the Coastal Plain of \nANWR, the 1002 area, really is, in comparison.\n  I agree with those of my colleagues who would argue we cannot drill \nour way to independence from foreign oil. They are absolutely right. We \nhave to have the incentives for renewable energy sources. We have to \nhave greater technological efficiency. We have to decrease our energy \nconsumption. Those efforts need to be part of this comprehensive energy \npackage. But we must also have increased domestic production. I suggest \nto you again, if you are going to argue that we need to have energy \nsecurity, if we want to reduce our reliance on foreign oil, the first \nplace we should be looking is ANWR.\n  But I am not going to go into any further discussion about ANWR at \nthis time. You have certainly heard the debate before. It will be an \nissue that we will revisit. We will continue to push for opening ANWR.\n  I want to take one more second to remind folks that we had an \nopportunity here for over one million jobs across the Nation, at a time \nwhen millions are unemployed in our country. But some Members have \ndeclined to accept that offer. Instead, we are talking about extending \nunemployment benefits.\n  I suggest to you that the unemployed people in my State, if given a \nchoice, would certainly prefer to have a job than more unemployment \nbenefits.\n  But when we speak about jobs, I should not be talking exclusively in \nthe negative here because all is not lost. We have an incredible \nopportunity in Alaska with our natural gas. Several very important \nprovisions are included in this bill that will promote the construction \nof a natural gas pipeline to transport the vast quantities of natural \ngas that we have up on our North Slope, to bring it to market in the \nlower 48, be it down the Alaska Canadian Highway or through LNG tankers \nto the west coast. We have 35 trillion cubic feet of gas up there now.\n  You have heard Members in the Chamber talking about the fact that \nright now that gas is stranded up there. Right now that gas is being \nreinjected instead of being shipped down here to the lower 48, where we \nneed it. We have provisions in the Energy bill to get that gas where it \nis needed: We have guaranteed loans, expedited judicial and \nenvironmental reviews, and a program to train pipeline workers--again,\n\n[[Page S15259]]\n\ntalking about the jobs aspect. The pipeline, if constructed, could \nprovide over one million jobs, direct and indirect jobs, through the \nconstruction of this pipeline alone.\n  But the key here is, if this pipeline is constructed, there are no \nguarantees. We have done a great deal in this legislation to encourage \nthe construction of the line.\n  There is one provision that generated a great deal of attention and \nfocus but is not included. There would have been a production credit to \nensure the economic viability and provide a safety net in the event the \nprice of gas drops to very low levels. That is not included in the \nlegislation.\n  This is a huge project. People need to understand how huge. This is a \n$20 billion project, 3,500 miles in length, 5 million tons of steel, \ndelivering billions of cubic feet of gas per day to a nation that is \nstarved right now for natural gas. And the situation is just getting \nworse.\n  It would be the biggest construction project of its kind in the \ncountry. It is something that we can only imagine. When we imagine huge \nprojects like this, every now and again they take a little bit of a \nboost to get going. What we have done in the Energy bill is to provide \nthat boost, to provide the incentives to encourage the construction.\n  Again, what we are providing is grants to authorize training of the \ncrews and workers who will construct and operate the pipeline.\n  We limit the period of time to bring a claim, if a claim should \narrive, and we expedite the claim so the project doesn't get bogged \ndown in the courts.\n  We authorize the construction of the pipeline. We have loan \nguarantees of up to 80 percent of the cost of the project. It would be \nan $18 billion Federal loan guarantee--probably the largest loan \nguarantee we have ever seen given to a project here in the United \nStates.\n  We have also included a 15-percent enhanced oil recovery credit for \nthe $2.6 billion gas handling plant that will be required on the North \nSlope.\n  We have provided for accelerated depreciation on the project, again \nhelping to provide that incentive which we need to encourage \nconstruction of this line.\n  This only happens, the jobs only come, if the construction happens, \nif we can get moving with the line, if we convince the producers that \nit is timely, it is necessary, and that the demand is there. I think we \nhave established that the demand is clearly there.\n  I am going to be working with the State of Alaska and the industry to \nexamine the options and to pursue those possibilities as we push this \nproject to completion. It is imperative that we in Congress, through \nthe passage of this bill, make our intent known that this is a priority \nfor the country. It is a priority for Alaska. But it must be a priority \nfor this Nation as well.\n  I have been talking about the Alaska component in the bill. We are \npleased with what I have spoken to so far. But we should be reminded \nabout the other good things in the Energy bill that apply throughout \nthe country.\n  Authorized annual funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, LIHEAP, is increased from $2 billion to $3.4 billion.\n  There is $550 million in grants for biomass production, and it \nprovides money for communities under 50,000 in population to improve \nthe commercial value of their biomass.\n  A couple of weeks ago, I stood on the floor during the debate on the \nHealthy Forests legislation and I showed a picture of Alaska Chugach \nForest on the Kenai Peninsula where as far as the eye can see the \nstanding trees are dead, killed by the spruce bark beetle. With the \nhelp of grants that we are seeing in the Energy bill, those trees can \nbe converted into a biomass fuel providing a new source of energy for \nlow-income communities.\n  There is money for clean coal power energy for those projects that \ndemonstrate the advanced technology that achieves significant emission \nreductions.\n  I need to point out that there has been discussion on this floor that \nthrough the Energy bill perhaps we are not putting enough focus on \nclean air, clean water, and concern for the environment. We need to \nunderstand that our environment is only going to be helped. We are only \ngoing to get cleaner air and cleaner water when we have the \nadvanced technology instead of the old stuff we had in the past. Those \ntechnologies might take some upfront money.\n\n  I know there are programs that have already been spoken about--such \nas the clean schoolbuses--$100 million to retrofit existing diesel \nbuses with new pollution control technology, $200 million in grants to \nreplace older schoolbuses with clean alternative fuels and ultra-low \nsulfur fuel buses.\n  Also, as has been referenced, there is funding for hydropowered \nautomobiles that the President has made such a big push for.\n  I might remind the body, though, that in order for us to make headway \non this particular initiative, it will increase the demand for our \nnatural gas. Again, the imperative is to move forward with a natural \ngas pipeline.\n  The bill contains language to make permanent the United States' \ncommitment to the energy security of Israel ensuring, if Israel is \nunable to independently secure its own supply of oil, that the United \nStates will procure the necessary oil to meet Israel's needs.\n  There is much in this Energy bill that provides the incentives and \nthe technology to move forward. We have language that will help in the \nrural areas of the nation--certainly those in my State. Not only do we \nnot have affordable energy in parts of rural Alaska, we don't have any \nenergy to speak of. We have a long way to go, but it is only with the \nassistance we are seeing through the Energy bill that we will get \nthere.\n  While I may suggest that Congress has missed an opportunity on \ncertain topics, such as ANWR, this bill does offer new programs to \nimprove our energy efficiency, increase the development and use of \nrenewable energy resources, and promote domestic production.\n  It doesn't go as far as it could in reducing America's dependence on \nunstable foreign sources of oil, but it is the beginning of a \ncomprehensive energy policy for this country. It is a policy that has \nbeen lacking for many, many years, and one that I feel is badly needed.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Domenici and \nhis counterpart in the House, Chairman Tauzin. I appreciate their hard \nwork and their leadership. Again, this is not a perfect bill, but it is \na good bill. I urge my colleagues to support its adoption so we can \nmove forward with a sound energy policy for the country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Alaska for \nbringing up an important issue of jobs in this bill, because clearly \none of the key components that we in the Northwest are interested in is \nthat this bill might move us forward on an energy policy that would \ncreate jobs and diversify Northwest power.\n  When we ran into a drought in 2000 and ended up having to go out on \nthe spot market and buy electricity, we certainly were gouged by some \nmanipulated contracts. But one of the things that could provide us some \nlong-term relief in the near term from future droughts and overreliance \non the hydrosystem would be a natural gas pipeline from Alaska down to \nthe continental United States which would help us in diversifying and \nprotecting against such incidents in the future.\n  But let us be clear. This bill doesn't get the job done. The Alaska \npipeline that we have all talked about as it relates to natural gas \ndoesn't have the framework within this legislation to move forward.\n  I commend the Senator from Alaska for focusing on job issues. I agree \nwith her that an energy policy must accomplish two things. It must set \na policy for us to get off our dependence on foreign oil and again for \nAmerica to have an advantage in job creation as we move on a 21st \ncentury energy policy. But this bill does nothing to help us diversify \nin the short term on natural gas that is available to us in Canada and \nAlaska. It does very little to help us in the future with the hydrogen \nfuel economy which, it is estimated, could create 750,000 jobs over the \nnext 10 years. That is not just the kind of activity that would make us \na leader in the United States; it is the kind of activity that would \nmake us a global\n\n[[Page S15260]]\n\nleader in the energy system of the future.\n\n  I will take a few minutes to talk about where we are with the Energy \nbill and where we have been because yesterday I spent quite a bit of \ntime talking about the overall aspects of the bill. Something of great \nconcern to me, being a member of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, I wanted to make sure, given the fact this bill has been \ndrafted mostly in secret, starting with the Vice President's energy \ntask force. That left many Americans out of the process of \nunderstanding what the administration's energy proposal would be, which \nled to a conference report that was done in secret by the Republican \nParty. Yesterday I needed to spend my time talking about the various \naspects of this bill in a comprehensive way that would give my \ncolleagues a perspective of someone from the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee who has dealt with some of the challenges and \nproblems.\n  Clearly, this 2003 Energy bill is becoming known as the bill about \nHooters, polluters, and about the looting of America that has happened, \nparticularly on the west coast, particularly in my State.\n  Americans are trying to understand this. I have had phone calls to my \noffice: I don't understand. I understand conservation, I understand \nrenewable energy, I understand incentivizing. What does Hooters have to \ndo with an energy policy?\n  In this legislation we have included green bond projects; that is, we \nwould help in the public financing of proposals to various developers \nin Colorado, New York, Iowa, and Louisiana, with $2 billion in private \nbonds to build energy-efficient developments. I am for energy \nefficiency, but last I heard Hooters had its own airline, was doing \nquite well and probably could borrow any money it needed to invest in \nenergy efficiency.\n  I have small businesses all over the State of Washington that got \nsmacked with the energy crisis. They had to conserve; they had to shut \ndown. Employees were coming up with all sorts of creativity: nobody got \nto borrow money from the Federal Government that would allow them to \nhave a line item in a bill that said specifically, this project is for \nyou.\n  Broad tax credits for conservation programs in which all companies \ncan apply for some of the incentives to get America to conserve--\nbecause conservation is a great program, particularly in times of less \nsupply--is a very good idea. But that is not what Hooters got. This \nparticular project, and the three others mentioned in this legislation, \nspecifically include a line item for particular projects. What \nqualifies them? I find it very hard to explain to my constituents. I \nknow there is a daiquiri bar in and an energy efficient bowling alley \nand a movie theater and everything else as part of this Hooters \nrestaurant development. But I don't understand why they should get some \nsort of line item for bonds, for money that needs to be borrowed for \nfuel efficiency when everyone else in the country has had to do their \nown jobs, to turn out the lights and conserve. What is so special about \nthis particular restaurant?\n  As far as the polluters, obviously, my colleagues have done a great \njob talking about the MTBE provision and the fact that people who have \nbeen involved with that product are seeking relief from being liable \nfor cleanup. I have heard from elected officials all over the State of \nWashington that they do not want to be the deep pocket. Cities have \nasked: Why is it that you are going to let these particular polluters \nin this bill off the hook and stick us with the cleanup cost of this \nparticular product? It is very unfair that that is the approach we \nwould take. My colleague, the Senator from Illinois, and everyone else \nhas been very articulate on that issue.\n\n  I am also amazed, as we look at the other aspects of the bill, \nparticularly relating to clean water and the Clean Water Act. Why would \nmy colleagues would want to say, under the Clean Water Act, this is \nlegislation that would somehow say to any coal-producing, oil, or gas \ncompany producer in the future under this bill, the 2003 Energy bill, \nthat you do not have to comply with clean water runoff standards. Why \nshould they be exempt? I cannot understand that. You build a shopping \ncenter. Guess what. You have to comply with runoff standards from the \nClean Water Act. If you build a hotel, you have to comply with getting \na runoff permit and saying how you are going to deal with runoff. Why? \nBecause there are two sources of pollution. We have the source point \npollution and then we have pollution that occurs from the runoff. We \nwant to control that.\n  We are demanding every other business in America has to get a permit \nwhen they go through development to deal with runoff, to make sure we \nhave clean water. But somehow we are going to allow certain types of \nindustries in the Energy bill, particularly oil, gas, and coal, to be \nexempt? What kind of policy is that?\n  The most famous person on this chart is Ken Lay. Why is he the most \nfamous person on this chart to people in Washington State? My \nconstituents want to know why, when they have been gouged with higher \nenergy prices, why this man is not in jail. I don't have a very good \nanswer.\n  This bill is about pollution. It is about special deals. It is about \nallowing a part of our country to be looted, to allow special interests \nto stick their hands in the pockets of ratepayers. That is what I will \nfocus on tonight. This bill takes a drastic step backward. While \ncomplex to understand, it is critically important for my colleagues to \nknow they cannot take the drastic steps in this measure that will \noverturn 70 years of case law, protecting consumers with just and \nreasonable rates.\n  I talked a little bit about the Clean Water Act. I don't know that I \nhave to go over that again, but I ask my colleagues, why make every \nother business in America comply with the Clean Water Act? There are \nprobably lots of other industries in the country; yet they have to \ncomply--if they want to develop--with runoff standards. Yet we will let \noil, gas, and coal companies off the hook. They do not have to get a \npermit anymore.\n  What is the price gouging that has gone on in this legislation? It is \nsignificant, and I will talk about that price gouging because it is \nvery important to understand.\n  I see my colleague from Florida, and I agreed to yield him some time. \nWould the Senator like that time now?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator from the State of Washington \nwould yield.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. How much time does the Senator from Florida need?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Five minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield, from my half hour, 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I rise in the Senate to tell the Senate that I \nhave concluded after studying this matter considerably that I will vote \nagainst this Energy bill, and I will vote against the motion for \ncloture because I have concluded that it is clearly against the \ninterests of the State of Florida.\n  I am going to try to point out two particular areas of the bill that \nviolate what everyone should consider in supporting the interests of \nthe people of the State of Florida. This is a map of Florida with stars \non it in dark colors. Each one of the dark-colored stars represents a \nhazardous material spill and an MTBE spill. There are 30,000 hazardous \nmaterial spills in our State. There are over 20,000 MTBE spills.\n  In the dark of night, in a conference committee that was closely \ncontrolled, a provision was inserted in this conference report that has \ncome back to us for consideration, that all liability of the oil \ncompanies would be removed forever on any of the contamination that \ncame as a result of those MTBE spills.\n\n  That simply is not right. It is not right to wipe out the ability of \n18 counties and cities in Florida that are presently contemplating suit \nto sue for those oil spills with MTBE, nor is it right that you would \nwipe out Escambia County's present suit--Escambia County, up here on \nthe map, the cradle of naval aviation, Pensacola--that you would wipe \nout their present suit against the oil companies because of the damage \nthat has been done to the water supply from the MTBE leeching.\n\n[[Page S15261]]\n\n  There is a lot in this Energy bill that I would like to support. \nThere is a lot in this Energy bill that I have helped put in and that I \nwill continue to support, such as the incentives for wind energy. That \nis certainly desirable. There is a major Florida investor-owned utility \nthat has wind energy in other parts of the country. I want to help \nencourage that renewable source of energy.\n  But I cannot take the good parts of this bill and overlook the kinds \nof things such as this: wiping out any liability of oil companies for \nthe harm they have caused to the environment.\n  Now, there is another major part I have considerable objection to, \nand that is the coastal parts of this bill. Under section 321, the \nSecretary of the Interior will be given broad new authority to grant \nleases, easements, or rights-of-way on the Outer Continental Shelf in \nareas where there is a moratorium against oil and gas exploration.\n  It is the ``Holy Grail'' of Florida that we do not want oil and gas \ndrilling off of our shores, not only for environmental reasons but for \nan economic reason. We have a $50 billion a year tourism industry, a \nlot of which depends on the pristine, sugary white beaches that we have \nin Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator for 2 \nadditional minutes just to complete my statement?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. President, I simply cannot support an Energy bill that suddenly \neases the process of permitting or weakens the Coastal Zone Management \nAct, weakens the process of a State to object to the Federal Government \ndoing anything having to do with oil and gas leasing off of the coast \nor with regard to the permitting process with regard to oil and gas \npipelines.\n  That is inimical to the interests of Florida and causes me to come \ndown on the side that even though there are lots of meritorious parts \nof this bill, which I will continue to work for, at the bottom line, \nthis is clearly not in the interest of my constituency.\n  So I thank the Senator for yielding so that I could state my \nposition, after a very deliberate consideration of this complicated \nlegislation. That is the way I will vote when these issues are brought \nup tomorrow.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for his \nsolid statement about the challenges facing us in drafting an Energy \nbill. The Outer Continental Shelf areas are somehow thrown up in the \nopen as to whether they are going to be part of the policy discussion, \nwhether States have rights, whether the development along those coastal \nareas is going to go through the normal process or whether industry is \ngoing to be able to just run roughshod over that.\n  So I appreciate the Senator's statement.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I will try to be brief to explain why I \nhave a major objection to this legislation as it relates to what we are \ndoing or failing, I should say, to do to protect consumers from the \nEnron price gouging that has happened. I think it is an amazing story.\n  Some of my colleagues were on the Senate floor earlier today talking \nabout how part of the California crisis was that in California they did \nnot pass on the cost of electricity to the retail side and somehow \nartificially suppressed demand. They asserted maybe that would have \nworked everything out.\n  Well, let me tell you, in Washington State we paid the cost at the \nretail level because we have a lot of public power in Washington State. \nAnd we had a drought. It was the second worst drought in the history of \nour State. It just so happened when that drought occurred it was the \nsame time that California had deregulated, and the spot market was \ngoing crazy, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has \noversight of these issues, was failing to do anything about it.\n  But public power has a requirement that they have an obligation to \nserve. So that obligation to serve meant they had to go find power \nsomewhere. Now, they had reserves. They had alternative plans. But they \nwent to the marketplace to buy power and found out the power was \nselling at exorbitant rates because of the deregulation that happened \nin California and the fact that the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission was failing to take action.\n  In fact, it got so bad in our State because of the high rates that we \nhad, in the county I live in, 14,000 people basically lost their \nelectricity that year. We had a 44-percent increase in the disconnect \nrate in Snohomish County, my home county, that year because of the high \ncost of energy. People could not pay their bills.\n  Now, I know some people think: Well, bad decisions were made by a \ncompany, and that may not happen again, or somebody did not plan for \nenough power in the future. But we all know now that Enron manipulated \nthese rates. They have admitted to manipulating the rates. The Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission has said they manipulated those rates. So \nwe all know what has gone on in those situations. But I don't think \nAmerica knows that people in my State are still paying on those \nmanipulated rates.\n  And my consumers are mad. They are furious. They are furious that \nthis Energy bill not only fails to recognize we need stricter \nguidelines against market manipulation to prevent that from occurring \nin the future, but somehow this bill actually goes further in condoning \nthose acts by saying it is going to try to preserve those Enron \ncontracts resulting from manipulation.\n\n  Let me give you an idea of what consumers have said to me.\n  One of my constituents writes:\n\n       We are writing to express our extreme concern regarding our \n     latest electricity bill. We have done everything in our power \n     to conserve, and that is reflected in our usage, which has \n     been down to a very minimal level. We have lived at this \n     address since 1979, and we cannot continue to live in \n     Snohomish County because the electricity bills are almost \n     greater than our mortgage payments. We are currently \n     considering moving.\n\n  Another constituent writes:\n\n       I just received my bill today. I tried to prepare myself \n     before opening the envelope, but, guess what, I didn't \n     prepare myself 6,000 times enough because my bill was $800. \n     That's absolutely crazy. We have lived at this address for 23 \n     years, and we have tried our best at conserving. Where is it \n     going to end?\n\n  So my constituents--and I could read many more. I could tell you how \nthe Everett School District in Snohomish County ended up having a \nmillion-dollar increase in their energy budget, how small businesses \nhave had huge increases in their energy budgets.\n  It includes the grocery industry in the State of Washington--\neverybody knows that grocery stores operate on slim margins and use a \nlot of electricity. Do you know what they have said to me? ``We are not \ngoing to build another grocery store in Snohomish County because your \nrates are too high.''\n  And our rates are too high because we continue to have to pay on \nEnron contracts that Enron admitted they manipulated. Why is it that we \nhave to continue to pay on these contracts?\n  You would think that at least at a minimum the Energy bill would take \na step forward and say: Let's prevent the kind of Enron manipulation \nfrom happening again. But we are not doing that.\n  In this bill, originally Senator Domenici's proposal, roundtrip \ntrading is prohibited. But there are other things we proposed: \nbasically making sure people don't dodge price caps; making sure people \ndon't falsify demand schedules, like the load shifting that happened in \nCalifornia; people who would go out of the region and then sell power \nback into the region; obviously, under the scheme Fat Boy, people were \nhiding some of the energy supply that they had--all those things are \nstill allowed under this Energy bill.\n  As much as my colleagues have tried to articulate this on the floor, \nsomehow the other side of the aisle wants to ignore the reality: This \nbill is not dealing with the Enron manipulation schemes and blocking \nthem from happening again. I don't see, just on this\n\n[[Page S15262]]\n\nissue alone--if there was nothing else in the Energy bill--why people \nwould support this Energy bill because of this policy.\n  I ask my colleagues, I know it may not seem to you like an issue \nbecause it didn't happen to your State, but find me a Member on the \nother side of the aisle who would accept having a 50 percent rate \nincrease for their consumers, not just for 1 year but for the next 5 \nyears because that is what we are paying. And we are paying on those \ncontracts to Enron. I have a letter from a woman. I will not go into \nthe details, but she basically ended up losing her job and having to \nmove to a different area because of this.\n  What is the real issue? These contracts have been manipulated. These \nrate are the increases. These are the numbers from 2002, but as I said, \nalmost a 50 percent rate increase in Snohomish County where I live. \nSeattle City Light had a 60 percent increase. So we are talking about \nreal dollars that my constituents are paying on these Enron contracts.\n  Enron admitted they manipulated contracts. They admitted that they \nweren't just and reasonable rates and that they used all these schemes. \nYou would think my utilities could get out of those contracts. You \nwould think my utilities could reform those contracts. In fact, I am \namazed; the Department of Justice actually went after Enron and got \nthem to reform a contract as it related to a Federal entity, the \nBonneville Power Administration, because they had the power of the DOJ \nbehind them. But when my little utilities, which don't have the \nDepartment of Justice working on their side, tried to go to court and \nget those contracts reformed--no luck. They were sent to the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, which got on a conference call with Wall \nStreet investors, told the Enron company and their interests, don't do \nanything to negotiate and reform those contracts because basically we \nare going to rule in your favor.\n  That is in a Wall Street Journal article. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 31, 2003]\n\n        Power Points: Second Thoughts on FERC's California D-Day\n\n                            (By Mark Golden)\n\n       New York.--Even though the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission's big day on California began Wednesday with a \n     400-page catalog of bad behavior by energy companies, the \n     second look by Wall Street was that things weren't so bad.\n       FERC staff reported to Congress that Reliant Resources \n     (RRI) was significantly responsible for the high prices for \n     natural gas in southern California in the winter of 2000-\n     2001, which may have cost consumers billions of dollars.\n       Reliant and BP PLC (BP) did sham electricity trades, the \n     staff alleged, and dozens of companies used trading \n     strategies like the infamous ``Get Shorty'' stuff that Enron \n     Corp. (ENRNQ) used in California's power market. That was \n     illegal, staff said, and all those companies should be forced \n     to cough up any related profits. Refunds due California for \n     overpriced crisis-era power sales could be increased.\n       But the ``D'' in what one Wall Street analyst has been \n     calling ``D-Day'' turned out to stand for ``dirt'': A lot of \n     ugly stuff that will make it hard for energy companies to \n     continue claiming as they have that there wasn't much funny \n     business during the crisis, but which isn't that horrible \n     from a financial or legal perspective for most of the \n     companies involved.\n       Reliant's ``churning'' of the gas market, for example, \n     wasn't illegal, FERC staff said, and the conclusion that the \n     practice caused prices to rise required a leap of faith. The \n     Reliant-BP trades may cause BP to wonder if its trader rigged \n     a higher bonus, but they had nothing to do with the soaring \n     prices that prevailed during the crisis.\n       FERC staff exonerated Williams Cos. (WMB) from claims it \n     manipulated the California gas market. And FERC commissioners \n     said they were going to take some time to decide whether \n     their staff was right about the Enron-like trades being \n     illegal.\n       During the public meeting, the stock prices of several \n     companies named in the investigation fell hard. Most \n     recovered Thursday and again Friday as the smoke cleared.\n\n\n                             mixed messages\n\n       FERC's Donald Gelinas, who headed the investigation into \n     market manipulation for the past year, presented his findings \n     in the well-attended public meeting.\n       After the meeting and a press conference, FERC Chairman Pat \n     Wood and Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell, the commission's \n     two Republicans, held a password-protected conference call \n     with a select group of Wall Street analysts. According to \n     several of those present, the commissioners conveyed the \n     message that the staff findings weren't that bad.\n       According to one analyst on the call, the split approach \n     makes sense, FERC wants to present a public image as a tough \n     cop on the beat so that states and the U.S. Congress support \n     its push for advancing electricity deregulation. On the other \n     hand, FERC doesn't want to scare away more investment from \n     the decapitalized electricity sector, which is in desperate \n     need of new transmission lines and will need more power \n     plants soon in some regions of the country.\n       ``It was the typical thing they've been doing--trying to \n     please Wall Street at the same time they are trying to please \n     California, and they end up not pleasing anybody,'' that \n     analyst said.\n       Brownell discussed the prospects for the commission's \n     decision--expected but postponed on Wednesday--on whether to \n     abrogate long-term power contracts signed during the crisis. \n     She said there are likely two votes against abrogation on the \n     three-member commission, and that the commission will \n     hopefully issue an order in the next couple of weeks, \n     according to one analyst on the call, who took notes.\n       Brownell's comments on the contracts were similar to what \n     was said in the public meeting, even if the latter tone was \n     more assuring to investors.\n       Schwab Capital Markets energy stock analyst Christine Tezak \n     didn't agree that the commission has presented different \n     messages to different audiences. Instead, their discussion \n     with the analysts reflected the audience's primarily \n     financial concerns.\n       ``For Wall Street, the whole blame game thing isn't that \n     interesting to us,'' she said. ``We want to know what actions \n     they took and what it's going to cost and when.''\n\n\n                         ferc approach defended\n\n       Observers shouldn't necessarily expect the messages of the \n     staff report and the commissioner's discussion with analysts \n     to be consistent, a FERC spokesman said.\n       ``The intent was to get an independent fact-finding \n     analysis about whether Enron or any other company had the \n     ability to manipulate the markets for power and gas in the \n     western states in 2000 and 2001,'' spokesman Bryan Lee said.\n       Chairman Wood wouldn't try to influence the outcome of that \n     investigation, nor does the investigation reflect his opinion \n     on the matters, Lee said.\n       Still, a press release issued at the time of the report \n     promised ``tough action'' from commissioners based on the \n     report. Wood said that any doubts about FERC's role as \n     effective ``cop on the beat'' should be dispelled.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Enron is actually suing consumers across America. They \nare suing consumers in my State, in Washington, in Oregon, California, \nNevada, Idaho, in the Midwest, in the East. The States on this map, \nthose are States in which Enron is saying to utilities and to consumers \nand ratepayers: I am taking you to court to make sure you continue to \npay on manipulated contracts because really you are going to be the \ndeep pocket for these energy prices.\n  It is just plain wrong. It is plain wrong that that is what America \nis dealing with and that this particular bill does nothing about it.\n  Since the beginning of these contracts in my area, I have probably \npaid $700 on my own energy bill--$700 more than I would have paid if we \nwould have had normal rates. Here is a check from me. It is not really \nmy bank. It obviously doesn't have my bank number on there. But that is \nwhat I am going to next pay to Enron because of the fact that my \nutility can't get out of those manipulated contracts. My utility can't \nget out of those contracts. That is what everyone in Snohomish is going \nto have to pay, $370 more, even though we have already paid $796 more \nsince the crisis began.\n  There is another example of a woman in Snohomish County, where I \nlive, who was trying to take care of her mother. Basically, she got \nlaid off from Boeing. She got a utility bill for $605, nearly double \nthe last bill she had. Her mother got a bill for $747. Her mother is on \na fixed income. She only has $1,500 a month from Social Security, and \nshe is supposed to pay 747 of those dollars out to Enron to foot the \nbill for manipulated contracts. And this body can't do any better than \nto condone those contracts and further protect them under this bill? It \nis amazing. It is truly amazing.\n  So where are we on this problem and this issue? Just look at what \nratepayers in my region have had to pay since 2001. The total my \nratepayers have had to pay is $1.5 billion, over and above the amount \nthey otherwise would have had to pay in the Northwest, all because they \nare stuck with long-term Enron contracts. It is unfair. It is unjust. \nIt certainly isn't reasonable.\n\n[[Page S15263]]\n\n  What is the problem with this legislation in front of us? Again, you \nwould say: That is an issue of manipulated contracts. You ought to go \nto court. You should figure out what the court has to say about those \ncontracts.\n  Actually, many of my constituents did go to court. Snohomish County \nPUD went to court. Enron turned around and countersued. Basically, the \ncourt said: You don't have standing here because this isn't a decision \nbefore our courts. You have to go to the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission. They are the people who oversee these issues.\n  So when they went to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, they \nsaid: There is market manipulation, but we are not going to do anything \nabout it. And, frankly, it is a problem, but our report only is going \nto demonstrate that there was manipulation and we are not going to do \nanything.\n  So what we have had to do is really push on the fact that the Federal \nPower Act says there should be just and reasonable rates.\n  This bill further amends the Power Act, and it basically says that \nthese contracts should stand. It basically gives the contracts \nsanctity. It goes one step further than 70 years of case law and says: \nEven though the Power Act requires just and reasonable rates, we are \ngoing to guarantee these contracts. And FERC and the courts don't have \nto reform them ever, unless somehow someone can prove that a failure to \ndo so is somehow contrary to the public interest.\n  We are setting a whole new legal standard in this bill. We are \nfailing to correct the Enron manipulations. We are failing to give \ndirection in a key area of consumer protection. Not only that, we are \nchanging 70 years of case law and saying it is OK to manipulate \ncontracts.\n  It is time to defeat this bill which supports Hooters, polluters, and \nthe Enron looters that are gouging American ratepayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I congratulate Chairman Pete Domenici and his \nstaff for bringing a comprehensive Energy bill to the Senate floor. It \nhas many positive features. Unfortunately, on balance, the provisions \nhe was not primarily responsible for, those that came out of the \nFinance Committee, are far too heavily weighted towards subsidies and \nmandates and require that I respectfully oppose the bill.\n  Let me first mention some of the good in the bill. This is the part \nthat came out of the Energy Committee. First, on the subject of \nreliability, since the year 2000, Congress has attempted to pass \nmandatory reliability standards. For some time it has been known that \nthe voluntary reliability standards that currently exist were not \nadequate. This point was brought home in August with the blackout that \nhit New England and the Midwest.\n  We know from the United States-Canada Power Outage System Task Force \ninterim report on the causes of the blackout that First Energy failed \nto follow at least six voluntary reliability standards. The mandatory \nreliability standards in this bill will ensure that utilities cannot \nignore the responsibility they each owe to maintaining the grid. It \nwill go a long way toward keeping the lights on for millions of \nAmericans.\n  SMD delay, standard market design, the Government knows best, a one-\nsize-fits-all prescription for Federal domination at the expense of \nStates and the market: This had to be stopped in its tracks before it \ncost consumers billions of dollars.\n  The same bureaucrats who approved the plan that brought blackouts and \nskyrocketing prices to California, obviously, didn't learn their \nlesson.\n  So we included a strong SMD delay provision in the bill. The message \nto the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, is very plain: When \nCongress says no, it means no; and it says no rule before 2007. By \nthat, we mean you cannot just slap another label on SMD, such as WMP, \nor use a different legal basis, such as ``just and reasonable rates,'' \nrather than discrimination, and then send the same straitjacket kind of \na rule out the door. The same goes for standards of conduct rulemaking, \na supply margin assessment test, or some other Federal Government \nregulatory scheme.\n  Native load: The current stormy debates over how wholesale \nelectricity should move and be traded in this country will mean nothing \nif we cannot guarantee retail customers, the families and businesses \nthat pay their electricity bills every month, that when they flip the \nswitch the lights will go on. The native load provision that I worked \non with Senator Domenici guarantees Arizona's transmission lines will \nfirst be used to serve Arizonans and not just sold to the highest \nbidder. These are some of the good things in the bill. They are all in \nthe electric portion of the bill that Senator Domenici presented.\n  The bad comes from the Finance Committee on which I also sit, \nprimarily in the form of tax subsidies. The conference agreement \nincludes nearly $24 billion in tax incentives; most are tax credits. I \nadvise my colleagues that the negotiating compromise process here was a \ncurious one. The energy tax provisions in the Finance Committee this \nyear totaled $15 billion over 10 years. The House tax incentives total \n$17 billion over 10 years.\n  Mr. President, you would think that, between $15 billion and $17 \nbillion, there is a fairly obvious number there--$16 billion might have \nbeen the compromise between the House and Senate. That is not the way \nit works. The compromise between $15 billion and $17 billion was $24 \nbillion. Guess who lost in the compromise? The American taxpayers. How \ndid you get to $24 billion? Well, obviously, there were a lot of votes \nthat needed to be gained and that is how we got to $24 billion.\n  Maybe there is another formula. The administration only asked for $8 \nbillion in energy tax incentives. This is three times that amount. \nMaybe that is the new formula for compromise in a conference committee. \nSo that is not an appropriate number. It is way out of bounds. It is \ntoo much of a burden on American taxpayers for benefits that are \ndubious at best.\n  Tax credits are not the most efficient way to set policy. They can be \ninefficient and wasteful. We should use them very sparingly. Tax \ncredits distort the market and cause individuals or businesses to \nundertake unproductive economic activity that they probably would not \ndo absent the inducement. They are, in effect, appropriations through \nthe Tax Code; they are a way to give Federal subsidies, disguised as \ntax cuts, to favored constituencies.\n  Here are some examples of tax subsidies in this agreement:\n  Section 45, renewable energy tax credit: Cost, $3 billion over 10 \nyears. The conference agreement extends and expands the production tax \ncredit for energy from wind and closed-loop biomass. It also extends \ncredit to new forms of energy, such as solar, open-loop biomass, \ngeothermal, small irrigation, and municipal solid waste. This provision \nincludes energy produced from livestock waste and animal carcasses--so \nsave your Thanksgiving turkey.\n\n  Energy-efficient improvements to existing homes, $352 million, for 10 \nyears.\n  Energy-efficient new homes, $409 million, for 10 years.\n  Credit for energy-efficient appliances, $255 million, for 10 years. \nThat is for washing machines, refrigerators, and the like.\n  Extend and modify the section 29 credit for producing fuel from \nnonconventional energy sources, $3.1 billion, 10 years. Often, \ncompanies that claim this credit are not even energy companies. There \nis one I have familiarity with because Arizona tried something similar.\n  Alternative motor vehicles incentives: Cost, $2.5 billion, 10 years.\n  This agreement deletes a requirement that was in the Senate bill I \ngot in for a study. Why did I do that? We found that the Arizona \nexperience could have cost the State of Arizona hundreds of millions of \ndollars. I wanted to prevent that from happening here. We had a \ndisastrous experience with alternative fuel vehicle incentives. This is \na quote from the Arizona Republic when the Arizona Legislature repealed \nits alternative fuel program:\n\n       Lawmakers gutted the disastrous alternative fuel vehicle \n     program . . . in a volatile and dramatic House vote, ending a \n     debacle that outraged taxpayers, panicked buyers, and brought \n     down one of the State's most powerful politicians.\n\n  The repealed law, incidentally, paid for up to 50 percent of the cost \nof a car\n\n[[Page S15264]]\n\nequipped to burn alternative fuels. The program could have cost Arizona \n$\\1/2\\ billion if it hadn't been repealed--11 percent of the State's \nbudget. When proposed, the cost of the program was projected to be \nbetween $3 million and $10 million--less than 10 percent of its true \ncost. So the question I wanted to study was, are we confident about the \nrevenue estimates for our congressional provision?\n  I have talked a little about some of the good and a little about some \nof the bad. Let me conclude by talking about the truly ugly.\n  Ethanol: The ethanol provisions of the conference report are truly \nremarkable. They mandate that Americans use 5 billion gallons of \nethanol annually by the year 2012. We use 1.7 million gallons now. For \nwhat purpose, I ask, does Congress so egregiously manipulate the \nnational market for vehicle fuel? No proof exists that the ethanol \nmandate will make our air cleaner. In fact, in Arizona--and this is a \ncritical point--the State Department of Environmental Quality found \nthat more ethanol use will degrade air quality, which will probably \nforce areas in Arizona out of attainment under the Clean Air Act. \nArizonans will suffer as a result.\n  Furthermore, according to the Energy Information Administration, this \nmandate, costing between $6.7 billion and $8 billion a year, will force \nAmericans to pay more for gasoline. Nor is an ethanol mandate needed to \nkeep the ethanol industry alive. That industry already receives a hefty \namount of the Federal largess. CRS estimates that the ethanol and corn \nindustries have gotten more than $29 billion in subsidies since 1996. \nYet this bill not only mandates that we more than double our ethanol \nuse, it provides even more subsidies for the industry--as much as $26 \nbillion over the next 5 years.\n  Professor David Pimental, of the College of Agriculture and Life \nSciences at Cornell, has studied ethanol. He is a true expert on the \n``corn-to-car'' fuel process. His verdict, in a recent study: ``Abusing \nour precious croplands to grow corn for an energy-inefficient process \nthat yields low-grade automobile fuel amounts to unsustainable, \nsubsidized food burning.'' It isn't efficient. The fuel is low-grade. \nAnd what is more, Congress, by going in for ``unsustainable, subsidized \nfood burning,'' will impede the natural innovation in clean fuels that \nwould occur with a competitive market, free of the Government's \nmanipulation. These ethanol provisions, alone, dictate that I vote \nagainst the bill.\n  So, Mr. President, in conclusion, while this bill includes several \nmeritorious provisions, especially those negotiated by Chairman \nDomenici, I must vote against it because of the $24 billion in tax \nsubsidies and the bill's irresponsible manipulation of the energy \nmarkets through the Tax Code and the ethanol mandate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are expecting \nSenator Graham as part of an order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Graham has 20 minutes under that \nagreement.\n  Mr. REID. I will speak for a few minutes until he comes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. May I be put in line after Senator Graham?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Chair announce the schedule before the Senate as \nto what speakers will appear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Graham is the last speaker under the \nagreement, with 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that following Senator Graham, the \nmajority be recognized if they desire, and then following that, Senator \nSchumer have an opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as we look around the world today, we see \nblackouts and we see wild price spikes in electricity markets. We see \nturmoil in the Middle East. We see global warming caused by fossil fuel \nemissions. We see air pollution that contributes to asthma attacks \namong our smallest citizens--our children. We see our parks that are \nsmog-ridden. We see all these things, and we realize the United States \nneeds a national energy policy with a purpose and a vision.\n\n  We don't need more of the same old thing--more drilling, more \nburning, more shortages, more blackouts, more price spikes, and ever \nlarger vehicles with inefficient engines. We need a national energy \nstrategy that will protect our environment, provide a reliable supply \nof electricity for our consumers, and bolster our national security.\n  Instead, we get a $75 billion grab bag that I believe has serious \nproblems with the three P's--process, pork, and policy.\n  The process of this bill was fatally flawed. The genesis of the bill, \nI believe, was hatched in secret almost 3 years ago by the Cheney task \nforce and completed in secret just a few days ago.\n  The usual policy--and we have tried to live up to that--is the Senate \ndoes a bill, the House does a bill, and both parties--that is the \nSenators from the Senate and Congressmen from the House, Democrats and \nRepublicans--sit down together to try to work out an arrangement. In \nthis instance, the ranking member of the committee, Senator Bingaman, \nwho was also the former chairman of the committee, was not consulted. \nThe first he saw the bill was when it was printed. The distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, the ranking member and former chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senator Jeffords, was not \nconsulted, even though 100 titles of this legislation that is now \nbefore the Senate were under the jurisdiction of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee.\n  The pork was best summed up by Senator McCain's description of this \nbill: Leave no lobbyist behind. It is shameful that two-thirds of the \ntax incentives in this bill go to oil, gas, coal, and nuclear energy. \nThis is an investment in the past, not an investment in the future.\n  This bill will lavish more than $55 billion of taxpayer money on some \nof the wealthiest corporations in the world; namely, oil, gas, and coal \ncompanies. It would be better if the companies were all U.S. companies, \nbut some of them are not even U.S. companies getting these benefits.\n  The most disappointing aspect about this bill is its failure to enact \na policy with vision. After pouring billions of dollars into oil and \nnatural gas, we need to invest in clean technology, in a clean energy \nfuture. Sadly, this bill is more of the same old, same old. It \nendangers the environment; it does nothing to help consumers; and it \nwill not break our dependence on foreign oil, a dependence that \njeopardizes our national security.\n  Let's start with the assaults on the environment that are included in \nthis bill.\n  There have been hours of speeches given in the last 2 days of how it \nendangers our water supply by granting MTBE producers immunity from \nclaims that the additive is defective in design or manufacture and by \nweakening the leaking underground storage tank regulations.\n  It allows large metropolitan areas to extend deadlines for ozone \nnonattainment areas to comply with the Clean Air Act, and it relaxes \nregulatory requirements for energy production on Indian reservations \nand public lands.\n  It is beyond my ability to comprehend how anyone who is supportive of \ntribal sovereignty, reservations, and economic development with our \nIndian tribes could support this legislation.\n  This bill also falls short of the real steps needed to guide America \ntoward energy independence.\n  For example, it is a great disappointment to me that higher fuel \nefficiency standards have not been included in this bill. If all cars, \ntrucks and sport utility vehicles had a CAFE standard of 27.5 miles per \ngallon, the country would save more oil in 3 years than could be \nrecovered economically from the entire Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \nA comprehensive energy strategy must include conservation, efficiency, \nand expand generating capacity.\n  Certainly our Nation must promote the responsible production of oil \nand gas, but that doesn't mean we should sacrifice the environmental \nprotections of our public lands.\n  We can't drill our way to energy independence. America only has 3 \npercent of the world's oil reserved, but we use 25 percent of the \nworld's supply.\n  This bill also fails to protect consumers.\n\n[[Page S15265]]\n\n  In the past few years, people in my home State and other Western \nStates have experienced severe spikes in the price of electricity. The \npolicies of the past are not the answer. Like Dorothy in the Wizard of \nOz, the solution is literally right at our feet--under the ground, in \nthe wind around us, and emanating from the Sun. In Nevada and other \nWestern States, we have the potential to generate enormous amounts of \nelectricity with geothermal, wind, and solar power. That is why I am \ndisappointed this energy bill does not contain a renewable portfolio \nstandard requiring that a growing percentage of the Nation's power \nsupply come from renewable energy resources.\n  I am proud that my home State of Nevada has adopted one of the most \naggressive renewable portfolio standards of any State. It requires us \nto produce 5 percent of our electricity with renewable sources, not \ncounting hydropower, by the end of this year. In 10 years, the goal \njumps to 15 percent. We already have developed 200 megawatts of \ngeothermal power, with a long-term potential of more than 2,500 \nmegawatts.\n  Utilities in Nevada have also signed contracts to provide 205 \nmegawatts of wind power in 2 years, and an additional 90 megawatts is \nproposed. By some estimates, we could potentially produce more than \n5,700 megawatts from wind power--meaning we could meet our entire \nelectricity needs with geothermal and wind. So I wish this bill \nincluded a Renewable Portfolio Standard.\n  Thankfully, it does extend and expand the production tax credit on \nrenewable energy resources from wind and poultry waste to include \ngeothermal, solar, and open-loop biomass. I have spent years fighting \nfor this tax credit, because it will give businesses the certainty they \nneed to invest in geothermal and solar generating facilities. We know \nthe production tax credit will work because it already has. With the \nbenefit of the existing production tax credit, wind energy is the \nfastest growing renewable energy source. In 1990, the cost of wind \nenergy was 22.5 cents per kilowatt hour. Today, with new technology and \nthe help of a modest production tax credit, wind is a competitive \nenergy source at 3 to 4 cents per kilowatt hour. I applaud the fact \nthat wind, geothermal, and solar energy will receive a production tax \ncredit of 1.8 cents per kilowatt hour.\n  I had hoped the bill would provide geothermal and solar energy the \nsame 10-year tax credit that wind energy enjoys, but a 5-year credit is \na good start. The facilities to develop these energy resources are very \ncapital intensive, and a 10-year tax incentive is needed to fully \nrealize our renewable energy potential.\n  Developing these renewable resources will not only help consumers, it \nwill create thousands of jobs. And many of these jobs will be in rural \nareas that are desperate for economic growth. A report from the Tellus \nInstitute, ``Clean Energy: Jobs for America's Future,'' found that \ninvestment in renewable energy could lead to a net annual employment \nincrease of more than 700,000 jobs in 2010, rising to approximately 1.3 \nbillion by 2020, and that each State would experience a positive net \njob impact. This is why we must be bold. We must not cling to the \nfossil fuel technology of the past. We must explore and seize the \npotential of the future.\n  I opened my remarks a few minutes ago by talking about all of the \nproblems we see if we look around the world today. But I also see much \nthat could be positive. I see renewable energy resources--the \nbrilliance of the sun, the power of the wind, the eternal heat within \nthe Earth. And I see the good old American ingenuity to unlock that \nenormous potential.\n  With a little bit of incentive and investment, we can develop the \ntechnologies to efficiently develop our renewable resources. And as \nfantastic as it sounds, with the use of hydrogen fuel cells, oil will \neventually be phased out as the primary transportation fuel.\n  If we choose to invest in energy efficient and renewable \ntechnologies, we will create thousands of new jobs, we will protect our \nenvironment, we will provide consumers with reliable sources of energy, \nand we will bolster our national security. That is the vision our \nNation needs. That is the leadership we must provide.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, the Energy \nbill before the Senate today is the newest chapter in the book that we \nhave been writing throughout this year. The title of that book is ``At \nWar With Our Children.'' This legislation would represent another \nexample of this generation taking the benefits of our profligate \nbehavior and then asking our children and grandchildren to pay the \ncost.\n  This chapter begins with the addition of over $30 billion in \nsanctioned appropriations and some $70 billion in authorized \nappropriations. This will be added to an already gigantic deficit. If \nit had been added to this year's deficit, it would have increased it by \napproximately 7 to 8 percent. This cost will be paid by our children. \nBut this goes beyond just adding to the financial burdens of our \nfuture. It adds to the vulnerability of our children and \ngrandchildren--a vulnerability that will be occasioned by the \nfundamental philosophy of this legislation, which is to drain America \nfirst.\n  There are some small vows to conservation and alternative sources of \nenergy, but the principle that lies behind this bill is to extract as \nmuch of our national treasure as quickly as possible and to accelerate \nthe date when we will have depleted our domestic source of petroleum \nand other critical natural resources.\n  Our generation gets whatever short-term benefits--physical \nmaintenance of low prices of gasoline, the benefits to the oil and gas \nindustry--that will come from this bill. But we again declare war on \nour children because they will end up paying for it.\n  Let me suggest what I think should be some goals of a reasonable, \ncomprehensive energy policy. These would be illustrative of the kind of \nlong-term goals that should be but, regrettably, are not the focus of \nthis Energy bill. As an example, my goal No. 1 was that we must take a \nlong-term approach to energy policy, establishing goals to reach for \nthe next 50 years with milestones for each decade to guide our \nprogress. We cannot be the generation that sets our national energy \npolicy on a course which will inevitably result in totally depleting \nour domestic energy reserves by the time our grandchildren are adults.\n  The United States is the model to the rest of the world. We should \nlead by example, using energy conservation and efficiency measures. We \nshould husband our domestic reserves, particularly of petroleum, for \ntimes of international turmoil.\n  Goal No. 2: We must wean ourselves from our unhealthy dependence on \npetroleum, both foreign and domestic. Current estimates show that the \nUnited States is consuming between 19 and 20 million barrels of oil \neach day. From the mid-1970s into the 1980s, use of petroleum sharply \ndropped in the United States. I propose we return to that path and aim \nto decrease the use of petroleum by approximately 10 percent over the \nnext decade, with the ultimate goal of finding a cleaner and more \nefficient way of operating automobiles and expanding our transportation \noptions such as high-speed rail.\n  Goal No. 3: We must reduce our importation of foreign oil, which \ncurrently accounts for about 65 percent of the oil we consume. We must \nconserve our current use of domestic oil and gas in order to stretch \ntheir availability as far as possible.\n  Under current levels of extraction and projected levels of use, in \napproximately 50 to 75 years, about the time our grandchildren will be \nour age, we will have exhausted our domestic petroleum reserves at \ncurrent economic and technological levels of extraction.\n  This is not a new problem, it is one that has been pointed out to us \nfor more than half a century. In 1946, James Forrestal, then-Secretary \nof the Navy, said this:\n\n       If we ever go into another world war, it is quite possible \n     that we would not have access to reserves held in the Middle \n     East. But in the meantime, the use of those reserves would \n     prevent depletion of our own, a depletion which may be \n     serious within the next 15 years.\n\n  Secretary Forrestal's statement is remarkable for a couple of \nreasons. First, he was looking far over the horizon, beyond the short \nterm, and trying to see what would be happening over the next 50 years. \nSecond, he did not succumb to the mantra of independence from foreign \noil through draining\n\n[[Page S15266]]\n\nAmerica first. Rather, he viewed use of foreign oil as a method of \nhusbanding our domestic reserves.\n  This Energy bill, with its drain-America-first policy, is a step \nbackward from Forrestal's policy. It will assure that we deplete our \nown resources in the near future. Forrestal sets the examples of the \nkind of policy we should be making in this energy Bill today.\n  Goal No. 4: We must increase the amount of renewable and alternative \nenergy we use. This would include wind, solar, hydro, geothermal power, \nand municipal solid waste. It should also include clean coal and \nnuclear as alternatives to current fossil fuel use.\n  Goal No. 5: We must eliminate our overreliance on a single source of \npower for electric energy generation. I am becoming increasingly \nconcerned about our tendency to turn to natural gas to solve all of our \nenergy woes. Clearly, natural gas has some significant advantages in \nterms of emission reduction, but we as a nation, in my judgment, would \nbe foolish to have only a single or even a single dominant source of \nfuels for our electric supply.\n\n  The National Association of State Energy Officials estimates that \nnatural gas used for electricity generation will increase by 54 percent \nbetween 2000 and 2015 as new powerplants are built and older plants are \nconverted to natural gas.\n  In contrast, our friends in Europe are making great strides in \nexpanding their energy portfolios to include renewables. Denmark, for \nexample, has a plan to eventually generate about 20 percent of its \nenergy needs from wind power. The United States should take serious \nsteps to include all available energy sources. One way to accomplish \nthis would be to establish a national renewable portfolio standard. \nThis simple measure would go a long way in putting us on the path to a \nsustainable energy future, by encouraging innovation in renewable \nenergy technologies and by increasing the demand which would have the \nresult of more efficient production. It would create jobs in America \nfor Americans.\n  Unfortunately, the Energy bill we are considering today ignores the \nrenewable portfolio outright, even though Senator Bingaman's amendment \nto this effect was accepted by a strong bipartisan vote by the Senate \nconferees.\n  Goal No. 6: We must provide Americans with a reliable electricity \nsystem. We all know that millions of people were affected by the \nblackouts of this past summer. What we do not know is how to prevent it \nfrom happening again. I am pleased that this bill begins the process, \nalthough distressed that this bill does not go as far as the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission has recommended to give us greater \nreassurance about the avoidance of August 14 calamities in the future.\n  But there is even a more basic step we should be taking, and that is \nto accomplish the goal of a reliable electric grid, we must gather data \nabout the current state of reliability.\n  It is shocking to realize there is presently no national reporting of \noutages, which makes it difficult to determine the scope of the problem \nand the range of solutions. Electricity customers have the means to \nfind information about the price of their electricity should we have \nsuch national data. They do not have such an opportunity today.\n  I propose that consumers should also have the means to judge the \nreliability of the system that provides them their electricity.\n  Goal No. 7: We should reduce the impacts of the use of energy on our \nenvironment. In the 1990s we proved that the American economy could \ngrow while making meaningful progress to improve our environment. This \nmeans we should not drill America first without considering real \nconservation and real efficiency standards, as well as the effects of \nsuch drilling on the depletion of our domestic energy reserves. It also \nmeans striving to reduce carbon emissions.\n  This bill does neither. It focuses, with laser-like precision, at \ngiving big oil every item on its wish list while running roughshod over \nthe rights of the States that depend on, for instance, healthy coasts \nfor their economic security. Section 325 weakens the consistency \nguidelines of the Coastal Zone Management Act.\n  Currently, States have the right to review proposed offshore projects \nand object if they find that these projects are inconsistent with the \nState's plans or policy. This Energy bill would impose severely \nrestrictive guidelines and deadlines for decisions appealing States' \nconsistency determinations. The practical effect of this would be to \nlimit opportunities for States to comment and provide important \ninformation on issues which directly affect their coastal zones.\n  Coastal States deserve to have a say in the fates of their shores. \nThis is the basis upon which the Coastal Zone Management Act became \nlaw. This Energy bill includes provisions to get every drop of oil out \nof domestic reserves while refusing to improve CAFE standards for SUVs. \nWith advances in technology, it is not difficult to improve the \nefficiency of vehicles while providing the other features that drivers \nwant. Yet this bill creates the likelihood that fuel efficiency \nstandards will continue to lag. We should resolve to move to at least \nthe 35 miles per gallon level for new cars within this decade.\n  The National Academy of Sciences says this is a reasonable goal. If \nwe pursued this goal, we would lessen the impact of any oil \ninterruption, we would sharply reduce the amount of money going to \nareas of the world where the cash might support undesirable activity, \nand, in addition, we would also make a significant dent in reducing \ngreenhouse gases, an issue which is also ignored by this Energy bill. \nAny comprehensive Energy bill that doesn't commit to at least some \nreductions in the emission of greenhouse gases is not worthy of \npassage.\n  Furthermore, this Energy bill goes one step further and actually \nrolls back important environmental standards. One example of this is \nthe exemption of the hydraulic fracturing process from the Safe \nDrinking Water Act protection for drinking water sources. I have grave \nconcerns about this action from public health, environmental, and legal \nperspectives.\n  Hydraulic fracturing is a means by which certain energy sources are \nretrieved through the use of a heavy hydraulic process. The consequence \nof this is that after the useful materials have been recovered, there \nis a significant amount of water laden with materials which contain \npotentially serious carcinogenic and toxic substances. There are \npotential serious consequences for drinking water quality in areas \nwhere this hydraulic fracturing occurs. In many cases, the fracturing \nfluids being pumped from ground water contain toxins and carcinogenic \nchemicals. Diesel fuel is a common component of fractured fluids.\n  The Energy bill before this conference permanently exempts the oil \nand gas industry from storm water pollution activities at construction \nsites. Since 1990, large construction sites have been required to \ncontrol storm water runoff in order to prevent pollution from entering \nadjacent waterways, harming wildlife and impairing water quality.\n  The irony of this is that the Senate will soon consider the \ntransportation bill, the Surface Transportation Act. This act was \namended in the Environment and Public Works Committee to mandate that \nStates earmark at least 2 percent of their highway funds to deal with \nstorm water runoff. While we are doing this to our public agencies, \nrequiring them to devote substantial funds and attention to storm water \nrunoff, we are permanently exempting the oil and gas industry at its \nconstruction sites from doing so.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes to \ncomplete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, in the year 2003--this year--\nsmaller sites were to have been required to adopt the same pollution \ncontrols which, since 1990, have applied to large projects. Under \nindustry pressure, the EPA issued a 2-year extension for the oil and \ngas industry. All other sectors, including small municipalities, still \nhave to comply. This section of the Energy bill adopts a permanent \nexemption for all construction at oil and gas sites, including those \nsites that held permits for over 10 years.\n  These are only some of the examples of environmental rollbacks in \nthis Energy bill related to clean water, clean\n\n[[Page S15267]]\n\nair, the National Environmental Protection Act, and other important \nenactments designed to protect the environment and the public health.\n  The Energy bill we have before us today cannot guarantee Americans \nthat their energy future is secure. Returning to the illuminating \nremark of Yogi Berra, if we look at this legislation, we begin to get \nsome sense of where we are headed.\n  With this Energy bill, we have written the next chapter in the book \n``War On Our Children,'' and it describes the next battle: Drain \nAmerica First, overlook conservation measures, ignore strategies to \nreduce depletion of domestic reserves.\n  The residue of these outdated ideas will undoubtedly stain the \nfuture. Our children and grandchildren will live in an America where \nwater is more contaminated, where air is further clogged with \npollution, where access to clean rivers and streams for drinking, \nswimming, and fishing will be diminished.\n  The cost of this destruction is not only economic or environmental, \nit is societal. Future generations will be forced to fix our mistakes \ninstead of focusing on a better tomorrow for their children and \ngrandchildren.\n  For these reasons, I strongly oppose this legislation and will vote \nno.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nconference report accompanying the Energy bill. As I have often stated, \nwe sorely need to develop a long overdue comprehensive energy policy \nfor our Nation. The United States has a responsibility to develop a \npolicy that harmonizes the needs of our economy and our environment.\n  These are not competing needs. A sustainable environment is critical \nto a strong economy and a sustainable economy is critical to providing \nthe funding necessary to improve our environment. We need to enact a \npolicy that broadens our base of energy resources to create stability, \nguarantee reasonable prices, and protect America's security. It has to \nbe a policy that will keep energy affordable. Finally, it has to be a \npolicy that will not cripple the engines of commerce that fund the \nresearch that will yield environmental protection technologies for the \nfuture.\n  The legislation we are discussing today is the key element in our \neffort to construct a viable energy policy. It will provide a \ntremendous boost to our economy, protect our environment, and create \nhundreds of thousands of jobs. Let me say this again. Passage of this \nbill will provide a tremendous boost to our economy, protect our \nenvironment, and create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  There are four huge reasons that my constituents in Ohio need this \nbill: Ethanol, natural gas, electricity and jobs.\n  The fuel title in this bill will triple the use of renewable fuels \nover the next decade, up to 5 billion gallons by 2012. It will also \nreduce our national trade deficit by more than $34 billion, increase \nthe U.S. gross domestic product by $156 billion by 2012, create more \nthan 214,000 new jobs, expand household incomes by an additional $51.7 \nbillion, and save taxpayers $2 billion annually in reduced Government \nsubsidies due to the creation of new markets for corn. In other words, \nwe will not have to use the subsidies to farms to the tune of $2 \nbillion with this 5 billion gallons of ethanol.\n  The benefits to the farm economy are even more pronounced. Ohio is \nsixth in the Nation in terms of corn production and is among the \nhighest in the Nation in putting ethanol into gas tanks. Over 40 \npercent of all gasoline sold in Ohio contains ethanol.\n  An increase in the use of ethanol across the Nation means an economic \nboost to thousands of farm families across my State.\n  Currently, ethanol production provides 192,000 jobs and $4.5 billion \nto net farm income nationwide. Passage of this bill will increase net \nfarm income by nearly $6 billion. Passage of this bill will create $5.3 \nbillion of new private sector investment in renewable fuel production \ncapacity, and expanding the use of ethanol will also protect our \nenvironment by reducing auto emissions which will mean cleaner air and \nimproved public health.\n  The use of ethanol reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and \nhydrocarbons by 20 percent. The use of ethanol also reduces emissions \nof particulates by 40 percent. The use of ethanol helped move Chicago \ninto attainment of their Federal ozone standard, the only RFG area to \nsee such an improvement.\n  In 2002, ethanol use in the United States reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions by 4.3 million tons. That is the equivalent of removing more \nthan 630,000 vehicles from the roads.\n  Simply stated, this legislation is critical to our farm economy, \nespecially in agricultural States such as Ohio. We need to get this \nbill finished.\n  We are in the midst of a natural gas crisis in the United States. \nOver the last decade, use of natural gas in electricity generation has \nrisen significantly while domestic supplies of natural gas have fallen. \nThe result is predictable: tightening supplies of natural gas, higher \nnatural gas prices, and higher electricity prices.\n  Home heating prices are up dramatically, forcing folks on low incomes \nto choose between heating their homes and paying for other necessities \nsuch as food or medicine.\n  Donald Mason, a commissioner of the Ohio Public Utilities Commission, \ntestified earlier here in Congress:\n\n       In real terms, the home heating cost this winter will \n     increase by at least $220 per household. That might sound not \n     significant, but during the winter season of 2002 to 2001, \n     one gas company in Ohio saw residential nonpayments jump from \n     $10 million a year to $26 million a year.\n\n  As a result of these heating cost increases, 50 percent more \nresidential customers were disconnected from gas service last year than \nin 2001.\n  I have personally seen my own natural gas costs go from $4 an mcf to \nover $8 an mcf. Projections indicate that this winter could be \ndevastating on the elderly and low-income families who are already \nstruggling to survive.\n  At a hearing last year, Thomas Mullen of Catholic Charities and \nHealth and Human Services of Cleveland, OH, described the impact of \nsignificant increases of energy prices on those who are less fortunate.\n  He said:\n\n       In Cleveland, over one-fourth of all children live in \n     poverty and are in a family of a single female head of \n     household. These children suffer further loss of basic needs \n     as their moms are forced to make a choice of whether to pay \n     the rent, or live in a shelter; pay the heating bill, or see \n     their child freeze; buy food, or risk the availability of a \n     hunger center. These are not choices that any senior citizen, \n     child, or for that matter, person in America should make.\n\n  Manufacturers that use natural gas as a feedstock are getting \nhammered due to the doubling and even tripling of their natural gas \ncosts and are either leaving the country or closing their doors.\n\n  Lubrizol, a chemical company located in Wickliffe, OH, which was at a \nmanufacturers' listening session that I conducted a couple of weeks \nago, is moving part of its workforce to France due to the tripling of \nnatural gas prices in Ohio.\n  The president of Zaclon, Inc., a chemical manufacturer based in \nCleveland, testified earlier this year that increased natural gas costs \nhave resulted in loss of sales revenues and increased total energy \ncosts.\n  The president of one major international pharmaceutical company \nstopped by my office--a company that has 22,000 employees in the U.S.--\nand basically said: Unless you do something about natural gas prices, \nwe are moving most of these jobs to Europe.\n  Due to the natural gas crisis, the Dow Chemical Company, which is \nheadquartered in Michigan, will be forced to shut down several plants, \nand they are going to eliminate 3,000 to 4,000 jobs.\n  The American Iron Steel Institute reported that an integrated steel \nmill could pay as much as $73 million for natural gas this year, up \nfrom $37 million last year.\n  An east Texas poultry producer reported that his poultry house \nheating bill jumped from $3,900 to $12,000 in 1 month, forcing him to \ndecide between paying the bank or the gas company.\n  High natural gas prices have resulted in the permanent closure of \nalmost 20 percent of the U.S. nitrogen fertilizer production capacity \nand the idling of an additional 25 percent.\n  The Potash Corporation, one of the world's largest fertilizer \nproducers, has announced layoffs at its Louisiana and Tennessee plants \ndue to high natural gas prices.\n  The company spends $2 million per day on natural gas.\n\n[[Page S15268]]\n\n  I could go on and on and on about the natural gas prices. This bill \nis going to provide more opportunity to increase the supply of natural \ngas and help limit the exacerbating needs for natural gas in this \ncountry because of the fuel switching that is going on. The end result \nis a drag on our economy.\n  Don't take my word for it. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nhas testified before the Senate Energy Committee, the House Energy \nCommittee, the Commerce Committee, and the Congressional Joint Economic \nCommittee on the supply and price of natural gas. He did it this year. \nHe stated:\n\n       I am quite surprised at how little attention the natural \n     gas problem has been getting because it is a very serious \n     problem.\n\n  This Energy bill includes several provisions to increase domestic \nproduction of natural gas and to ensure that we have a healthy, vital \nfuel mix for electric generation.\n  It is vitally important for us to finish this debate and pass this \nbill in order to relieve the pressure on our natural gas supply.\n  This bill helps provide money for clean coal technology and use a \n250-year supply of coal. There are some people in this country who want \nto shut down coal and force our utilities to use more natural gas. This \nbill will increase the use of coal using clean coal technology and take \nthe pressure off of energy companies fuel switching to natural gas.\n\n  Electricity is another issue for the people of Ohio. There has been a \nlot of conversation here on the floor over the last couple of days \nabout the electricity title of the bill. Several of my colleagues have \ntalked about the need to prevent blackouts such as the one we \nexperienced in August. Let me say that as a Senator from Ohio where the \nblackout was triggered, I know about the need to prevent more \nblackouts. In fact, I held a hearing on this exact topic this morning \nin the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee. The electricity \ntitle in this bill explicitly provides the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission with the authority to establish and enforce with penalties \nnew national reliability standards that will be critical in helping to \nprevent future blackouts.\n  For my colleagues who are having a problem with this bill, I remind \nthem that this title is so needed if we are going to prevent future \nblackouts.\n  It also provides the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with new \nauthority to site transmission lines, encourages utilities to invest in \nincreased transmission capacity, and encourages utilities to invest in \nnew clean coal technologies that will allow more electricity to be put \ninto the grid without increasing the pollution put into the air.\n  At the oversight hearing that I held this morning, I asked the panel \nof electricity experts from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, \nthe Department of Energy, and the North American Electric Reliability \nCouncil what we need in order to prevent future blackouts. Their \nresponse was overwhelming: Enact the provisions in the Energy bill, \nespecially the reliability standards.\n  Finally, I want to talk about jobs created by this legislation. The \nEnergy bill saves jobs. It will create nearly 1 million new jobs. The \nEnergy bill will prevent the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, \nlike the jobs lost in the manufacturing sector in the past 3 years, in \npart due to high energy costs, which I have discussed, and the \ndevastating impact it has in my State, particularly manufacturing jobs, \nbut jobs in all sectors, including manufacturing, construction, and \ntechnology.\n  Where are these other jobs going to come from? Natural gas and coal, \nmore than 400,000 direct and indirect new jobs will be created through \nthe construction of the Alaska national gas pipeline, while at the same \ntime bringing an affordable energy supply to the lower 48 States. \nAmerica's substantial investment in clean coal technology creates \n62,000 jobs and ensures Americans new electricity that is abundant, \nreliable, affordable, and cleaner than ever before; 40,000 new \nconstruction jobs created by the construction of approximately 27 large \nclean coal plants; 12,000 full time permit jobs related to plant \noperation; 10,000 research jobs in the fields of math, engineering, \nphysics, and science, with an estimated annual salary of $125,000. A \nlot of the research jobs will be created right in my State of Ohio.\n  The renewable fuel standard in the bill will create more than 214,000 \nnew jobs and expand household income by an additional $51.7 billion \nover the next decade.\n  Building a first of its kind nuclear reactor to cogenerate hydrogen \nwill create 3,000 construction jobs and 500 long-term high-paying, \nhigh-tech jobs.\n  A nuclear production tax credit will spur the construction of \napproximately four light-water nuclear reactors for a total of 6,000 \nmegawatts of clean and affordable energy. This construction will create \nbetween 8,000 and 12,000 jobs. Running the plants will create 6,000 \nhigh-paying, high-tech jobs. The Price-Anderson renewal in this bill \nwill protect 61,800 jobs and 103 plants nationwide.\n  Again, renewables, incentives for geothermal energy will bring \nbetween 300 and 500 megawatts of clean and renewable geothermal energy \non line over the next 3 years that will create between 750 and 1,000 \ndirect jobs and between 7,500 and 10,000 indirect jobs.\n  The fact is, this is a jobs bill. It will also do something else: It \nwill prevent the loss of jobs. Mississippi Chemical and Yazoo City, MS, \nfiled for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May due to financial \nlosses attributed to the combination of depression in the agricultural \nsector and extreme volatility in the domestic natural gas area. In \nother words, plants are shutting down because of the high cost of \nnatural gas. This will produce more natural gas in this country and \ntake the heat off the rising cost of electricity in our country.\n  I have heard a number of my colleagues during the debate savage this \nbill, claiming it will devastate the environment, that it gives oil \ncompanies a free pass for MTBE contamination, and that it contains \nporkbarrel funding for energy companies. Unfortunately, this rhetoric \nis just another example of the old adage, you cannot let the facts get \nin the way of good judgment or a good argument. I will address a few of \nthose most outrageous claims we have heard.\n  The first complaint raised by many of my friends is that the bill is \nbad for the environment. What are the facts? Here are the environmental \nbenefits to this bill. By promoting greater efficiency and cleaner \nenergy technology, the Energy bill will improve air quality, reduce \ngreenhouse gasses, protect our natural resources, and provide a \ncleaner, healthier environment for the American people. The Energy bill \nwill reduce environmental impacts by improving energy efficiency, \nconserving energy, and improving air quality to renew energy efficiency \nstandards for energy-efficient products such as consumer electronics \nand commercial appliances.\n\n  It will provide tax incentives for energy-efficient appliances, \nhybrid and fuel cell vehicles, and combine heat and power products. It \nwill authorize $1.2 billion over the next 3 years for weatherization \nassistance programs to help low-income families to make their homes \nmore energy efficient and permanently reduce their energy bills. And it \nwill increase dramatically the LIHEAP money that we will need during \nthe next couple of years for the poor and the elderly so that they are \nnot literally out in the cold.\n  It expands the use of renewable energy, requiring the Federal \nGovernment to purchase up to 5 percent of its electricity from \nrenewable sources and encouraging the installation of solar panels on \npublic buildings. It increases production of renewable energy \nresources, such as geothermal on Federal and tribal lands. It provides \ntax incentives for production of electricity from renewable energy such \nas wind, solar, biomass, and landfill.\n  Under this bill, the tax credits include $5.6 billion of tax \nincentives for thermal and for solar energy. We are going to see, as \nmany of my colleagues have asked for the last couple of years, a lot \nmore windmills and a lot more solar panels built as a result of this \nlegislation.\n  It reduces the use of oil for transportation. It authorizes over $2.1 \nbillion for the President's Freedom Car and hydrogen fuel initiatives \nto help reduce the use of oil for transportation needs. This is a big \nissue in this piece of legislation. I have heard some of my colleagues \nsay it will not do anything to\n\n[[Page S15269]]\n\nreduce their reliance on oil. I have already talked about the \ncontribution of reducing reliance on oil in terms of renewable fuels \nsuch as ethanol, but what it also does is invests substantial money in \nfuel cells that need to be moved along in this country.\n  As a Senator and as cochairman of the auto caucus, I have been in \nautomobiles powered by hydrogen and that use fuel cells. This bill will \nstart us on the way to a situation where my children, and for sure my \ngrandchildren, will not be using oil to power their motor vehicles. We \nhave to get on with it and get serious.\n  It creates new markets for renewable fuels for transportation such as \nethanol and biodiesel to reduce the dependence on foreign oil. \nExpanding use of cleaner energy technologies is another issue in this \nbill, and modernizing our electricity grid with policies that promote \nthe use of efficient distribution generation combined with heat and \npower and renewable energy technology. It authorizes a 10-year clean \ncoal power initiative to enable the use of plentiful domestic coal \nresources with fewer environmental impacts.\n  It also improves the hydroelectric relicensing process to help \nmaintain this nonemitting source of energy while preserving \nenvironmental goals.\n  The second complaint we have heard about is it contains provisions \nthat give MTBE a free pass from any liability. Now, what are the facts? \nFirst of all, Congress has considered liability protections in a \nvariety of settings, including medical care and educational \ninstitutions. This provision recognizes that when Congress mandates the \nuse of fuel components and when those components have been studied and \napproved by the EPA, it is reasonable to disallow a case where the mere \npresence of a removable system fuel makes it a defective product. The \nsafe harbor provision is intended to offer some protection to refiners \nthat have been required to use oxygenated fuels under the Clean Air \nAct. They are being required to do it. We told them to do it. The safe \nharbor provision will not affect cleanup costs; it will not affect \nclaims based on the wrongful release of renewable fuel into the \nenvironment such as a spill.\n\n  The suggestion is with the spills that are going on, we will not be \nable to sue those people responsible. Anyone harmed by a wrongful \nrelease would retain all rights under current law and would be able to \nrecover cleanup costs just as they do now. Those responsible for \nreleasing oxygenated fuels will be responsible for cleaning them up.\n  Federal and State environmental statutes such as underground storage \ntank laws will still apply if gasoline is released and gets into a well \nor contaminates a drinking water supply.\n  Critics have charged that this bill will throw all MTBE lawsuits out \nof court. They could not be more wrong. The safe harbor only applies to \nproduct liability claims and does not affect any claims that have been \nfiled prior to September 5, 2003. In fact, at a hearing that I chaired \non this topic in March of this year, we spent a significant amount of \ntime discussing current litigation going on in Santa Monica, CA. The \nfacts in this case are pretty clear. MTBE has contaminated the city's \nwater, and the city has had to undergo costly remediation to clean up \nthe contamination.\n  In that litigation it is worth noting that the oil companies have \npaid millions and millions of dollars for the cost of remediation and \nto bring in uncontaminated water to that community. I understand Santa \nMonica litigation is moving forward. Most importantly, this legislation \nwill not change any aspect of that case. It will not cause any claims \nto be kicked out and will most certainly not cause the case to be \ndismissed.\n\n  Let me state this again: The safe harbor does not apply in cases such \nas this. It does not let the oil companies off the hook. It does not \nthrow any litigation out of court. And it does not give anyone a free \npass.\n  Now, a number of my colleagues have come to the floor during this \ndebate and announced they will vote no on this bill because this safe \nharbor provision is contained in the fuels title. These Members are \nannouncing they oppose the ethanol package purely for this reason. \nCynically, I would like to say that, in my opinion, such an \nannouncement is a statement that some of these Members have picked \ntrial lawyers over farmers.\n  The third complaint that critics of this bill have lodged against it \nis that it contains unreasonable handouts for big energy and oil \ncompanies. What were the facts?\n  The authorizations and tax incentives contained in the bill are \ngeared to promote the kinds of energy that our friends across the aisle \nand on this side of the aisle are calling for.\n  The bill includes incentives for renewable energy--$5.6 billion \nworth--such as wind energy, solar energy, and the use of biomass. As I \nmentioned, over 26 percent of all the tax incentives in this bill go to \nrenewable energy.\n  The bill includes incentives for clean-burning natural gas \nproduction.\n  The bill includes incentives for clean coal technologies. These are \nthe technologies that will allow utilities to continue to use coal \nwithout continuing to emit pollution into the air.\n  The bill includes incentives for increased energy efficiency and \nconservation.\n  I would like to read a letter that was sent to Senator Domenici. It \nis from the American Wind Energy Association, the Geothermal Energy \nAssociation, the National Hydropower Association, and the Solar \nIndustries Association:\n\n       Dear Senator, on behalf of the leading renewable energy \n     trade associations, we are writing to urge your support for \n     passage of H.R. 6. H.R. 6 contains several important \n     provisions vital to the future of our industries. Its passage \n     will help expand renewable energy production and spur job \n     growth in the United States in the immediate future. We ask \n     that you support the bill and vote in favor of any cloture \n     motion filed on the conference report.\n\n  What is the downside of promoting clean-burning and renewable energy? \nAren't these the same things that many have been attacking us for not \nincluding in the bill? This criticism is one more example of overheated \nrhetoric that, frankly, does not stand up to scrutiny.\n  If we do not pass this legislation, we will continue to see the \nhemorrhaging of jobs in America, especially in States such as mine, and \nwe will lose all of the potential jobs that I have just outlined.\n  This is the largest jobs bill we have seen on the Senate floor in \ndecades. It is my hope and expectation that the Senate will pass it. \nThese issues have been in front of us for far too long--far too long.\n  Last year, when this was brought up, I spent 6 weeks on the floor of \nthe Senate debating the Energy bill. We finally passed it in the \nSenate, and it died.\n  This year, we started out for 2 or 3 weeks and finally were able to \nenter into a compromise with the other side of the aisle and pass the \nbill that we passed last year so it could go into conference.\n\n  We have worked very hard on this piece of legislation. It is not \nperfect. There are people who have problems with it. But, overall, it \nis a very good piece of legislation. The result of not passing it--God \nonly knows what would happen.\n  For example, this morning, when I had the hearing with the folks who \nare trying to do something about the blackout problem in this country, \nthey indicated the only salvation for them is this Energy bill. They \nsaid: Please pass it, we need it now.\n  If we do not pass it now, then when are we going to get to mandatory \nrenewable standards, with penalties, and get on with making sure we do \nnot have more blackouts in the United States of America?\n  As I said, these issues have been in front of us for too long. Now \nthat we are so close to the finish line, I ask my colleagues to vote \nfor cloture on this bill, prevent a filibuster that will hurt our \neconomy, cost us jobs, and hurt our environment. Most importantly--most \nimportantly--we have never had an energy policy in this country. It is \nlong overdue. It is long overdue. We need to move on with this for the \nfuture of our economy, for our environment, and for our national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate that this debate is now coming to a \nclose, and we\n\n[[Page S15270]]\n\nwill, evidently, vote on cloture tomorrow morning at about 10:30. It \nhas been a long debate. It has been a good debate. I think it has been \nan elucidating debate. I think the longer we debate this bill, the more \nunfavorably it is looked upon by the American people.\n  I would like to make one general comment about the process before \ngetting into the substance of the bill. I have tremendous respect for \nmy friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. He is a fine man. We have \nworked together on legislation. I think he works hard. I think he is \ndedicated.\n  I have a very fond relationship with my former colleague from the \nHouse of Representatives, Congressman Tauzin, head of the House Energy \nCommittee. We came into the Congress together in 1980.\n  But no matter who it is, you cannot negotiate a bill with only two \npeople in the room. Our ranking member from New Mexico, Senator \nBingaman, was excluded. The Democratic side in the House was excluded. \nBut it was not just the Democrats who were excluded; too, too many of \nthe Members were excluded.\n  Why is it that those of us in the Northeast, Democrats and \nRepublicans, think this bill is so bad for our region and our \ncommunities? Well, maybe it is because when you have a Senator from New \nMexico and a Congressman from Louisiana negotiating the whole bill, \nthere is not enough input from other parts of the country.\n\n  The beauty of the system that the Founding Fathers created--and that \nwe have carried forward in our own fashion 215 years later--is that it \nunderstood those things, and it understood that we should not have a \nmajor bill negotiated by two people behind closed doors.\n  The fact that this bill is teetering on the edge of survival right \nnow, I think, in part, is because of the process by which it was \nconstructed. I hope we will not do it again.\n  If we should win our vote tomorrow, those of us who are arguing \nagainst cloture, I hope that the lesson will be learned. I hope we will \nhave real debate and real conference committees.\n  I also hope that, even here, we do not make the same mistake of \npassing last year's bill and then just saying, ``Let it go to \nconference,'' which was a mistake, I think, made on our side as well.\n  The process works. It is long and slow and laborious, but it works.\n  Again, a bill that has so many goodies for so many people--that such \na bill should be teetering on the edge of extinction, I think shows we \nought to go back to the process, the open process, the process that has \nMembers of various parts of the country represented, the process of \ndebate and refinement, because that ends up making better legislation.\n  Now, I have a whole lot to say about this bill, but the hour is late. \nSo I will just put my comments into two categories: one, what the bill \ncontains; and, two, what the bill does not contain--neither of which \nmakes me happy.\n  What the bill contains: There are some good provisions in this bill. \nI am not going to get up here and do a diatribe against these little \nnarrow things that are there for everybody. There are a few in there \nfor my State, too. I think those sometimes are the grease that makes \ngood legislation move forward, but alone they are not enough to carry a \nbill, alone they are not enough to justify a bill.\n  Some of the bad things contained in this bill, as well as some of the \nthings that are so missing from this bill, make a complete case against \nthe bill.\n  To me, the two things that are in the bill that should not be, more \nthan anything else, are the ethanol provisions and the MTBE provisions.\n  On the ethanol provisions, I would say this to my colleagues: We do \nhave to find a substitute for MTBE. We do have to keep our air clean. \nAnd ethanol is a good way to do it. I am not against ethanol per se. \nWhat I am against is mandating ethanol for every region in the country \nwhether it fits or not. Ethanol would be a good standard to meet the \noxygenate requirements in areas where there is abundant corn and \nabundant ethanol manufacturing facilities. But in many regions of the \ncountry, particularly on the coasts, there is not. And there are better \nways to meet the clean air standards.\n  Refiners in my area say that by changing the blend and changing the \nmethod of refining, they can do just that without ethanol. And they \nwill do that to meet the oxygenate clean air standards. But this bill \nhas the nerve--that is the only way you can put it--to require them to \nbuy ethanol anyway or at least buy ethanol credits. I have never quite \nseen anything like it.\n  Ethanol is a very subsidized product with many different types of \nadvantages. Corn growers get all sorts of subsidies. I am not against \nthose subsidies. I think we need to have a farming community. And just \nas we need dairy farmers in New York, we need corn growers in the \nMidwest and other places. But I wouldn't dare require people in the \nMidwest to buy some kind of dairy product made in New York for some \nother purpose. I might subsidize the product and say: Go out in the \nfree market and make it work. But I wouldn't force them to do it. This \ngoes a step beyond anything we have ever done in this Chamber.\n  If we wanted to help the corn growers and we are not helping them \nenough through the Agriculture bill, then let the Government do it. But \nthe ethanol bill says to the traveling salesmen in upstate New York: \nYou are going to do it. It will raise the price of gasoline 4 to 10 \ncents a gallon in my area.\n  How can anyone in this Chamber ask those of us from the Northeast and \nthe West to impose that kind of gas tax on our constituents? It is just \nunfair. It is just wrong. I, for one, resent it. Again, if you want to \nsubsidize the corn growers, do it. But not in this inefficient, unfair, \nregionally slanted way. Therefore, I very much oppose the ethanol \nprovision.\n  My folks can't afford another 4 to 10 cents a gallon, likely to be 7 \nor 8 cents a gallon. Gasoline is high enough. We should be doing things \nto lower the price of gasoline. In that one fell swoop, all the good in \nterms of trying to produce alternative fuels will be undone.\n  Probably even worse in terms of its egregiousness, in terms of its \narrogance, in terms of its nerve, its gall, is the MTBE provision. \nParenthetically, I say to my friend from Ohio who said it doesn't stop \nlawsuits, it certainly does. It doesn't stop lawsuits if the little gas \nstation on the corner was negligent. But if you have lost your home to \nMTBEs, you are not going to get anything out of that little gas \nstation.\n  We know the only way that homeowners are going to get recompense \nhere. It is through the oil companies, the producers of MTBEs. And \nthose suits are prohibited.\n  So it is small comfort to the thousands of citizens in Fort \nMontgomery or in Hyde Park or in Plainview, NY, different communities \nin different parts of our State who have lost use of water in their \nhome.\n\n  This is not just some environmental fetish. I have visited these \nhomes. I feel for these people. Every time your child wants a bath or \nshower, you have to get in the car and drive a mile. You must use \nbottled water. For most of the people I know--these are middle class \npeople, not rich people--the value of their home has been it. All they \nhave been able to do is save for their home, and it is gone.\n  Now you say: Well, we are just going after the oil companies because \nthey have deep pockets. Bunk. The bottom line is, the oil companies \nknew, the producers knew this was harmful. And here is the rub: They \ndidn't tell a soul. It is not simply that they didn't produce it, but \nthey didn't tell a soul. When they sold the gasoline with MTBE to the \ngas station down the street, they didn't say: Be careful. They didn't \nsay: If you sit on top of an aquifer or a well, maybe you shouldn't use \nit. They didn't say: Make sure your tanks don't have leaks because this \nis dangerous stuff if it leaks into the water. They didn't say any of \nthat.\n  Had the oil companies, the MTBE producers, come clean and let people \nknow that this might be harmful and that they ought to take remediation \nthe minute there is a spill and deal with prevention so there wouldn't \nbe spills, we would not be asking that they be sued.\n  The analogy is to the cigarette industry in the sense not that the \nproduct was harmful, not even that people might have known it was \nharmful--that is probably true in each case--but, rather, that it was \nkept secret. It was\n\n[[Page S15271]]\n\nconcealed. People didn't have the ability, the choice, to prevent the \nharm from occurring.\n  The suits have been successful. My friend from Ohio just mentioned \nthe suit in Santa Monica. Hundreds and hundreds of suits like that will \nbe stopped if we pass this legislation.\n  I wish every one of my colleagues had come with me to Fort \nMontgomery, a little community in the hills overlooking the Hudson, a \nfew miles south of West Point. The people there are mostly retired \nsoldiers, not generals, rather, they are captains and majors and \nsergeants. It is a modest community. They worked hard for their country \nand they served their country. All they have is these little homes. And \nlook at their faces. They all gathered one fall afternoon on someone's \nfront lawn and talked to me. They are lovely people. They said: We \ndon't want any money; we are not suing for money.\n  This isn't one of these lawsuits where they say, ``Give us millions \nof dollars,'' and claim some alleged damage. I don't like those \nlawsuits. In fact, right now we are trying to put together a class \naction bill that would make the lawsuits fairer. But the lawsuits were \ntheir recourse. The oil companies were beginning to negotiate with \nthem, either to put filters on their water or to help build a new \nsystem.\n  If this bill passes, these people will have two terrible choices: \nSell their home at maybe the half the value it was a few years back \nbefore MTBE leached into their water supply, or spend thousands and \nthousands and thousands of dollars each year, each taxpayer, to build a \nwhole water system.\n  Who is more to blame? The company that produced the MTBE and didn't \ntell people it was harmful, although they knew it, or these majors and \nsergeants and captains who served their country for years and have lost \njust about everything they have had?\n  That story can be repeated in many parts of New York and many parts \nof California and many parts of New Hampshire and many parts of Iowa \nand many parts of America. We should not allow it to happen.\n  As I said, I am not the leading advocate on our side of the aisle of \nlawsuits as a solution to everything. I would much rather see \ngovernment regulation than lawsuits. But if there was ever a situation \nwhere lawsuits are justified, it is here.\n  What is infuriating is we are giving the MTBE industry $2 billion for \nclosing. My friend talked about the money for LIHEAP. It is good that \nit is in the bill, but it is an authorization. Every time we do the \nappropriations bill, we don't come close to the authorization level. \nThat is not real money. Put that $2 billion into LIHEAP, real money. \nBut here we are, instead, giving it to the MTBE producers for closing \ndown.\n  Do we give money to the little drycleaner shop that has to close down \neven though the blood and sweat and tears of the person who ran it are \nreal? Do we give money to other businesses that have closed down, the \nthousands in my State, because maybe our country has not done enough to \ndefend them from unfair trade practices? No. But not only do we give \nthis industry $2 billion as recompense for closing down, but then we \nprotect them from liability. This bill chooses those companies over \ntens of thousands of innocent homeowners. It is an egregious decision, \nand it shall not pass--if we have anything to do with it.\n\n  Those two provisions are at the top of my list as the most egregious \nin the bill. I will tell you what bothers me just about as much. It is \nnot just what is in the bill, it is what is not in the bill. As \neverybody who has come to the floor to speak has said, we need an \nenergy policy in America. This bill is a hodgepodge of little things, \nwithout much of an energy policy. It is a stitching together of a \ncoalition of individual ideas. I like the tax deductions for the \nrenewables. The reliability provisions don't go far enough, as far as I \nam concerned, but at least there is a step forward there. But there is \nno real energy policy.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 showed us many things, and one thing it showed us \nis that we have to be independent of Middle Eastern oil. The best and \nquickest way to do that is by some measure of conservation, and it is \nMIA in this bill. When China can pass CAFE standards more significant, \nmore stringent than our own, this country is headed for a fall. If we \ncannot tighten our belts now, before there is a crisis, then something \nis wrong with the way our country is governing itself. Yet there is \nvirtually nothing in terms of oil independence and conservation. Even \nthe rather modest provisions that the Senator from Louisiana put in the \nSenate bill are gone. Again, on issue after issue, that occurred--issue \nafter issue after issue.\n  There is no real conservation measures, at a time when we cry out. If \nyou ask experts what is most needed in terms of our energy policy, it \nis conservation. We can increase production, and we can try to do \nexperiments with coal or nuclear or hydrogen or whatever you want, but \nthose are 10, 15 years down the road. We can talk about the timetables. \nI disagree with my friend from Ohio on that. The quickest way to do it \nis by conservation. We are not doing it.\n  Then we have the blackout in the Northeast. It cried out for a \nnational grid to make our electricity system like our highway system, \nwhere the Government has direct and fairly strict oversight of the \nmeans of transportation--in one case of cars, and in another of \nelectricity. And we do the most modest of steps--after we got a huge \nwarning.\n  The report yesterday showed how little oversight there is, how little \ncoordination there is. One energy company in Ohio and one voluntary \norganization in part of Ohio dropped the ball. My view is simple. This \nought to all be done not by the electricity companies, which have a \ndramatic interest against spending the money to make the transmission \nwires work because that is not where they want to make money. It is not \na cost that brings them a big rate of return. We should turn that over \nto FERC and let them set the standards and require the companies to \nmeet it.\n  This bill doesn't come close to that. Once again, a shot across the \nbow, so close to us, and we do virtually nothing. The special \ninterests--the Southeast doesn't want to be part of a national grid. \nFine. They don't want to give up any rights or be governed by rules \nthat might be good for the common good. Fine. The grid provisions here, \nbetter than much of the bill, leave so much to be desired and are \nemblematic of this bill. The special interests say jump and the bill \nsays, How high? No energy policy. And the same with the problems we \nhave had with deregulation and the sale of electricity out in \nCalifornia and in the West. I am not an expert on that, but my \ncolleagues from California and Washington State have talked about that. \nWe are MIA.\n\n  So instead of a coherent energy policy, which the times cry out for, \nwe have a mishmash of goodies, of nods in the direction of the best \nparts of the bill, and away from some very bad things that hurt many \nparts of our country.\n  It is no wonder, Mr. President, that editorial pages across the \ncountry have condemned this bill in a way we have not seen in a long \ntime. There is virtually no division. Frankly, I have not seen one \narticle, one editorial--I have probably missed it--that defends this \nbill. The New York Times--probably the leading liberal editorial page--\nand the Wall Street Journal--the leading conservative editorial page--I \nthink on the same day said, ``Don't vote for this bill.'' And they are \njoined by about everybody in between. That is not just the media \nranting and raving and not understanding the realities, or being too \nmuch in their ivory tower, or on their high horse, which I will be the \nfirst to admit happens all the time. That is because there is something \nwrong with this bill.\n  So it is my view that we are better off going back to the drawing \nboard, open up the process, include the ranking member from New Mexico \nof the committee, and include the members of the committee, debate the \nbill even if it takes a few weeks. I guarantee you that we will get a \nmuch better bill.\n  This bill is an overall negative for what it contains and for what it \ndoesn't. We can and must do a lot better. If we defeat cloture \ntomorrow, we will.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President. I rise to express my strong support for a \ndecision taken over the last several days in South Africa.\n  On Wednesday, South Africa's cabinet approved a plan for government-\nsponsored HIV/AIDS treatment programs. Though late in coming, the \ndecision had to be received as good news by South Africa's five million \npeople infected with HIV. In a country where 600 people a day die of \ncomplications from AIDS, this is a life-saving announcement.\n  Many of us feared we might not ever see this day. In August 2002, I \nsat with President Mbeki in Pretoria. His response to the AIDS crisis \nin his country was disheartening, even disconcerting. But he and his \ngovernment have come a long way.\n  We must be sure that we do our part now, Mr. President. I gather that \nthe Foreign Operations and Labor-HHS conferences have agreed to provide \n$2.4 billion in global AIDS funding for FY 04. That is welcome and \npositive news. But it is still less than we promised the world, and \ngiven that 16,000 people a day contract this deadly virus we cannot \nafford to break that promise again next year.\n  We will also have to take a look at the assumptions that are \nunderlying our current AIDS policy. The President laid out an ambitious \nemergency AIDS program for the 14 countries hit hardest by this virus. \nWith a robust prevention and treatment program coupled with aggressive \nrecruitment, training and retention of qualified medical personnel, we \nwill make a difference in those countries.\n  But this pandemic is moving. While we act aggressively in these 14 \ncountries, we cannot afford to maintain just the status quo in the \ncountries who are threatened with the next wave of this crisis. Recent \nstudies in India suggest that the epidemic in that one country could \nmatch if not overwhelm the suffering we have already seen in Africa. In \nChina, government mismanagement and poverty are contributing to an \nacceleration of the pandemic, and eastern Europe and Russia are seeing \nalarming rates of infection that threaten to overwhelm the weak health \ncare infrastructures in those tenuous democracies.\n  This is a huge challenge. We have begun to take some important steps \nto address it, but we are a long way from done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15272-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15272-S15273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR TOM JURICH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, November 5, 2003, brought many reasons \nfor celebration in Kentucky. First, my friend, Ernie Fletcher was \ncelebrating his victory in the gubernatorial election, making him the \nfirst Republican to hold that office in 32 years. The same day, the \nUniversity of Louisville, my alma mater, was celebrating its acceptance \ninto the Big East Conference. On that day, my local paper, The Courier-\nJournal, highlighted both of these achievements on the front page--a \ngreat day to be a Republican and a Cardinal.\n  The man who orchestrated U of L's rise to the Big East is my friend, \nTom Jurich, the university's athletic director. Since his arrival in \n1997, Tom has worked diligently to improve Louisville's athletic \ndepartment. In recent years, he has hired two outstanding coaches, \nfootball coach Bobby Petrino and basketball coach Rick Pitino. He also \nhas secured U of L's place as one of the top athletic programs in the \ncountry. Tom's hard work and dedication should be commended.\n  I close by quoting Tom from the November 5, 2003 edition of The \nCourier-Journal. He said:\n\n       It's a wonderful day to be a U of L fan. And it's a \n     wonderful day to be a Cardinal student-athlete. But it's a \n     hell of a great day to be the athletic director at the \n     University of Louisville. This has been a six-year work in \n     progress This puts us on a level playing field.\n\n  This U of L alum is one happy fan, and I thank my friend for all he \nhas done for the University of Louisville Athletic Department. I ask \nunanimous consent that the following article from The Courier-Journal \nbe printed in the Congressional Record to document this historic day: \n``Under Tom Jurich, Louisville's star has risen in the East.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Courier-Journal, Nov. 5, 2003]\n\n       Under Tom Jurich, Louisville's Star Has risen in the East\n\n                             (By Pat Forde)\n\n       At 10 o'clock yesterday morning, a wrinkled Big East \n     Conference banner was stretched across a table in Kenny \n     Klein's office at the University of Louisville.\n       The worst-kept secret in college athletics was literally--\n     and finally--on the table. Welcome to a banner day on Planet \n     Red.\n       Klein, the associate athletic director for media relations, \n     is in his 21st year at U of L. He has been a loyal soldier \n     through the glory and the gory--from an NCAA championship to \n     NCAA probation, from the Fiesta Bowl to 1-10. He ranks \n     yesterday among his very proudest days on the job.\n       ``For the whole, encompassing factor of the athletic \n     department and university, it's as big as anything we've \n     done,'' Klein said. ``We're poised to make an absolute leap, \n     I think.\n       ``It's really neat because you work so hard to build \n     something, a total department, and to see it come to fruition \n     is just a great feeling. Until now you've had that little \n     stigma, even though we knew we can compete. The stigma's \n     gone.''\n       After six years of unwavering effort by athletic director \n     Tom Jurich, the stigma is gone. After some of the most \n     skillful, steely and inspired personnel moves in recent \n     college sports history reinvigorated football and men's \n     basketball, the stigma is gone. After a committed campaign to \n     improve U of L's shady NCAA-compliance image, low-budget \n     facilities and neglected non-revenue sports, the stigma is \n     gone.\n       The news that U of L will leave Conference USA in 2005 (at \n     the latest) for the Big East did not pack the focused \n     emotional wallop of beating UCLA in Indianapolis in 1980, \n     Kentucky in Knoxville in '83, Duke in Dallas in '86 or \n     Alabama in Tempe in '91. But those were ephemeral moments, \n     followed (eventually) by hard times. This victory could have \n     a permanent effect on exposure, recruiting, finances and \n     winning--if the Bowl Championship Series situation works \n     itself out.\n       That's a significant ``if,'' but Jurich expressed \n     confidence that the new Big East won't lose its place at the \n     big table. And if there is one thing Cards fans have learned \n     to do, it's to trust Jurich's vision.\n       ``He really had to change the culture for six years to make \n     this happen,'' said senior associate athletic director Julie \n     Hermann. ``This is a benchmark, a defining moment.''\n       The defining moments keep piling up for Jurich. The man who \n     hired John L. Smith, Rick Pitino and Bobby Petrino now has \n     brought the entire athletic department up to a level it has \n     strived to reach forever.\n       Jurich took over on Oct. 21, 1997. Yesterday he jokingly \n     said his first call to Big East headquarters came the \n     following day. In reality he took a few months getting a grip \n     on the U of L program, then put in a call to see where the \n     Cardinals stood.\n       ``It fell on deaf ears,'' he said.\n       There is a cure for deafness: persistence, a plan and the \n     power of Pitino.\n       ``We just kept at it and kept at it,'' Jurich said. ``And \n     when we got Rick, I think the possibilities became a lot \n     clearer.''\n       The possibilities could become crystal-clear probabilities \n     by 2005. Pitino is pointing for a Final Four-level season in \n     2004-05 and could move the Cards immediately to the top of a \n     16-team Big East megaheap. Football coach Bobby Petrino will \n     be in his third year, with a number of today's young talents \n     in starring roles. If the non-revenue sports step up--most \n     notably women's basketball--U of L could enter the Big East \n     on a serious roll.\n       The trajectory of Louisville's climb grew steeper in recent \n     years, but the gradual ascent began decades before. This is a \n     school that once was a member of the Ohio Valley Conference, \n     just another regional athletic program in a state owned by \n     Big Blue. This is a school that once gave away football \n     tickets with a tank of gas at convenience stores, a school \n     that once had non-revenue facilities that would embarrass \n     some high schools.\n       ``It's been a slow progression, but this is a great day for \n     the athletic department,'' U of L trustee and 1970s \n     basketball hero Junior Bridgeman said. ``It's not a \n     culmination, just the next step. But it's a great time, and \n     everyone should share in the joy.''\n       Said Charlie Tyra, a basketball star from the 1950s: ``This \n     is another step in the direction they want to get. Hopefully, \n     this is the big step.''\n       It's big enough to say that Louisville is now officially \n     Big. Big enough for the Big\n\n[[Page S15273]]\n\n     East. Big enough for the big boys of college athletics. Big \n     enough to have something Big Brother in Lexington lacks: \n     membership in what will be the best basketball conference \n     going.\n       This is a league big enough to find on every map. Trips to \n     Hattiesburg, Birmingham and Greenville are out. Philadelphia, \n     Washington and the Big Apple are in.\n       It's big enough to find every March. As recently as 1994, \n     Louisville was playing in the Metro Conference Tournament in \n     the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi. Now it has signed \n     on to play its league tourney on the most famous hardwood in \n     the world at Madison Square Garden.\n       It's big enough to keep a football coach happy. U of L lost \n     the two best it ever had--Howard Schnellenberger and John L. \n     Smith--because of conference affiliation. Today Petrino, a \n     star-in-the-making, believes he has everything he needs to \n     chase what had been unattainable: a national championship.\n       Schnellenberger, Denny Crum and Bill Olsen vaulted \n     Louisville athletics forward dramatically in the 1980s and \n     early '90s. That shouldn't be forgotten today when measuring \n     how far the Cards have come. But by the time Jurich arrived, \n     the school's isolationist athletic stance had outlived its \n     usefulness.\n       As the conference landscape had begun to change, U of L \n     hadn't changed with it. Hogging TV and postseason revenue and \n     pipe-dreaming of football independent status wasn't helping \n     make the Cards an attractive modern program. In fact, it \n     nearly cost them membership in C-USA at a time when, as \n     Jurich pointed out, ``Louisville needed Conference USA much \n     more than Conference USA needed Louisville.''\n       Today Louisville is easily the most vibrant, viable and \n     attractive school in the league. And in 2005 it will commence \n     aiming even higher.\n       You want billboard material? You've got it. Louisville \n     might not be the Best College Sports Town in America, but \n     it's a better one today than it ever has been.\n       Before the official announcement yesterday, Klein stood at \n     a podium in the U of L football complex, preparing to make \n     introductions. Someone flipped a switch, and behind him a \n     projection screen rolled up.\n       Behind the screen was the Big East banner that had been \n     sitting on the table in his office earlier in the day. The \n     symbolic wrinkles had been ironed out. And as the screen \n     rolled up, Klein couldn't help but smile.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15273-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MONA VANNATTER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mona Vannatter. \nOn December 31, 2003, Mona will be retiring after 20 years of service \nat the Kentucky Rural Development State Office.\n  Raised in Anderson, IN, Mona graduated from Ball State University \nwith an associate's degree. However, in 1978, she moved to the \nBluegrass State with her husband, Steve, and their two daughters, \nKristi and Sheri. Though a Hoosier by birth, Mona is a Wildcat at \nheart.\n  In 1983, Mona became the secretary to the State director of the \nKentucky Rural Development State Office. Since that time, she has \nproven to be a dedicated and talented employee. Her colleagues praise \nher as a wonderful representative of the office who genuinely cares \nabout the Kentuckians with whom she interacts. In 2003, Mona was \nrecognized for exemplary performance as secretary to the State \ndirector. For the past several years, she has also donated her time and \nenergy to coordinating the United Way Combined Federal Campaign for the \nagency and successfully reaching the Rural Department goals.\n  Mona brings the same enthusiasm and energy to her life outside of \nwork. An active member of Broadway Christian Church, Mona served as \nsecretary for her Sunday school class and cocoordinator for God's \nPantry. She taught a self-improvement class at the Women's Federal \nPrison Camp, bringing a positive influence and an optimistic outlook to \nthose who need it most.\n  For two decades, she has been a dedicated employee of the Kentucky \nRural Development State Office. Mona continually proves to be a \npositive influence in both her workplace and her community. I ask each \nof my colleagues to join me in thanking Mona Vannatter for all that she \nhas done for her community, the commonwealth of Kentucky, and this \ngreat Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15273-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15273-S15274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a fellow Iowan \nand a great American, CWO4 Bruce A. Smith, who recently gave his life \nin service to his country as a pilot in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Chief \nWarrant Officer Smith was killed on November 2, 2003, after his \nhelicopter was attacked by a surface-to-air missile 40 miles west of \nBaghdad in central Iraq. He is survived by his wife Oliva, his 15-year-\nold daughter Savannah, his 12-year-old son Nathan, his sisters Carol \nand Brenda, and his brother Brian, as well as numerous other family \nmembers, friends, and loved ones. Our deepest sympathies go out to the \nmembers of Chief Warrant Officer Smith's family and to all those who \nhave been touched by his untimely passing.\n  Our Nation's strength resides in the hearts of the men and the women \nwho serve in its defense. The liberties we prize and the freedoms we \ncherish would not exist if it were not for those who courageously risk \ntheir lives while serving in our Nation's Armed Forces. Although our \nhistory books are filled with the names of those great patriots whose \nactions defined our Nation's founding, and although we stand in awe of \nour fathers and our grandfathers for the heroism they displayed during \nthe great wars of the 20th century, from time to time we are reminded \nthat men and women of such stature can still be found defending our \nNation and our way of life.\n  Today, we pay tribute to one such man, CWO4 Bruce A. Smith. Chief \nWarrant Officer Smith enlisted in the Iowa Army National Guard as a \nsenior in high school, serving his Nation with distinction for more \nthan 23 years, first as a medic and then as a pilot, before losing his \nlife in Iraq. Chief Warrant Officer Smith's exemplary career in the \nNational Guard, his commitment to his family, and his sense of duty \nattest to his character as an outstanding American.\n  As I stand before you today to honor a fallen patriot, I would also \nlike to use this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathies to Chief \nWarrant Officer Smith's loved ones. While we share their grief, we \ncannot possibly fully understand their sense of loss. We owe them a \ndebt that can never be repaid and I know they will be in the thoughts \nand prayers of many Americans\n  CWO4 Bruce A. Smith has entered the ranks of our Nation's great \npatriots, and his courage, his dedication to duty, and his sacrifice \nare all testaments to his status as a true American hero. Let us always \nremember Chief Warrant Officer Smith's service to our Nation.\n  I also speak today in honor of a fellow Iowan and a great American, \nSGT Paul F. ``Ringo'' Fisher, who recently gave his life in service to \nhis country as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On November 2, 2003, \nthe helicopter in which Sergeant Fisher was riding was forced to make a \ncrash landing about 40 miles west of Baghdad after being struck by a \nshoulder-fired missile. Sergeant Fisher sustained multiple injuries in \nthe crash, which ultimately led to his death 4 days later on November \n6, 2003, at the Homburg University Klinikum in Homburg, Germany. \nSergeant Fisher is survived by his wife Karen, his stepson Jason, his \nmother Mary, his sister Brenda, and his brother David, as well as \nnumerous other family members, friends, and loved ones.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate and my fellow citizens across our \ngreat Nation to join me today in paying tribute to Sergeant Fisher for \nhis bravery, for his dedication to the cause of freedom, and for his \nsacrifice in defense of the liberties we all so dearly prize. The \nselflessness of a soldier is unmatched in the history of human \nendeavors, and mankind knows no greater act of courage than that \ndisplayed by the individual upon sacrificing his life for his \ncountrymen, their liberty, and their way of life.\n  Although we honor Sergeant Fisher as a fallen patriot, we must also \npay special tribute to his loved ones whose grief we share, but whose \nsense of loss we cannot possibly fully understand. My deepest sympathy \ngoes out to the members of Sergeant Fisher's family, to his friends, \nand to all those who have been touched by his untimely passing. \nAlthough there is nothing I can offer that will ever compensate for \ntheir loss, I hope they will find some comfort in the thoughts and \nprayers of a grateful Nation who will be forever in their debt.\n  Our national history is filled with ordinary men and women who \nsacrificed their lives in service to our country.\n\n[[Page S15274]]\n\nAn avid student of history, Sergeant Fisher enjoyed learning about the \nheroes who preceded him, especially those who brought our Nation \nthrough the great wars of the 20th century. It is thus with great \nsolemnity that we today pay tribute to SGT Paul F. ``Ringo'' Fisher, \nwho has himself attained heroic status, having joined the ranks of our \nNation's greatest patriots and history's most courageous souls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15274-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15274-S15275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD, FDR, FREEDOM FROM FEAR, AND COURTING YOUR GIRL \n                     WITH ANOTHER BOY'S BUBBLE GUM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to take the floor now to \njoin all Senators on both sides of the aisle in extending our warmest \nbirthday wishes to the Senator who in so many ways is respected as Mr. \nUnited States Senate by us all, our friend and eminent colleague from \nthe State of West Virginia, Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd is 86 years young today, with the emphasis on ``young,'' \nbecause he truly is young in the same best sense we regard our Nation \nitself as young, inspiring each new generation to uphold its \nfundamental ideals of freedom and opportunities and justice for all.\n  Senator Byrd's personal story is the very essence of the American \ndream, born to a hard life in the coal mines of West Virginia, rising \nto the high position of majority leader, a copy of the Constitution in \nhis pocket and in his heart, insisting with great eloquence and equally \ngreat determination, day in and day out, year in and year out, that the \nSenate, our Senate, live up to the ideals and responsibilities that \nthose who created the Senate gave us. Washington, Adams, Jefferson, \nMadison, Franklin, Webster, Clay, Calhoun--they each live on today in \nSenator Robert Byrd, and they would be proud of all he has done in our \nday and generation to make the Senate the Senate it is intended to be.\n  On a personal note, I am always very touched on this day in \nremembering the unusual coincidence that Senator Byrd was born on the \nsame day as my brother Robert Kennedy and in the same year as my \nbrother, President Kennedy, and was married on President Kennedy's \nbirthday.\n  In the many years we have served together, he has taught me many \nthins about the Senate, especially how to count votes. He did me one of \nthe biggest favors of my life, although I did not feel that way at the \ntime. On that occasion over 30 years ago, we were each certain we had a \nmajority of democratic votes. We couldn't both be right, and Senator \nByrd was right. All these years later, like so many others among us, I \nstill learn from his eloquence whenever he takes the floor and reminds \nthe Senate to be more vigilant about living up to our constitutional \ntrust.\n  Senator Byrd has received many honors in his brilliant career, and \nthe honor he received last Saturday in Hyde Park in New York was among \nthe highest. He was honored with The Freedom from Fear Award by The \nFranklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute. The award is named for one of \nthe Four Freedoms--freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from \nwant, and freedom from fear--in President Roosevelt's famous State of \nthe Union Address to Congress in 1942, a few weeks after the Second \nWorld War began. The award also harks back to FDR's First Inaugural \nAddress in 1933, in which he rallied the Nation from the depths of the \nGreat Depression with the famous words, ``The only thing we have to \nfear is fear itself.''\n  In his address accepting the award, Senator Byrd emphasized the \nimportance of renewing our dedication to the Nation's ideals in the \nvery difficult times we face today, when the temptations are so great \nonce again to put aside our freedoms in order to safeguard our \nsecurity. As Senator Byrd said so eloquently, in a lesson each of us \nshould hear and heed:\n\n       Carry high the banner of this Republic, else we fall into \n     the traps of censorship and repression. The darkness of fear \n     must never be allowed to extinguish the precious light of \n     liberty.\n\n  Senator Byrd's address in Hyde Park also contains a very beautiful \nand moving passage about the person who has been his lifelong best \nfriend and strongest supporter all through these years, the coal \nminer's daughter he married 66 years ago, his wife Erma.\n  I wish them both many, many happy returns on this special day, and I \nask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd's extraordinary address on \nreceiving the Roosevelt ``Freedom from Fear'' Award be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Courage from Conviction\n\n       I thank Ann Roosevelt and William ``Bill'' vanden Heuvel \n     (the Great!) and the Board of the Roosevelt Institute for \n     this distinct, unique honor. I also thank my colleague, a \n     colleague sui generis. Yes, Senator Hillary Clinton came to \n     my office and she said that she wanted to be a good senator. \n     And she said, ``How shall I do it? How shall I go about it? I \n     want to work for the people of New York. I want to be a good \n     senator.'' And I did say, ``Be a work horse, not a show \n     horse.'' She took that to heart, and she has been a fine \n     senator. She has never forgotten that admonition. She has \n     been a good senator and I am delighted to be here in her \n     state this morning. This is an extraordinary award, for which \n     she recommended me so graciously.\n       I am humbled to be deemed a practitioner of President \n     Roosevelt's great vision. I am proud to be associated once \n     again with my friend and quondam colleague, former Senator \n     and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. Ah, what a shame, \n     as we have witnessed the lowering of the Senate's standards. \n     And how proud I would be to be able to vote for a great \n     federal judge to grace the Supreme Court of the United \n     States, George Mitchell. I would have no doubt that he would \n     honor this Constitution of the United States of America. And \n     I hope that, I trust that, the Great Physician, the Great \n     Lawgiver, might bless me so that I might live to see that \n     day.\n       I congratulate the other exceptional laureates, and I am \n     proud to be their colleague. I am proud to be numbered with \n     the previous Four Freedom recipients.\n       Franklin Delano Roosevelt--ah, the voice! I can hear it. I \n     can hear it yet as it wafted its way through the valleys, up \n     the creeks and down the hollows in the coal camps of Southern \n     West Virginia. That voice--there was nothing like it. \n     Franklin Roosevelt was a man of tremendous courage. A leader \n     of uncommon vision and optimism. An orator of compelling \n     passion. He looms large, oh so large, in my boyhood memory. I \n     grew up in the home a of coal miner. I married a coal miner's \n     daughter. I thank her today for her guidance, her advice, her \n     constant confidence in me that she has always shown.\n       Studs (Terkel), I tell you how I won the hand of that coal \n     miner's daughter some 66 years ago. We had in my high school \n     class a lad named Julius Takach. He was of a Hungarian \n     family. His father owned a little store down in Cooktown, \n     about 4 miles from Stotesbury, where I grew up. And each \n     morning, Julius Takach would come to school with his pockets \n     full of candy and chewing gum from his father's store's \n     shelves. I always made it my business to greet Julius Takach \n     at the schoolhouse door upon his arrival! And he would give \n     me some of that candy and chewing gum. I never ate the candy. \n     I never chewed the chewing gum. I proudly walked the halls of \n     Mark Twain High School to see my sweetheart as the classes \n     changed, and I gave her that candy and chewing gum. Now do \n     you think I told her that Julius Takach gave me that candy \n     and that chewing gum? Why, no! Studs, that's how you court \n     your girl with another boy's bubble gum!\n       The stock market crashed in October 1929. I was 12 years \n     old. I had $7 that I had saved up selling the Cincinnati \n     Post. I had that $7 in the bank at Matoaka, West Virginia. \n     The bank went under, and I haven't seen my $7 since. I \n     struggled to find my first job working at a gas station \n     during the Great Depression. I was 24 when the Japanese \n     bombed Pearl Harbor.\n       I can remember the voice of President Roosevelt on the \n     radio in those days. His voice carried over the crackle and \n     static of my family's old Philco set. President Roosevelt \n     understood the nation. He understood its history. He \n     understood its character, its ethos. He understood the \n     Constitution. He respected the Constitution.\n       In Marietta, Ohio, in 1938, President Franklin Delano \n     Roosevelt said: ``Let us not be afraid to help each other--\n     let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an \n     alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are \n     not a President and senators and congressmen and government \n     officials, but the voters of this country.'' President \n     Roosevelt was right.\n       Especially in these days, when we find ourselves in \n     dangerous waters, I remind the nation of President's \n     Roosevelt's charge: the government is ourselves. I have \n     called on my colleagues in Congress to stand as the Framers \n     intended.\n\n     I saw them tearing a building down\n     A group of men in a busy town\n     With a ``Ho, Heave, Ho'' and a lusty yell\n     They swung a beam and the sidewall fell.\n\n     I said to the foreman, ``Are these men skilled?\n     The type you would hire if you had to build?''\n     He laughed, and then he said, ``No indeed,\n     Just common labor is all I need;\n     I can easily wreck in a day or two,\n     That which takes builders years to do.''\n\n\n[[Page S15275]]\n\n\n     I said to myself as I walked away,\n     ``Which of these roles am I trying to play?\n     Am I a builder who works with care,\n     Building my life by the rule and square?\n     Am I shaping my deeds by a well-laid plan,\n     Patiently building the best I can?\n     Or am I a wrecker who walks the town\n     Content with the labor of tearing down?''\n\n       That's what we see today. I call on my colleagues to stand \n     as the Framers intended, as a check against an overreaching \n     executive. I have urged the people of America to awaken to \n     what is happening and to speak out against those who would \n     tear down the fabric of Constitutional liberty. To speak out, \n     for it is the duty of each citizen to be vigilant to what his \n     or her government is doing, and to be critical, if need be. \n     It is not unpatriotic to speak out. It is not unpatriotic to \n     ask questions. It is not unpatriotic to disagree. Speak out, \n     lest the right of dissent, the right to disagree, be trampled \n     underfoot by misguided zealotry and extreme partisanship.\n       I have been in Congress now close to 51 years, longer than \n     any other person--out of 11,707 individual persons who have \n     served in the House or Senate or both--with the exception of \n     two. And I have never seen such extreme partisanship; such \n     bitter partisanship; such forgetfulness of the faith of our \n     fathers, and of the Constitution. Never have I seen the equal \n     of what I have seen in these last three years.\n       But let us not fear. The individual mind remains an \n     unassailable force. The individual voice can inspire other to \n     act. A single act of bravery can lead an army against great \n     odds. At a time when dissent is labeled unpatriotic, the \n     strength of a single individual can give hope to the \n     hopeless, voice to the voiceless, power to the powerless.\n       ``The iron will of one stout heart shall make a thousand \n     quail. A feeble dwarf, dauntlessly resolved, will return the \n     tide of battle, and rally to nobler strife the giants that \n     had fled (Martin F. Tupper, 1810-1889).''\n       During these troubled times, the legacy of Franklin Eleanor \n     Roosevelt is not forgotten. Again, I thank Ann Roosevelt and \n     the inimitable William vanden Heuvel (the Great!), and the \n     Board of the Roosevelt Institute for this great honor. I \n     thank again my protege in whom I have great pride, Senator \n     Hillary Clinton. And I thank each of you here this morning. \n     This day has inspired me to carry on with new energy.\n       I close with words from President Roosevelt's first \n     inaugural address: ``[T]he only thing we have to fear is fear \n     itself--nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which \n     paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.''\n       If I may be so bold as to add, let us take courage from \n     conviction. Carry high the banner of this Republic, else we \n     fall into the trap of censorship and repression. The darkness \n     of fear must never be allowed to extinguish the precious \n     light of liberty.\n       May we remember the words of the Scripture (Proverbs \n     22:28): ``Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers \n     have set.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15275-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EXPANSION OF NATIONAL SECURITY LETTER AUTHORITY IN INTELLIGENCE \n                 AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday saw passage of yet another \nexample of this Administration's secret efforts to further expand \nsecret powers of the FBI. The FBI can now use National Security \nLetters, NSLs, which do not require approval by a court, grand jury, or \nprosecuting attorney, to demand confidential financial records from car \ndealers, pawn brokers, travel and real estate agents, and other \nbusinesses, and to prohibit the business from disclosing that the \nrecords have been sought or obtained.\n  There is no requirement that the FBI demonstrate a need for such \nrecords. It need only assert that the records are ``sought for'' an \nintelligence or terrorism investigation. Nor are there sufficient \nlimits on what the FBI may do with the records or how it must store \nthem. For example, information obtained through NSLs may be stored \nelectronically and used for large-scale data mining operations.\n  Congress last expanded the FBI's NSL authority in October 2001, as \npart of the comprehensive antiterrorism package known as the USA \nPATRIOT Act. Incredibly, the Intelligence Committee forced passage of \nthis latest expansion without consulting the Judiciary Committee, which \noversees both the FBI and the implementation of the PATRIOT Act. \nIndeed, the Committee is in the midst of holding a series of oversight \nhearings on the PATRIOT Act, including the very provision that has now \nbeen significantly modified.\n  What is even more incredible is the fact that this very provision is \nthe target of sunset legislation that I and other members of the \nJudiciary Committee, both Democratic and Republican, have introduced. \nThere is no doubt that we would have meaningfully and thoroughly \nexplored further expansion of the NSL authority had we been given the \nopportunity to do so.\n  This is what the new law has done. Under the PATRIOT Act, the FBI was \npermitted to use NSLs to obtain records from banks and other similar \nfinancial institutions if they were ``sought for'' an intelligence or \nterrorism investigation. Now the term ``financial institution'' has \nbeen expanded to include a host of other businesses that have nothing \nto do with the business of banking, and the term ``financial record'' \nhas been expanded to include any record held by any such business that \npertains to a customer.\n  The FBI has long had the power to obtain this sort of information, \nwhether through a judicial subpoena or a search warrant. But with the \nstealth amendment of the NSL authority, the FBI can now obtain a vast \namount of personal and highly confidential information without \nobtaining court approval, and without any other independent check on \nthe validity or scope of the inquiry. The privacy rights of all \nAmericans have been compromised as a result.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15275-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

My home State of Oregon has also lost a \ncitizen to this form of hatred. In August 2001, Lorenzo ``Loni'' \nOkaruru died after being savagely beaten about the head and face with a \nblunt instrument. Detectives believe that the crime was most likely \ncommitted by a man who picked up Okaruru, who he thought was a women, \nand was angered to find out Okaruru was a biological male. Law \nenforcement officials believe that Okaruru was killed because of his \nsexual orientation and gender identity and have classified the crime as \na hate crime. The Portland community and civil rights groups rallied \ntogether to denounce this horrible crime.\n  I believe that Government's first duty to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15275-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15275-S15278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONSEQUENCES OF THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT FOCUS ON STUDENT TESTING\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this month public school students around \nWisconsin are sharpening their No. 2 pencils and settling in to take a \nseries of annual tests called the Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts \nExaminations. These exams, given to students in grades four, eight, and \nten, test students' knowledge of reading, language arts, math, science, \nand social studies.\n  These tests--and their results--have taken on new meaning for schools \naround my State as students and teachers in Wisconsin settle into their \nsecond school year under the No Child Left Behind Act. This law, the \ncenterpiece of the President's domestic agenda, requires that students \nin grades three through eight and in one high school grade be tested \nannually in reading and math beginning in the 2005-2006 school year, \nwith annual science tests to be added 2 years later. Thus, Wisconsin \nwill be required to expand the WKCEs, and the already-existing annual \nthird grade Wisconsin Reading Comprehension Test, to include new \nreading tests for students in grades five, six and seven; and new math \ntests for students in grades three, five, six, and seven.\n  As I travel around Wisconsin, I hear time and again from frustrated \nparents, teachers, administrators, and school board members about their \nconcerns with the ongoing implementation of the NCLB. I began to hear \nsuch comments more than 2 years ago when the President first proposed \nhis education\n\n[[Page S15276]]\n\ninitiative, and this drumbeat of concern has increased as my \nconstituents continue to learn first-hand what this new law means for \nthem and for their students and children. While Wisconsinites support \nholding schools accountable for results, they are concerned about the \nfocus on standardized testing included in the President's approach.\n  I opposed the President's education bill in large part because of \nthis new annual testing mandate. The comments I have heard from people \nacross Wisconsin about this new program have been almost universally \nnegative. Parents, teachers, administrators, and others in the \neducation community have told me that they are concerned about the \neffect that over-testing will have on Wisconsin's public school \nstudents. They oppose another layer of federally mandated testing for \nmany reasons, including the cost of developing and implementing the \nadditional tests, the loss of teaching time every year to prepare for \nand take the tests, and the unnecessary pressure that these additional \ntests will place on students, teachers, schools, and school districts.\n  The pressure to do well on annual tests is already weighing on the \nteachers and schools in Wisconsin, even with 2 years to go before the \nadditional tests are required. The stakes are very high for schools and \nschool districts. The results on these annual tests are a central part \nof the complicated formula that determines whether a school is meeting \nor exceeding its ``adequate yearly progress'' goals. Failure to meet \nAYP goals in two or more consecutive years will lead to sanctions for \nthe schools and districts in question. I have heard from many \nconstituents about the complex AYP system, and what being determined to \nbe a ``school in need of improvement'' or a school that ``has not met \nAYP'' will mean for--and how these designations will be interpreted \nby--parents, students, school personnel, and the general public.\n  In order to measure AYP, Wisconsin and other States are required \nunder NCLB to look at four indicators for each school and district: \ntest participation, graduation and attendance criteria, reading \nachievement, and math achievement. Three of these four criteria are \nbased on the annual standardized tests. This is troubling because the \nfuture of individual schools and school districts is riding on student \nparticipation in and success on just two exams--reading and math. These \ncore subjects are important, to be sure, but I am concerned that this \nexclusive focus on testing--which is a top-down mandate from the \nFederal Government--may be detrimental to the successful education of \nour children, who could benefit from a more flexible approach.\n  As a recent editorial in the La Crosse Tribune points out, ``the \nstakes on the schools are high. Buy what about students? The test \nresult doesn't appear on their transcript and it doesn't count toward a \ngrade or graduation.'' And what if a student had a bad day? Or what if \nthe required amount of students don't take the tests, and the school \nfails to meet the 95 percent participation rate required by the NCLB? A \nmissed participation rate 2 years in a row would mean that the school \nis ``in need of improvement,'' even if the students who took the tests \ndid well on them.\n  In addition, some of my constituents are concerned about the value of \nthese tests to students, parents, and teachers. According to one \nteacher, the existing tests don't have any meaning to students and have \nlittle meaning to classroom teachers. And the Federal Government has \nmandated that students take even more tests without developing a system \nthat makes these new tests, or the existing ones for that matter, \nmeaningful to students.\n  The impact of these standardized tests on students varies. Some \nstudents already have test anxiety and that anxiety may well increase \nunnecessarily. As the stakes increase for schools, the increased stress \nlevel is sure to filter down from administrators to teachers to \nstudents. For example, members of the Wisconsin School Counselors \nAssociation told me that they have been handing out apple-shaped \n``stress balls'' for anxious third graders to squeeze while taking \ntheir reading tests.\n  While some students experience stress out about tests, others simply \ndo not care about the tests at all, and fill in random answers or turn \nin blank test sheets--after all, there's no penalty if they do so. For \nstudents who are struggling, however, a low test score on a \nstandardized test can be demoralizing. According to one Wisconsin \nteacher, ``Students are being evaluated on one single test. What if the \nstudent has a bad day? . . . [T]he truly scary part is that \nstandardized tests ensure that half of our students will always be \n'below average.' How can we meet the benchmark that everyone will score \nproficient and advanced when the tests are designed to never let that \nhappen? . . . Taking more tests is not going to improve learning.''\n  Most students, of course, try their best. But they are confused about \nwhy they are taking tests that do not count toward their grades, and \nmany students and parents are confused by the results of these tests.\n  With the stakes rising for schools and districts, some schools in \nWisconsin have resorted to offering what amounts to bribes to encourage \nthe students to participate in the WKCEs and to do well on them. Since \nthe tests have little consequences for individual students, but very \nserious consequences for schools and districts, some schools are \npulling out all of the stops to get students to take these tests \nseriously.\n  According to a recent article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, some \nschools are offering prizes to students who show up and complete their \nexams. These prizes range from movie tickets to gift certificates for a \nlocal mall to big ticket items such as a television and a DVD player. \nSome schools are offering exemptions from end-of-semester exams for \nstudents who do well on the WKCEs. One elementary school is promising \nstudents additional recess periods, snacks, and movies. One teacher \ntold my staff that her school is allowing students to engage in one of \nthe ultimate school no-nos chewing gum in the classroom in order to \nhelp to relieve the stress of taking the tests.\n  I will ask that the complete text of the two articles that I have \nreferenced be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, schools in my State are already feeling the pressure \nto compel students to participate in and succeed on annual tests 2 \nyears before the additional, federally mandated tests are added to the \nmix. I am concerned about the implications that this pressure, and the \nresulting scramble to get students to take these tests seriously, will \nhave on public education in my State. I am not saying that schools \nshould not be required to be successful or to show improvement in \nstudent performance. Of course, all schools should strive to ensure \nthat they are successful and that their students show improvement.\n\n  But these examples from my State are clear evidence of one of the \nbasic problems with the NCLB--its exclusive focus on test scores as the \nmain measure of student achievement. When schools feel compelled to \nhand out goodies to get students to take tests seriously, those tests \nare not serving their intended purpose. Certainly, tests have their \nplace in education. But tests should be used as one of multiple \nmeasures of student achievement, not as the sole means of determining \nthe success or failure of a school.\n  I am extremely concerned that the new Federal testing mandate will \nnot achieve the desired result of better schools with qualified \nteachers and successful students. I fear that this new mandate will \ncurtail actual teaching time and real learning in favor of an \nenvironment where teaching to the test becomes the norm. The \nunfortunate result of this would be to show our children that education \nis not about preparing for their futures, but rather about preparing \nfor tests--that education is really about sharp No. 2 pencils and test \nsheets, about making sure that little round bubbles are filled in \ncompletely, and, if their school districts and States have enough \nmoney, maybe about exam booklets for short answer and essay questions. \nI am also deeply concerned that this focus on testing will rob teachers \nof valuable teaching time and will squelch efforts to be innovative and \ncreative, both with lesson plans and with ways of measuring student \nperformance.\n  For these reasons, earlier this year I introduced the Student Testing \nFlexibility Act, a bill that would return a\n\n[[Page S15277]]\n\nmeasure of the local control that was taken from States and local \nschool districts with the enactment of the NCLB. This bill would allow \nStates and school districts that have demonstrated academic success for \n2 consecutive years the flexibility to apply to waive the new annual \ntesting requirements in the NCLB. States and school districts with \nwaivers would still be required to administer high-quality tests to \nstudents in, at a minimum, reading or language arts and mathematics at \nleast once in grades 3-5, 6-9, and 10-12 as required under the law.\n  This bill is cosponsored by Senators Jeffords, Dayton, and Leahy. I \nam pleased that this legislation is supported by the American \nAssociation of School Administrators; the National Education \nAssociation; National PTA; the National Association of Elementary \nSchool Principals; the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals; the School Social Work Association of America; the National \nCouncil of Teachers of English; the Wisconsin Department of Public \nInstruction; the Wisconsin Education Association Council; the Wisconsin \nAssociation of School Boards; the Milwaukee Teachers' Education \nAssociation; the Wisconsin School Social Workers Association; and the \nWisconsin School Administrators Alliance, which includes the \nAssociation of Wisconsin School Administrators, the Wisconsin \nAssociation of School District Administrators, the Wisconsin \nAssociation of School Business Officials, and the Wisconsin Council for \nAdministrators of Special Services.\n  I would also like to take a moment to discuss the recently released \nNational Assessment on Educational Progress scores. In addition to a \nmassive new annual testing requirement, the NCLB also requires States \nto participate in the previously voluntary NAEP tests for fourth grade \nreading and math, which are given every 2 years. Proponents of high-\nstakes testing argue that NAEP participation will help to ensure that \nthe results of State-administered tests are valid, and that States are \nnot ``dumbing down'' their tests in order to avoid Federal sanctions.\n  The NAEP scores that were released last week are the results of the \nfirst round of required testing under the NCLB, and, for the first \ntime, include scores from all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and \n2 schools run by the Department of Defense. While the nation-wide test \nresults are an improvement over the NAEP administered 2 years ago, I am \ndeeply concerned about the lingering racial disparities in the test \nresults.\n  I am particularly concerned that the test scores for the \napproximately 25,000 Wisconsin eighth graders who took this test lead \nthe Nation in the gap between White and African-American students on \nboth the reading and the math tests. While the NAEP was taken by only a \nsmall percentage of students in my State and around the country, we \ncannot ignore the racial disparities in the test scores and the need to \ndo more to ensure that all students have an equal opportunity for a \nquality education.\n  The Secretary of Education heralded the NAEP results, saying, ``These \nresults show that the education revolution that No Child Left Behind \npromised has begun.'' If these test scores prove anything, it is that \ntoo many children are being left behind. Study after study has shown \nthat disadvantaged students lag behind their peers on standardized \ntests.\n  I regret that the President and the Congress have not done more to \nensure that schools have the resources to help these students catch up \nwith their peers before students are required to take additional annual \ntests that will have serious consequences for their schools. If we fail \nto provide adequate resources to these schools and these students, we \nrun the risk of setting disadvantaged children up for failure on these \ntests--failure which could damage the self-esteem of our most \nvulnerable students.\n  Instead of focusing resources on those students and schools needing \nthe most help, I am afraid that the testing provisions in the \nPresident's bill will punish those very schools with sanctions that \nwill actually take badly needed funding away from them.\n  I would like to note that my constituents have raised a number of \nother concerns about the NCLB that I hope will be addressed by \nCongress. I continue to hear about complex guidelines and a lack of \nflexibility from the Department of Education. I hear about the unique \nchallenges that the new tutoring, public school transfer, and other \nrequirements pose for rural districts. My constituents often ask when \nthe Federal Government is going to provide the funding it promised for \neducation programs. I share my constituents' concern about imposing new \nsanctions on schools that do not meet yearly goals even though the \nprograms that would help students and schools to meet those goals are \nnot fully funded.\n  I will continue to monitor closely the implementation of the NCLB and \nits effect on public school students in Wisconsin.\n  I ask unanimous consent the articles to which I referred be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Nov. 9, 2003]\n\n                        Take a Test, Get a Prize\n\n                            (By Amy Hetzner)\n\n       Some day soon, teams of Case High School sophomores could \n     be sitting in a Racine movie theater and thanking President \n     Bush.\n       In an attempt to boost the number of students taking the \n     State's standardized test this week, Case High School will be \n     handing out movie passes to every 10th-grader who completes \n     the battery of exams.\n       It's just one of many efforts, which include a TV giveaway \n     at another school, to improve student performance and \n     participation on the Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts \n     Examinations, or WKCEs.\n       In many Wisconsin schools, the testing began for fourth-, \n     eighth- and 10th-graders last week and will continue until \n     Nov. 21. The tests cover reading, language arts, mathematics, \n     science and social studies.\n       If nothing else, the new incentives show the growing \n     importance that President Bush's No Child Left Behind Act has \n     placed on annual state testing.\n       If students slip up, they could cause their school to be \n     labeled as needing improvement and sent on a path to \n     escalating sanctions imposed by the Federal law. If, for \n     example, less than 95% of students take the tests two years \n     in a row, a school may have to allow students to transfer \n     elsewhere.\n       But the students themselves have little incentive to put \n     forward an effort. The exam doesn't count toward a grade or \n     graduation and won't appear on any transcript.\n       As Larry Black, principal of Big Foot High School in \n     Walworth, puts it: ``For schools, they're high-stakes tests. \n     For students, they're low stakes. .  .  . And that's a bad \n     match.''\n\n\n                        Rolling out the rewards\n\n       To help surmount that obstacle and hopefully avoid being \n     labeled for improvement, two Racine high schools are rolling \n     out the rewards just to get students to take the tests.\n       In addition to free movie passes, Case students can qualify \n     for $10 cash awards, Regency Mall gift certificates, school-\n     spirit wear and other prizes--simply by showing up this week \n     and answering the exam's questions.\n       At Racine's Horlick High School, the goodies are even \n     bigger. The school is planning several raffles for each of \n     the two days of testing this week, at which students can \n     win a television set, DVD player and CDs, Principal Nola \n     Starling-Ratliff said.\n       The incentives are geared to increase both schools' test \n     participation rates, which last year fell below the required \n     95% of students.\n       Miss that goal for a second year and both schools would \n     have to allow students to transfer to other district schools \n     under the federal law. A third year of missing their target \n     would force the schools to offer extra tutoring in math and \n     reading.\n       The high schools facing the threat of sanctions aren't the \n     only ones proffering perks this year, however.\n       Gifford Elementary School in Racine also dangled the \n     prospect of an extra recess, movie privileges and anonymous \n     treats before any fourth-grade class that had perfect \n     attendance during the week of testing.\n       ``It's made a huge difference,'' Gifford Principal Steve \n     Russo said. ``Every morning we talk about testing with the \n     kids. We encourage them to do the best job, to take pride in \n     their work.''\n\n\n                       critic pans reward system\n\n       But Alfie Kohn, a national opponent of high-stakes testing, \n     called such rewards ``coercive'' and ``disrespectful'' toward \n     students. ``Even if higher test scores were a good idea, you \n     don't treat children like pets by dangling the equivalent of \n     doggie biscuits before them when they perform to your \n     liking,'' said Kohn, a Massachusetts-based author of the \n     book, ``Punished by Rewards.''\n       School officials, however, say there's nothing wrong with \n     giving students a little push.\n       Five years ago at Arrowhead High School in Waukesha County, \n     test scores took a serious dip when about 80 sophomores \n     refused to complete the exams, instead turning in blank forms \n     in protest of a test they felt was meaningless. If a school's \n     students were to do the same today, their action could have\n\n[[Page S15278]]\n\n     more serious consequences for their school in addition to \n     giving it a public black eye.\n       ``We never want to fall into the category where the \n     school's `in need of improvement' just because students \n     didn't take the test seriously,'' said Arrowhead \n     Superintendent David Lodes.\n\n\n                            a reason to try\n\n       So this year, Arrowhead will give its students a reason not \n     only to take the test but also to try.\n       The school is offering its students a chance to skip final \n     semester examinations in their regular classes if they do \n     well on their WKCEs--scoring at least at the proficient or \n     advanced level in the subject area that corresponds with the \n     class exam they want to avoid.\n       It's the first year Arrowhead High School has made such an \n     offer, which has been announced to students but is still \n     waiting for formal approval from the School Board.\n       Arrowhead students who do exceptionally well on the WKCE--\n     scoring at the advanced level on all the tests--also will be \n     allowed to spend their junior-year study hall classes in the \n     senior commons in the pilot effort.\n       Other schools in the state offering exam exemptions include \n     Big Foot High School, Hartford Union High School and Pulaski \n     High School near Green Bay. Bay Port High School in the \n     Howard-Suamico School District gives students a chance to \n     drop a low-scoring test with a proficient score in the \n     subject area.\n       ``I think we should be able to come up with a way where we \n     can get our students to give their best effort,'' Lodes \n     said. ``Everybody needs to do as best as they possibly \n     can. Yet everybody wants to be rewarded.''\n       Arrowhead students say they can see a difference.\n       ``I'm actually trying a little harder now,'' said Zack \n     Olson, a 15-year-old sophomore at Arrowhead, where testing \n     began last week.\n       Previously, Olson said he might not have studied for the \n     test at all. But with the lure of getting out of final exams \n     and a nicer study hall environment, he said he's been doing \n     the practice work that teachers have offered.\n       Another Arrowhead sophomore, Adam Moir, said he was even a \n     little nervous the night before testing began because he \n     wasn't sure what to expect.\n       He said a lot of students will be motivated to try to get \n     out of their final exams. ``But, in the same way, there are \n     some students that could care less about school,'' Moir said. \n     ``I'm not one of them.''\n\n                      [From the La Crosse Tribune]\n\n           Our View: Make Federal Testing Fit With Curriculum\n\n                      (By Tribune editorial staff)\n\n       Why are some school districts offering movie tickets and \n     other prizes as an inducement to take the tests required \n     under President Bush's ``No Child Left Behind'' law?\n       They are doing it because students have little incentive to \n     participate in the testing, even though a bad result can \n     result in a Federal Government listing as a failed school.\n       Under the Federal legislation, schools are required to \n     subject students to testing once a year. If students do not \n     participate, the school could face sanctions. For instance, \n     if less than 95 percent of the students show up for testing \n     two years in a row, the school could have to allow students \n     to transfer elsewhere.\n       So, the stakes on the schools are high. But what about \n     students? The test result doesn't appear on their transcript \n     and it doesn't count toward a grade or graduation.\n       A story in Sunday's Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said that \n     the Racine, Wis., School District gives away movie tickets to \n     get kids to show up. Another, unnamed, district is giving \n     away a television set. Still another district--Arrowhead \n     schools in Hartland, Wis., is letting students who take the \n     test opt out of some final exams.\n       None of this sounds like it is educationally sound, but \n     school administrators say they have little other incentive to \n     get students to take the test. Isn't there a better way to \n     judge school performance than using a test that has no other \n     meaning than providing a potential for Federal punishment? \n     Are there no other valid measurements of student performance?\n       Giving prizes as an inducement to take a test seems of \n     dubious value. But maybe we ought to be looking for ways to \n     reconcile the federal government's need for performance data \n     with schools' existing curriculum and practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15278-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SYRIA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, the Syria Accountability and \nLebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act takes important and valuable \nsteps, and I would have voted for it had I been present, but I am \nconcerned that it may not go far enough.\n  Syria has long been recognized as a state sponsor of terrorism. In \nfact, the Syrians themselves openly speak of their support for \nterrorist organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Palestinian \nIslamic Jihad. Intelligence reports and terrorism experts tell us that \nthe next generation of terrorists is being trained in a network of \ntraining facilities that exist in Syria and the Syrian-controlled parts \nof Lebanon. These international terrorist organizations that run these \ncamps already have the capacity to kill Americans, and they have state \nsponsors with access to weapons of mass destruction. Prior to 9/11, \nHezbollah was responsible for the deaths of more Americans than any \nother terrorist group.\n  On September 18, 2001, the Senate passed S.J. Res 23, which \nauthorized the President to use ``all necessary and appropriate force'' \nagainst those responsible for the attacks of 9/11. This authorization \nfor the use of force is therefore limited to al-Qaeda. We ignore other \nterrorist networks at our peril--and at one point, President Bush \nrecognized that. Nine days after the terrorist attack of September 11, \nthe President declared:\n  ``Our war on terror begins with al-Qaeda but it does not end there. \nIt will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been \nfound, stopped and defeated.''\n  In his State of the Union speech on January 29, 2002, President bush \nre-stated our priorities:\n\n       Our nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and \n     persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives. First, we \n     will shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and \n     bring terrorists to justice. And, second, we must prevent the \n     terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological or \n     nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the \n     world.\n\n  I supported those statements and hoped to help the President carry \nout his pledge. Last October, Congress authorized the use of force \nagainst Iraq. I voted against this authorization because I believed it \nwas a distraction from the war on terrorism. At that time, I attempted \nto amend the resolution to provide the president the authorization to \nuse force against other terrorist organizations that met the following \ncriteria: they have a state sponsor with access to weapons of mass \ndestruction; they have a history of killing Americans; and they have \nthe ability to strike inside the United States.\n  I remain concerned that the President does not have the necessary \nauthorization to use force against these additional terrorist \norganizations. Without such authorization, he cannot fulfill the \ncommitment he made in his January 2002 State of the Union speech.\n  I hope the administration will take this occasion to review its \nexisting authorities and report back to Congress on where there may be \ndeficiencies in its authorities to carry out the war on terrorism. Only \nthen will we be able to hold Syria and similar states that sponsor or \nharbor terrorists truly accountable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15278-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15278-S15279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BUSINESS CLIMATE IN UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as Co-Chairman of the Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, I have closely followed \ndevelopments in Ukraine including aspects of the human, security and \neconomic dimensions. My desire is that Ukraine consolidate its \nindependence by strengthening democratic institutions, including the \njudiciary, and undertaking reforms to improve the business climate \nessential to attracting much-needed foreign investment. Twelve years \nafter independence, the people of Ukraine deserve to enjoy the fruits \nof freedom and prosperity, but obstacles remain. Bringing Ukraine more \nfully into Europe is both essential to the country's long-term economic \nsuccess and important for European security. Accelerating Ukraine's \nmovement toward Europe is timely and needed. While high-ranking \nUkrainian officials pay lipservice to such integration, the jury is \nstill out as to whether they are prepared to take the bold steps that \nwill be required to advance such integration. An important barometer \nfor the future will be the extent to which the country's moves to \nconfront the corruption and crime that retard the process of \ndemocratization and economic liberalization and erode Ukraine's \nsecurity and independence.\n  While those at the top say the right things, there is justified \nskepticism as to their sincerity. This is certainly the case concerning \nUkraine's current President, Leonid Kuchma. The controversies \nsurrounding Kuchma undercut his credibility with respect to the issue \nof combating corruption. Nevertheless, this should not detract from\n\n[[Page S15279]]\n\nthe urgency of tackling corruption in the lead up to critical \nparliamentary elections slated for next year, and presidential \nelections to select Kuchma's successor in 2004.\n  Meanwhile, those serious about rooting out corruption and corrupt \nofficials should take a hard look at the handling--or more accurately, \nmishandling--of Ukrainian and foreign owned businesses. For example, \nUnited States-owned businesses have been victimized through \nexpropriations, asset thefts, extortion and the like perpetrated or \nabetted by corrupt officials and courts in Ukraine. While new cases \ncontinue to occur, longstanding cases remain unresolved with investors \nunable to obtain the relief to which they are entitled under Ukrainian \nand international law.\n  Although the State Department has made repeated representations about \nthese cases at senior levels of the Kuchma administration, Kyiv \nrebuffed repeated requests to resolve them in accordance with the law. \nAt the same time it refuses to punish the perpetrators of the criminal \nacts or take corrective measures to prevent similar cases from arising.\n  If the victims are to ever achieve a measure of justice, it is \nessential that U.S. officials raise these cases at every appropriate \nopportunity.\n  In one especially egregious and illustrative case, well-connected \nindividuals in Ukraine were able to orchestrate the seizure of all the \nassets of a successful pharmaceutical joint venture which was half \nowned by United States investors. When, 6 years after the theft the \nUkrainian appeals courts finally dismissed the spurious claims to the \nassets on grounds that they were based entirely on forged and falsely \nfabricated documents, senior Ukrainian officials launched into action. \nWithin weeks of these judicial decisions, the Ukrainian President \nreportedly convened a meeting of senior officials, including the \ncognizant senior judges and his own senior law enforcement and national \nsecurity cabinet level officers, at which he made clear that he did not \nwant the stolen assets restored to their rightful American owners.\n  The courts quickly complied, without explanation, and in disregard of \nthe copious evidence before them, the judges reversed the decisions \ntaken just two months earlier and held in favor of the claimants. \nSeveral months later longstanding criminal charges against the same \nindividuals were dropped.\n  The circumstances surrounding this case and others involving United \nStates investors are indicative of the far reaching scope of corruption \nand the rule of law deficit in Ukraine today. While the matter was \nrepeatedly raised by the State Department several years ago, I am \nconcerned that the Ukrainian side might assume that the matter is a \nclosed case. I urge officials at the Departments of State and Commerce \nto disabuse Ukrainian Government officials of such an impression.\n  If the Kuchma administration is serious about rooting out corruption \nand advancing democracy and the rule of law, these cases provide a good \nstarting point. Only time will tell if they are up to the challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15279-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRATULATING THE PEOPLE OF GUATEMALA ON THEIR RECENT ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, the people of Guatemala went to the polls \non November 9 to elect a new President, Members of the Guatemalan \nParliament, local officials, and representatives to the Central \nAmerican Parliament.\n  These elections attracted attention, in large part, due to the \ncandidacy of Efrain Rios Montt, a former coup leader who under the \nGuatemalan constitution should have been banned from running for the \nPresidency all together. Rios Montt presided over a troubled part of \nGuatemala's history, during which time too many innocent lives were \nlost.\n  Now these elections were not perfect. Long lines and confusion over \nwhere to vote made it difficult for many Guatemalans to express their \npolitical views. Some polling stations stayed open for as long as 5 \nhours after they were scheduled to close; other did not. The time \nperiod leading up to the elections was marked by violence and \nintimidation linked to some Rios Montt supporters.\n  But in the end, these were important and hopeful elections for a \nnumber of reasons. Rios Montt was defeated in the ballot box--and he \naccepted defeat. The willingness of losers to accept defeat is one sign \nof a maturing democracy. And the result of this defeat for Rios Montt \nshould not be overlooked; he will lose his immunity from prosecution \nfor crimes committed under his watch.\n  There is much more to the story than Rios Montt's candidacy, however. \nApproximately 60 percent of Guatemala's 5 million voters went to the \npolls on Sunday--the largest turnout since 1985. By turning out in such \nnumbers, Guatemalans showed they understand the power of the ballot \nbox. As one woman put it, ``You have to vote if you want things to \nchange.''\n  Overall, these elections were fair and open. Ballots were not rigged, \nand vehicles carrying them were monitored by satellite.\n  Violence on election day was isolated. In spite of an insecure \nclimate during the campaign season, threats of violence were not \ncarried out on a large scale over the weekend. The violence many had \nfeared--and some observers have come to expect from elections of this \nsort--did not take place. In the words of Guatemalan Nobel Prize winner \nRigoberta Menchu: ``This first round was about saying no to violence.''\n  These elections also marked the first time a nation-wide network of \nover 3,000 independent election observers, Mirador Electoral, monitored \nGuatemalan elections--no easy feat in a country ravaged by 40 years of \ncivil war. The group was so highly regarded, they were asked by the \nGuatemalan election commission to release their ``quick count'' \nprojections of the winners. And the results of Mirador Electoral \nmatched those reached by the election commission.\n  Guatemalans will go to the polls again on December 28, and will \nchoose between top vote-getters Oscar Berger and Alvaro Colon to be the \nnext President. I would call upon the Guatemalan Government to maintain \ntheir commitment to fairness, and to make adjustments to better prepare \nfor a high turn-out of Guatemalans.\n  While Guatemala still has many problems, these elections give me hope \nfor the future. I congratulate the Guatemalan people for their \ncommitment to democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15279-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15279-S15280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CONGRATULATING EDITH MILLER\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I recognize the outstanding \ncontributions made by Edith Miller, outgoing Executive Director for the \nVermont School Boards Association, VSBA.\n  Edie, as she is known to her colleagues, friends, and family, joined \nthe Vermont School Boards Association in December 1997 after previously \nserving for many years as the director of the University of Vermont's \nContinuing Education Program.\n  Edie also served with great distinction on numerous boards dedicated \nto the arts and community welfare. Her participation in local \ngovernment is noteworthy. She has worn many hats, from holding \npositions on the town zoning and planning commissions to her current \nrole as Chair of the East Montpelier Select Board.\n  I also had the pleasure and benefit of having her husband, Martin \nMiller, on staff during my tenure as Vermont Attorney General from 1969 \nthrough 1972.\n  Over the years, various individuals have described Edie Miller as a \nstrong and articulate voice in support of public education. She \npossesses a tireless work ethic and an ability to identify critical \nissues, analyze the information, and communicate that information not \nonly to the VSBA members, but also to local State and Federal \nofficials.\n  Edie was a driving force in the creation and implementation of the \nVermont Education Leadership Alliance Project, VELA. She worked \ndiligently with her colleagues in the Vermont Superintendents \nAssociation and the Vermont Principals' Association to address the \ncritical shortage of principals, superintendents and school board \nmembers in Vermont. The program was designed to train and certify\n\n[[Page S15280]]\n\nschool leaders, thereby increasing their effectiveness and reducing \nturnover. Although VELA is now under the capable leadership of David \nFord, Edie still remains very active on its Board of Directors.\n  Her remarkable skill at working with a broad constituency has earned \nEdie enormous respect within Vermont's education community. Edie is not \nafraid to pursue any idea that she believes will improve outcomes for \nVermont's children.\n  To underscore my efforts to increase funding of special education, \nEdie met with members of every school board throughout Vermont, \nconvincing them to sign a petition asking the federal government to \nfully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This was \nnot an easy task, but she persevered. These petitions were presented to \nme in Vermont, bound in a red ribbon. During Senate debate of the \nvarious special education funding proposals I have sponsored, I take \nthese petitions with me to the chamber. I can tell you that those \npetitions have made a deep impression on my colleagues.\n  I have been very fortunate to work closely with Edie on a number of \neducation issues. I have always appreciated her keen insight and her \ninsistence on carefully weighing all aspects of proposals before making \na policy decision.\n  For Edie, it is important to increase educational opportunities for \nall students. For Edie, first and foremost, it is and always will be \nabout the kids.\n  Edie has left an indelible mark on Vermont's education landscape. \nThough she may be stepping away from her responsibilities at VSBA, I \nknow she will not be stepping away from education.\n  So, it is with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Edie \nMiller on her stellar accomplishments as executive director for the \nVermont School Boards Association and her unyielding commitment to the \neducation of Vermont's children.\n\n                     CHARLES D. ``CHUCK'' ANDERSON\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I was recently advised of the upcoming \nretirement of Mr. Charles D. ``Chuck'' Anderson after a long and \nfaithful career in the defense industry. Mr. Anderson is retiring from \nRaytheon as the company's vice president of the Air-to-Air Missiles \nDivision in Tucson, AZ.\n  Chuck began his career in the 1950s as a paratrooper with the \nCalifornia National Guard, then earned his bachelor of science degree \nin mathematics and physics from California State Polytechnic \nUniversity. He went on to earn a master of science degree in Systems \nEngineering from the University of Southern California in 1972.\n  For the last 10 years, Mr. Anderson has been with Raytheon, and it is \nmy understanding that he has been responsible for all AMRAAM, Sparrow \nAIM-9M, AIM-9X, and ASRAAM efforts, including development, testing, and \nproduction. He also played key roles in the design and manufacture of \nthe Standard Missile, Standard Arm, DIVAD, Stinger, Advanced Cruise \nMissile, and Phalanx.\n  Prior to his years at Raytheon, Chuck served in a variety of \ncapacities with General Dynamics, and over the years he has earned a \nnumber of awards: the Winner of the 1998 Department of Defense \nLogistics Life Cycle Cost Reduction Award; the 1999 Outstanding \nContracting Team Award; and the 2000 Secretary of the Air Force \nLightening Bolt Award, to name just a few.\n  Chuck Anderson has spent a career dedicated to keeping America \nstrong. I wish him and his wife, Carolyn, best wishes as they venture \ninto the next chapter of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15280-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15280-S15281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PAUL UNGER\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a remarkable \nOhioan--a man of great vision and great compassion. Paul Unger is the \nfounder of the Unger Croatia Institute for Public Administration, an \norganization that provides professional training, education, and \ntechnical assistance to Croatian Government administrators and \nuniversity officials. On January 23, 2004, he will receive the \nOutstanding Citizen Achievement Award from the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development for his tireless dedication to fostering \ndemocracy and freedom in Croatia.\n  Paul Unger, a fellow Ohioan who is a native of Cleveland, first \narrived in Zagreb for a Christmas party one wintry December night in \n1945. He was en route from his post as commandant of a United Nations \nrefugee camp for Croatians in Egypt to his new assignment as \nadministrator for the United Nations relief program in Yugoslavia. That \nevening, he met Sonja Franz, a Croatian architect-engineer, who became \nhis wife by the next holiday season. Soon after they married, the \nUngers left Croatia for the United States.\n  As the decades passed, the Ungers kept close contact with their \nfamily, friends, and colleagues who had remained overseas, committed to \na free, democratic Croatia. In 1997, Paul Unger assembled an advisory \ngroup of 45 American and Croatian banking, education, and government \nleaders to found the Unger Croatia Institute for Public Administration \nto help reform-minded leaders ease Croatia's transition from the \ndevastating war to a more efficient, democratic government.\n  As a first step, Mr. Unger created a fellowship program to assist \nsenior Croatian officials in the development of improved practices in \ngovernment. This program was to be administered by his alma mater, \nHarvard University. The Unger Croatia Program was created within the \nJohn F. Kennedy School of Government, and the Institute Advisory Group \nwas charged with nominating and selecting candidates. Between 1998-\n2001, the Ungers personally sponsored 22 Fellows at the Kennedy School, \nincluding deputy prime ministers, cabinet ministers and deputies, \nnational bank governors, parliamentary committee chairs, ambassadors, \nand a Presidential candidate.\n  To build a program that could provide similar services for locally \nelected officials, Mr. Unger turned to the Maxine Goodman Levin College \nof Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University, CSU. In 2001, the Unger \nCroatia Center for Local Government Leadership was established within \nCSU's Levin College.\n  The success of the Cleveland seminars inspired Mr. Unger to create an \neducational alliance between CSU and the University of Rijeka, which \nwas formalized in 2002. This collaboration continues to blossom. Over \nthe past 2 years, the Unger Croatia Center at CSU has worked closely \nwith the Economics faculty in Rijeka to develop their professional \ncourses. Last summer, the University of Rijeka hosted the first seminar \nfor public officials in Croatia, and this spring, the University will \nintroduce its first programs in public administration and public health \nadministration--an important step toward the eventual realization of \nthe first-ever Croatian Graduate School of Public Administration.\n  As Mr. Unger continues to work toward a vision for a prosperous \nCroatia, government is being transformed. Program participants have \nreturned home and implemented the techniques learned through their \nstudies, creating an environment where Croatians have become \nincreasingly involved in local government and have taken an active role \nin setting budget priorities and guiding community development.\n  Beyond his extraordinary efforts abroad, Mr. Unger also has \ncontributed much to our home State of Ohio. It is here that he and \nSonja raised a family and achieved prominence through a successful \nbusiness, volunteer service, and community activism. Among his many \naccomplishments, Mr. Unger served as president/CEO of the Unger \nCompany, a national food packaging company headquartered in Cleveland; \nchairman of the Urban Renewal Task Force for the Mayor of Cleveland; \npresident of the Cleveland chapter of the American Civil Liberties \nUnion; and chairman of the Ohio's International Trade Council. He has \nbeen widely-recognized, notably by the Cleveland Heights High School \nHall of Fame, the Cleveland Blue Book, and the City Club of Cleveland \nHall of Fame.\n  Finally, Paul Unger has remained steadfast in moving Cleveland into \nthe international arena. He has helped lead the Cleveland-Miskole \nSister City Committee and the Cleveland Council on World Affairs. He \nalso has sponsored the ``Cleveland in the World'' lecture series at the \nCity Club of Cleveland.\n\n[[Page S15281]]\n\nSonja has been a local civic and political leader in her own right and \nwas the first woman to be honored with a Golden Door Award by \nCleveland's Nationality Services Center for her dedication as a social \nworker and interpreter.\n  In January 2004, the USAID's Bureau for Europe and Eurasia will honor \nPaul Unger with the Outstanding Citizen Achievement Award, which \nrecognizes Americans who have made exceptional contributions to \ninternational development through volunteerism. I congratulate Mr. \nUnger for all his work at home and abroad and express my thanks to him \nand to his wife Sonja for their leadership, dedication, and commitment \nto democracy in Croatia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15281-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING DR. DONALD PINKEL AND PROFESSOR DR. HANSJO RG RIEHM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay homage to the \nremarkable contributions of Dr. Donald Pinkel and Professor Dr. \nHansjorg Riehm to the cure of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, \nor ALL, once an invariably lethal disease. On December 4, 2003, \ndistinguished colleagues from 12 nations will honor these outstanding \nphysicians in San Diego, CA.\n  ALL is the most common cancer in children. Forty years ago, very few \nchildren were cured. Since that time, the cure rate has improved \ndramatically. I am informed that thanks in part to the leadership and \nvision of Dr. Pinkel and Professor Dr. Hansjorg Riehm, about 80 percent \nof ALL patients are now cured in developed nations. Dr. Pinkel's \ndevelopment of effective presymptomatic central nervous system therapy \nand Professor Dr. Hansjorg Riehm's development of effective post \ninduction intensification halved the number of relapses and deaths. \nTens of thousands of children, their families, friends and neighbors in \nmany countries have benefitted. Dr. Pinkel and Professor Dr. Riehm \nstand united in their desire that effective therapy be available to \nchildren with ALL, both in the developed world and in the developing \nworld.\n  I am informed that during his years at St. Jude Children's Research \nHospital in the 1960s, Dr. Pinkel introduced the concept of \npresymptomatic central nervous system therapy and cured one-half of \nchildren with ALL. Previously, many children had achieved temporary \nremission from leukemia, only to suffer return of leukemia or relapse \nin the central nervous system, subsequent bone marrow relapse, and \ndeath. Presymptomatic central nervous system therapy remains a \ncornerstone of ALL therapy throughout the world.\n  Professor Dr. Hansjorg Riehm and his colleagues in the Berlin \nFrankfurt Munster Group introduced effective postinduction \nintensification in the late 1970s. This concept involves implementing \nstronger therapy after the patient is in remission. Previously, \npatients received brief intensive induction therapy followed by \npresymptomatic central nervous system therapy and prolonged mild \nmaintenance therapy. Most patients achieved remission, but many \nsuffered leukemic relapse and death. With application of effective post \ninduction intensification, the number of relapses fell and the chance \nfor cure increased. Professor Riehm's strategy of post induction \nintensification has been applied throughout the world with similar \nsuccess.\n  We know how tragic it is when children and their families struggle \nwith life-threatening disease. The dramatic improvement in the cure \nrate of ALL gives children and those who cherish them just cause for \ngreater hope. Literally tens of thousands of children in many nations \nhave survived and grown up to realize their hopes and dreams due to the \nremarkable contributions of Dr. Pinkel and Professor Dr. Riehm.

The President of the United States and the Congress of \n     the United States are respectfully urged to enact legislation \n     to amend the provisions of the federal tax code to exempt \n     from taxable income of National Guard members on state active \n     duty allowances received for housing and subsistence.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to trade relations with \n     Taiwan; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 228\n\n       Whereas, The United States and the Republic of China, \n     commonly known as Taiwan, maintain an important trade \n     relationship, with Taiwan being among the largest trading \n     partners of the United States and the United States being one \n     of the largest exporters to Taiwan; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan, the fourteenth largest trading nation in \n     the world, is a center for international trade which is vital \n     to the economic prosperity of this State and the United \n     States in general; and\n       Whereas, The State of New Jersey and Taiwan established a \n     sister-state relationship in 1989 symbolizing the close \n     friendship between the people of New Jersey and the people of \n     Taiwan; and\n       Whereas, This State seeks to encourage and expand mutually \n     beneficial commercial relationships with Taiwan; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan is a modern democracy that routinely holds \n     free and fair elections and has dramatically improved its \n     record on human rights; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's 23,000,000 people are not represented in \n     the United Nations; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan has in recent years repeatedly expressed \n     its strong desire to participate in the United Nations and \n     has much to contribute to the work and funding of the United \n     Nations; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's participation in the United Nations will \n     help maintain peace and stability in Asia and the Pacific: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The Congress and the President of the United States are \n     respectfully memorialized to strengthen trade relations with \n     the Republic of China (Taiwan) and to support the \n     participation of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the United \n     Nations.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to a Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 318\n\n       Whereas, Some senior citizens in New Jersey have \n     prescription drug coverage through the ``Pharmaceutical \n     Assistance to the Aged and Disabled'' and Medicaid programs, \n     Medicare supplemental insurance policies or retirement \n     benefit plans; however, according to the federal government, \n     approximately one-third of senior citizens in the nation do \n     not have any insurance coverage for prescription drugs; and\n       Whereas, Prescription drugs and medication therapy \n     management services are essential components of medical \n     treatment, yet the Medicare program does not offer a \n     comprehensive prescription drug and service benefit to senior \n     citizens who need prescription drug and service coverage in \n     order to be able to afford their medications and comply with \n     prescription medication regimes; and\n       Whereas, Proper utilization of prescriptions drugs can be \n     one of the most cost-effective medical interventions \n     available in the health care system and medication therapy \n     management services would assist senior citizens in proper \n     medication utilization, which can help reduce adverse \n     medication events that oftentimes result in increased \n     spending of Medicare funds for nursing home stays and \n     hospital, physician and emergency room visits; and\n       Whereas, Proper utilization of prescription drugs can meet \n     the needs of special populations with chronic diseases and \n     those with co-morbidities through coordinating care with \n     disease management, drug utilization review and patient \n     education program, all of which aid in ameliorating medical \n     errors; and\n       Whereas, Promoting greater access to prescription drugs \n     through the inclusion of a prescription benefit in the \n     Medicare program would reduce the incidence of senior \n     citizens employing unsafe cost-saving methods, such as \n     splitting pills and staggering the days on which medications \n     are taken; and\n\n[[Page S15284]]\n\n       Whereas, Comprehensive reform of the Medicare program would \n     coordinate care for this population and offer more choices of \n     quality coverage for senior citizens, while maintaining the \n     financial sustainability of the program; and\n       Whereas, A voluntary, comprehensive Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit program, which provides eligible enrollees with \n     covered outpatient prescription drugs, medication preparation \n     services and medication therapy management services, would \n     ensure senior citizens access to necessary prescription drugs \n     and services: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly of the State of New Jersey:\n       1. This House respectfully memorializes Congress to enact, \n     and the President of the United States to sign into law, a \n     financially sustainable, voluntary, universal and \n     comprehensive prescription drug benefit in the Medicare \n     program, which would ensure senior citizens access to \n     necessary prescription drugs and services.\n       2.

Sec. 3121(d)(1)); \n     and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania employers, including corporate \n     officers, can, to the extent provided by law, take a tax \n     credit against the FUTA tax of the unemployment contributions \n     that were paid into Pennsylvania's unemployment compensation \n     fund; and\n       Whereas, FUTA establishes that employers may take a maximum \n     credit of 5.4% against the FUTA tax; and\n       Whereas, after the offset credit is applied, Pennsylvania \n     employers who pay into the State unemployment system are left \n     to pay 0.8% FUTA tax on the first $7,000 in wages paid to \n     each employee; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania's Unemployment Compensation Law \n     requires that corporate officers pay unemployment \n     compensation taxes, although they generally are not eligible \n     to collect unemployment compensation benefits should they \n     become unemployed; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania corporate officers have expressed \n     frustration because they are required to pay into the State's \n     unemployment compensation sysetm but are subsequently denied \n     unemployment benefits when they become unemployed; and\n       Whereas, the payment of unemployment compensation taxes is \n     especially burdensome for small, incorporated businesses; and\n       Whereas, exempting Pennsylvania corporate officers from \n     State unemployment contribution liability would be futile \n     because such officers would then be required to pay the full \n     6.2% FUTA tax on their wages instead of the net 0.8% rate \n     normally paid with the 5.4% offset credit permitted for State \n     unemployment taxes paid; and\n       Whereas, such an exemption would not provide any real tax \n     relief to corporate officers, but would merely result in the \n     Federal Government benefiting from additional tax revenue at \n     the expense of Pennsylvania's unemployment compensation fund: \n     Therefore be it\n       Resolved (the senate concurring) That the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the Congress to \n     reexamine the FUTA tax as it relates to corporate officers \n     and reevaluate the need for such a tax; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-333.

Burk decision and allow the State \n     to use the Federal funds to pay for its expenses rather than \n     provide the supplemental funds that the Head Start programs \n     need to meet the Supreme Court mandates: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. This House expresses its opposition to the move of Head \n     Start funding by the Federal Government from the Department \n     of Health and Human Services to the Department of Education \n     and also expresses its opposition to provide Head Start \n     funding on a block grant basis.\n       2.

This refusal to allow the \n     United States to complete its constitutional duty of advice \n     and consent is denying the nominees the opportunity to \n     address any honest objections to their records or \n     qualifications.

In the recent past, the Sixth Circuit has \n     taken as long as 15.3 months to reach a final disposition of \n     an appeal. With the national average at only 10.9 months, \n     this means the Sixth Circuit takes over 40% longer than the \n     national average to process a case; and\n       Whereas, the last time the Sixth Circuit was this \n     understaffed, former Chief Judge Gilbert S.

Judge Merritt also wrote that the court was \n     ``rapidly deteriorating, understaffed and unable to properly \n     carry out their responsibilities''; and\n       Whereas, decisions from the Sixth Circuit are slower in \n     coming, based on less careful deliberation, and, as a result, \n     are less likely to be just and predictable. The effects on \n     our people, our society, and our economy are far-reaching, \n     including transaction costs.

A bill to improve data collection and dissemination, \ntreatment, and research relating to cancer, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, ours is a remarkable Nation.\n  America is the home to 90 of the top 100 universities. Americans work \nan average of 300 hours more per year than our friends in Europe. More \npatents are applied for in this Nation each year than in all of the EU \nmember states combined. We lead the world in research and development. \nPerhaps the area in which our labor and investment will have the most \nprofound impact, is in field of the life sciences.\n  This year our Nation met a remarkable goal. In the span of the last 5 \nyears we have doubled our financial commitment to basic health research \nfunding. Those funds will go toward saving and extending the lives of, \nand improving the quality of life for, people around the world.\n  Our history has proven that when this Nation is resolute and \ndetermined, we can achieve remarkable things.\n  In 1939, the United States was producing 800 military airplanes per \nyear. At the onset of World War II, President Roosevelt challenged the \nNation to increase manufacturing to 4,000 planes per month. By the end \nof 1943, in perhaps the greatest industrial feat in history, the United \nStates was producing 8,000 military aircraft per month.\n  On May 5, 1961, the United States launched Mercury 3 and Alan Shepard \nbecame the first American in space, spending a total of 15 minutes and \n28 seconds in sub-orbit. Twenty days later President Kennedy addressed \na joint session of Congress and proposed that our Nation land a man on \nthe moon before the end of the decade. Only July 29, 1969, four days \nafter leaving the launch pad, Neil Armstrong stepped from the lunar \nmodule to the surface of the moon in perhaps the greatest engineering \nand technological feat in history.\n  Between 1996 and 1997, for the first time, the total number of cancer \ndeaths in the United States did not rise. That trend has continued to \nthis very day. Today, there are at least 50 compounds under \ninvestigation for efficacy as cancer preventives and untold research is \nbeing performed in search of new cures and treatments for cancer. This \nis the time for our Nation to become resolute and determined to achieve \nwhat may be the greatest scientific feat in history--to win the war on \ncancer.\n  Our Nation began its commitment to the War on Cancer with the passage \nof the National Cancer Institute Act of 1937. In 1971, Congress \ncommitted itself to win the war with the passage of the National Cancer \nAct. Today, I am joined by the Chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee Judd Gregg in beginning the next campaign \nof this war, with the introduction of the National Cancer Act of 2003. \nWith this bill we renew our commitment to the fight, and join NCI \nDirector Dr. Andrew Von Eshenbach in his commitment to make cancer \nsurvivorship the rule and cancer deaths rare by 2015.\n  Major provisions within the legislation include: Enhancing our \ncurrent cancer registry system; enhancing our existing screening \nmechanisms; creating a new Patient Education Program; enhancing NCI \nDesignated Comprehensive Cancer Centers; elevating the importance of \npain management and survivorship throughout the nation's cancer \nprograms; authorizing the Office of Survivorship within NCI; freeing \nthe NCI to engage private entities to further cancer research; and \nproviding patients with greater access to experimental therapies.\n  In the coming months, I look forward to working with the Chairman, \nthe Administration and other members interested committed to winning \nthe War on Cancer, to get this bill to markup, to the floor and to the \nPresident's desk.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 1900. A bill to amend the African Growth and Opportunity Act to \nexpand certain trade benefits to eligible sub-Saharan African \ncountries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``United \nStates-Africa Partnership Act.'' This bill builds on the important \ntrade and investment initiatives that were contained in the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) passed in 2000.\n  The original African Growth and Opportunity Act and the expansion of \nAGOA that I am introducing today emphasize the need to elevate the \nAfrican private sector. The AGOA legislation offers enhanced trade \nbenefits, more U.S. private sector investment, and a higher level \ndialogue with African governments. It envisions a new economic \npartnership between the United States and African nations.\n  To gain these benefits, African countries are expected to undertake \nsustained economic reform, abide by international human rights \npractices, and strengthen good goverance. These standards have been \nused by the U.S. to stimulate reforms in Asia, Latin America, Eastern \nEurope and elsewhere. There is no reason to expect that they will not \nbe successful in Africa as well.\n  Private investment tends to follow good governance and economic \nreform, but the private sector takes cues from government policies and \ninvolvement. It is very much in our interest to play a constructive \nrole in the evolving political and economic transition in Africa. A \nstable and prosperous Africa will be better equipped to cooperate on a \nrange of shared global problems such as weapons proliferation, \nterrorism, narcotics, the environment and contagious diseases. African \neconomic success also can create new markets for American exports. If \njobs are created and foreign exchange is earned through enhanced \nexports, Africa will have greater capacity to buy goods and services \nfrom abroad. They will likely purchase machinery, electronics, \nfinancial services, agricultural products, and many other goods and \nservices from U.S. suppliers.\n  If we had ignored Taiwan and Korea in the 1960s when they were at \nstages of economic development comparable to many African societies \ntoday, we would have missed out on enormous opportunities in East Asia. \nYears from now, I hope we can look back and say that we were present at \na crucial juncture in Africa's growth and development and that we \nplayed a constructive role in that change.\n  In an effort to reverse the persistent under-performance by African \neconomies and to stimulate American involvement in Africa, I introduced \nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act in the United States Senate in \n1999. Since its enactment in 2000, AGOA has been a positive economic \nforce in Africa. In 2002, 94 percent of U.S. imports from AGOA-eligible \ncountries entered duty-free. The United States imported $9 billion in \nmerchandise duty-free under AGOA in 2002, a 10 percent increase from \n2001.\n\n  Imports from African countries, not counting oil, jumped 50 percent \nlast year. In South Africa, sub-Sahara's most important economy, \nexports of automobiles have increased sixteen-fold in the past two \nyears. The tiny country of Lesotho, population 2.2 million, generated \n$318 million in AGOA exports in 2002. New export-oriented garment \nfactories have created 25,000 jobs. For the first time in its history, \nprivate sector manufacturing employment--thanks to trade--exceeds \ngovernment employment.\n  Performances like this, which occurred despite the recent slowdown in \nworld trade, are the direct result of AGOA. The legislation lets \nAfrican countries export some 1,800 products duty-free, without quotas, \nto the United States. It is a direct response to developing countries' \nlong-time plea; trade, not aid, is the real key to ending poverty and \nbringing about sustainable, long term economic growth.\n  Despite these signs of progress, many Africa economies remain in bad \nshape. Of the 64 least developed countries in the world, 38 are in \nAfrica. Per capita output of goods and services actually dropped during \nthe 1990s, according to the World Bank, and with only 1.4 percent of \nworld trade in 2001, sub-Saharan Africa has been falling behind the \nrest of the world. During the 1990s,\n\n[[Page S15290]]\n\nglobal gross domestic product grew a robust 44 percent; the figure for \nAfrica was only 8.5 percent. From 1990 to 2001, gross national income \nper capita in sub-Saharan Africa actually declined by .2 percent.\n  Africa is in need of help, and expanding AGOA should be a part of the \ndevelopment strategy for the continent. The experience of AGOA has \ntaught us valuable lessons about the path to enhanced investment and \neconomic development and has confirmed some of the key principles that \nproponents of market-based development have used to guide policy. \nFirst, AGOA has demonstrated that a commitment to good governance and a \npositive investment climate is important to economic growth. Countries \nsuch as Lesotho, which has made significant efforts in recent years to \npromote economic reform and stable democracy, have derived the most \nbenefit from the AGOA provisions. Second, the experience of AGOA has \ndemonstrated that regional integration is as essential to development \nas access to the U.S. and other foreign markets. Using the \ninfrastructure and economic stability of South Africa as a base, \nneighboring southern African countries have worked together to take \nadvantage of the benefits under AGOA.\n  AGOA should not be seen as an end in itself. Rather, it is an initial \nstep designed to expand development and decrease poverty by promoting \ngreater integration of Africa into the global trading community. \nAchieving these goals will require both enhancements to the AGOA \nframework and additional steps to address the compelling problems \nfacing Africa. Our trade efforts must be part of a broader American \npartnership with the often-neglected countries of Africa.\n  This partnership starts with three issues. First, we must help \naddress the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa. In addition to the human tragedy \nthat HIV/AIDS has created in Africa, the epidemic severely limits the \neconomic growth that would reduce Africa's poverty. When workers are \nforced to call in sick more days than they are able to work, when \ngovernment positions are experiencing regular turnover, and when scarce \ncapital must be diverted from investment to dealing with the AIDS \ncrisis, it is nearly impossible to build a stable economy.\n\n  Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation establishing a program \nunder which the United States will contribute $15 billion over the next \n5 years to address the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa. The President signed \nthis bill into law and has placed his prestige behind its effective \nimplementation. It is my hope that this leadership and much needed \nfunding will start to turn the tide in the fight against the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic.\n  Second, we have begun an effort to rethink the way that aid is \ndelivered to the world's poorest countries, most of which are in \nAfrica. Earlier this year, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took \naction on the President's Millennium Challenge Corporation initiative. \nThis initiative would deliver up to $8 billion over the next three \nyears to the world's poorest countries, and it would condition that aid \non the development of policies by the recipient countries that will \nmake that aid more effective. These policies include a commitment to \njust and democratic governance and economic freedom. The Millennium \nChallenge Corporation would build on the lessons of AGOA, which has \ndemonstrated that private investment will flow to countries that build \na stable, predictable investment climate. The incentives provided by \nMillennium Challenge Corporation dollars would help to establish \nconditions that will cause private investment dollars to flow to the \npoorest countries.\n  Third, we need to move forward with enhancements to AGOA itself. That \nis my purpose in introducing the United States Africa Partnership Act \n(USAPA)--also known as ``AGAO III.''' The current AGOA expires in 2008. \nMy bill would extend AGOA benefits until 2015. This coincides with the \ngoal of the World Trade Organizations to have a ``tariff free world'' \nby 2015. We should take action on this extension soon so that investors \nwill have the certainty they need when making investment decisions \ninvolving Africa.\n  AGOA contains a provision that allows least developed countries \n(LDCs) to export capped quantities of apparel made from third country \nfabric to the U.S. duty free. All other countries must use U.S. or \nAfrican fabric inputs in order to receive duty-free treatment. This \n``special rule'' for LDCs expires on September 30, 2004. USAPA would \nextend this provision for four additional years until September 30, \n2008.\n  It also would eliminate the import sensitivity test with respect to \nAfrican products and nuisance provisions in the rule of origin for \napparel. The AGOA rule of origin is modified so that it applies only to \nthe essential components of apparel. USAPA also clarifies the \ndefinitions of certain fabrics for customs purposes, including hand-\nloomed folklore articles.\n  USAPA would develop initiatives to provide technical and capacity \nbuilding experience. In the area of agriculture, it directs the \nSecretary of Agriculture to develop a comprehensive plan to increase \nimport and export abilities in agricultural trade. It also provides \nthat 20 full-time personnel of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection \nService be stationed in at least 10 AGOA eligible countries to provide \ntechnical assistance in meeting U.S. import requirements and trade \ncapacity building.\n\n  In an effort to stimulate business partnerships, the bill I introduce \ntoday also addresses investment incentives and encourages the Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, and the Foreign \nAgricultural Service to facilitate investment in AGOA eligible \ncountries. It directs the Secretary of the Treasury to seek \nnegotiations regarding tax treaties with eligible countries.\n  In addition, it encourages U.S. private investment in African \ntransportation, energy and telecommunications and increases \ncoordination between U.S. and African transportation entities to reduce \ntransit times and costs between the United States and Africa.\n  Finally, the bill grants funding for the continuation of the AGOA \nforums and establishes an AGOA task force to facilitate the goals of \nthe Act.\n  The original African Growth and Opportunity Act launched an effort to \nformulate a new American strategy towards Africa. It sought to \nestablish the foundation for a more mature economic relationship with \nthose countries in Africa that undertake serious economic and political \nreforms. That effort was supported by virtually all sub-Saharan African \nnations, and it had wide support among American businesses and non-\ngovernmental organizations. We should now seize the opportunity to \nfurther integrate African countries into the world economy.\n  The United States-Africa Partnership Act that I introduce today \nrecognizes the enormous potential for economic growth and development \nin sub-Saharan Africa. It embraces the vast diversity of people, \ncultures, economies, and potential among forty-eight countries and \nnearly 700 million people. A stable and economically prosperous Africa \ncan provide new partnerships that will contribute greatly to our \ncommercial and security interests. I urge all members to support the \nUnited States-Africa Partnership Act so that we can achieve the mutual \nlong-term benefits that it would bring to Africa and to our country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Allen):\n  S. 1902. A bill to establish a National Commission on Digestive \nDiseases; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague, \nSenator Specter of Pennsylvania, to introduce the National Commission \non Digestive Diseases Act.\n  It is estimated that over 62 million Americans presently suffer from \na range of painful, debilitating and in some cases, fatal digestive \ndiseases. Conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), \nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colorectal cancer, gastroesophageal \nreflux disease impact the lives of our friends, loved ones and \nneighbors. These diseases produce total estimated direct and indirect \ncosts in excess of $40 billion annually. Of course, these figures do \nnot take into account the serious physical and emotional toll digestive \ndiseases have on those afflicted.\n  Thanks to significant advances in medical science, we are now on the \nbrink of some major scientific breakthroughs in the area of digestive \ndisease research. However, in other areas\n\n[[Page S15291]]\n\nof this diverse field, we still lack even a basic understanding of the \ncondition itself, let alone effective methods of treatment and \nprevention.\n  The bill I am proposing today would call upon the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a Commission \nof scientific and health care providers with expertise in the field, as \nwell as persons suffering from digestive ailments, to assess the state \nof digestive disease research and develop a long range plan to direct \nour scientific research agenda with regard to digestive disease. The \nCommission would submit their report to Congress in 18 months.\n  This legislation would build upon the successes of a digestive \ndisease commission that was assembled roughly 25 years ago with a \nsimilar goal. The 1976 Commission's findings directed significant \nprogress in the area of digestive disease research.\n  While the plan set forth by the first Commission has certainly \naccomplished a great deal, the burden of digestive diseases in this \ncountry remains substantial and advancements in genetics and medical \ntechnology compel the assembly of a new commission to guide our \nresearch efforts well into the 21st century.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues towards expeditious \npassage of this important, bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to join \nmy colleague Senator Reed of Rhode Island to introduce the National \nCommission on Digestive Diseases Act.\n  Each year, more than 62 million Americans are diagnosed with \ndigestive diseases and disorders. These conditions, such as colorectal, \nliver and pancreatic cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable \nbowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and chronic \nhepatitis C require patients to undergo rigorous courses of medical \ntherapies and treatment. As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I am acutely aware \nthat while promising research developments have been made in these \nareas, the causes of many of these diseases are unknown and their \nincidence is on the rise.\n  In 2001, the Lewin Group conducted a study of the economic burden to \nour society resulting from the direct and indirect costs associated \nwith just 17 of the over several hundred digestive diseases. The \nresults of this study revealed that the total costs associated with \nphysician care, inpatient and outpatient hospital care as well as loss \nof work for patients with digestive disorders was $42 billion in the \nyear 2000. It is clear from this study and the findings of digestive \ndisease specialists around the country that these disorders represent \nenormous health and economic consequences for the nation.\n  The National Commission on Digestive Diseases Act would address the \nburden of digestive diseases in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. \nThis legislation would create a panel of scientists in the relevant \ndisciplines, patient representatives, employers and other appropriate \nexperts to conduct a comprehensive study on the current state of \nscientific and clinical knowledge in digestive diseases. The commission \nwould then be charged with evaluating the resources necessary to \nexpedite the discovery of treatments and cures for patients with these \ndiseases and develop a 5-10 year long-range plan for effectively \naddressing these needs.\n  In 1976, Congress created a Commission on Digestive Diseases Research \nwhich serves as the successful model for this new initiative. Following \n18 months of deliberations, the 1970s commission created a long-range \nplan and recommendations that laid the groundwork for significant \nprogress in the area of digestive diseases research. The state of \nscientific knowledge has changed substantially since the late 1970s, \nhowever, and the advent of genetics and genomics research, as well as \nthe discovery of additional digestive diseases, compels us to look anew \nat the challenges that digestive diseases present to patients and those \nwho care for them.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will advance our understanding of \nthe causes, effective treatments, possible prevention, and cures for \ndigestive diseases. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nenact this important bipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 1905. A bill to provide habitable living quarters for teachers, \nadministrators, other school staff, and their households in the rural \nareas of Alaska located in or near Alaska Native Villages; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nhave a profound effect on the retention of teachers, administrators, \nand other school staff in remote and rural areas of Alaska. I am \npleased to have Mr. Campbell join me in introducing this bill.\n  In rural areas of Alaska, school districts face the challenge of \nrecruiting and retaining teachers, administrators and other school \nstaff due to the lack of housing. In the Lower Kuskokwim School \nDistrict in western Alaska, they hire one teacher for every six who \ndecide not to accept job offers. Half of the applicants not accepting a \nteaching position in that district indicated that their decision as \nrelated to the lack of housing.\n  Earlier this year, I traveled through rural Alaska with Education \nSecretary Rod Paige. I wanted him to see the challenges of educating \nchildren in such a remote and rural environment. At the village school \nin Savoonga, the principal slept in a broom closet in the school due to \nthe lack of housing in that village. The special education teacher \nslept in her classroom, bringing a mattress out each evening to sleep \non the floor. The other teachers shared housing in a single home. \nNeedless to say, there is not enough room for the teachers' spouses. \nUnfortunately, Savoonga is not an isolated example of the teacher \nhousing situation in rural Alaska.\n  Rural Alaskan school districts experience a high rate of teacher \nturnover due to the lack of housing. Turnover is as high as 30 percent \neach year in some rural areas with housing issues being a major factor. \nHow can we expect our children to receive a quality education when the \ngood teachers don't stay? How can we meet the mandates of No Child Left \nBehind in such an educational environment? Clearly, the lack of teacher \nhousing in rural Alaska is an issue that must be addressed in order to \nensure that children in rural Alaska receive the same level of \neducation as their peers in more urban settings.\n  My bill authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development to \nprovide teacher housing funds to the Alaska Housing Finance \nCorporation, which is a State agency. In turn, the corporation is \nauthorized to provide grant and loan funds to rural school districts in \nAlaska for teacher housing projects.\n\n  This legislation will allow school districts in rural Alaska to \naddress the housing shortage in the following ways: construct housing \nunits; purchase housing units; lease housing units; rehabilitate \nhousing units; purchase or lease property on which housing units will \nbe constructed, purchased or rehabilitated; repay loans secured for \nteacher housing projects; provide funding to fill any gaps not \npreviously funded by loans or other forms of financing; and conduct any \nother activities normally related to the construction, purchase, or \nrehabilitation of teacher housing projects.\n  Eligible school districts that accept funds under this legislation \nwill be required to provide the housing to teachers, administrators, \nother school staff, and members of their households.\n  It is imperative that we address this important issue immediately and \nallow the flexibility for the disbursement of funds to be handled at \nthe local level. The quality of education of our rural students is at \nstake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1905\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Teacher Housing Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide for enhanced Federal, State, and local \nenforcement of the immigration laws, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Homeland \nSecurity Enhancement Act of 1003. Senator Miller and I have taken the \nlead in encouraging a culture of cooperation of all levels of \nimmigration law enforcement--Federal, State, and local--and seek to \nbuild an immigration law enforcement system that uses unified\n\n[[Page S15293]]\n\ndatabases for information sharing from one level to another.\n  The subject matter of the bill introduced today is one I care very \ndeeply about--the ability of State and local law enforcement to \nvoluntarily aid the Federal Government in the Enforcement of \nimmigration law. Let me be clear, this bill is not about the \ncommandeering of State and local police forces or about forcing them to \ndedicate resources toward immigration law enforcement, it is simply \nabout their authority to participate in immigration law enforcement if \nthey so choose.\n  I am convinced that our ability to successfully enforce our \nimmigration laws is a test of whether we will be a Nation governed by \nlaws.\n  Many of the immigration reforms enacted by this Congress since 9/11 \nhave been aimed at fixing the first half of our broken immigration \nsystem, the visa issuance process that allowed terrorists to enter our \ncountry under the guise of legality.\n  It is now time to look at the second half of our broken immigration \nsystem--the half that allows people to remain here illegally for \nindefinite time periods, regardless of how they came here.\n  We know that Americans strongly value our heritage as a Nation of \nimmigrants. Americans openly welcome legal immigrants and new citizens \nwith character, ability, decency, and a strong work ethic. However, it \nis also clear Americans do not feel the same way about illegal \nimmigration. The fact is that a large majority of Americans feel that \nState and local governments should be aiding the Federal Government in \nstopping illegal immigration.\n  A RoperASW poll published in March of this year titled ``Americans \nTalk About Illegal Immigration'' found that 88 percent of Americans \nagree, and 68 percent ``strongly'' agree, that Congress should require \nState and local government agencies to notify the INS, now ICE, and \ntheir local law enforcement when they determine that a person is here \nillegally or has presented fraudulent documentation. Additionally, 85 \npercent of Americans agree, and 62 percent ``strongly'' agree that \nCongress should pass a law requiring State and local governments and \nlaw enforcement agencies, to apprehend and turn over to the INS, now \nICE, illegal immigrants with whom they come in contact.\n  Those numbers speak volumes about the desires of the American \npopulation. It is important to note that those numbers were collected \non requiring state and local action. It is very likely that a poll on \nthis bill, a bill that is about volunteer State and local action would \nyield even stronger support.\n  America's strength is based on its commitment to the rule of law. \nInscribed on the front of the Supreme Court Building just down the \nstreet are the words, ``Equal Justice Under Law.''\n  In the world of immigration laws, a facade of enforcement that holds \nno real consequences for law breakers is both dangerous and \nirresponsible. If the only real consequence of coming to this country \nillegally is a social label, then our immigration laws are but a \nbrightly painted sepulcher full of dead bones, for it is impossible to \nbe a Nation governed by the rule of law, if our laws have no real \neffect on the lives of the people they govern.\n  Our illegal alien population is at a record high. The lack of \nimmigration enforcement in our country's interior has resulted in 8-10 \nmillion illegal aliens living in the U.S. with another estimated \n800,000 illegal aliens joining them every year--that is on top of the \nmore than 1 million that legally immigrate each year. These numbers \nmake it easy for criminal aliens to disappear inside our borders.\n  Of the 8-10 million illegal aliens present today, the Department of \nHomeland Security has estimated that 450,000 are ``alien absconders''--\npeople that have been issued final deportation orders but have not \nshown up for their hearings.\n  An estimated 86,000 of them are criminal illegal aliens--people \nconvicted of crimes they committed in the U.S. who should have been \ndeported, but have slipped through the cracks and are still here.\n  The next number is perhaps the most concerning--3,000 of the ``alien \nabsconders'' within our borders are from one of the countries that the \nState Department has designated to be a ``state sponsor of terrorism.''\n  The number of illegal aliens outweighs the number of federal agents \nwhose job it is to find them within our borders by 5,000 to 1. The \nenforcement arm of the old INS, now called The Bureau of Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement (ICE) has a mere 2,000 interior agents inside \nthe borders. Leaving the job of interior immigration enforcement solely \nto them will guarantee failure.\n  State and local police, a force 650,000 strong, are the eyes and ears \nof our communities. They are sworn to uphold the law. They police our \nstreets and neighborhoods every day. Their role is critical to the \nsuccess of our immigration system.\n  For that critical role to be effective, a few very important things \nneed to happen: 1. State and local law enforcement need clear authority \nto voluntarily act; 2. the NCIC needs to contain critical immigration \nrelated information that can be accessed on the roadside; 3. Federal \nimmigration officials have to take custody of illegal aliens \napprehended by State officers, they can not continue to tell them to \njust let them go; 4. the Institutional Removal Program has to be \nexpanded so that criminal aliens are detained after their State \nsentences until deportation, they can't be released back into the \ncommunity just to be searched for by federal officials at a later date; \nand 5. critically needed federal bedspace has to be given to DHS for \nthey can not guarantee effective removal without adequate detention \nspace.\n  The Homeland Security Enhancement Act that Senator Miller and I are \nintroducing today will do all of those things.\n  Let me tell you about a few of the problems in immigration \nenforcement that started my interest in this area and prompted me to \nauthor this bill.\n  A few years ago, police chiefs and sheriffs in Alabama began to tell \nme that they had been shut out of the system and felt powerless to do \nanything about Alabama's growing illegal immigrant population.\n  As I went to town hall meetings and conferences with police, I heard \nthe same story--``we have given up calling the INS because INS tells us \nwe have to have 15 or more illegal aliens in custody or they will not \neven come pick them up.''\n  Even worse is that Alabama police were told that the aliens could not \nbe detained until the INS could manage to send someone. They were told \nthey had to just let them go! They were being told this, even though I \nthought the legal authority of State and local officers to voluntarily \nact on violations of immigration law was clear. If there is any doubt \nthat State and local officers have this authority, Congress needs to \nfix that, which is what this bill will do.\n  Only two circuits have expressly ruled on State and local law \nenforcement authority to make an arrest on an immigration law \nviolation. In 1983, the Ninth Circuit, while not mentioning a \npreexisting general authority, held that nothing in federal law \nprecludes the police from enforcing the criminal provisions of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Act. See Gonzales v. City of Peoria, 722 \nF.2d 468 (9th Cir. 1983).\n  The Tenth Circuit has reviewed this question on several occasions, \nconcluding squarely that a ``State trooper has general investigatory \nauthority to inquire into possible immigration violations.'' United \nStates v. Salinas-Calderon, 728 f.2d 1298, 1301 n.3 (10th Cir. 1984).\n  As the Tenth Circuit has described it, there is a ``preexisting \ngeneral authority of State or local police officers to investigate and \nmake arrests for violations of federal law, including immigration \nlaws.,'' United States v. Vasquez-Alvares, 176 F.3d 1294, 1295 (10th \nCir. 1999). And again, in 2001, the Tenth Circuit reiterated that \n``State and local police officers [have] implicit authority within \ntheir respective jurisdictions `to investigate and make arrests for \nviolations of federal law, including immigration laws.' '' United \nStates v. Santana-Garcia, 264 F.3d 1188, 1194 (citing United States v. \nVasquez-Alvarez, 176 F.3d 1294, 1295).\n  None of these Tenth Circuit holdings drew any distinction between \ncriminal violations of the INA and civil provisions that render an \nalien deportable.\n\n[[Page S15294]]\n\nIt appears that the Ninth Circuit started the confusion regarding the \ndistinction between civil and criminal violations in Gonzales v. City \nof Peoria by asserting in dicta that the civil provisions of the INA \nare a persuasive regulatory scheme, and therefore only the federal \ngovernment has the power to enforce civil violations. See Gonzales v. \nCity of Peoria, 722 F.2d 468 (9th Cir. 1983).\n  This confusion was, to some extent, fostered by an erroneous 1996 \nopinion of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) of the department of \nJustice, the relevant part of which has since been withdrawn by OLC.\n  Why was the Federal agency responsible for immigration enforcement \ntelling my police chiefs in Alabama to just let illegal aliens go?\n  To be fair, ICE probably does not have the manpower or detention \nspace to take custody and detain all illegal aliens. With less than \n20,000 appropriated detention beds, ICE tells my office that they do \nnot have the bed space to detain all the illegal aliens that they \napprehend; instead, they have to give first priority to detaining the \nworst of the worst--individuals such as convicted felon aliens.\n  It is shocking to me that even though we know that detention is a key \nelement of effective removal, we do not even detail all illegal aliens \nthat have been convicted of crimes, even convicted of felonies, before \nremoval. Last February, in a report titled ``the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service's Removal of Aliens Issued Final Orders'' the \nDepartment of Justice Inspector General found that 87 percent of those \nnot detained before removal never get deported. Even in high risk \ncategories, the IG found that only fractions of non-detained violators \nare ever removed--35 percent of those with criminal records and 6 \npercent of those from ``state sponsors of terrorism.''\n  These percentages have not changed substantially since 1996, when the \nlast IG report issued on the ability to remove aliens found that 89 \npercent of aliens with final deportation orders that are not detained \nare never removed.\n  But we cannot lay all the blame on DHS--they can only detain illegal \naliens that they have space to detain. They are using all of the \nbedspace that they have and are releasing people that should be \ndetained because there is no more room. The Homeland Security \nEnhancement Act would add the critical bedspace DHS needs to fulfill \nits mission of interior enforcement.\n  The third problem that has been brought to my attention is the \ninadequate way we share immigration information with State and local \npolice. We have databases full or information on criminal aliens and \naliens with final deportation orders, but that information is not \ndirectly available to state and local police. They have to make a \nspecial second inquiry to the immigration center in Vermont just to see \nif an illegal alien is a wanted by DHS.\n  Without easy access to immigration database information, and with ICE \nunwilling to come and identify every suspected illegal alien, State and \nlocal police cannot quickly and accurately identify who they have \ndetained and who they will be releasing back into the community if they \nfollow ICE's instruction to ``just let them go.''\n  State and local police are accustomed to checking for criminal \ninformation in the NCIC (National Crime Information Center) database, \nwhich is maintained by the FBI. They can and routinely do access the \nNCIC on the roadside when they pull over a car or stop a suspect.\n  An NCIC check, which takes just minutes, includes information about \nindividuals with outstanding warrants. Even fugitives that use false \nidentification can be identified on the roadside through use of the \nNCIC when, as is often the case, a police officer has access to an \ninstant fingerprint scanner in his car.\n  Separately, ICE operates the Law Enforcement Support Center, which \nmakes immigration information available to State and local police, but \nrequires a second additional check after NCIC that most State and local \npolice either don't know about or don't have the time to perform.\n  The Hart Rudman Report, ``America Still Unprepared--America Still In \nDanger,'' found that one problem America still confronts is ``650,000 \nlocal and State police officials continue to operate in a virtual \nintelligence vacuum, without access to terrorist watchlists.'' The \nfirst recommendation of the report was to ``tap the eyes and ears of \nlocal and State law enforcement officers in preventing attacks.'' On \npage 19, the report specifically cited the burden of finding hundreds \nof thousands of fugitive aliens living among the population of more \nthan 8.5 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. and suggested that \nthe burden could and should be shared with 650,000 local, county, and \nState law enforcement officers if they could be brought out of the \ninformation void.\n  If State and local police are not accessing the immigration \ninformation we have worked hard to make available, we must find a way \nto get the information to them, through systems that are used to using. \nOur bill will get information to them through the system that are \nalready using--the NCIC.\n  As part of its Alien Absconder Initiative, ICE tells us that it is in \nthe process of entering information on the estimated 450,000 alien \nabsconders into NCIC. As of October 31, only information on 15,200 \nalien absconders had been entered into NCIC. That number is totally \nunacceptable and is shocking to me.\n  This should only be the beginning. At the least, the NCIC should \ncontain information on all illegal aliens who have received final \norders of departure and all illegal aliens who have signed voluntary \ndeparture agreements. In truth, the NCIC should contain information on \nall violations of law.\n  Our bill will ensure that when a NCIC roadside check is done on an \nindividual pulled over for speeding, police will know immediately if \nthe individual has already been ordered to leave the country, has \nsigned a legal document promising to leave, or has overstayed their \nvisa.\n  Understanding the value of getting immigration information to State \nand local police comes from understanding that they are the ones who \nwill come into contact with the dangerous illegal aliens on a day-to-\nday basis.\n  Three 9/11 hijackers were stopped by State and local police in the \nweeks proceeding 9/11. Hijacker Mohammad Atta, believed to have piloted \nAmerican Airlines Flight 77 into the World Trade Center's north tower, \nwas stopped twice by police in Florida, Hijacker Ziad S. Jarrah was \nstopped for speeding by Maryland State Police two days before 9/11. \nAnd, Hani Hanjour, who was on the flight that crashed into the \nPentagon, was stopped for speeding by police in Arlington, VA. Local \npolice can be our most powerful tool in the war against terrorism.\n  The D.C. Snipers were caught because of the fingerprint collected by \nlocal police. John Lee Malvo was identified when the fingerprint \ncollected from a magazine at the scene of the liquor store murder and \nrobbery in Montgomery, Alabama matched with the fingerprints collected \nby INS agents in Washington State. Had both law enforcement entities \nnot done their job by taking prints, it is possible that the identity \nof John Lee Malvo could have been a mystery for weeks longer.\n  In February, a 42-year-old woman sitting on a park bench in New York \nwith her boyfriend was dragged away and gang-raped by five deportable \nillegal immigrants. Although 4 of the 5 had State criminal convictions \nand 2 had served jail time, the INS claims they were never told about \nthem--thus, they were not deported as the law requires.\n  Fifty-six illegal aliens were caught by State and local police, and \nconvicted of molestation and child abuse, long before ICE's ``Operation \nPredator'' found them a few weeks ago living in New York and Northern \nNew Jersey after they should have been deported. Of the 56 arrested, \none had raped his 10-year-old niece; another has sexually assaulted a \n6-year-old boy; one had raped his 7-year-old niece; and another has \nsexually assaulted a 2-year-old.\n  The 9/11 hijacker cases, the D.C. sniper cases, and a multitude of \ncriminal alien cases clearly illustrate that our State and local police \nare on the front lines in combating alien crime. To cut them out of the \nsystem, as we do now, whether intentionally or unintentionally, is to \neliminate our most effective weapon against criminal and terrorist \naliens.\n\n  The opponents of this bill will say that we don't want immigrants to \nsucceed and that we don't want people to\n\n[[Page S15295]]\n\ncome here. That is absolutely not true. We believe in the rule of law. \nWe believe that people should come here to be citizens of this country \nunder the color of law. We want people to come here and reach their \nfullest potential. But, we believe that a Nation has the right to set \nthe standards by which it accepts people, and if it sets those \nstandards it ought to create a legal system to enforce those standards. \nThis bill will work to enforce the immigration standards our Nation has \ncreated.\n  The opposition will say that State and local police can not \nadequately respect the civil rights of illegal aliens, and that \nenforcement will cost too much and will discourage the reporting of \ncrimes. It is curious logic to say that we trust our police to enforce \nlaws against citizens but not against non-citizens here illegally.\n  I know that State and local police are trained to protect the civil \nrights of all types of suspects and defendants and that they do so \nevery day in this country. In Alabama, State troopers receive annual \ntraining on racial profiling. In New York, the NYC Police Department \noperations order #11 strictly prohibits racial profiling in law \nenforcement actions. If Alabama and New York are consistent in how they \ninstruct and train their State and local police with regards to racial \nprofiling, it is safe to assume that the rest of the Nation does as \nwell.\n  Under this bill, State and local police will have to respect the \ncivil rights of illegal aliens the same way they respect the civil \nrights of all people against whom they enforce the law. State and local \npolice will continue to be held responsible for violations of civil \nrights; this bill does not change that fact.\n  The opposition will say that this bill is expensive; that it costs \ntoo much. It is always expensive to enforce the law. I do not think \nthis bill is overly expensive. We have made it as cost affordable as we \ncan by electing to efficiently use resources already available to us. \nLaw enforcement is not an area where it pays to pinch pennies. In \nimmigration enforcement, I believe that it costs us too much not to \nenforce the law. I believe it is time that Congress take responsibility \nfor providing DHS with the resources they need to do the job we have \ngiven them.\n  When it comes to immigration enforcement in America, the rule of law \nis not prevailing. If we are serious about securing the homeland, we \nsimply must get serious about immigration enforcement.\n  It is time to talk about the big picture--time to be honest about \nwhat it will really take to fix our broken immigration system. In most \ncases, we don't need tougher immigration laws, we just need to utilize \nour existing resources and use some new resources to enforce the laws \nwe already have.\n  If State and local police are confused about their authority to \nenforce immigration laws, that authority needs to be clarified. This \nbill will do that. If State and local police can not access immigration \nbackground information on individuals quickly enough, we should change \nthat. This bill makes that information more accessible. If DHS is not \ntaking custody of the illegal aliens being apprehended by State and \nlocal police, we need to make it possible for them to do so. This bill \nwill address the practice of ``catching and releasing'' illegal aliens. \nIf we do not have enough detection space to hold people that break the \nlaw, then we need more detention space. This bill gives DHS 50 percent \nmore bedspace to use in immigration enforcement. If illegal aliens are \nbeing released back into the community after their prison sentences \ninstead of being deported, we need to fix the system that releases \nthem. This bill will extend the Institutional Removal Program to ensure \nthat custody is transferred from the state prison to federal officials \nat the end of the alien's prison sentence.\n  Once again I would like to thank Senator Miller for joining with me \nto introduce this legislation. It is imperative that we take critical \nsteps toward regaining control of our out-of-control immigration \nsystem. This bill is a critical step in the right direction. I \nencourage my colleagues to study this bill and to join Senator Miller \nand I as we work to pass the Homeland Security Act of 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1906\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve \nstroke prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join with Senator \nCochran in supporting the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act \nof 2003. The STOP Stroke Act is a vital first step in building a \nnational network of effective care to diagnose and quickly treat \nvictims of stroke.\n  For over 20 years, stroke has consistently been the third leading \ncause of death in our country. Every 45 seconds, another American \nsuffers a stroke. Every 3 minutes, another American dies. Few families \ntoday are untouched by this cruel, debilitating, and often fatal \ndisease that strikes indiscriminately, robbing us of our loved ones.\n  More than ever today, help is available. Modern medicine is \ngenerating new scientific advances that increase the chance of survival \nand partial or even full recovery following a stroke. We are learning \nhow to manage this disease more effectively, and we are also learning \nhow to prevent it from happening in the first place.\n  But science doesn't save lives and protect health by itself. We have \nto put new discoveries into action. We need to educate as many people \nas possible about the warning signs of stroke, so that they know enough \nto seek medical attention. We need to train doctors and nurses in the \nbest techniques of care. We need better ways to treat victims as \nquickly and as effectively as possible--so that they have the best \nchance of full recovery.\n  Our bill provides grants to States to develop statewide programs for \nstroke care, so that the most effective care will be available to \npatients as quickly and efficiently as possible to reduce the level of \ndisability caused by stroke.\n  Stroke systems will rely on information sharing among agencies and \nindividuals involved in the study and provision of care, in addition to \ntraining for health professionals on the signs of stroke and guidelines \non best practices.\n  The bill also authorizes the Secretary of HHS, acting through CDC, to \noperate the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry to develop \nand collect data and analyze the care of acute stroke patients. Funds \nwere appropriated for the registry at the end of the last Congress, but \nthe registry has not yet been authorized. In fact, the Senate passed \nthe act unanimously last year, and it came very close to House passage. \nLiterally millions of our fellow citizens will benefit from the lives \nsaved and the better care they will receive as a result of this \nlegislation. It's long past time for Congress to act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1911. A bill to amend the provisions of title III of the Trade Act \nof 1974 relating to violations of the TRIPS Agreement, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I introduce an important, bipartisan \npiece of legislation that will amend the Trade Act of 1974 to help \nensure that America's intellectual property rights are properly \nprotected by our trading partners and that disputes between America and \nother governments can be investigated and resolved in a quick and \nsensible manner.\n  This bill makes commonsense changes to three important aspects of the \nTrade Act of 1974. First, this bill makes certain that our partners who \nbenefit from trade with the United States adequately protect American \nintellectual property. The TRIPS standards (Trade Related Aspects of \nIntellectual Property) that the World Trade Organization uses today in \norder to determine if a country is protecting intellectual property \nlaws were written in the early 1990s--before digital piracy had become \nwidespread. Our legislation will codify the necessity on the part of \nother nations to keep intellectual property protections current with \ntechnology.\n  In addition, this measure will establish a petition process for \nbringing intellectual property claims against trade partners in the \nCaribbean Basin who fail to enforce intellectual property rights while \nbenefiting from profitable trading programs. Under current law, there \nis no provision for parties to petition the United States Trade \nRepresentative to investigate whether or not one of our Caribbean \npartners is meeting the criterion of ``fair and effective'' enforcement \nof intellectual property rights in order to benefit from special trade \nprograms. This legislation invests the USTR with the power to ensure \nthat beneficiaries of favorable trading programs will not be rewarded \nfor failing to protect intellectual property in a meaningful way.\n  Finally, this bill will correct an undesirable and unintended \ntechnical deficiency of the Trade Act of 1974 when applied to the \ndispute mechanisms of the World Trade Organization. Current\n\n[[Page S15300]]\n\ntimelines for investigating intellectual property violations under the \nTrade Act force the USTR to designate certain countries as failing to \nprotect intellectual property before a complete investigation can be \ncompleted and make it virtually impossible to negotiate with that \ncountry or bring a WTO dispute settlement case in order to resolve a \ndispute. This bill amends Section 301 of the Trade Act to make sure \nthat investigations can proceed before policy is made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15300-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 269--URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA TO END THE \n         COMMERCIAL SEAL HUNT THAT OPENED ON NOVEMBER 15, 2003\n\n  Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Reed, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Kennedy) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 269\n\n       Whereas on November 15, 2003, the Government of Canada \n     opened a commercial hunt on seals in the waters off the east \n     coast of Canada;\n       Whereas an international outcry regarding the plight of the \n     seals hunted in Canada resulted in the 1983 ban by the \n     European Union of whitecoat and blueback seal skins, and the \n     subsequent collapse of the commercial seal hunt in Canada;\n       Whereas the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. \n     1361 et seq.) bars the import into the United States of any \n     seal products;\n       Whereas in February 2003, the Ministry of Fisheries and \n     Oceans in Canada authorized the highest quota for harp seals \n     in Canadian history, allowing nearly 1,000,000 seals to be \n     killed over a 3-year period;\n       Whereas harp seal pups can be legally hunted in Canada as \n     soon as they have begun to molt their white coats at \n     approximately 12 days of age;\n       Whereas 97 percent of the seals culled in the 2003 \n     slaughter were pups between just 12 days and 12 weeks of age, \n     most of which had not yet eaten their first solid meal or \n     learned to swim;\n       Whereas a 2001 report by an independent team of \n     veterinarians invited to observe the hunt by the \n     International Fund for Animal Welfare concluded that the seal \n     hunt failed to comply with basic animal welfare regulations \n     in Canada and that governmental regulations regarding humane \n     killing were not being respected or enforced;\n       Whereas the 2001 veterinary report concluded that as many \n     as 42 percent of the seals studied were likely skinned while \n     alive and conscious;\n       Whereas the commercial slaughter of seals in the Northwest \n     Atlantic is inherently cruel, whether the killing is \n     conducted by clubbing or by shooting;\n       Whereas many seals are shot in the course of the hunt, but \n     escape beneath the ice where they die slowly and are never \n     recovered, and these seals are not counted in official kill \n     statistics, making the actual kill level far higher than the \n     level that is reported;\n       Whereas the commercial hunt for harp and hooded seals is \n     not conducted by indigenous peoples of Canada, but is a \n     commercial slaughter carried out by nonnative people from the \n     East Coast of Canada for seal fur, oil, and penises (used as \n     aphrodisiacs in some Asian markets);\n       Whereas the fishing and sealing industries in Canada \n     continue to justify the expanded seal hunt on the grounds \n     that the seals in the Northwest Atlantic are preventing the \n     recovery of cod stocks, despite the lack of any credible \n     scientific evidence to support this claim;\n       Whereas 2 Canadian Government marine scientists reported in \n     1994 that the true cause of cod depletion in the North \n     Atlantic was over-fishing, and the consensus among the \n     international scientific community is that seals are not \n     responsible for the collapse of cod stocks;\n       Whereas harp and hooded seals are a vital part of the \n     complex ecosystem of the Northwest Atlantic, and because the \n     seals consume predators of commercial cod stocks, removing \n     the seals might actually inhibit recovery of cod stocks;\n       Whereas certain ministries of the Government of Canada have \n     stated clearly that there is no evidence that killing seals \n     will help groundfish stocks to recover; and\n       Whereas the persistence of this cruel and needless \n     commercial hunt is inconsistent with the well-earned \n     international reputation of Canada: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges the Government of Canada to \n     end the commercial hunt on seals that opened in the waters \n     off the east coast of Canada on November 15, 2003.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am joined by a number of my \ncolleagues in submitting a resolution in the hope that the Canadian \ngovernment will cease its support of the slaughter of seals. The images \nfrom this senseless slaughter are difficult to view but even harder to \naccept: skinning of live animals, some no older than 12 days, and the \ndragging of live seals across the ice using steel hooks.\n  On November 15, 2003, the Government of Canada opened a commercial \nhunt on seals in the waters off the east coast of Canada. This hunt is \nsupported by millions of dollars of subsidies to the sealing industry \nevery year from the Canadian Government. These subsidies facilitate the \nslaughter of innocent animals and artificially extend the life of an \nindustry that has ceased to exist in most developed countries. These \nsubsides can not be justified and should be ended.\n  Few would argue that this industry still serves a legitimate purpose. \nTwo years ago, an economic analysis of the Canadian sealing industry \nconcluded that it provided the equivalent on only 100 to 150 full-time \njobs each year. In addition, the analysis found that these jobs cost \nCanadian taxpayers nearly $30,000 each. The report concluded that when \nthe cost of government subsidies provided to the industry was weighed \nagainst the landed value of the seals each year, the net value of the \nsealing industry was close to zero.\n  There is little about the Canadian sealing industry that is self-\nsustaining. The operating budget of the Canadian Sealers Association \ncontinues to be paid by the Canadian government; their rent each month \nis paid by the provincial government of Newfoundland and Labrador; seal \nprocessing companies continue to receive subsidies through the Atlantic \nCanada Opportunities Agency; Human Resources Development Canada, and \nother federal funding programs for staffing and capital costs. The \nsealing industry, through the Sealing Industry Development Council and \nother bodies, receives assistance for product research and development, \nand for product marketing initiatives, both overseas and domestically. \nAll the costs of the seal hunt for ice breaking services and for search \nand rescue, provided by the Canadian Coast Guard, are underwritten by \nCanadian taxpayers.\n  Many believe that subsidizing an industry that only operates for a \nfew weeks a year and employs only a few hundred people on a seasonal, \npart-time basis is simply a bad investment on the part of the Canadian \ngovernment. The HSUS has already called upon the Canadian government to \nend these archaic subsidies and instead work to diversify the economy \nin the Atlantic region by facilitating long-term jobs and livelihoods.\n  The clubbing of baby seals can't be defended or justified, and Canada \nshould end it just as we ended the Alaska baby seal massacre 20 years \nago. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15300-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15300-S15301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 270--CONGRATULATING JOHN GAGLIARDI, FOOTBALL COACH OF \n  ST.

A dream so powerful that compelled a race of people \nto fight for the liberty of others when they were in bondage \nthemselves. A dream that not only served as a catalyst for physical \nliberation in the African-American community but removed societal \nshackles from our culture and enabled us to realize the ideals set \nbefore us in the Constitution--that all men are created equal under \nGod.\n  Today, I am proud to stand here with my colleagues, from both the \nHouse and the Senate, and announce the passage of the National Museum \nof African-American History and Culture Act. After over 70 years, we \nhave finally created a museum to honor--nationally--the contributions \nand sacrifice of African Americans in this country.\n  I would specifically like to thank Senator Dodd, who was committed to \nhonoring this history and has worked hard to get us to this point \ntoday.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Trent Lott for his unwavering \nsupport to move this bill through the Committee of Jurisdiction. As \nwell as Senator Ted Stevens for his leadership and commitment to this \nproject.\n  Additionally, I would like to recognize Senator Santorum for his \ncontinued unwavering commitment to this bill as well as the majority \nleader of the Senate, Senator Bill Frist. It means a great deal to have \nsuch widespread support and I am grateful.\n  Perhaps most important, I would like to thank Representative John \nLewis for championing this bill for over 15 years. It has been a \npleasure for me to work with you, John, on this bill.\n  With the creation of this museum, we will celebrate a rich and \nmagnificent history. A history of a people's quest for freedom that \nshaped this Nation into a symbol of freedom and democracy around the \nworld. I am proud to\n\n[[Page S15304]]\n\nstand here today with my colleagues and celebrate the passage of this \nwonderful bill.\n  Perhaps most important, I believe that this museum will be a catalyst \nfor needed racial reconciliation in this country. There will be many \ntears shed at this museum--tears that cleanse the soul and that \ntranscend race, creed, and color.\n  I remember when I met with the dean of the Afro-American Studies at \nHoward University. He told me of a story about his grandfather who \nfinished a bowl the day the Emancipation Proclamation was authorized.\n  His grandfather decided to keep the bowl because it no longer was the \nproperty of a slave master but the man who made it--his grandfather. \nThe dean has this bowl in his home--an incredible piece of history and \nI am sure there are many more pieces out there waiting for a home--a \nnational home and today we have ensured that there will indeed be a \nhome for such artifacts.\n\n  Specifically, this bill creates this museum within the Smithsonian \nInstitution--America's premier museum complex. We have worked very hard \nwith the Smithsonian Institution to craft a bill that will compliment \ntheir programs--and indeed we have done just that.\n  The legislation outlines a museum that is very similar to the \nAmerican Indian Museum, slated to open next year. And I know that the \nSmithsonian Institution will create another national treasure, one that \ntells the story of African Americans in this country--a proud history, \na rich history.\n  This bill charges the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution \nalong with the Council of the National Museum to plan, build and \nconstruct a museum dedicated to celebrating nationally African-American \nhistory--which is American history.\n  In addition, this bill charges the board of regents with choosing a \nsite on or adjacent to the National Mall for the location of the \nmuseum.\n  Additionally, the bill instructs the director of the museum to create \nand oversee an education and program liaison section designed to work \nwith educational institutions and museums across the country in order \nto promote African-American history.\n  Finally, the bill sets fourth a federal-private partnership for \nfunding the museum and creates a council for the museum, which will be \ncomprised from a mixture of leading African Americans from the museum, \nhistorical, and business communities.\n  I do not pretend that this museum is a panacea for racial \nreconciliation. It is, however, a productive step in recognizing the \nimportant contributions African Americans have made to this country.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once expressed his desire for this \nNation, ``That the dark clouds of [misconceptions] will soon pass away \nand the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-\ndrenched communities and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant \nstars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great Nation with all \ntheir scintillating beauty.'' We are one step closer today--God bless.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today is a truly historic day. After nearly \nthree-quarters of a century of trying, a national museum dedicated to \ntelling the story of the African American struggle and contribution to \nthe founding and development of this country is about to be realized \nwith passage of H.R. 3491, legislation to create a National Museum of \nAfrican American History and Culture.\n  Many individuals are to be congratulated and thanked for their \nefforts to bring this dream to fruition. In the Senate, my \ndistinguished colleague and author of legislation this Congress to \nauthorize the African American Museum, Senator Sam Brownback, has been \na champion of this effort for the past two Congresses. I was pleased to \nbe his coauthor on this measure.\n  As chairman of the Senate Rules Committee last Congress, it was my \ngreat honor to work with him to produce legislation to create the \nPresidential Commission, whose report underpinned the legislation we \nintroduced earlier this year. We would not be voting on this matter \ntoday but for the continuing efforts of Senator Brownback.\n  In the House, my good friend, Congressman Bob Ney, and my friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut, Congressman John Larson, worked with us to \nfind a compromise that could be supported in the House and shepherded \nthis legislation to passage on the House suspension calendar on \nWednesday by an overwhelming vote of 409 to 9. Their diligence and \ndedication to this effort was tireless.\n  But no one deserves more credit for helping to realize this dream \nthan does my dear friend from Georgia, Congressman John Lewis. This \nbill is truly his dream, his inspiration, his vision, his mission.\n  For nearly 12 years John Lewis has made creation of this museum his \npersonal crusade. It has been a labor of love and while the road has \nbeen long and filled with bumps, the victory today is his victory. I \nsalute John Lewis for his courage and tireless dedication to this \ncause.\n  But the ultimate winner today is not just a handful of Members, it is \nour Nation as a whole. For today, Congress has acted to heal old wounds \nof the past and formally acknowledge that the stories and contributions \nof African Americans to the birth and growth of this great Nation must \nbe told to complete our history.\n  Since 1929, efforts have been made to recognize the contributions and \nunique history of Americans of African descent. It is past time that we \npublicly acknowledge and incorporate the African American experience \ninto our collective identity.\n  This legislation will help ensure that the compelling stories and \ninvaluable contributions of African Americans to our national fabric \nwill no longer be ignored, but shared with all Americans, indeed, all \npeoples of the world.\n  With the creation of the National Museum of African American History \nand Culture, Americans of all races, ethnic backgrounds, and personal \nhistories can come together to celebrate the contributions of all \nAmericans to the rich heritage and culture that is the American melting \npot.\n  That is the essence of this legislation--the completion of the \nAmerican story of our quest for freedom and truth through the public \nincorporation of the experiences and contributions of African Americans \nto that struggle. This Museum offers the promise and hope that all \nAmericans can come to understand the full story of how this nation was \nformed.\n  The House bill before us is virtually identical to the bill Senator \nBrownback and I introduced in May of this year, S. 1157, which the \nSenate passed on June 23rd.\n  This legislation directs the Smithsonian Institution to establish a \nmuseum known as the National Museum of African American History and \nCulture. Within 12 months of enactment, the Smithsonian Board of \nRegents will choose a site for this Museum from among four sites listed \nin the bill.\n  With regard to the sites available for selection, the House bill \ndeletes the Capitol grounds site contained in the Senate-passed bill \nand substitutes a fourth site, known as the ``Banneker Overlook site'' \nlocated on 10th Street Southwest at the foot of the L'Enfant Plaza \npromenade on axis with the Smithsonian Castle.\n  The bill directs that, prior to the selection of the site, the Board \nof Regents will consult with the chair of the National Capital Planning \nCommission and the chair of the Commission on Fine Arts, as well as the \nchairman of the Presidential Commission, Congressional oversight \ncommittees and others.\n  In the meantime, the Smithsonian Board of Regents will appoint a 19 \nmember council, comprised of leaders within the African American \ncommunity and others, to advise the Regents on the development, design \nand construction of the Museum.\n  With regard to the selection of these council members, I was \ndisappointed that the House deleted a provision in the Senate-passed \nbill which would have required that at least 9 members of the council \nbe of African American descent.\n  This important provision in the Senate-passed bill was modeled on \nprovisions of the act which created the National Museum of the American \nIndian. As in the case of that Museum, this language was intended to \nensure that the sensitivities and perspectives of those individuals \nwhose stories this Museum will tell are properly considered and \nportrayed.\n\n[[Page S15305]]\n\n  Although I regret that the House deleted this provision, the bill \nstill requires that, in appointing 17 of the 19 members of the council, \nthe Board of Regents take into consideration individuals recommended by \norganizations and entities that are committed to the advancement of \nknowledge of African American life, art, history, and culture.\n  Although this change weakens the Senate version of this bill some, \nthe Smithsonian Institution can still ensure the integrity of the \ncontent of this museum by appointing members to the council in keeping \nwith the Senate's original intent. As the ranking member of the Rules \nCommittee which has oversight jurisdiction over the Smithsonian, I look \nforward to working with the Smithsonian to see that this happens.\n  This Museum will include exhibits and programs relating to all \naspects of African American life, art, history, and culture from the \ntime of slavery through present day and will provide leadership to \nother museums and will collaborate with historically Black colleges and \nuniversities and educational organizations to ensure the integrity of \nthe exhibits and programming and to broaden the reach of its story and \nmission.\n  The House compromise also retains provisions of the Senate-passed \nbill which authorizes a grant program within the National Institute of \nMuseum and Library Services. This program is intended to support \norganizations dedicated to expanding the knowledge of the African \nAmerican experience and slavery by providing support for improving \noperations, care of collections, and intern and scholarship programs.\n  Equally important is a provision which will provide grants to \nnonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is to promote the study \nof the African American diaspora. Such grants can be used to increase \nexisting endowment funds for the purpose of enhancing education \nprograms and maintaining and operating traveling exhibits.\n  In Connecticut, we are fortunate to have such an organization in \nAmistad America, Inc. Amistad America is a national, non-profit \neducational organization dedicated to promoting the legacies of the \nAmistad incident of 1839 through the traveling exhibit of the freedom \nschooner Amistad.\n  The Amistad is literally a floating classroom which celebrates and \nteaches the historic lessons of perseverance, leadership, cooperation, \njustice, and freedom inherent in the Amistad Incident. Although its \nhome port is New Haven, CT, the freedom schooner Amistad travels to \nboth national and international ports to bring the story of our \ncollective history and the continuing struggle for equality and human \nrights to school children and adults around the globe.\n  It is through the efforts of such organizations as Amistad America, \nwith the support of the new Museum of African American History and \nCulture and the National Institute of Museum and Library Services, that \nwe can ensure that the lessons of the past are not lost on current or \nfuture generations.\n  In short, this legislation offers the hope that through knowledge and \neducation, the history of the struggles for freedom and equality of \nsome Americans becomes the interwoven history of all Americans and \nensures that future generations will not have to repeat such struggles.\n  I was honored to be the lead Democratic sponsor of this legislation \nin the Senate, and I am honored to stand before the Senate today to \nurge my colleagues to adopt this compromise which the House has passed \nand send this measure to the President for his signature.\n  We would not be at this point today without the dedication and \nassistance of many people, including the staff who labor many hours and \nlate into the night to facilitate the legislative process. At the risk \nof leaving someone off the list, I want to recognize those staff for \ntheir considerable contributions to this measure, including LaRochelle \nYoung of Senator Brownback's staff; Michael Collins and Tammy Boyd of \nCongressman John Lewis's staff; Paul Vinovich and George Hagijski of \nCongressman Bob Ney's House Administration Committee staff; George \nShevlin and Matt Pinkus of Congressman John Larson's House \nAdministration Committee staff; Susan Brita of Congressman James \nOberstar's House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee staff; Dan \nMathews of Congressman Steven LaTourette's Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee staff; Bill Johnson of Congressman Jack \nKingston's staff; and Kennie Gill of my Rules Committee staff.\n  The action we take today is historic not only in its ability to unify \nthis nation, but in its message to the world that we recognize and \ncherish the contributions of all Americans to the creation of this \ngreat democracy.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3491) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. FRIST. I want to take just one moment and comment on the \nunanimous consent agreement and the establishment within the \nSmithsonian Institution of the National Museum of African American \nHistory and Culture, which we just approved.\n  This has been a fairly long journey, to come to the point of the \nestablishment of this African American History and Culture Museum. It \nreally goes back to the time of African-American history, when it began \nin 1619 in Jamestown, VA. It was there a Dutch slave trader exchanged \nhis cargo of Africans for food. Over the next 400 years, the \ndescendants of men and women brought to America in chains would seek \nand find freedom. They would transform the American consciousness. They \nwould permanently revolutionize American culture, American music, \nAmerican art, and American literature.\n  We are on the cusp of really a momentous event, and that is the \nenshrining of these events in a national museum devoted to African-\nAmerican history and culture. With this, visitors from around the world \nwill learn about 400 years of struggle and progress.\n  The museum will house priceless artifacts, it will house documents, \nit will house recordings--all commemorating that 400-year history. It \nwill serve as a wellspring of inspiration and scholarship. With the \naction of just a few moments ago, we will be sending the President a \nbill to fulfill this vision.\n  What the African American Museum of History and Culture Act does is \nestablish this museum within the Smithsonian. It is a Federal-private \npartnership. It authorizes $17 million for the first year in order to \nlaunch this museum.\n  The Board of Regents will have 12 months to designate a site and the \nlegislation lays out four possibilities for that site. Once that site \nis selected, the Board will set to work raising up this new national \ninstitution. America will finally have a museum worthy of the \ngenerations of men and women who have sacrificed so much and given so \ndeeply to the cause of freedom.\n  I do commend my colleagues, Senator Brownback, Senator Dodd, Senator \nLott, Senator Santorum, Senator Stevens, and on the House side \nespecially Representative John Lewis of Georgia and Representative J.C. \nWatts for their hard work and their leadership in coming to this point.\n  Indeed, the African-American journey is America's journey and tonight \nwe take another major step forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator has finished his comment on the passage of \nthis important legislation, I would like to briefly say John Lewis's \nname was mentioned, and rightfully so. Everyone the distinguished \nmajority leader mentioned has played a significant role in this \nlegislation before us, but when John Lewis came to Washington, this \nbecame a personal crusade of his.\n  John Lewis is one of my heroes. I have such great admiration and \nrespect for him. I think this is the culmination of a dream he started \nmany years ago. I want the record to be clear as to how much this means \nto him, the people of Georgia, and this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I, again, want to second that. When this bill passed the \nHouse of Representatives--I think it was 2 nights ago--I immediately \ncalled Representative Lewis the next morning for exactly the same \nreason.\n\n[[Page S15306]]\n\n  I have not been around Washington quite as long to be able to build \nupon the shoulders of somebody like Representative Lewis, who had this \nvision of a museum, but we are now taking that major step forward. As \nmuseums are approved and money is put forward, it takes a while, but to \nsee that dream really becoming concrete, I want to tell him thank you \nfor me, for this body, for America, and for all the millions of people \nwho will benefit from that vision he had.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15306-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING COACH JOHN GAGLIARDI\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 270, submitted by Senators \nColeman and Dayton earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 270) congratulating John Gagliardi, \n     football coach of St. Johns University, on the occasion of \n     his becoming the all-time winningest coach in collegiate \n     football history.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. Res. 270, \ncongratulating John Gagliardi on becoming the winningest college \nfootball coach in history. He is a truly remarkable coach and an even \nbetter man.\n  While thousands of his players have known this for years, the rest of \nthe country has come to learn over the last several weeks that it not \njust John's 410 wins which make him special. In an era when collegiate \nstudent athletes are pressured to avoid academics, John Gagliardi \nconsistently coaches teams with graduation rates at or close to 100 \npercent. He values sportsmanship, hard work and humility. And he treats \nhis players and opponents with respect.\n  I am proud that several South Dakotans have contributed to John's \nsuccess over the years. This year's conference championship team \nincludes three fine student athletes from South Dakota: Aaron Babb, of \nSioux Falls; Jason Hardie, of Beresford; and Dana Kinsella, also of \nSioux Falls.\n  There have been other fine South Dakotans before them. While there \nare dozens, I will name just a couple. Sean Dailey, an all-conference \ndefensive end, is now an accomplished chemist. And Jay Conzemius, an \nAll-American running back was until recently the Chancellor of the \nCatholic Diocese of Sioux Falls.\n  It is right and fitting for the Senate to honor John Gagliardi for \nhis historic accomplishments. It is unlikely that anyone will ever win \nas many games as he has, and maybe even more unlikely that any coach \nwill so positively impact the lives of so many young men. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate will now consider \nS. 1152, the United States Fire Administration Act of 2003. I am \npleased to offer a substitute amendment which includes the provisions \nof S. 321, the Firefighting Research and Coordination Act.\n  I thank Senators Hollings, Brownback, Breaux, Biden, DeWine, \nCantwell, Lindsey Graham, Carper, and Snowe for their support of these \ntwo bills. I also thank Representative Camp for his leadership in the \nHouse on the companion bill to S. 321. In addition, I thank Chairman \nBoehlert and ranking member Hall of the House Science Committee, and \nChairman Nick Smith of the Research Subcommittee for their work on this \nlegislation.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to address many of the pressing \nneeds of our fire services. As we face a war against terrorism, we must \nremember that firefighters are among the first to respond to any \ndomestic terrorist event. In addition, today's firefighters must be \nprepared to deal with a host of other hazards caused by urban and wild \nland fires, natural disasters, hazardous materials spills, and other \naccidents. This legislation is designed to ensure that our Nation's \nfirst-responders are adequately prepared and trained to take action \nagainst these myriad threats.\n  This legislation will reauthorize funding for the U.S. Fire \nAdministration, USFA, for fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2008. \nThe USFA's important mission is to reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to fire and related emergencies. The agency utilizes a number of \ntools to fulfill its mission. The National Fire Academy, NFA, is the \npremiere training academy of the fire services, and has trained over \n1.4 million firefighters and other first-responders in emergency \nmanagement, fire prevention, and anti-terrorism. In addition, the USFA \nengages in research, testing, and evaluation activities with public and \nprivate entities to promote and improve fire and life safety.\n  This legislation also would reestablish the position of U.S. Fire \nAdministrator at USFA. The U.S. Fire Administrator plays a critical \nrole in our Nation's fire control policy and homeland security \ninitiatives by serving as the point-of-contact for the fire services. \nThis position was eliminated in last year's legislation that \nestablished the Department of Homeland Security. On April 30, 2003, the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation heard \ntestimony from many of the major fire service organizations regarding \nthe importance of the U.S. Fire Administrator, and the need for the \nadministrator to serve as a representative of the fire services within \nthe new Department of Homeland Security.\n  The legislation would address a major issue that fire departments \nface in equipping themselves. Today's firefighters use a variety of \ntechnologies including thermal imaging equipment; devices for locating \nfirefighters and victims; and state-of-art protective suits to fight \nfires, clean up chemical and hazardous waste spills, and contend with \npotential terrorist devices. Unfortunately, there are no uniform \ntechnical standards for new equipment used in combating fires. Without \nsuch standards, local fire companies may purchase equipment that is \nfaulty or that does not satisfy their needs. A January 2003, Consumer \nReports article reported that much of the emergency equipment sold \ntoday is not tested or certified by the government or independent labs. \nThe article states that ``the confusion will get worse, emergency \ndepartments say, as new equipment floods the market in response to \nincreased government funding.''\n  The legislation would help to resolve this problem by authorizing the \nU.S. Fire Administrator to work with other Federal agencies and \ninterested parties to support the development of voluntary consensus \nstandards for new firefighting technology. Fire departments would use \nthese standards when buying equipment through the federal Assistance to \nFirefighters Grant Program. In the rare case where a standard is out of \ndate, the U.S. Fire Administrator would be allowed to grant a waiver.\n  The legislation also would address many of the coordination \nchallenges that firefighters face during national emergencies. It would \ndirect the U.S. Fire Administrator to provide assistance to State and \nlocal fire services in developing mutual aid plans, and report on a \nstrategy for deployment of volunteers and other emergency response \npersonnel.\n  Additionally, the legislation would authorize the National Fire \nAcademy to train firefighters on technologies and strategies to respond \nto future terrorist attacks. It also would authorize the U.S. Fire \nAdministrator to work with other federal agencies to coordinate \ntraining programs to prevent duplication.\n  The bill also would authorize the U.S. Fire Administrator to work \nwith the Department of Agriculture and Department of the Interior to \nprovide assistance in fire prevention and control technologies, \nincluding methods of containing insect-infested forest fires as well as \nmeasuring, tracking, and limiting the dispersal of the resulting smoke. \nIn addition, the legislation would expand the Board of Directors of the \nNational Fallen Firefighters Foundation from nine members to 12. And, \nit would allow local fire departments to purchase equipment for \nfighting fires with foam in remote areas without access to water under \nthe Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Volunteer Fire Council; \nthe Congressional Fire Services Institute; the National Fire Protection \nAssociation; the International Association of Fire Chiefs; the \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters; the International \nAssociation of Arson Investigators; International Society of Fire \nService Instructors; North American Fire Training Directors and the \nInternational Fire Service Training Association.\n  I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter of endorsement in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 6, 2003.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee, Science and Transportation \n         Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: We are writing in strong support of S. \n     1151/H.R. 2692, the United States Fire Administration \n     Reauthorization Act of 2003. Through a cooperative effort \n     between both the leaders of the\n\n[[Page S15309]]\n\n     authorizing committees and our organizations, this \n     legislation charts a course for the United States Fire \n     Administration to prepare our nation's fire service for the \n     many challenges it faces in a post 9-11 world.\n       Of particular importance to the fire service is the \n     reinstatement of the United States Fire Administrator \n     position as a Senate-confirmed position. As you are aware, \n     the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296) \n     inadvertently eliminated the position of U.S. Fire \n     Administrator. The Fire Administrator is the lead advocate \n     for the fire service within a presidential administration. In \n     a display of nonpartisanship, the nation's fire service, \n     several members of Congress, and Secretary Tom Ridge agreed \n     that the position needed to be reinstated.\n       Like you, we have taken a keen interest in the development \n     of new technologies for first responders. While the emergence \n     of new technologies will certainly benefit the readiness of \n     local first responders, attention must be given to its \n     performance capabilities. Otherwise we could jeopardize the \n     safety of our first responders. For this reason, we support \n     the Firefighter Research and Coordination Act (S. 321/H.R. \n     545) as an amendment to the reauthorization measure. Many new \n     technologies have the potential to improve the capabilities \n     of our first responders; however we must ensure that these \n     technologies serve their intended purpose and protect our \n     firefighters and emergency medical personnel through the \n     requirement that equipment purchased with the FIRE Grant \n     program must meet voluntary consensus standards.\n       We also support the other sections of the legislation \n     calling for coordination of response to national emergencies \n     and for increased training. These are critical to the \n     effective deployment and safety of first responders at major \n     incidents.\n       Lastly, there is one issue not included in your legislation \n     that we encourage both the Congress and the U.S. Fire \n     Administration to help us advance: the installation of \n     automatic fire sprinklers in both homes and the workplace. We \n     can significantly reduce the number of deaths caused by fire \n     by providing incentives and encouragement to the public to \n     stall automatic sprinkler systems in their homes and \n     businesses. Until the 108th session adjourns, we will \n     continue to call on Congress to support the Fire Sprinkler \n     Incentives Act, sponsored by Congressman Curt Weldon and \n     Senator Jon Corzine and any other measures that promote the \n     use of sprinklers.\n       We look forward to working with you in advancing this \n     legislation through Congress quickly. Again, we thank you for \n     your continued support.\n           Sincerely,\n         Congressional Fire Service Institute, International \n           Association of Arson Investigators, International \n           Association of Fire Chiefs, International Association \n           of Fire Fighters, International Fire Service Training \n           Association, International Society of Fire Service \n           Instructors, National Fire Protection Association, \n           National Volunteer Fire Council, North American Fire \n           Training Directors.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1152, the \nU.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2003 that reestablishes \nthe position of U.S. Fire Administrator and incorporates the provisions \nof S. 321, the Firefighting and Research Coordination Act which I \ncosponsored.\n  As we prepare to reauthorize the U.S. Fire Administration for the \nfirst time since fiscal year 2000, we do so in a vastly changed \nenvironment. In that time, the term ``first responder'' has entered the \nlexicon and is now a part of our national consciousness. Americans have \nalways understood and were assured that in the event of an emergency, \nunits of the U.S. Fire Service would respond, render aid to the \nsuffering, and protect our property and resources. However, we had \ngotten to the point that we were taking the Fire Service for granted.\n  All of that changed, as did many things in America, on September 11, \n2001. On that day, we watched in horror as those tragic events unfolded \nin New York, Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon, and we saw over and over \nthe bravery and sacrifice of those proud men and women of the United \nStates Fire Service as they worked tirelessly and without regard for \ntheir personal safety to help their fellow Americans. On that day, all \nof America once again became aware of those who live in our midst--our \nneighbors, our friends, and our relatives--who daily stand on the front \nlines to protect us from harm.\n  Since that time we embarked on an immense reorganization of the \nGovernment as we stood up the Department of Homeland Security. There \nwere many views about the relative pros and cons of such a Department \nand which Federal agencies should be included in the Department and \nwhich were better left outside. This proposal will reauthorize just one \nagency within that organization, the United States Fire Administration. \nMost importantly, it will reestablish the U.S. Fire Administrator \nposition as a separate entity appointed by the President and ensure \nthat it is not subsumed as the Director of the Preparedness Division \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security.\n  In testimony earlier this year before the Commerce Committee, we \nheard from representatives from the International Association of Fire \nChiefs, the National Fire Protection Association and the National \nVolunteer Fire Council who were united in their call to reestablish the \nposition of United States Fire Administrator because of the importance \nof having an independent voice within the administration. As one \nexample, they cited the need to have the Fire Administrator oversee the \nFirefighter Investment and Response Enhancement, FIRE, Act grants \nprogram to ensure funds were properly focused on the entirety of the \nfire service mission and not expended on strictly counterterrorism \nefforts.\n  I have always believed the FIRE grant program was one of the most \nsuccessful competitive grant programs run by the Federal Government. In \nfiscal year 2002, my home State of Maine received a little over $4.3 \nmillion in grants, most of which went to the smallest communities in \nthe State. In fact, the largest single recipient was the smaller South \nBerwick Fire Department, not the larger Portland or Bangor departments.\n  I have the honor and privilege of representing the Great State of \nMaine which has 5,300 miles of coastline and a long and proud maritime \ntradition. I am particularly pleased that this measure amends the FIRE \ngrant process to include maritime firefighting so that those \nresponsible for the protection of our ports and vessels at sea have the \nopportunity to acquire the tools and equipment they need to accomplish \nthat mission.\n  Beyond simply directing the FIRE Act program, the bill also \nauthorizes the U.S. Fire Administrator, in consultation with the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, the Inter-Agency Board \nfor Equipment Standardization and Interoperability, the Directorate of \nthe Science and Technology at the Department of Homeland Security, \nnational voluntary consensus standards development organizations and \nother interested parties, to develop the measurement techniques and \ntesting methodologies to assess new firefighting technologies.\n  Such standards would support the development of voluntary consensus \nstandards for evaluating the performance and compatibility of new \nfirefighting technology, including thermal imaging equipment; early \nwarning fire detection devices; personal protection equipment for \nfirefighting; victim detection equipment; and devices to locate \nfirefighters in buildings.\n  The U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act also ensures that \nequipment purchased under the FIRE grant program will be required to \nmeet or exceed those applicable voluntary consensus standards unless \nwaived by the Fire Administrator in accordance with very specific \nguidelines.\n  Furthermore, under this legislation, the Fire Administrator is tasked \nwith acting as a resource for State and local governments in developing \nmutual aid plans, updating the Federal Response Plan, and reporting on \nthe need for a strategy for deploying volunteers, including a national \ncredentialing system. New training programs at the National Fire \nAcademy to improve tactics for using new firefighting technology and \nresponding to terrorist attacks will be authorized under this measure.\n  I want to stress that the report on our strategic needs for the \ndeployment of volunteers and emergency response personnel would be \nrequired within 90 days of enactment and a report describing plans to \nrevise the Federal Response Plan to address responses to terrorism \nattacks would be due 180 days after enactment. These times are critical \nbecause it is imperative we complete the planning our national response \nso the Fire Service can more effectively protect our fellow citizens.\n  Successful implementation of those plans require that our \nfirefighters undergo comprehensive training to understand and use the \nFederal Response Plan, to use new technologies and to develop the \nstrategies and tactics to fight fires wherever they occur--in \nbuildings, in forests or on the water.\n\n[[Page S15310]]\n\nThis legislation also encourages the Superintendent of the National \nFire Academy to coordinate with Federal, State and local agencies to \ndevelop the curricula to accomplish that training and ensure that it is \navailable in all geographic regions to both career and volunteer \nfirefighters.\n  In conclusion, I would just say that this reauthorization of the Fire \nAdministration is vital to those who risk their own lives every day in \nthis nation to protect our citizens and our resources. It provides them \nwith the leadership, the tools, the planning and the training they need \nto effectively accomplish that mission and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport passage of this measure.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I am going to discuss the legislation \nbefore the Senate, the Energy bill. In order to secure our country's \neconomic and national security, we need to have a balanced energy plan \nthat protects the environment, supports the needs of our growing \neconomy, and reduces our dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  Balance has been my guiding light as I worked legislation through the \nFinance Committee, which I chair, for tax incentives for energy. I \nwanted to make sure we had a very balanced piece of legislation. By \nbalanced, I mean balanced between fossil fuels, conservation, and \nrenewable fuels.\n  We do have in the finance provisions of this Energy bill very \nbalanced provisions for fossil fuels, for near-term energy needs, but \nwe also legislate for the future as we have emphasis upon renewable \nfuels, wind energy, biomass, biodiesel, ethanol, and things of that \nnature. We have tax incentives for that.\n  Then we also have tax incentives for conservation. It is my belief \nthat a well-balanced piece of energy legislation, with tax incentives \nfor fossil fuels, for renewable fuels, and for conservation, is not \nonly good for such policy, but I have come to the conclusion that is \nthe sort of legislation we have to have to get the bipartisanship it \ntakes to get a bill through the Senate.\n  Now, the other body, in writing similar legislation out of their \nfinance committee--over there it is called the Ways and Means \nCommittee--it seemed to me it was very tilted toward fossil fuels. It \nwas my job, representing the Senate, to make sure from the conference \nwith the House of Representatives we came out with a balance. I think \nwe did come out with that balance.\n  I commend that balance to this body, to think about that as you vote \non cloture tomorrow. Give us an opportunity to vote this bill up or \ndown, and consider that my committee, in bringing this balance--for \nconservation, for renewable fuels, and for fossil fuels--tried to do \nwhat we could to get a majority vote in this body.\n  Now, of course, we need a supermajority vote, and that supermajority \nvote is to stop a Democrat filibuster against this bill. In a time like \nthis, when the energy needs of our country are so great, and we are in \na crisis situation, we should not tolerate a filibuster against this \nbill.\n  Every man, woman, and child in the United States is a stakeholder \nwhen it comes to developing a responsible, balanced, stable, and long-\nterm energy policy.\n  The events of September 11 have made very clear to Americans how \nimportant it is to enhance our energy independence. We can no longer \nafford to allow our dangerous reliance on foreign sources of oil to \ncontinue.\n  But somehow we can wait; and we do wait. We should not wait, but we \nseem to wait in a way that causes that wait to make ``too good of an \nimpact.'' It has been over 10 years since we passed energy legislation \nin this body. But if we wait until we get that perfect piece of \nlegislation, we may be waiting forever. And by waiting forever, we will \nsuffer the consequences of less supply and higher prices.\n  I do not know about folks in all parts of the country, but I know I \nwas brought up in the State of Iowa just to have dependence upon our \nsources of energy. When you go to the gas pump, you put the hose in \nyour car, you move the lever, you expect to get gasoline. When you flip \nthe light switch, you expect the lights to come on.\n\n  In order for that to happen, and for the price to be stable, just a \nsmall percentage at the margins of supply is necessary in order for us \nto have that stability and that certainty.\n  Some people in this country believe that one way to change American \nlifestyle is to force down the supply of energy. I happen to believe \nthat Americans ought to have a massive amount of choice; that we do not \nneed a bunch of bureaucrats or interest groups in Washington dictating \nto us that somehow, through an energy policy, by cutting back on the \namounts of energy, they are going to bring about their ``perfect'' \nsociety.\n  This bill is obviously not perfect. And to those who complain about \nvarious provisions, I just remind them, if they drafted a ``perfect'' \nbill--and there probably would never be one--it would not pass the \nHouse or the Senate.\n  Some say the process has not been perfect. But if the process had \nbeen perfect for some, it would not have been perfect in the view of \nothers. And that is fairly common in any legislating process.\n  While we are talking about process, I would like to clarify the role \nthe Senate Finance Committee, which I chair, played in this bill. We \nhave heard a lot about Republicans shutting Democrats out of the \nconference process. Well, that is not the way I operate as chairman. \nThat is not the way my Democrat counterpart, Senator Baucus, operated \nwhen he was chairman of this committee when the Democrats were in the \nmajority in the last Congress.\n  With respect to the tax provisions of the bill, the process was open. \nSenator Baucus attended conference committee meetings. Finance \nCommittee Democratic staff worked side by side with my Republican staff \nin the conference negotiations.\n  I might add, they were a key asset for us in the protracted \nnegotiations with the House Ways and Means Committee. Conferee staff on \nboth sides of the aisle was informed as the process moved forward.\n  If it is ``perfection'' you are insisting upon, then you are in the \nwrong business. Legislating is neither a perfect process nor does it \nproduce perfect products.\n  The Energy Security Act of 1992--the last one that Congress passed--\nwas not perfect. That quickly became clear.\n  In 1995, after extensive interagency review and analysis, under \nprovisions of section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the \nClinton administration concluded that oil imports threatened our \nnational security.\n  Such a finding, under this law, gave him the authority to impose \nquotas and import fees on oil. But he chose to do nothing because he \nbelieved that import adjustments would be too harmful to the economy.\n  Within 3 years of passing what was called an Energy Security Act, the \nfact is, our national security only worsened. When national security is \nnot in good shape, it is probably because our economic security has \nworsened.\n  So what do we do? Do we do nothing? Do we wait for a perfect piece of \nlegislation? Do we wait for market forces to save us? We heard earlier \ntoday criticism of this Energy bill because it fails, in so many words, \nto allow the free market to work its magic. The bill is not perfect, it \nhas been argued, because it favors one energy source over another. You \ncan go on and on and on. I would like to talk about that favoritism, \nand I would like to talk about the marketplace.\n  During the debate on the 1992 Energy Security Act, the chairman of \nthe Energy Committee at that time, former Senator Bennett Johnston of \nLouisiana, stated that each barrel of imported oil was subsidized by \nthe taxpayers to the tune of $200 per barrel. That is outrageous. \nAnybody listening to that says I had to misquote something.\n  But again, let me explain from this leading Senate expert on energy, \nas Senator Johnston was, he is telling us that imported oil is \nsubsidized $200 for each and every barrel. Is that favoritism, when we \nsubsidize imported oil at $200 a barrel? Are we picking winners and \nlosers? What does that tell us about the so-called free market system? \nHow can our domestic energy producers compete with that? It makes a \nmockery of the argument that we must sit idly by and let the \nmarketplace control our energy policy.\n  How absurd can we be? On one hand, we subsidize imported oil, and we \ndo that through the military expense it takes to protect the trail of \noil from the Middle East to our shore or what we are doing in the \nMiddle East now to preserve peace over there, cutting down on terrorism \nas part of that. But on the one hand we subsidize imported oil, and \nthen we wonder why we become dangerously dependent upon that foreign \noil. The Government, through a massive interagency review, declares \nthat our national security is at risk because of imported oil but then \ndeclines\n\n[[Page S15312]]\n\nto do anything about it because we might disrupt our domestic economy. \nSo any way you look at it, we are in a box that we need not be in, if \nwe can get this legislation passed.\n  The marketplace won't save us because we stacked the deck in favor of \nforeign oil. Again, I ask: What do we do in response to this imperfect \nworld in which we find ourselves? Pass a bill that picks winners and \nlosers? The answer is a definite yes. The winners we pick in this bill \nare all Americans, all of whom have a stake in reducing our dependence \nupon foreign sources of oil. We do this by favoring domestic producers \nover foreign producers. That is true of oil and natural gas, but it is \nalso true of our supply of renewable fuels.\n  It is well past time that we get serious about implementing energy \nefficiency and conservation efforts, investing in alternative renewable \nfuels, and improving domestic production of traditional resources. I \nsupport a comprehensive energy policy consisting of conservation \nefforts on the one hand, the development of renewable and alternative \nenergy sources on the other hand, and on the third hand, domestic \nproduction of traditional sources of energy.\n  As my colleagues well know, I have long been a supporter of \nalternative and renewable sources of energy as a way of protecting our \nenvironment, increasing our energy independence. That started with my \nwork with former Senator Robert Dole on legislation for tax incentives \nfor ethanol. It was my own work in 1992, developing the wind energy \ntax credit, that has increased our production of electricity by wind. \nMy State of Iowa, for instance, is third of the 50 States in the \nproduction of wind energy, as an example. So obviously, you know I \nstrongly support the production of renewable domestic fuels. I \nparticularly emphasize, in addition to ethanol, biodiesel made from \nsoybeans. As domestic renewable sources of energy, ethanol and \nbiodiesel can increase fuel supplies, reduce our dependence upon \nforeign oil, and increase our national economic security.\n\n  For the first time we have a tax incentive in this legislation for \nproduction of virgin and recycled biodiesel. This is a new market for \nsoybean farmers and yet another source of renewable energy. The \nrenewable fuels standard, supported by a broad coalition, is good for \nAmerica's farmers, obviously good for the environment, good for our \nconsumers, good for creating jobs in our cities in the production of \nthis fuel, and good for our national security, as we are less dependent \nupon foreign sources of oil.\n  A key reform in this Senate bill deals with the treatment of ethanol-\nblended fuels for highway trust fund purposes. Tax incentives for \nethanol are unique in terms of their treatment in the Tax Code. Unlike \nincentives for other energy sources such as oil and gas, the revenue \nfor ethanol incentives comes out of the highway trust fund because it \nsimply is not paid into the trust fund in the first place. This bill \nmakes it clear that those incentives will be treated like all other \nenergy incentives: The revenue will be made up to the highway fund from \nthe general fund.\n  We didn't get all of the Senate reform in this conference agreement. \nA gesture to the House was that we would defer repealing the partial \ntax exemption these fuels get until the next highway bill, which is \nearly next year. The same is true with respect to the transfer of the \n2.5 cents fuel tax that ethanol-blended fuels do pay. That highway bill \nwill be before us early next year. The current highway trust fund \nspending authority runs out on February 29 next. So we have to get it \npassed early.\n  My friend Senator Baucus has made this highway trust fund reform a \npriority of his. Together, he and I will ensure that the highway trust \nfund is made whole for the gap between now and February 29. I have the \nassurance of the leadership of both bodies that our deferral will not \nprejudice the highway community.\n  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I worked closely with \nranking member Senator Baucus to develop a tax title that strikes a \ngood balance between conventional energy sources, alternative and \nrenewable energy, and conservation. Among other things, it includes \nprovisions for the development of renewable sources of energy such as \nwind and biomass, incentives for energy-efficient appliances in homes, \nand incentives as well for the production of nonconventional sources of \ntraditional oil and gas.\n  This bill reflects the broad diversity of energy resources in the \nUnited States. There are new benefits for clean coal technology. Our \ncolleagues from the Rocky Mountains and the Ohio Valley produce and use \nthis abundant source for the generation of electricity.\n  Burning coal for electricity can lead to environmental problems. This \nbill goes a long way toward remedying the pollution problems associated \nwith coal use. In the heartland, agriculture is a key part of our \neconomy. Agricultural activities result in food that our people in the \ncities eat. There is also waste that results from farming. New \ntechnology has given us a twofer in the farm community. I am talking \nabout equipment and processes that convert animal waste to energy. This \ntechnology needs a bit of a lift to get off the ground, so we have tax \nbenefits to get these new technologies started.\n  Now we have heard some big city folks and big city papers ridicule \nsome of the tax benefits for this new technology. I guess I would ask \nthese folks from the big cities just a couple questions: Do you think \nit is wise to address these environmental problems? Do you think it is \nwise to ignore a new source of energy?\n  I believe the Senate Finance Committee did a good job in addressing \nour Nation's energy security in a balanced and comprehensive way. I \nbelieve the Congress has finally gotten to the point of addressing an \nissue with such a direct impact on our national economic security. For \nthe sake of our children and grandchildren, we must implement \nconservation efforts, invest in alternative and renewable energy, and \nimprove the development and production of domestic oil and natural gas \nresources. We must do it now. That is what this legislation does.\n  Before we get to an up-or-down vote on this legislation, we have to \nface the issue of a Democrat filibuster against this legislation, and \nthat filibuster is going to keep us from voting, if we don't get 60 \nvotes tomorrow. We have to have those Senators of both parties that \nrepresent primarily the grain-growing regions of the country, from Ohio \nwest to Nebraska, and from Arkansas north to the Canadian border, stick \ntogether tomorrow on what we call the cloture vote, to get 60 votes. We \nare going to lose six Republicans from the Northeast. We have to pick \nup about 15 Democrats to get this job done. I expect that we can, \nbecause most of the bulwark of support of the last 20 years for \nrenewable fuels--meaning ethanol, biodiesel but also including wind \nenergy, geothermal, things such as that--have come from people within \nthe Democrat Party, but particularly from what I call the upper Midwest \nof the United States, the grain-producing regions of the country. If we \nall stick together, I think we can produce these votes.\n  There is tremendous leadership from that part of the country. Senate \nDemocratic Leader Tom Daschle, from South Dakota, has always been a \nleader in the production of renewable fuels, and particularly ethanol. \nHe can claim a lot of credit for what we have done in that area over \nthe past. I know he is not supporting cloture, but I also know, as \nDemocrat leader, he has an opportunity to use a lot of muscle in his \nefforts as leader to produce the votes we need.\n  We cannot afford to lose votes on this issue if we are going to get \nthe job done. I think there are a lot of other people who ought to be \nconcerned about it. Senators on the other side of the aisle are \nconcerned about conservation of energy, and rightly so. I pointed out \nhow I felt, that we need a balanced bill between fossil fuel, \nrenewables, and conservation.\n  There are a lot of conservation provisions in the tax provisions of \nmy legislation that ought to get support from the other side. There has \nbeen some talk, particularly from the other side, that some people have \ntried to twist the arms of our colleagues to be against cloture, which \nmeans to keep the bill from coming to a final vote, arguing that we can \nrefer this back to conference and get certain provisions taken out. \nThat is not going to work\n\n[[Page S15313]]\n\nunder the Senate rules. This cannot be referred back to conference. \nOnce it passed the other body, conference doesn't exist.\n\n  There has been some talk, when it comes to the important provisions I \nhave talked about and have been a part of--I even complimented Senator \nDaschle for being a proponent of these for a long period of time--what \nwe call the renewable portions of it, or this part of our legislation \nthat makes up for the road fund. The money lost to the road fund can be \nmade up from the general fund. That is all in this bill.\n  We have tax incentives for ethanol until the year 2010. We have an \nethanol-like tax incentive for biodiesel. We have the renewable fuels \nstandard, which mandates 5 billion gallons of ethanol to be used every \nyear, phased in over a few years. That is 20 percent of our corn crop. \nJust think how that will benefit agriculture, cut down on taxpayers' \nsubsidies to farmers over the long haul, and clean up the environment \nat the same time.\n  But all of these provisions are in this bill. It was not something \nthat was easy for me to get through conference. If it had not been for \nthe intervention of the Vice President in offering a compromise that \nthe House of Representatives did not want to accept, we would not have \nsuch a perfect piece of legislation for renewable fuels in this bill.\n  As I started to say, there has been talk on the other side that \nsomehow we can get this all done in a conference on transportation next \nyear when the highway bill comes up. Well, all you have to do is sit in \nconference with members of the Ways and Means Committee and find out \nhow they love fossil fuels. God only made so much fossil fuel; it is a \nfinite quantity. But on the other side of this Capitol Building, the \nidea is there is no end to it. You don't need to worry about renewable \nfuels.\n  So they come to conference with heavy emphasis upon fossil fuels, not \nwanting to give tax credits to biodiesel, and to wind and ethanol, and \nthey don't like the renewable fuels standard mandate of 5 billion \ngallons. Some people are being told it is just a simple process of \ngetting this done next February, so you can vote against cloture and \nkill this bill.\n  If you knew how hard it is to negotiate this, this is the last train \nto leave town. If you want good provisions for biodiesel, good \nprovisions for ethanol, good tax incentives for conservation, that is \nthe wave of the future for energy. But if this bill is filibustered to \ndeath, don't count on me bringing back ideal provisions on renewables. \nI cannot guarantee that. Nobody else can guarantee it. We don't know \nwhat next January and February is going to be like.\n  When we have a bird in the hand, it is worth two in the bush. I hope \nmy colleagues, particularly the Democrats who are filibustering this, \nand particularly anybody from the grain-producing parts of the United \nStates, where they benefit from renewable fuels, will work hard to \nproduce the votes and help us to get the 60 votes so we can pass this \nbill in an overwhelming way.\n  Don't tell me you are for ethanol, don't tell me you are for \nbiodiesel, don't tell me you are for putting general fund money into \nthe road fund to make up for lost revenue from ethanol--and this bill \ndoes that.\n  Don't tell me those things if you are not going to help us fight hard \nto get the 60 votes necessary to break the filibuster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know the hour is late, and I appreciate \nthe indulgence of the staff on the floor of the Senate. It has been a \nlong day for them in the Senate to listen to a lot of speeches \npredominantly about the Energy bill, although I gather there has been \nsome discussion about the Medicare prescription drug bill as well. I \napologize to those who have been around here a long time today to have \nto listen to yet one more Member of this institution express his views \non the matter we will be voting on tomorrow morning at around 10:30 \na.m.--and that is the Energy bill.\n  I listened with great interest to my good friend from Iowa, with whom \nI have served now in the institutions of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives for about 30 years. We have been through a lot of \nbattles, both together and on opposite sides. I always find his remarks \ncompelling, interesting, and admire him immensely. He has been a very \neffective Member of this body for a long time. I appreciate his work.\n  He has been through a lot in the last couple of years. He is chairman \nof the Finance Committee, and he has an awful lot of matters with which \nto deal. I appreciate his service. I regret on the matter before us we \nhave a different point of view on the Energy bill. I care deeply about \nthe subject matter. I know my colleague from Iowa does. Certainly, he \nraises some very significant issues as they pertain to renewable energy \nresources. Were this a bill about just that question, he would have my \nunyielding support.\n  Unfortunately, there is more to this bill--it is more than 1,100 \npages. My Governor--a Republican Governor--of the State of Connecticut \nand most of the membership of the State legislature have taken a \ndifferent view because of the adverse impacts on my State, just as it \nhas positive impacts on the State of Iowa and the grain-producing \nStates. That is a major reason many of our colleagues, both Democrats \nand Republicans, are opposed to the bill.\n  They must understand, for those of us who come from other parts of \nthe country, we have to evaluate a bill such as this and take a look at \nwhat it does to our economy, our environment, our energy needs, as well \nas the health of our people. For those reasons, on a bipartisan basis \nin my State, there have been strong expressions of opposition to this \nbill. I wish to take a few minutes to outline those reasons.\n  Tomorrow morning at 10:30 o'clock, there will be bipartisan \nopposition to invoking cloture. This is not a question where, on many \nissues, Democrats and Republicans line up very neatly on one side of \nthe aisle or the other. There will be Democrats who will oppose \ncloture; there will be Democrats who will support cloture; there will \nbe Republicans who oppose cloture; there will be Republicans who \nsupport cloture. This is a matter of people looking at legislation that \nevolved in the conference committee.\n  My respect for the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Pete Domenici, as he \nknows, is tremendous. I have great regard for him. I admire his \nleadership in the Senate. I have enjoyed working with him on numerous \noccasions. He has been a very fine Senator for many years. I know he \nput a lot of work into this bill. If I were to vote on this measure \nexclusively on the basis of friendship, I would be a strong supporter \nof this bill because I happen to like Pete Domenici a great deal. But I \ncannot, in all good conscience, vote for something that does such \ndamage to my State, to my region, to my country.\n  This legislation would have been better crafted at the end of the \n19th century and the beginning of the 20th century than the beginning \nof the 21st century. This is a 20th century Energy bill, not a 21st \ncentury Energy bill. It is important, with the few hours remaining \nbetween tonight and tomorrow morning, to know what this bill may do to \nthe country and the people of this country might express to their \nelected representatives their strong feelings about what is in this \nbill.\n  Like any other legislation in my 24 years here, there are good pieces \nto this. I am not going to stand here and suggest everything in this \nbill is wrong. It is not. The Senator from Iowa has already mentioned \nthe idea of using some of our natural resources to provide a renewable \nsource of energy.\n  As a Senator from Connecticut, I tried to be very sympathetic and \nsupportive of those kinds of issues. If this bill were exclusively \nabout that, I would not have any real difficulties with it. But no \nMember ought to vote for a bill such as this for the simple reason that \none provision of this bill is good for their State. You must take into \nconsideration all the damage that can be done to the very people of \nthat State if we adopt the measures included in this bill.\n  This is not, as I say, a 21st century energy policy. Let me quote the \nOrlando Sentinel of November 18. This is not a Connecticut newspaper, \nit is a Florida newspaper. Listen to what they say:\n\n       Start Over: The Energy bill before Congress is worse than \n     what exists.\n\n  They continue:\n\n\n[[Page S15314]]\n\n\n       Two-thirds of the tax breaks would go to the oil, natural-\n     gas and coal industries, helping to perpetuate the country's \n     dependence on fossil fuels. Less than a quarter of the breaks \n     would promote the use and development of renewable energy \n     sources, and less than a tenth would reward energy efficiency \n     or conservation.\n\n  Tonight there are literally thousands of young Americans who are \nstationed in a place called Iraq. I don't believe they are there \nexclusively, as some do, because of the oil issue, because of the \ndependency that this Nation and the Western alliance has on the Middle \nEast for its energy supplies. I also don't think it is not a reason. It \nis certainly part of the reason. I know there are others who believe it \nis the whole reason. I don't subscribe to that. If I did, I would never \nhave supported the authorization of use of force by the President to go \ninto Iraq, for which I voted. I believe it is part of the reason. I \nbelieve we are over there trying to protect the economic and energy \ninterests of the United States in part because of our dependency on \nthat part of the world.\n  Why at a moment such as this, when our country is at such risk, \nparticularly over its future economic policy, would we pass an Energy \nbill such as this? Now more than ever, this bill ought to be doing \neverything in its power to support energy resources that are truly \nrenewable, such as the Senator from Iowa suggested, balanced with other \nresources that have been supported by other Members of this Chamber. \nAnd it certainly should do more on conservation and efficiency.\n  As the Orlando Sentinel pointed out, as I mentioned a moment ago, \nless than a tenth of this bill would reward energy efficiency or \nconservation--less than one-tenth of this bill. Here we are in 2003, \nwith all of the problems we face in the Middle East and elsewhere, and \none-tenth of this bill is dedicated to energy conservation and \nefficiencies, and only a quarter of the tax breaks would be to promote \nthe use and development of renewable energy sources. On that basis \nalone, this bill ought to be reconsidered before we go forward.\n  The Governor of my State, John Rowland, has served as the president \nof the Republican Governors Association during his tenure as Governor. \nJohn Rowland and I have significant differences on a lot of issues. But \non this issue, he has written to all members of our delegation in \nresponse to what is in this bill. I want to read into the Record some \nof the comments of the Republican Governor of Connecticut, shared, I \nmight add, by many Governors all across this country.\n  This is a bipartisan notion of caution about what we are about to do. \nHe mentions five or six reasons why this bill ought to be reconsidered. \nI ask unanimous consent that the full text of this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             State of Connecticut,\n\n\n                                           Executive Chambers,\n\n                                  Hartford, CT, November 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Gentlemen: Yesterday, the House and Senate energy conferees \n     approved of a multibillion dollar omnibus energy bill. The \n     energy bill passed the House just moments ago and, as such, \n     the Senate may hold a vote on the bill as early as tomorrow.\n       While this office is presently engaged in reviewing the \n     finer details of this legislation, a couple of noteworthy \n     items have already come to light that are especially \n     disconcerting.\n       First, this bill undermines the delicate balance of federal \n     and state rights. It gives unprecedented authority and \n     standards of review exclusively to the federal appeals court \n     in the District of Columbia to review actions required for \n     the construction of a natural gas pipeline. State \n     environmental and siting laws would essentially be reduced to \n     a process of rubber stamping Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission (``FERC'') certificates of public convenience and \n     necessity. In addition, any delay, however well founded it \n     may be, such as considering ways to protect the state's \n     natural resources, may be grounds for an appeal and federal \n     override of a state's ruling. State courts would be stripped \n     of jurisdiction over matters arising in the state that not \n     only affect the state, but also relate to the interpretation \n     of state statutes and regulations.\n       Second, this proposed legislation would codify a Department \n     of Energy Order that resulted in the operation of the Cross \n     Sound Cable that runs from New Haven to Brookhaven. You may \n     recall that the Cross Sound Cable was not operational before \n     the August 14, 2003, blackout because the cable failed to \n     meet federal and state permitting requirements concerning its \n     depth. Section 1441 of the bill states that ``Department of \n     Energy Order No. 202-03-2, issued by the Secretary of Energy \n     on August 28, 2003, shall remain in effect unless rescinded \n     by Federal statute.'' This sets a bad precedent.\n       Third, the bill generally limits the time frame for \n     development of Coastal Zone Management consistency appeal \n     records, constraining the states and the Secretary of \n     Commerce in making informed decisions. In the same vein, this \n     legislation limits the record on consistency appeals \n     addressing pipelines to the record developed by the FERC. \n     Historically, FERC's record has been inadequate to evaluate \n     and protect the state's natural resources. The legislation \n     deprives Connecticut and other coastal states of the tools \n     they need to manage their coastal resources.\n       Fourth, this legislation authorizes the postponement of \n     ozone attainment standards across the country when the \n     problems are shown to have originated outside the state. This \n     not only hinders Connecticut's progress toward improving air \n     quality, but also likely has significant health ramifications \n     for Connecticut's residents. Contrary to general practice, \n     this language was added behind closed doors, without \n     meaningful opportunity for public debate.\n       Fifth, the bill contains language that would preempt a \n     state's siting process in areas of interstate congestion, if \n     the FERC were to find that the state delayed or denied a \n     project. State siting authorities may very well be justified, \n     however, in delaying approval or imposing condition for \n     reasons such as public safety or environmental protection. It \n     may also be that the more complex the project, the more time \n     that may be needed to review its complexities. In addition, \n     the applicant may need an extension of time in which to \n     compile additional information for submittal to the siting \n     authority or to negotiate with adverse parties. The existing \n     language fails to take these reasons into account.\n       Finally, the proposed legislation provides immunity, \n     retroactive to September 5, 2003, to MTBE producers from \n     defective product liability arising from groundwater \n     contamination by MTBE. It also provides $2 billion in \n     transition assistance to producers, in preparation for an \n     MTBE ban effective in 2014. It is precisely because of \n     groundwater contamination caused by MTBE that Connecticut has \n     banned its use as a gasoline additive effective January 1, \n     2004. MTBE has been proven to be especially harmful; we \n     likely do not yet know how much damage it has done and \n     perhaps will do. It may be premature at this time to provide \n     such immunity.\n       While improvements are clearly needed to spur investment in \n     energy-related projects to enhance reliability in the power \n     grid, I would urge you to reject this proposed legislation \n     and return it to the House and Senate energy conferees for \n     further deliberation. I would be happy to assist Congress in \n     any way possible to further address these items of particular \n     concern. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John G. Rowland,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I also ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nattorney general of the State of Connecticut expressing other reasons \nto oppose this legislation also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         State of Connecticut,\n\n                                  Hartford, CT, November 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: Yesterday I wrote to you about some \n     pressing concerns about outrageous provisions of the \n     Administration's Energy Bill, and urged you to filibuster it. \n     I write again today to inform you of another assault on well-\n     accepted state powers to protect our citizens--a provision \n     buried in this Bill, discovered during my review.\n       This provision, Subtitle D, new Section 1442, gives the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dictatorial power to \n     preempt and override all other federal agencies and all state \n     laws and officials in approving natural gas pipelines. It \n     would have the clear effect of forcing approval of \n     construction of the disastrous Islander East gas pipeline \n     project through the middle of the pristine Thimble Islands \n     area of Long Island Sound.\n       The Islander East pipeline is, as I have said, the worst \n     case in the worst possible place--an absolute environmental \n     disaster. Every state and federal regulatory agency \n     responsible for reviewing this proposal--the Connecticut \n     Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the United \n     States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service--has found that this \n     project will cause pervasive, enduring harm to the marine \n     environment in this uniquely valuable part of the Sound. Even \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) own staff \n     concluded that there was a clearly environmentally preferable \n     alternative route, if any pipeline should be built across the \n     Sound.\n\n[[Page S15315]]\n\n       While FERC ignored the facts and voted to approve the \n     proposal anyway, the facts arrayed against this proposal are \n     so compelling that we are strongly positioned to stop it in \n     court, because it is insupportable environmentally. Section \n     1442 is plainly intended to strangle our challenge to this \n     project in court, no doubt because we were likely to succeed. \n     Section 1442 drastically changes current law by providing \n     that the courts must accept FERC's determination, although \n     every other state and federal agency disapproves of the \n     project.\n       The breathtaking sweep and far reaching ramifications of \n     Section 1442 would extend well beyond Connecticut. This \n     provision completely and permanently dismembers a carefully \n     crafted system of state and federal checks and balances for \n     all major gas pipeline projects. Under existing law, \n     pipelines require not only the approval of FERC, but state \n     approval for water quality issues, and for effects on the \n     coastal zone environment. State disapprovals on these \n     important environmental grounds are now generally sufficient \n     to bar the proposals. Under this amendment, FERC approval of \n     a project would effectively eliminate all state environmental \n     oversight. One of the other projects that will apparently be \n     rushed to final construction under this bill is the Millenium \n     Pipeline project in Westchester County, New York, which is \n     proposed to run through various minority neighborhoods and \n     under a section of the Hudson River. Senators Schumer and \n     Clinton, among many other New York state officials, have \n     expressed grave concerns about the millenium proposal.\n       This Bill contains many inexcusable giveaways to the energy \n     industry. Even among those giveaways, this one is especially \n     abhorrent, since it grants one federal agency supreme \n     dictatorial power to preempt enforcement of environmental and \n     consumer protection by all other state and federal \n     authorities. It would cause wanton lasting destruction of \n     Long Island Sound. If this Bill is passed, our environment \n     will suffer severe permanent damage, which is absolutely and \n     indisputably unnecessary to any legitimate public interest. \n     Once again, I urge to take a stand against this injustice.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                               Richard Blumenthal.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I will not get into the introduction of the letter and so \nforth, but I will quote from the Governor of a New England State. \nFirst, the Governor says the bill undermines the delicate balance of \nFederal and States rights. Under this legislation, this bill gives \nunprecedented authority and standards of review exclusively to the \nFederal appeals court in the District of Columbia to review actions \nrequired for the construction of a natural gas pipeline. State \nenvironmental and siting laws would essentially be reduced to a process \nof rubberstamping the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission certificates \nof public convenience and necessity.\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       In addition, any delay, however well founded it may be, \n     such as considering ways to protect the State's natural \n     resources, may be grounds for an appeal and Federal override \n     of a State's ruling. State courts would be stripped of \n     jurisdiction over matters arising in the State that not only \n     affect the State, but also relate to the interpretation of \n     State statutes and regulations.\n\n  Now, I have historically opposed a State's right to veto important \nnational efforts, and I include energy as one of them. So I know there \nhave been efforts in the past to say States ought to be able to veto \nmatters that come before them affecting energy policy, but as strongly \nas I have felt that States ought not to have exclusive veto power, I do \nnot think the Federal Government ought to also have veto power when it \ncomes to States needs and necessities.\n  I do not care where one lives in America, but they should pay \nattention to this provision. This is an incredible overreaching by the \nFederal Government. To come in and strip a State's ability to protect \nits own citizens when it comes to natural resources and the energy \nneeds they may have, or a variety of other issues, and to shove those \nmatters up to an appeals court in the District of Columbia, whether one \nis from Georgia, Connecticut, or anywhere else, I think would be highly \noffensive to most people in this country.\n  That is not to say we have it all right. We do not. Lord knows our \nStates can make very parochial decisions, particularly when it comes to \nenergy policy, but the idea that the Federal Government could go into \nany State in this country, regardless of our needs, our concerns, our \nwell-being, and say, I am sorry, you lose, you have no rights at all in \nthese matters. My Governor is right on that issue alone. This bill \nought to be sent back to the conference.\n  We are about to adopt something that overreaches beyond what I think \nmost of my colleagues would support in any other area of law, and yet \nthey are going to do it here. If a precedent is set here, it will \nhappen in other areas as well?\n  My Governor goes on to explain that there are other reasons:\n\n       The bill generally limits the time frame for development of \n     Coastal Zone Management consistency appeal records, \n     constraining the States and the Secretary of Commerce in \n     making informed decisions. In the same vein, this legislation \n     limits the record on consistency appeals addressing pipelines \n     to the record developed by the FERC. Historically, FERC's \n     record has been inadequate to evaluate and protect the \n     State's natural resources. The legislation deprives \n     Connecticut and other coastal States of the tools they need \n     to manage their coastal resources.\n\n  I mention this because the Presiding Officer--we share a lot of \nthings in common, not the least of which we share is having an Atlantic \ncoastline. All of the States on the eastern seaboard, the gulf, the \nwest coast, if they care about coastal zone management--and I know how \nimportant that is all along the Atlantic coast--and wanting a say in \ndetermining how those very delicate and fragile resources will be \nmanaged, this bill makes it more difficult for our States to continue \nin that vein.\n  Reading from the letter:\n\n       The legislation authorizes the postponement of ozone \n     attainment standards across the country when the problems are \n     shown to have originated outside of the State. This not only \n     hinders Connecticut's progress towards improving our air \n     quality, but also likely has significant health \n     ramifications for Connecticut's residents. Contrary to \n     general practice, this language was added behind closed \n     doors, without meaningful opportunity for public debate.\n\n  It would be one thing if this bill were just about energy policy. To \nbe able to now postpone the ozone attainment requirements written in \nlaw, there are literally hundreds of thousands of people in this \ncountry who suffer from significant ailments affecting their \nrespiratory functions. I know of what I speak. I have family members \nwho suffer from asthma. To roll back the provisions of the ozone \nattainment standards in States such as mine and elsewhere is a major \nhealth setback for people.\n  I suspect that various health organizations around the country will \nhave strong feelings about this. If no other provision to this bill \nmoves one to reconsider whether or not we ought to be moving forward, \nthe idea that we could do such great damage to the health of American \ncitizens is enough. We know what causes these problems--and in my State \nof Connecticut we suffer because of the prevailing southwesterly winds \nfor most of the year. So we get a lot of the poor air quality coming \nout of other States. So we have to live with the pollution that exists \nelsewhere. We are trying to stop that on a national level. This \nlegislation will make it very difficult for that to happen in the \nfuture.\n  My Governor goes on and says:\n\n       The bill contains language that would permit a State's \n     siting process in areas of interstate congestion, if the FERC \n     were to find that the State delayed or denied a project. \n     State siting authorities may very well be justified, however, \n     in delaying approval or imposing condition for reasons such \n     as public safety or environmental protection. It may also be \n     that the more complex the project, the more time that may be \n     needed to review its complexities. In addition, the applicant \n     may need an extension of time in which to compile additional \n     information for submittal to the siting authority or to \n     negotiate with adverse parties. The existing language [in \n     this bill] fails to take those reasons into account.\n\n  Again, this goes right back to the first point I made earlier, where \none can come in and basically shove these matters up to the Federal \nappeals court in Washington. Again, I am not suggesting that States \nought to have outright veto power. But the idea that this legislation \nwould say, as categorically as it does, that the FERC could come in if \nthey find that a State denied a project or delayed a project to gather \nmore information, and just roll right over you.\n  Listen to this. The Governor goes on to say:\n\n       The proposed legislation provides immunity, retroactive to \n     September 5, 2003, to the MTBE producers from defective \n     product liability arising from groundwater contamination of \n     MTBE. It also provides $2 billion in transition assistance to \n     producers, in preparation for an MTBE ban effective in 2014. \n     It\n\n[[Page S15316]]\n\n     is precisely because of groundwater contamination caused by \n     MTBE that Connecticut has banned its use as a gasoline \n     additive effective January 1, 2004. MTBE has been proven to \n     be especially harmful; we likely do not yet know how much \n     damage it has done or perhaps will do [to people]. It may be \n     premature at this time to provide such immunity.\n\n  There is a growing body of evidence that this gasoline additive could \nhave caused great damage to people and now we are going to reach back \nto September 5 of this year and provide immunity to the producers of \nthis product to the great detriment of maybe millions of people in this \ncountry. What is that doing in this bill? We talk about tort reform, \nand here we are providing immunity.\n\n  The idea in this bill that we would provide immunity from recovery \nfor people who get sick and suffer as a result of being exposed to \nMTBE, I think is outrageous.\n  I am confident my colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, has \nspoken eloquently on this subject matter. I heard him address the \nmatter the other day in a closed meeting of Senators, and I was moved \nby the evidence that he provided to us. I am confident he has or will \nlay it out again here. So I will not dwell on it.\n  It's bad enough we provide immunity, but now we are going to provide \nMTBE producers with $2 billion in assistance, in preparation for a ban \neffective 11 years from now.\n  Lastly, I mention a rather parochial matter and I don't want to make \nmy opposition to this bill based on parochial issues. But my \nconstituents are very concerned about a provision in this bill that was \nwritten into the bill in conference--never in the House bill, never in \nthe Senate bill--and really tramples all over States rights. It would \ncodify a Department of Energy order that resulted in the operation of \nthe Cross Long Island Sound Cable that runs from New Haven, CT to \nBrookhaven.\n  This Cross Sound Cable was not operational before the August 14 \nblackout because the cable failed to meet the Federal and State \npermitting requirements concerning its depth. Section 1441 of the bill \nstates:\n\n       The Department of Energy order No. 202-03-2, issued by the \n     Secretary of Energy on August 28, shall remain in effect \n     unless rescinded by Federal statute.\n\n  You may say, ``I am sorry that has happened to your State, Senator,'' \nbut it could be yours next.\n  We didn't argue during the blackout about allowing that cable to be \nused, but its continued operation violates state and federal permitting \nrequirements. But that emergency is over. Yet, written into statutory \nlaw, now it says, whether we like it or not, this temporary order is \nnow permanent and it will require a Federal statute to overturn it. Not \neven FERC can overturn it. I have to pass a bill in the Senate to \noverturn it.\n  I grant you it is a local issue, but you ought to be worried about \nit. That is what happens around here: The precedent gets set.\n  These are several of the reasons why I believe this bill deserves to \nbe sent back.\n  It is November. We have another session of Congress coming up. Why \ncan't we go back and do some work on this? I have to believe that most \nMembers think that this bill is just too tilted in one direction. It is \nnot in the best interest of our country to be adopting this type of \nenergy policy.\n  As I mentioned earlier, knowing how important it is for our economy, \nfor our energy self-sufficiency, for our environment, and for health \nreasons, this legislation deserves reconsideration. It is not balanced.\n  So I hope when the hour arrives tomorrow morning, our colleagues \nrespond. This is the kind of bill we will spend a good part of the next \ndecade undoing. When people discover what is really in this bill, they \nwill want to make changes. I think a wiser course of action would be to \ngo back and correct the legislation now and have a bill that would \nenjoy broad bipartisan support. Instead, there will be broad bipartisan \nopposition to invoking cloture tomorrow.\n  These new provisions giving extraordinary power to the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission are really stunning in their scope and breadth. I \nam rather amazed that there has not been more outspoken opposition to \nthis, in more predictable quarters, when States rights are involved.\n  I mentioned earlier the issue of health. I pointed out that dirty air \nfrom outside our State impacts our air quality. It is a major cause of \nasthma and may play a role in the development of that disease.\n  An estimated 86,000 of Connecticut children have asthma that's 10.4 \npercent of the children in my state. And 7.3 percent of the adult \npopulation, approximately 180,000, have it as well. I represent a small \nState, about 3.5 million people. These are significant numbers.\n  The fact that this bill rolls back the provisions on air quality is \ngoing to mean that people in Connecticut are going to suffer. If for no \nother reason, this bill ought to be sent back.\n  We are going to debate Medicare in a few days and talk about how to \nkeep down costs. Asthma doesn't go away. In fact, there is nothing \nworse than an adult onset of asthma. I know because my wife has it and \nshe didn't have it as a kid. It is crippling. Anybody who has it or has \na family member with it knows what I am talking about.\n  There is time left to do this bill right. I hope this institution \nwould take a moment to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/20/senate-section/article/S15316-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
