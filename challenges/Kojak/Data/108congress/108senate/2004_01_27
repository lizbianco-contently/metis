Mr. President, I wish to address an issue that I think \ndeserves even greater attention in the Senate. It has been 6 months now \nsince a senior White House official publicly disclosed one of this \nNation's most protected and valuable national security secrets: the \nidentity of an intelligence operative. This act of political \nretribution not only placed at risk the life of an intelligence \noperative, it put at risk the security of every American.\n  In the war on terrorism, the importance of intelligence agents to our \nnational security simply cannot be overstated. Human intelligence is \nour best weapon against terrorists. By revealing the name of this \noperative, the senior White House official or officials responsible \nacted in an unprecedented manner to break a fundamental bond of trust \nthat protects both the mission and the lives of intelligence officers.\n  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld summarized the stakes involved \nwhen he said:\n\n       Leaks put people's lives at risk. And I think that the \n     people in any branch of Government have the obligation to \n     manage their mouths in a way that does not put people's lives \n     at risk. Folks that leak and put people's lives at risk ought \n     to be in jail.\n\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\n\n  Former President George H.W. Bush put it even more succinctly:\n\n       I have nothing but contempt and anger for those who betray \n     the trust by exposing the names of our sources. They are, in \n     my view, the most insidious of traitors.\n\n  While Republicans, including President Bush and members of his \nCabinet, have been quick to condemn the act of leaking sensitive \ninformation, it took the Justice Department nearly 3 months after this \nleak to announce it was launching an investigation.\n\n  Several more months ensued before Attorney General Ashcroft, in \nresponse to criticism about a potential conflict of interest, removed \nhimself from heading up the investigation and turned it over to another \nJustice Department attorney. Not surprisingly then, given these twists \nand turns, the identity of the leaker remains unknown to this day.\n  Last week, unsatisfied with its apparent lack of progress, a group of \nformer intelligence officers asked Congress to open an immediate \ninquiry into the disclosure of Valerie Plame's name to the media. They \nsaid:\n\n       The disclosure of Ms. Plame's name was an unprecedented and \n     shameful event in American history, and, in our professional \n     judgment, has damaged U.S. national security, specifically \n     the effectiveness of U.S. intelligence gathering using human \n     sources.\n\n  These former intelligence officers took this extraordinary step \nbecause they feared that the Justice Department investigation underway \nmay not uncover those responsible or may attempt to explain away the \nincident as little more than an unfortunate event that does not rise to \nthe level of criminal behavior.\n  No American--Democrat or Republican--can afford to allow this affair \nto be swept under the rug. The cloud of uncertainty hangs over our \nintelligence community. Intelligence agents report growing fear that \nthe community is increasingly viewed as a political tool rather than as \nan instrument of independent and objective discovery and analysis.\n  Too many agents and analysts are beginning to wonder what will happen \nto them if they come forward with facts or analyses that contradict \nofficial policies of the administration.\n  In addition to affecting their work, we should all be concerned about \nthe chilling effect this could have on the willingness of foreign \nnationals to cooperate with our agents if they, too, come to fear their \nidentities could come to be disclosed. These fears are justified. \nLeaking the names of covert agents or other intelligence assets \nrepresents a direct assault on our intelligence community and our \nability to work with foreign agencies and assets.\n  The nature of intelligence officers' work prevents them from ever \nreceiving from the American people the recognition or thanks they \ndeserve. In fact, despite the incredible risks they assume on our \nbehalf, they do not ask for recognition or thanks. All they ask is that \nwe keep faith with them and offer them the protection they need to do \ntheir jobs.\n  Someone in the White House betrayed that trust, and we owe it to \nevery intelligence officer--indeed, to every American--to uncover the \ntruth about this leak and punish those responsible to the fullest \nextent.\n  In order to shed more light, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, \nseveral colleagues, and myself have requested that the GAO investigate \nwhether or not the White House complied with the administrative \nrequirements to safeguard classified information in the case of CIA \noperative Valerie Plame.\n  This investigation is fundamentally different from the Justice \nDepartment investigation currently underway. That investigation will \nassess whether any criminal statutes have been violated.\n  We have asked the GAO to assess a separate, yet equally important, \nquestion of whether the White House followed appropriate internal \nadministrative procedures protecting Ms. Plame's identity and \nresponding to the leak once it occurred.\n  In order to safeguard the lives of our intelligence agents and the \nintegrity of our intelligence process, we have an obligation to \ndiscover the truth about this affair and hold those responsible \naccountable.\n  Yesterday at this time I discussed the growing consensus that Iraq \ndid not, in fact, have weapons of mass destruction prior to the start \nof the war, as we had been told.\n  I said then and I will say today, every Member of this body has a \nresponsibility to review matters such as these and see that this Senate \nlives up to its obligations. We simply cannot afford to ignore what \nhappened, why it happened, and our own responsibility to ensure that it \ndoes not happen again.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I address the legislation at hand, \nI will make a brief response to the distinguished Democrat leader's \nstatement concerning our efforts in Iraq and weapons of mass \ndestruction. I think the Senator from South Dakota has a legitimate \npoint in that there needs to be a thorough evaluation of the \nintelligence and what happened that led us to believe that perhaps some \nof that information was incorrect. I point out, again, that I am very \npleased to note that the overwhelming majority of the American people \nstill believe we did the right thing in Iraq. There is very little \ndoubt in anyone's mind, including the previous administration's \nstatements, that Saddam Hussein had acquired weapons of mass \ndestruction, used weapons of mass destruction, and there is no doubt in \nthis Senator's mind that if he were still in power he would be \nattempting to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\n  Certainly we need to find out all the elements that went into the \nestimates concerning weapons of mass destruction, but at the same time \nthere is a clear record in statements made by the previous President, \nas well as this President, concerning Saddam Hussein's intentions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to say very briefly that Senator \nDaschle's statement regarding the leaking of the name of the \ninformant--someone who worked for the CIA--had nothing to do about \nwhether there were or were not weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. \nSenator Daschle had to leave but he wanted to make sure I made the \nrecord clear. His statement had no reflection on whether there were or \nwere not weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. His statement simply \nrelates to the fact that there simply should be an investigation into \nwho leaked the most sensitive information regarding someone who worked \nfor the CIA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/27/senate-section/article/S266-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S266-S270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PENSION FUNDING EQUITY ACT OF 2003\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nbetween now and 12:30 p.m. shall be equally divided between the bill \nmanagers or their designees.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, a series of high profile events, including \nthe Iowa caucuses, the State of the Union Address, the passage of a \nmassive Omnibus appropriations bill, and today's primary in New \nHampshire have overshadowed our consideration of this measure, and that \nis regrettable.\n  The pension bill that is almost sure to pass this Chamber is folly. \nThe amendment offered by Senators Grassley, Baucus, Gregg, and Kennedy, \nwhile addressing the short-term interests of a handful of special \ninterests, could further exacerbate a severe pension underfunding \nproblem. I might say this measure is recognized as such by the \nadministration.\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\n  As an editorial in yesterday's Washington Post noted:\n\n       Not for the first time, Congress has muscled up to an \n     important problem, taken a good look at it and resolved to \n     make it worse.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial of Monday, January 26, \nentitled ``Pension Perniciousness'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 26, 2004]\n\n                         Pension Perniciousness\n\n       Not for the first time, Congress has muscled up to an \n     imported problem, taken a good long look at it and resolved \n     to make it worse. The problem is the vast hole in the \n     nation's corporate pension schemes, and the perverse rules \n     that helped create them. Congress's solution, championed in \n     the Senate by an alliance of Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-\n     Iowa), Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Edward \n     M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), is to reward the hole-diggers with what \n     amounts to a $16 billion loan from taxpayers.\n       About one in five private-sector workers has a ``defined-\n     benefit'' pension, the sort in which an employer guarantees a \n     certain pension to its workers when they retire. To pay for \n     these future benefits, employers are supposed to put \n     sufficient money into a pension fund; the problem is they \n     often don't. The gap between money put aside and money needed \n     in the underfunded pension plans comes to an enormous $350 \n     billion. When companies go bust, the Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corp., the government-backed entity that insures pensions, \n     gets saddled with plans that are in deficit. As a result, the \n     PBGC itself has a deficit of 11.2 billion, which taxpayers \n     may have to plug eventually. As more companies go bust, more \n     of the $350 billion problem out there in the private sector \n     will land on taxpayers' shoulders.\n       Why do companies run these pension deficits? Because \n     regulations perversely encourage them to do so. If a firm \n     gives workers a pay raise, it will have to pay for that \n     immediately; if it gives them an increase in their pension, \n     accounting rules allow it to defer the cost into the future. \n     This deferral is especially tempting for cash-strapped \n     companies--which often means ones with a strong chance of \n     going bust. Bethlehem Steel, for example, upped its pension \n     promises and declared bankruptcy three years later. Wobbly \n     companies that underfund their pensions would pay extra \n     insurance premiums if the insurer were a private company. But \n     the PBGC's rules do not allow it to price risk properly, \n     adding a further incentive for shaky companies to hitch a \n     free ride with the others.\n       There is, as Congress is demonstrating, no political \n     constituency for fixing this problem. Weak companies with \n     underfunded pensions lobby lawmakers for permission to \n     continue their imprudence; labor leaders from those same \n     firms lobby lawmakers in the same direction; nobody is on the \n     other side. In the deal currently being cooked up, a group of \n     hard-pressed companies led by the steel industry and the \n     airlines will be given a special break for two years; if any \n     of these firms goes bust in the meantime, the public will end \n     up shouldering the deficits, which is why the congressional \n     measure amounts to a taxpayer loan.\n       Yet taxpayer support for people in defined-benefit pension \n     plans is a perverse notion. Fully one in two private-sector \n     workers has no company plan whatever. Why should the less \n     fortunate bail out the lucky ones?\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the editorial goes on to say:\n\n       There is, as Congress is demonstrating, no political \n     constituency for fixing this problem. Weak companies with \n     underfunded pensions lobby lawmakers for permission to \n     continue their imprudence; labor leaders from those same \n     firms lobby lawmakers in the same direction; nobody is on the \n     other side. In the deal currently being cooked up, a group of \n     hard-pressed companies led by the steel industry and the \n     airlines will be given a special break for two years; if any \n     of these firms goes bust in the meantime, the public will end \n     up shouldering the deficits, which is why the congressional \n     measure amounts to a taxpayer loan.\n       Yet taxpayer support for people in defined-benefit pension \n     plans is a perverse notion. Fully one in two private-sector \n     workers has no company pension plan whatever. Why should the \n     less fortunate bail out the lucky ones?\n\n  Once again, Congress is poised to give another handout to certain \nairline, steel, and labor interests, regardless of the costs this could \nimpose on the employees and retirees of these businesses and ultimately \non American taxpayers. By allowing these entities to dig their already \nunderfunded plans further into debt, we are creating a very real risk \nof defaults. When this occurs, the Federal agency that ensures private \nsector fixed benefit plans, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, \nor PBGC, will be the first to try to cover this liability. The PBGC \nitself is hugely in deficit and ultimately the American taxpayer is on \nthe hook.\n  I join the PBGC in opposing this proposal that relieves severely \nunderfunded pension funds of the obligation to make deficit reduction \ncontributions, or DRCs, to catch up on their deficits. As the PBGC's \ndirector has said:\n\n       Giving a special break to weak companies with the worst-\n     funded plans is a dangerous gamble.\n\n  In a letter to the majority leader last week, the directors of the \nPBGC, Cabinet Secretaries Chao, Snow, and Evans, wrote:\n\n       It would be irresponsible to amend the interest rate bill \n     with any additional provisions that would significantly \n     further exacerbate systemic plan underfunding. If H.R. 3108 \n     were amended to do so, we as the PBGC board would recommend \n     that the President veto the legislation.\n\n  The Grassley, Baucus, Gregg, and Kennedy amendment does just that. In \naddition to being fiscally irresponsible, the amendment is grossly \nunfair, once again lavishing Federal largesse on selected industries \nand companies.\n  Explaining why the pension system is already in jeopardy, the PBGC \ndirectors wrote:\n\n       The PBGC reported a record single-employer program deficit \n     of $11.2 billion through the end of 2003, three times larger \n     than any previously recorded deficit. Last year, the General \n     Accounting Office added the PBGC's single-employer pension \n     program to its ``high risk'' Federal program list. In \n     addition, the PBGC remains exposed to $85 billion in pension \n     underfunding in single-employer plans sponsored by \n     financially weak employers. The PBGC also reported the first-\n     multiemployer deficit in two decades.\n\n  As the Secretaries explained in another letter sent last November:\n\n       The DRC rules were put into place to guard against the \n     continuing deterioration of funding levels in underfunded \n     plans. These rules were designed to protect participants' \n     accrued benefits and the financial integrity of the \n     pension insurance system. Suspension of the DRC rules \n     would mean a significant further reduction in the \n     resources available to meet the promises made to existing \n     and future retirees. Moreover, suspending DRC rules would \n     jeopardize pension funding in the future, as companies \n     begin to fund their plans less prudently in anticipation \n     of extraordinary relief from their contributions when the \n     plans become underfunded.\n\n  Despite these warnings and a $400 billion gap between what companies \nhave contributed to their pension funds and what they owe under their \nplans, why is the Senate ready to give companies whose pensions are \nseverely underfunded a pass on their obligations to ensure their \nemployees' retirement pay? Because, we are told, economic forces beyond \nanyone's control have come together to create a ``perfect storm.''\n  The extraordinary coincidence of low interest rates and a poorly \nperforming stock market, proponents claim, has led to big losses and \ncreated a unique hardship for these companies' pension funds.\n  A look at historical contributions suggests, however, that the \nanomalous ``perfect economic weather'' of the last decade is as likely \nan explanation for the current sorry shape of pension plans as the \n``perfect economic storm.'' In the 1990s, record stock market returns \nallowed companies radically to reduce or simply not budget for pension \ncontributions. Whereas single-employer pension contributions totaled \n$63 billion between 1980 and 1984, between 1990 and 1995 single-\nemployer pension contributions amounted to only $26 billion.\n  Clearly, today's economic climate is not what it was in the late \n1990s, and I do not question that many companies now face significant \nliabilities to their pension funds. I am not proposing that nothing be \ndone, and the base bill, H.R. 3108, provides enormous relief to all \npension funds by adjusting the way in which contributions and assets \nare calculated so as to reduce companies' obligations to their pension \nfunds by $80 billion.\n  The Grassley, Baucus, Gregg, and Kennedy amendment, however, would \ngive another huge break to a very select group of entities. Why, when \ncompanies' pension liabilities are so high, should we let a favored few \nwalk away from their responsibilities to their employees and retirees? \nWhy should the Senate permit these select entities to use money that \nshould go to reduce their pension deficits for other purposes, and \ninvite them to dig themselves deeper in the hole, especially when it is \nlikely that the American taxpayers, many of whom have no pension plans, \nare going to have to bail them out?\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\n  We can talk about economic ``perfect storms,'' interest rates, and \nbull and bear markets, but I hope that people understand that we are \nreally talking about the ability of retirees to pay their heating \nbills, buy needed medicine and groceries, and visit their \ngrandchildren. Even if, as I suspect the managers and union officials \nwho support the amendment cynically calculate, the PBGC will assume \npension liabilities if plan sponsors default, the benefits that \nparticipants will get from PBGC will likely be far less than what they \nwere counting on receiving.\n  There is no doubt that current pensions laws are in desperate need of \nreform, but I don't support DRC relief in a vacuum.\n  The amendment contains yet another bailout of certain airlines, steel \nproducers, and one apparently very special labor union. DRC relief is \ngranted to these entities with no restrictions. Any other entity that \nwants to receive DRC relief has to show that it is able to meet its \nfuture contributions in a timely manner. Let me repeat that. Any other \nentity that wants DRC relief must show that it can make its future \ncontributions. Certain passenger airlines, steel producers, and one \nunion, however, get a DRC break, regardless.\n  Let us talk about the airline industry. I was one of the first people \nto support giving financial assistance to this industry in the \naftermath of September 11. At the onset of the Iraq War, I supported, \nwith some reservations, additional temporary relief to the industry. \nBut here we are again facing another cry for help and an outstretched \nhand. Let us review the assistance to the airlines over the past few \nyears.\n  After September 11, Congress provided to the airlines $5 billion in \ndirect payments to compensate for losses stemming from the September 11 \nattacks; $10 billion in loan guarantees; Federal terrorism insurance; \n$68 million in reimbursements for increased insurance costs; and, \nliability protection against claims arising in connection with the \nSeptember 11 attack.\n  Later in 2001, Congress provided that the Federal Government assume \nresponsibility for security from the airlines.\n  In the legislation that established the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, Congress extended the terrorism insurance.\n  In the Iraq Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, Congress \nprovided $2.3 billion directly to the airlines in the proportional \nshare each carrier has paid the TSA or collected in passenger security \nand air carrier security fees, and suspended security fees from June 1 \nthrough September 30, 2003. This has been estimated to provide a \nsavings of $700 million to airlines.\n  Congress has appropriated almost $200 million to reimburse airlines \nfor hardened cockpit door installation.\n  In the FAA reauthorization bill that was just signed into law \nCongress once again extended terrorism insurance--through March 30, \n2008.\n  I don't begrudge the airlines the assistance Congress has provided to \ndate, and I understand that the industries' health is inextricably \nbound to the well-being of our economy. That said, I won't continue to \nsupport special aid to airlines without some accountability. We can't \nseem to go more than 6 months without the airline industry asking \nCongress for another handout. I have not doubt that they will be up \nhere again soon asking for tax relief, relief from security fee \nobligations, or some other form of aid.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for workers and taxpayers, and \nagainst a bailout. Disregarding the interests of their employees and \nmembers, management and labor have joined in urging Congress to support \nthe amendment by Senators Grassley, Baucus, Gregg, and Kennedy, that is \npremised on the hope that companies' currently inadequate pension \nassets will recover, not through contributions, but through rising \ninterest rates and a robust stock market. I know the Super Bowl is \ncoming up, but this ``Hail Mary'' pass is not the right move. Let us \nspend a little time crafting a true pension reform bill rather than \nsimply rushing through a bill that will benefit a handful of coddled \nindustries at the risk of workers and taxpayers throughout this \ncountry.\n  If, as I am afraid will happen, however, the amendment providing \nselect DRC relief is adopted, and this folly is enacted into law, I \nwould expect that companies and unions that avail themselves of this \nrelief will freeze the compensation of their highest paid officials at \nthe same time. If companies and unions determine that they cannot or \nwill not make contributions to their severely underfunded pension plans \nand honor their obligations to their rank and file, they should not \nthen turn around and increase the princely sums being paid to their top \nexecutives. We will be watching.\n  To reiterate, the airlines were major recipients of this pending \namendment, the Grassley-Baucus-Gregg-Kennedy amendment. After September \n11, Congress already provided the airlines $5 billion in direct \npayments to compensate for losses stemming from September 11, $10 \nbillion in loan guarantees, Federal terrorism insurance, $68 million in \nreimbursement for increased insurance costs, and liability protection \nagainst claims arising in connection with September 11. Later, Congress \nprovided that the Federal Government assume responsibility for security \nfor the airlines. The list goes on and on about what we have already \ndone for the airlines and now another bailout for the airlines. I \nreally strongly object to the selectivity of this amendment and I don't \nknow how you rationalize it.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, is there a time limit?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is a time limit. The Senator \nhas 9 minutes 42 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have an \nadditional 5 minutes. Perhaps it has to be yielded to me by someone.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the request be \nmodified so that if someone from the majority wishes to speak for an \nextra 5 minutes after Senator Baucus, they be allowed to do so.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Working For A Better America\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I simply wish to say thank you. I rise to \nsay thanks to all my colleagues, particularly here in the Senate, my \nfriends and family in Montana and across the country, my wife Wanda and \nmy son Zeno, my mother, and so many others. Thank you for the best \nwishes, the get-well cards, flowers, phone calls, and e-mails for the \npast few weeks. It is astounding how much we do live in kind of a \nglobal village and how connected we are. I deeply appreciate the \nconcern of so many of my very good friends.\n  A few weeks ago, I underwent surgery for a condition known as \nsubdural hematoma which was the result of a fall I took in November \nwhile running in what is called the JFK 50 Miler in Maryland. You might \nask, Why in the world would someone want to run 50 miles? I sometimes \nask myself. Nonetheless, it was then that I took a fall, and as a \nconsequence of that fall, I had this condition called subdural \nhematoma.\n  I must say I am very grateful to the doctors, nurses, and everyone \nwho was very helpful. They have encouraged me to take my time. They \ndidn't want me to do something stupid or dumb, or to get back to work \ntoo quickly. Unfortunately, as you well know, we have 24-hour news \nservice these days. When I was at home, I had an extremely bad case of \ncabin fever. I could hardly wait to get back to work. The doctor said \nstay home. Wanda said stay home. My friends said stay home. So I stayed \nhome for a little while.\n  In all seriousness, I am very delighted to be back in this Chamber \nand back in the Senate with all of you, doing what I love; that is, \nrepresenting Montanans and working to make their lives better.\n  Following the surgery, I have been asked several times if any of this \nhas changed my perspective. Does it give me pause? The answer, \nobviously, is that it does; clearly, it does. It gives you a deeper \nsense of perspective. It is humbling. I am sure the response would be \ndifferent for different people, but for me, it caused me to just think \na little more clearly and deeply about what we are all about and what \nwe are doing.\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\n  I must say I think it has been very helpful. It makes one deeply \nappreciate what we have in life--our family, our friends, including our \nhealth. It also reinforces one's resolve. It makes you want to keep \ndriving, pushing, working to create change and help people. You \nrealize, even more, that we have only a finite amount of time here to \nget our work done. It subtly reminds you about the ever-daunting \ndeadline that time imposes on all of us, the sense we have to get as \nmuch done as we can in the short time we have been given so as not to \nwaste one day, an hour, or a minute.\n  It also reinforces what my Indian friends taught me so long ago in \nMontana--that we have a moral obligation to leave this place in as good \nor better shape than we found it, to pass on to our kids and our \ngrandkids an America as great as our parents bestowed upon us.\n  It is written in Scripture that much is expected from those to whom \nmuch has been given. As Americans--particularly as Members of the \nSenate--we have been given an awful lot. We have a lot of work ahead of \nus.\n  That is why it is imperative we look to the example of leadership set \nby so many here in this Chamber--courageous yet humble leaders such as \nmy friend and mentor, former majority leader of the U.S. Senate, \nAmbassador Mike Mansfield. I don't know of a more gentle, a more \nstrong, or, in a sense, a more profound man than Mike Mansfield. He is \na man to whom we should all look up for leadership and try to \nexemplify, although we may never get there, as much as possible.\n  We have a big year ahead of us. For my part, I will continue to work \ntogether with all of you--my distinguished colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle--to make America an even better place to live, to work, and \nto raise a family.\n  I look forward to passing a new transportation bill that will create \njobs and ensure safety on our Nation's roads.\n  I look forward to reforming our pension system to ensure that workers \nand their families' life savings are protected.\n  I look forward to working with my good friend, chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley, to pass our JOBS bill, \notherwise known as FSC/ETI reform, and to give a boost to domestic \nmanufacturing and create jobs.\n  I look forward to working together to boost agriculture in our \ncountry and get international markets open to U.S. beef as soon as \npossible.\n  I look forward to cracking down on tax cheats. There are too many \npeople who cheat Americans by breaking the law in our income tax \ncode. I look forward to making a greater investment in education, \nsomething we do not do enough of in this Chamber.\n\n  I look forward to working together to curb the rising number of \nuninsured Americans. I was lucky. I had surgery performed by excellent \npeople. I am fortunate enough to have good health insurance coverage. A \nlot of Americans do not. An event like this reminds us that the 43.6 \nmillion Americans who go without health insurance must have it. We in \nCongress, who do have the security of good health insurance, must do \nmuch more to assure that more Americans and soon all Americans have \nhealth insurance. We are not doing enough.\n  We tend to get all involved in lots of peripheral issues and not \nspend enough time on the core issues. I daresay that health insurance \ninadequacy, the cost of health insurance, is probably the first, \nsecond, and third most important issue facing Americans. We do not \nspend enough time on it.\n  We have an aggressive agenda before the Senate. It is up to us to \nfulfill the promises we made, set aside partisan differences, and work \ntogether--not talk about it but do it. Do what is right for America. \nMove our country forward. It is up to us to lead. People want Congress \nto do what is right. Most Americans are not partisan. They are not very \nrightwing or very leftwing. Most Americans are in the big middle. They \nwant the Congress to do what is right. It is up to us to provide that \nleadership.\n  I say thank you. I deeply appreciate my colleagues in the Senate. It \nis my distinct honor and privilege to serve here.\n  I also will address the pension bill and the pending managers' \namendment that will be before the Senate later today. First, I thank \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, and also Senator \nKennedy, who gave some very kind remarks a few days ago, and Chairman \nGregg for their collective persistence, determination, and their \nwillingness to work together. Here is a good example of the two \ncommittees, the leadership from both committees on both sides of the \naisle, working together to craft a very important piece of legislation. \nThe amendment before the Senate is truly bipartisan. I also thank again \nSenator Kennedy for managing the bill in my absence and I deeply \nappreciate his kind words on the floor a few days ago.\n  Now let me turn back to the pension bill and the managers' amendment. \nThis legislation helps address the retirement security of literally \nmillions of workers and retirees. It seeks to support the pension \nbenefits they have earned and upon which they rely for their economic \nwell-being. It is an important step to help preserve the embattled \ndefined pension benefit plan. And it is embattled.\n  The security of our pension system is at stake. Daily we hear \nemployers are dropping out of the defined benefit plan system. The \nreasons are simple. The defined benefit plans require a commitment on \nthe part of the employer. This is a commitment many employers are no \nlonger willing to make or can afford to make.\n  A recent survey found that 15 percent of the defined benefit plan \nsponsors have frozen plans since January 1, 2001. That means these \nplans will no longer allow workers to earn more benefits. Another 6 \npercent are actively considering freezing the defined benefit plans. \nThis could mean that more than one in five employees earning a \nguaranteed retirement benefit will not earn future benefits.\n  We need to ask what caused this and what can we do. According to the \nsurvey, the most common reason for freezing the defined benefit plans \nis the cost--not just the total cost but also the volatility and \nunpredictability of the cost. It is one thing to have an obligation you \ncan put in the budget projections. Businessmen love to know what is \ngoing on. We understand that. Then business can build a plan to meet \ncertain obligations. It is another thing to have costs that vary wildly \nfrom year to year. You do your best to project these costs, but it is \ndifficult. Having cash available for investment in growth and expansion \nis critical to a successful business. Fluctuating minimum contribution \nrequirements make good business plans very difficult.\n\n  In the worst of times, a large unexpected contribution requirement \ncan spell disaster. It can bankrupt an enterprise. That enterprise has \nto turn the unfunded pension liability over to the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation, known as the PBGC.\n  Last September, the Finance Committee marked up the National Employee \nSavings and Trust Equity Guarantee Act, a bill that includes a set of \nlong-term funding changes to address the situation. That bill provides \ntemporary relief for companies that are suffering. It provides a \ntemporary substitute for the 30-year Treasury rate, similar to the \nprovision in the amendment before the Senate today. It also provides \ntemporary relief for the deficit reduction contribution for companies \nthat were well funded in the year 2000. These provisions were designed \nto give companies relief from large contribution cash demands.\n  The Finance Committee bill includes provisions to allow companies to \nput more money into their plans when times are good, and the bill \nprovides for long-term replacement of the 30-year Treasury rate with a \nyield curve, which is a conservative basis for liability measurement.\n  We need to look at long-term reforms such as those included in the \nFinance Committee bill. I hope we will do that later this year.\n  We have an immediate, more pressing need to deal with the problems we \nface today: low interest rates, the effects of recent market downturns, \nand the resulting high contribution requirements that companies will \nface if we do not take action today. Normally, low interest rates are \ngood, but in this case they tend to exacerbate the problem with respect \nto defined benefit guarantee plans. Increased payments\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\nwould have to be made as early as April 15. We must act quickly to \nprovide the needed relief.\n  The pending managers' amendment has three important components to \ndeal with the immediate problems we face. First, it substitutes the \nlong-term corporate bond rate with a 30-year Treasury rate. Second, it \nprovides partial relief from deficit reduction contributions from \ncompanies that did not make a deficit reduction contribution in 2000. \nAnd it provides temporary relief from experience loss amortization \npayments for multiemployer plans.\n  These are not long-term solutions. They will provide short-term \nrelief from contribution volatility for employers who have been \ngenerous enough to provide defined benefit programs for their \nemployees.\n  The more important factor in the health of the defined benefit system \nand of the PBGC, which guarantees the benefits of the system, is the \nhealth of the employers in response to the plans. The short-term relief \nprovisions will help. The more employers who stay in the system, the \nhealthier those employers and the stronger the system.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to come up with a long-\nterm solution. But the provisions in this bill cannot wait. The \nretirement security of millions of workers hangs in the balance. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/27/senate-section/article/S270-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the hour of 2:15 \np.m. having arrived, the time until 2:30 will be equally divided \nbetween the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, and the Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Baucus, or their designees.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana is otherwise \noccupied for the moment, so we are going to turn our attention, through \nmyself and Senator Kyl, to the legislation we are considering, which is \ncritically important and which has to do with pension plans and \noffering predictable solutions.\n  There are many people who I would like to thank, but I will not do \nthat because I only have 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The legislation we are considering enacts critical reforms that will \nshore up defined benefit pension plans upon which so many Americans \ndepend. Today, we are updating the interest rate that companies must \nuse when they calculate the liabilities of their pension plans. An \nindex of long-term corporate bond rates is surely more accurate as a \nmeasurement of expected investment return than the now entirely defunct \n30-year Treasury rate.\n  This bill also provides a grace period for pension plans, including \nmultiemployer plans, which have experienced extraordinary losses in the \nrecent stock market declines. Make no mistake, if companies are not \naccorded reasonable flexibility in funding their plans, then they will \nnot be able to maintain or afford plans for their workers, and their \nworkers will hurt. I know of that because I live in a State where that \nsurrounds me.\n  I hope today's action is only the first step in a thoughtful and \ncareful process to provide meaningful reforms for the defined benefit \npension plan system. Congress ought to do all it can to encourage \nemployers to provide retirement security through such plans.\n  Today, only 35,000 companies provide defined benefit pension plans, \nwhich is less than a quarter of the plans available 20 years ago. That \nis a big loss. Given the volatility we have seen in the stock market \nover the last few years, more employees would benefit from having the \nopportunity to earn secure, predictable pension benefits.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues to address the other \nimportant issues facing companies that are interested in providing \ndefined benefit pension plans. For example, Congress ought to \nreconsider the funding rules to ensure that companies are able to \ninvest appropriately in their pension plans when business is good and \nprofits are strong. We also need to consider ways to strengthen the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation which, to say the very least, is \nstretched dangerously thin.\n  I hope my colleagues will work with me on important reforms such as \nthese so we can improve retirement security for millions of Americans. \nAs I ask my colleagues to do exactly that, I remind them of the people \nwho are dependent upon us. I have met with many West Virginians who \nhave worked hard all of their lives--as they say, played by the rules--\nand earned pension benefits from their employers, only to have the rug \npulled out from under them in retirement. It is a painful, painful \nsight.\n  Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel, Weirton Steel, Kaiser Aluminum, and \nSpecial Metals--and I am talking about companies in West Virginia--have \nbeen taken over by the PBGC in recent years. Retirees who dedicated \ntheir working years to those companies have told me how scared they \nare. Many have also lost their health insurance. Without their full \npension benefits, they have no way to provide for their health care \nneeds.\n  Some people--and I am talking about seniors who are 60 or 65 years \nold--have told me they are looking for work. Part of their so-called \nretirement will be spent on the job because the pension benefits they \nwere promised--the benefits they did earn--have been taken away.\n  The legislation we are considering today will not solve all problems. \nMore comprehensive pension reform is needed. But I am pleased this bill \nwill help companies maintain pension plans that otherwise might have \nbeen canceled.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2234\n\n  I would also like to take a moment to address the amendment that has \nbeen offered by my colleague from Arizona. On behalf of the \nsteelworkers of my State and the steelworkers of the State of the \nPresiding Officer, and on behalf of steelworkers across this country \nand many other hundreds of thousands of working people, I want to \noppose the amendment that the Senator has offered.\n  The legislation that Congress is considering today is designed to \nhelp companies maintain critical pensions on which workers are \ndepending. We are doing so to protect workers from losing benefits that \nthey have been promised. We understand some companies, faced with \nparticularly hard times, are unable to immediately make up the \ninvestment losses recently suffered by pension plans. If companies \ncannot afford to meet strict deficit reduction contribution \nrequirements, they might be compelled to abandon pension plans and \nleave workers without secure retirement benefits.\n  Having said this, the Kyl amendment would dramatically decrease the \nsecurity of hard-earned retirement benefits. The amendment \nfundamentally undermines the guarantee provided by the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation which insures the defined benefit retirement \nplans. Let me be very clear about that because the PBGC is, \nunfortunately, something that we know a great deal about in the part of \nthe country I come from. I repeat, the Senator's amendment would \ndramatically decrease the security of hard-earned retirement benefits. \nIt undermines the guaranteed portion of the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation. If Congress is going to change the guarantee provided by \nthe PBGC, we must look for ways to improve the guaranteed benefit, not \nundermine it.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Americans currently depend on PBGC for their \nretirement security. These are people who toiled away for years, often \nin very dangerous occupations, in all kinds of them. It is absolutely \nessential that we do not erode the already inadequate guarantee that \nprotects these workers in their old age. Retirees depend upon PBGC \npayments to pay for food, housing, and, increasingly, to cover health \ncare costs when retiree health benefits have been reduced or \neliminated, as is so often the case. It would be unconscionable for \nCongress to provide relief to cash-strapped companies to help them \nmaintain the pension plans they offer, only to punish the employees of \nthose companies by\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\ndenying them the benefits they have earned.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in standing up for workers and \ndefeat this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes to speak to the amendment which I have offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me point out what we are doing here and then explain the \nvery modest amendment I have offered which would not undermine the \npension guarantee for employees.\n  The basic problem we have is that the Treasury note that was used to \ncalculate the payments that companies make to the fund to guarantee \npensions for their employees is no longer being issued, so some \nsubstitute had to be found. The underlying bill uses the 30-year \nTreasury note as that substitute. I think everybody agrees that needs \nto be done on a temporary basis.\n  There was a deficit created in the pension fund because companies \nwere not paying in the appropriate amount during the period of time \nthat the Treasury note was not being issued. As a result, the fund \naccrued a deficit. It is over $11 billion. So companies are being asked \nto pay in a deficit reduction contribution to make sure that the fund \nhas the money that is required to ensure that employees will receive \ntheir benefits.\n  Ironically, it is the proponents of the amendment that are \nundercutting the fund because what they are saying is not everybody \nwill have to pay their fair share into the fund to guarantee payments \nto employees; that for a couple of steel companies and a couple of \nairlines, they will not have to make the full deficit reduction \ncontribution. Instead, in the first year, they only have to pay 20 \npercent of what is required. In the second year, they would only pay 40 \npercent of what is required. That, obviously, is going to mean, for \nthose companies, they are not paying in what they should be to ensure \nthat their employees are fully covered.\n  All my amendment does is say that given the fact that in this \nsituation an employer is not paying in the full amount, the pension \nguaranty board should not be on the hook for benefits that are accrued \njust during this period of time. So what we say is that if a business \ntakes advantage of this special rule, and if it fails during the 2-year \nperiod that this is in effect or 2 years thereafter, then all of the \nbenefits that accrued during that period of time would not be \nguaranteed by the board. In other words, the corporation would have to \nhold harmless the pension guaranty board.\n  If we don't do this, then the prediction that the board members who \nare in charge made in their recent letter would potentially come true. \nThe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has three board members: The \nSecretary of Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of \nLabor. They wrote a letter to Leader Frist on January 22 and this is \namong the things they said:\n\n       We believe that H.R. 3108 would best protect pensions and \n     pensioners if passed free of any provisions to alter the \n     Deficit Reduction Contribution rules.\n\n  The underlying amendment does, in fact, alter the deficit reduction \ncontribution rules.\n\n       Specifically, it would be irresponsible to amend the \n     interest rate bill with any additional provisions that would \n     significantly further exacerbate systemic pension plan \n     underfunding.\n\n  Obviously, if you don't require all of the companies to pay in their \nfair share, you are, in fact, undermining the fund. They conclude by \nsaying:\n\n       If H.R. 3108 were amended to do so, we as the PBGC board \n     would recommend that the President veto the legislation.\n\n  My point in mentioning this is to note that it may be that the amount \nof money we are talking about would not be interpreted as significantly \nunderfunding. That would be the hope because if it would be, then I \ndon't think any of us would be happy. But what I would suggest is that \nas a way of ensuring that the impact is minimized, my amendment should \nbe adopted. It is very minimal. It simply says for those companies, if \nany, that choose to take advantage of this special waiver from the \ndeficit reduction contribution, if they fail during this 2-year waiver \nperiod, then only the benefits that are accrued during that period \nwould not be covered. That is to say, they would have to hold harmless \nthe pension guaranty board for that amount of money.\n  The reason is obvious: They are not paying in. They should not \nreceive the benefit of the guarantee. If they want to receive the \nbenefit of the guarantee for those benefits, then pay in their fair \nshare. Obviously, they are totally covered for all of the benefits \naccrued up to that date because they paid in up to that date. So we are \nbasically saying: If you choose as a corporation to take advantage of \nthis waiver and not pay in what everybody else has to pay in, you \nshould be on the hook for that amount of money. You should not ask the \ntaxpayers or your rivals in business, your competitors, or the board to \ntry to make up that difference.\n  The reality is, we are not talking about a great deal of money. The \nprinciple is important and would help to make this underlying amendment \na little bit more palatable to some of us on this side and to the \nadministration.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want my colleague from Arizona to \nlisten. If I misstate this, I hope he will correct me. I urge our \ncolleagues to vote in favor of the Kyl amendment.\n  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is in trouble. It guarantees \npensions, both single-employer plans and multiemployer plans, and it \ndoesn't have enough money to provide the guarantees that it has already \nmade.\n  So there is a catchup provision that says, well, you should pay up; \nyou should help. This bill we are getting ready to pass is going to \nmake it easier on some companies--airlines and steel--so they don't \nhave to pay as much on the catchup. The Senator's amendment says if \nthose companies grant additional benefits, i.e., increased pensions, \nand if they go upside down--declare bankruptcy--PBGC will not be held \nfor any incremental benefits increase during this 2-year period of \ntime; is that correct?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I may correct one aspect. Theoretically, a \nnew employee would be a new benefit, but the reality is that since the \naccrual or the benefit is usually a 3- to 5-year time period, new \nemployees would not in fact be covered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield further, you want to make sure \npeople are not receiving additional pension changes, i.e., increasing \nbenefits by 10 percent for all covered employees?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that is one of the purposes of this. To be \nclear, technically, a new employee would be counted, but since the \nbenefits don't accrue for 3 to 5 years anyway, it probably would be de \nminimis.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the Kyl amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nChambliss) and the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) would vote ``nay.''\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), the \nSenator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Maryland (Ms. \nMikulski) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMontana (Mr. Baucus) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nwould each vote ``yea.''\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could I have the attention of the \nchairman of the Finance Committee? Would the Senator enlighten us as to \nwhat he expects as far as when we are going to complete this \nlegislation? As the Senator well knows, we have been on it Wednesday, \nWednesday afternoon, Thursday afternoon, Friday, Monday, and today. We \nhave had one amendment. I know we are going to run into all kinds of \nproblems later on in the session about time, and I was just wondering \nwhat the leadership intended to do on this bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We hope to work out agreements on all of the remaining \namendments yet today and then have a vote tomorrow and close down very \nshortly because of weather.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. I do not believe there are any amendments on this \nside.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. There is one more on this side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. I look forward to working with the chairman. We \nare together on this.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As a matter of interest, Members on our side have \ninquired about how we were going to proceed on the legislation. I \nwanted to give them some opportunity. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over the past few days we have had a good \ndebate and discussion of the challenges facing the defined benefit \npension plan system. I thank my colleagues for engaging with us on \nthese issues that are so vital to the well-being of American workers \nand their families.\n  As I and others have mentioned, defined benefit pension plans provide \na greater certainty and greater security to retirees. Every American \ndeserves this kind of security in his or her old age in terms of \nretirement. There are savings, which are so important, Social Security \nand pensions. We have seen savings reduced significantly with our \neconomic downturn and we have also seen the pensions of so many of our \ncitizens threatened.\n  This legislation is designed, as pointed out earlier, to try to deal \nwith a particular challenge in a temporary way until we can reach a \nfinal determination on how we are going to proceed. But it is \nabsolutely essential.\n  This week we have taken the first important step to stabilizing our \nNation's pension plans, which have been battered by a perfect storm of \neconomic conditions over the last 3 years.\n  I again thank Chairman Grassley, the ranking minority member, Senator \nBaucus, as well as our HELP committee chairman, Senator Gregg, for \nworking with all of us to develop a moderate bipartisan measure to \naddress the pension system's short-term problems. This amendment does \nnot weaken the existing funding bill. It simply provides temporary, \nmoderate relief to give companies and workers the breathing room needed \nto take steps to further protect these pension plans. We must take \nadvantage of this time to improve and expand our pension system.\n  More and more American workers are finding themselves without a \npension. Since 2000, 3.3 million Americans have lost their pension \ncoverage. In 2002, only 53 percent of our Nation's workers were \nparticipating in retirement plans--the lowest level in over a decade. \nOnly one in five workers today has a secure defined benefit plan.\n  This drop in pension coverage is part of an overall decline in the \nquality of jobs and the quality of benefits that American workers are \nreceiving. American workers are working harder than ever, but they are \ngetting less and less for their effort.\n  I want to take a few moments here on the floor of the Senate to \nremind our friends and colleagues what the real state of the union is \nwith regard to workers in our country at this time.\n  As recently as today, there were statements and comments by the \nchairman of the Federal Reserve. On CNN, they asked the question: Do \nyou agree with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comment that \nnew jobs will replace old jobs as they always have?\n  We could ask that in this Chamber. I wonder what the answer would be. \nThe American people get it--certainly the viewers of CNN do. This is \nnonscientific, but it is a reaction. Those who believe Mr. Greenspan \nwas right were 11, and those who believe he was wrong were 89 percent.\n  Americans are getting it. They are understanding it.\n  The Federal Reserve Bank publication Economics and Finance, last \nsummer said--I will include the appropriate references--that the \ndownward turn in the mid-1970s and early 1980s shows an even mix of \ncyclical and structural adjustments--those who lost their jobs as \ntemporary workers and who lost their jobs which are more permanent in \nnature. During these episodes, half the unemployment was structural and \nhalf was cyclical. The pattern changed in the early 1990s when industry \nwas undergoing structural adjustments and increased its share of total \nemployment to 57 percent.\n\n  The greatest change, however, is apparent. In the 2001 downturn, 79 \npercent of the employees worked in industries affected more by \nstructural shifts than by cyclical shifts. That means, in simple \nlanguage, those who responded to the CNN poll understand that 80 \npercent of the jobs that are lost today are permanently lost. This has \nto be a major concern.\n  This chart indicates that the Federal Reserve reports the Bush job \nloss is permanent. In the 1950s, the permanent job loss was 51 percent; \nin the 1980s, again 51 percent; and, early 1990s, only 57 percent. Now, \nthere is an 80 percent permanent job loss--the first time in the \nhistory of this country.\n  There is a report from the Department of Labor which shows that 36 \nStates have lost jobs since President Bush took office, and 27 States \nlost more jobs in the last month alone. The rate of job loss in my \nState of Massachusetts since President Bush took office is higher than \nin any other State.\n  I say to the Chair, my friend and colleague from Rhode Island, I \ndoubt if Rhode Island is very far behind. Over the last 3 years, \n193,000 jobs disappeared, and 200,000 Massachusetts residents are \ncurrently unemployed. In Massachusetts, 2,500 workers a week are \nrunning out of benefits because our Republican friends and the Bush \nadministration refuse to extend the unemployment compensation \ntemporarily for 13 weeks to permit these families to pay a mortgage and \nto put food on the table. These workers have paid into the fund. The \nfund has $17 billion in surplus. The cost of this legislation for 13 \nweeks is $7 billion. But no.\n  Look at what the President of the United States said at the time of \nhis State of the Union. He said, ``This economy is strong and growing \nstronger.'' Applause. And then he said, ``Jobs are on the rise.'' \nApplause.\n\n[[Page S273]]\n\n  That really defies the facts and reality in terms of what is \nhappening across the United States in terms of real jobs.\n  I referred previously to the excellent article and report of just \nlast Friday. This information is current. These figures are current \nwith regard to my own State of Massachusetts. The statement of the \nchairman of the Federal Reserve is current. The study of the Federal \nReserve is current.\n  Here is the Wall Street Journal pointing out that the gap in wages \nand equality is growing for U.S. workers. The gap between the highest \nand lowest earners in America is widening again, with election year \nramifications. The trend is a reflection of the job market. The \nexceptionally weak response to the current economic recovery as well as \nthe long-term technological and economic changes have eroded the \nbargaining power of America's lowest paid workers. Data show that \nyounger workers, who currently have fewer job prospects than a few \nyears ago, in particular are bearing the brunt. The numbers indicate a \nmovement to greater wage inequality around the time President Bush \nsucceeded President Clinton.\n  This is the Wall Street Journal. This is not a Democratic organ I am \nquoting.\n  The disparity started under President Bush with the economic slide \ninto recession 3 years ago. The trend represents a reversal of the late \n1990s when the lowest rates in a generation enabled the lowest paid \nworkers to keep pace with those at the top. Mr. President, we will look \nat the jobs referred to in the President's State of the Union. He \ntalked about these jobs as being on the rise.\n\n  Look at this chart. This refers to what is happening in the job \nmarket.\n  The late 1990s, 1998 to 2000, all the fourth quarter--the same \nquarter we were coming out of the recession--for every job that paid \n$16.31, the new job paid $18.32, a $2 bonus. Lost your job? Get a new \njob and get better pay. This is the average of all the new jobs.\n  What is it today? Under the Bush recovery, for every job that was \npaying $16.92, the replacement job is $15.65--22 percent nationwide; 35 \npercent in the State of New Hampshire where so many of our friends and \ncolleagues are today. No wonder the citizens of New Hampshire are \nconcerned about the state of the economy, the cost of tuition, and the \ncost of health care.\n  Look what is happening in the industries across the country at the \npoint of hiring. We find workers are working harder, working longer, \nand they are making less. This is the real state of the Union.\n  This chart shows nationwide only two States--Nebraska and Nevada--\nhave actually increased employment and had a pay increase over the \nemployment figures when the President took office. Every other State \nhas seen a decline.\n  How does the recovery stack up with other recoveries, the last nine \nrecoveries, going back to 1949? This chart compares the constant \nquarter used when the recession ended. What happened to wages? Going \nback to 1949, they went up 16 percent; 10 percent in 1954; 10 percent \nagain in 1958; in 1961, 7.9 percent; 9.2 percent in 1982; 1991, 6.1 \npercent; and 2001, 1.58.\n  That is what is happening out here among workers in the workplace. No \nwonder, as CNN reported last week, that American workers are finding \nthemselves competing with cheap foreign labor just to hold on to their \njobs. They are overwhelmed because they feel as if forces way beyond \ntheir control are making decisions that affect their lives. They are \nexhausted because they are working harder and longer and faster just to \nstand still.\n  Who is making out with this recovery? This chart compares the \nrecovery in the 1990s and the recovery today. In the Bush economy, \ncorporate profits ballooned compared to workers' wages. With the \nrecovery in the early 1990s, 60 percent of the new economic activity \nwas reflected with 60 percent going to the workers' wages; with the \nrecovery in the 1990s, 40 percent went to corporate profits. With \ntoday's recovery, 86 percent goes to corporate profits and 13 percent \ngoes to the workers in this country.\n  Talk about disparity. Talk about fairness. What is going on is the \nmost dramatic change and shift in recent history in terms of the \nrelationship between the profits and what the workers are earning.\n  That is absolutely wrong. The results are dramatic. In the year 2000, \nthere were 31 million Americans living in poverty. Today, there are 34 \nmillion Americans living in poverty, according to the Department of \nCommerce.\n  It is not just what is happening in the job markets; it is happening \nin health care costs. We see this in the most recent Time magazine, \nFebruary 2, ``Why Your Drugs Cost So Much More.'' The report shows \nAmericans spent $162 billion on prescription drugs in 2002, up from \nless than $100 billion a decade ago.\n\n  Health care spending continues to rise; 9.3 percent in 2002, \naccording to the trade journal Health Affairs. That is the largest \nincrease in 11 years. Employers tighten coverage to cut costs; \nconsumers are more resentful of what they are paying at the drugstore. \nWhile prescriptions represented only 10 percent of the total health \ncare costs in the United States in 2002, they amount to 23 percent of \nthe out-of-pocket costs for the consumer.\n  We passed a drug bill last fall. One would think we would look at \ncoverage and try to do something about costs. No way. Written into \nthat, behind closed doors, were the provisions that this Bush \nadministration and the Republicans prohibited the Secretary of HHS to \nbe able to bargain with the drug companies in order to see some \nreduction. The Secretary for Veterans Affairs can do it and it means a \n47-percent reduction for veterans' prescription drugs. But this was \nprohibited in the legislation.\n  Hopefully in this Congress under the leadership of Tom Daschle and \nCongresswoman Pelosi, we will address what is happening with health \ncare costs. Prescription drug costs are a special problem because the \ncost of prescription drugs is out of control. We have to do something \nfor our fellow Americans, primarily our seniors but for others as well, \nand about the costs of health care generally.\n  Workers are working harder, longer, and for less. They are worried \nabout their health care. The costs are going through the roof, with \nvery little insight to get a handle on that cost.\n  We look not only at what workers are looking for in terms of their \ncosts for health care and the costs of health care for their parents. \nLook at the costs of college education. This chart is a comparison of \ntuition at a 4-year public university: it was $3,700 in 2001-2002; now \nit is $4,700. That's a 26-percent increase since 2001.\n  How can average working families afford to send their child to \nschool? How do they afford their health care costs, their prescription \ndrug costs, their tuition?\n  Look what has happened to wages--nothing. That is the real state of \nthe Union, not this ``jobs are on the rise, and the economy is strong \nand getting stronger.''\n  This is the description of what is happening out there to American \nworkers. What is the answer of this administration? We say, with regard \nto the lowest workers, let's see an increase in the minimum wage.\n  The minimum wage has not been increased in 7 years. By the end of \nthis year it will be at its lowest purchasing power, in real terms, in \nthe history of the minimum wage. We say: Let's get an increase. There \nis a majority of the Members in this body who would vote for an \nincrease in the minimum wage, and we have been prohibited from getting \nit because the Republican leadership will not let us get a vote on the \nissue.\n  Seven million Americans are entitled, when they are working 40 hours \na week, 52 weeks a year, not to have to live in poverty. That is what \nwe believe on this side. We challenge the other side to give us an \nopportunity to let the Senate express itself.\n  We have the second issue that I have mentioned, unemployment \ncompensation. Mr. President, 90,000--think of that number of people--\n90,000 individuals a week are losing their unemployment compensation. I \ndo not know how those families do it. How does a father and mother come \nback and look into the eyes of their children when they lose that \nunemployment compensation, having worked hard all of their lives, paid \ninto the fund, and it is suddenly gone? And they cannot find a job \nbecause we are in a jobless recovery. As\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\nthe figures show, in the last month, this administration said there \nwould be 300,000 jobs. There have been 1,000 jobs created. It is a \njobless recovery.\n  How do those parents deal with it? How do those children react? That \nis what is happening. Now we cut away their lifeline, the temporary \nunemployment compensation. No, you cannot have it. You cannot have an \nincrease in the minimum wage to provide some relief. And that is a \nfamily value issue because most of those who work for the minimum wage \nare women, and many of the women have children. It is a family issue, a \nchildren's issue, a women's issue, a civil rights issue, a fairness \nissue. Yet we cannot have a raise in the minimum wage. We cannot have \nan extension of unemployment benefits.\n  Beyond that, we are going to stick it to 8 million Americans in \ndenying them overtime. We had the debate on that earlier, that proposed \nregulation by the administration to restrict overtime coverage for 8 \nmillion Americans. It was rejected here under the leadership of my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Harkin. It came up in the House of \nRepresentatives. It was rejected there. Then those provisions rejecting \nthis regulation were stripped out of the omnibus bill behind closed \ndoors in the middle of the night.\n  That is unfair to a number of different professions. It is unfair to \nnurses, firefighters, and police officers. They are the backbone of \nhomeland security. But it is unfair to others as well, including many \nprofessions which have predominantly women in them. It is very unfair \nto working women.\n  The cruelest part of this whole proposal was the part of the \nregulations that said if service men and women, when they are over in \nIraq defending this country, and Afghanistan or other parts of the \nworld, got a little specialized training, when they come back and take \na job, if they had that specialized training, they would not be \neligible for overtime.\n  Can you imagine that? We use these training programs as an incentive \nfor people to go into these services. I have asked on the floor and \nwould love to see the exchange of information between the Secretaries \nof Labor and Defense on that issue because this is a major incentive--\ntraining programs, education--for young people who perhaps do not have \nthe resources to be able to go on to college and do not want to be a \nburden on their parents. They go into the service--proudly go into the \nservice--and wear the uniform of our country, and defend our country, \nbut they also try to get that help and assistance in the form of \ntraining and education.\n  I will end on this issue with this letter from Randy Fleming, a \nveteran, and what this proposal would mean to veterans. He is a Boeing \nemployee worried about losing his overtime. This is what his letter \nsays:\n\n       My name is Randy Fleming. I live in Haysville, Kansas--\n     outside Wichita--and I work as an Engineering Technician in \n     Boeing's Metrology Lab.\n       I'm also proud to say that I'm a military veteran. I served \n     in the U.S. Air Force from August 1973 until February 1979.\n       I've worked for Boeing for 23 years. During that time I've \n     been able to build a good, solid life for my family and I've \n     raised a son who now has a good career and children of his \n     own. There are two things that helped make that possible.\n       First, the training I received in the Air Force made me \n     qualified for a good civilian job. That was one of the main \n     attractions when I enlisted as a young man back in Iowa. I \n     think it's still one of the main reasons young people today \n     decide to enlist. Military training opens up better job \n     opportunities--and if you don't believe me, just look at the \n     recruiting ads on TV.\n       The second thing is overtime pay. That's how I was able to \n     give my son the college education that has opened doors for \n     him. Some years, when the company was busy and I had those \n     college bills to pay, overtime pay was probably 10% or more \n     of my income. My daughter is next. Danielle is only 8, but \n     we'll be counting on my overtime to help her get her college \n     degree, too, when that time comes. For my family overtime pay \n     has made all the difference.\n       That's where I'm coming from. Why did I come to Washington? \n     I came to talk about an issue that is very important back \n     home and to me personally as a working man, a family man, and \n     a veteran. That issue is overtime rights.\n       The changes that this administration is trying to make in \n     the overtime regulations would break the government's bargain \n     with the men and women in the military and would close down \n     opportunities that working vets and their families thought \n     they could count on.\n       When I signed up back in 1973, the Air Force and I made a \n     deal that I thought was fair. They got a chunk of my time and \n     I got training to help me build the rest of my life. There \n     was no part of that deal that said I would have to give up my \n     right to overtime pay. You've heard of the marriage penalty? \n     Well I think that what these new rules do is to create a \n     military penalty. If you got your training in the military, \n     no matter what your white collar profession is, your employer \n     can make you work as many hours as they want and not pay you \n     a dime extra.\n       If that's not bait and switch, I don't know what is.\n       And I don't have any doubt that employers will take \n     advantage of this new opportunity to cut our overtime pay. \n     They'll tell us they have to in order to compete. They'll say \n     if they can't take our overtime pay, they'll have to \n     eliminate our jobs.\n       It won't be just the bad employers, either--because these \n     rules will make it very hard for companies to do the right \n     thing. If they can get as many overtime hours as they want \n     for free instead of paying us time-and-a-half, they'll say \n     they owe it to the stockholders. And the veterans and other \n     working people will be stuck with less time, less money, and \n     a broken deal.\n       I'm luckier than some other veterans because I have a union \n     contract that will protect my rights for a while anyway. But \n     we know the pressure will be on, because my employer is one \n     that pushed for these new rules and they've been trying hard \n     to get rid of our union.\n       And for all those who want to let these military penalty \n     rules go through, I have a deal I'd like to propose. If you \n     think it's okay for the government to renege on its deals, I \n     think it should be your job to tell our military men and \n     women in Iraq that when they come home, their service of \n     their country will be used as a way to cut their overtime \n     pay.\n\n  You can't say it any better than that. And the cruelest part of it \nall is that the Labor Department puts out a publication to show \nemployers how to go about cutting his overtime pay.\n  Mr. President, just finally, I want to make mention of something we \nought to be concerned with--and we ought to be concerned about all \nworkers--but it just came to my attention that the administration's \novertime proposal will affect the U.S. Capitol Police.\n  The Capitol Police was first created in 1828 with the sole mission of \nproviding security for the U.S. Capitol Building. These dedicated \nofficers protect our lives, the lives of our staff, and the security of \nthe Nation's Capitol every single day.\n  Nearly 2,000 officers are responsible for these duties, and hundreds \nof them could lose their overtime pay under the Bush plan.\n  After September 11, many of these officers worked around the clock to \nsecure our safety. During the anthrax attacks, the officers dedicated \nhours and hours away from their families to secure the Capitol against \nfurther biochemical attacks.\n  If you walk through these halls, you can hear the buzz among these \nofficers: Are we going to be affected by this overtime proposal? How \ncould they do this to us?\n  Not every officer would be affected, but many with the specific \nduties listed in the Bush proposal could lose their overtime \nprotections. Denying overtime protections to even one Capitol Police \nofficer is too much.\n  Sergeants and other officers who spend most of their time on \nnonmanagerial activities but who supervise two other officers could \nlose their overtime protection.\n  And for the first time in the history of the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, nearly 40 percent of the Capitol Police force--those earning above \na certain amount who meet just one of the exemption criteria--will not \nhave access to overtime protections.\n  Well, this is where we are. We want to give the assurance to the \nAmerican workers, to their families, to parents and their children that \nwe are going to battle.\n  We are going to battle to make sure this administration doesn't \nimplement those overtime rules. We are going to battle every moment we \nhave, every opportunity we have, to extend unemployment compensation. \nAnd we are going to battle time and time again to increase the minimum \nwage. Let there be no mistake about it. It is going to come up in the \nSenate time and time and time and time again, until we provide some \njustice for workers in America.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2264 To Amendment No. 2233\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\namendment be set aside for the purpose of offering another amendment \nthat has been agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Nickles and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for Mr. Nickles, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2264 to amendment No. 2233.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate with respect to the status \n                       of private pension plans)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON STATUS OF PRIVATE PENSION \n                   PLANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:-\n       (1) The private pension system is integral to the \n     retirement security of Americans, along with individual \n     savings and Social Security.\n       (2) The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is \n     responsible for insuring the nation's private pension system, \n     and currently insures the pensions of 34,500,000 participants \n     in 29,500 single-employer plans, and 9,700,000 participants \n     in more than 1,600 multiemployer plans.\n       (3) The PBGC announced on January 15, 2004, that it \n     suffered a net loss in fiscal year 2003 of $7,600,000,000 for \n     single-employer pension plans, bringing the PBGC's deficit to \n     $11,200,000,000. This deficit is the PBGC's worst on record, \n     three times larger than the $3,600,000,000 deficit \n     experienced in fiscal year 2002.\n       (4) The PBGC also announced that the separate insurance \n     program for multiemployer pension plans sustained a net loss \n     of $419,000,000 in fiscal year 2003, resulting in a fiscal \n     year-end deficit of $261,000,000. The 2003 multiemployer plan \n     deficit is the first deficit in more than 20 years and is the \n     largest deficit on record.\n       (5) The PBGC estimates that the total underfunding in \n     multiemployer pension plans is roughly $100,000,000,000 and \n     in single-employer plans is approximately $400,000,000,000. \n     This underfunding is due in part to the recent decline in the \n     stock market and low interest rates, but is also due to \n     demographic changes. For example, in 1980, there were four \n     active workers for every one retiree in a multiemployer plan, \n     but in 2002, there was only one active worker for every one \n     retiree.\n       (6) This pension plan underfunding is concentrated in \n     mature and often-declining industries, where plan liabilities \n     will come due sooner.\n       (7) Neither the Senate Committee on Finance nor the Senate \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), \n     the committees of jurisdiction over pension matters, has held \n     hearings this Congress nor reported legislation addressing \n     the funding of multiemployer pension plans;\n       (8) The Senate is concerned about the current funding \n     status of the private pension system, both single and multi-\n     employer plans;\n       (9) The Senate is concerned about the potential liabilities \n     facing the PBGC and, as a result, the potential burdens \n     facing healthy pension plans and taxpayers;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor and Pensions should conduct hearings on the \n     status of the multiemployer pension plans, and should work in \n     consultation with the Departments of Labor and Treasury on \n     permanent measures to strengthen the integrity of the private \n     pension system in order to protect the benefits of current \n     and future pension plan beneficiaries.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I indicated, this amendment has been \ncleared on both sides. I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2264) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there have been some inquiries about \nother amendments. We have some other amendments on which we are \nworking. I will file them. Then I believe that would be the end of \nconsideration of this legislation today. I will come back later on to \ndo that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to offer a comment or two \nabout the legislation before us and express my thanks to two Members of \nthe Senate who have been very involved in shaping this legislation, \nSenator Grassley and Senator Kennedy. I thank them for the work they \nhave done.\n  There is a lot of concern in this country about the exodus of \nmanufacturing jobs and technology jobs. The legislation before us is a \nthoughtful, timely response to a number of employers, large and small, \nwho are concerned that unless we address this problem with respect to \nselecting an appropriate successor to the 30-year Treasury bond, an \nappropriate measure to determine what magnitude of money should be \ncontributed to pension funds, we are going to otherwise increase the \nexodus of jobs, manufacturing and otherwise.\n  We are doing good work. My hope is we will be able to finish this \nlegislation this week and get on with our business and allow employers \nto get on with theirs.\n\n\n                 Energy Efficiency for Air Conditioners\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, about a week or so ago I learned that a \nU.S. circuit court of appeals, I believe for the Second District, had \nreleased a decision that is a major victory for energy efficiency. It \noffers significant savings for consumers of electricity. It is \nimportant for our Nation's energy future. Finally, it will help to \nimprove the quality of air we breathe.\n  Let me take a moment to talk more about this decision and its impact. \nTo provide a bit of background, among the U.S. Department of Energy's \nresponsibilities is to establish energy efficiency standards for \nelectrical appliances. Central air-conditioners, the type that cool \nmost of our homes and offices, must meet the appropriate seasonal \nenergy efficiency rating, better known as SEER. During warm summer \ndays--which seem a long way away now--central air-conditioners account \nfor more than half of the electricity we use. Increasing the efficiency \nof these necessary modern comforts will result in significantly less \nstress on our Nation's electricity grid and reduce the occurrence of \nblackouts.\n  According to the Alliance to Save Energy, requiring energy-efficient \nair-conditioners would avoid having to construct as many as 48 new \nelectric powerplants over the next 16 years. It would also result in \nless greenhouse gases and harmful air pollution being released into the \natmosphere because of reduced electricity demand.\n  Some of you may recall at the close of the Clinton administration, \nafter exhaustive research, review, and comment, the Department of \nEnergy set forth a new standard known as SEER 13. In doing so, the \nEnergy Department directed that central air-conditioners, sold \nbeginning in 2006, would need to be 30-percent more energy efficient \nthan those currently available.\n  Unfortunately, that standard was withdrawn a couple of years ago when \nthe current administration took office. That standard was replaced with \na less efficient, less rigorous requirement. The revised standard, \nknown as SEER 12, would have required just a 20-percent increase in \nenergy efficiency.\n  In response to the administration's actions, 10 States, several \nconsumer groups, and the Natural Resources Defense Council filed suit \nat that time in an attempt to overturn this weakened standard.\n  It was 2 years ago, as the Senate was beginning to consider the \nEnergy bill, that I was encouraged that the legislation we are \nconsidering should have restored the higher SEER 13 standard originally \nembraced by the Clinton administration. Unfortunately, that language \nwas removed during the debate on the bill and the weaker SEER 12 \nstandard was allowed to stand.\n  Last year, I discussed options for reinstating the higher SEER 13 \nstandard but decided to hold off until the pending court case was \ndecided. As I said, I was gratified to learn last week that the U.S. \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had decided in favor of \nthe original, more rigorous standard. The court's decision means that \nconsumers will be able to purchase energy-efficient air-conditioners \nthat could cut electricity bills for them by over $1 billion per year. \nThe administration could decide to appeal the court's decision to the \nSupreme Court. I urge them today not to do so.\n  As we debate again and again the future of energy policy, this court \ndecision is one that should be embraced and encouraged, not appealed. \nWe\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\nshould take every opportunity to increase our energy security. This is \none of those opportunities.\n  I yield the floor and thank Senator Durbin for his consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                     CBS Rejection Of MoveOn.Org Ad\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for his \nstatement and for holding to the time limit he promised. He is a man of \nhis word.\n  Recently I learned that the CBS television network, which claims to \nbe the No. 1, most-watched network, with more than 200 affiliated \nstations, rejected an ad for its upcoming Super Bowl broadcast that \nwill be on Sunday. CBS's explanation for rejecting this ad was that \ntheir network prohibited the showing of advertisements that take stands \non controversial public policy issues.\n  So what was this controversial, dangerous ad which CBS is protecting \nAmerican viewers from watching? Well, it was an ad sponsored by a \nnonprofit organization called MoveOn.Org. You can find it on your Web \nsite at MoveOn.Org. You can see the ad. This 30-second ad shows several \nchildren working unhappily in a variety of grownup jobs.\n  When you go to the Web site and bring up this ad, you can see a \nlittle girl cleaning the floor of a commercial building with music \nplaying in the background, a boy washing dishes at a restaurant, \nanother youngster working on an assembly line in a factory, another \nfixing tires at an automobile shop, and another collecting trash for \nthe back of a truck.\n  The ad ends with this line:\n\n       Guess who's going to pay off President Bush's $1 trillion \n     deficit?\n\n  That is the controversial ad. The ad that CBS doesn't want America to \nsee, which those who are following this debate can go to MoveOn.org/\ncbs/ad and see this ``dangerous,'' ``controversial'' ad that crosses \nthe line, an ad which CBS is going to protect the American people from \neven getting a chance to see. These are some of the still photos from \nthat ad showing kids in working situations, and closing with one short \ntag line:\n\n       Guess who's going to pay off President Bush's $1 trillion \n     deficit?\n\n  CBS is afraid of this ad. They are afraid if the American people see \nit, they would be so caught up in the controversy of this ad, it would \njust be unfair.\n  Is it controversial? Is this ad too hot for network TV? Would America \nbe traumatized and changed forever viewing this dangerous, \ncontroversial, 30-second ad? Well, clearly not. This ad makes two \nfactual assertions every American knows to be true. First, it says we \nare facing a growing national debt, a debt exceeding $1 trillion, which \nhas to be paid off by future generations. Guess what. Those future \ngenerations are going to be comprised of our children.\n  Second, in those few words at the close of the ad, it says President \nBush and his administration have to accept responsibility for creating \nthis debt--a fact President Bush's own budget documents readily admit, \na fact substantiated by President Bush's programs of tax cuts for the \nwealthy. Everybody with even a short-term memory recalls that only a \nfew years ago we were dealing with a budgetary surplus under the \nClinton administration. Now we are deep in historic debt year after \nyear after year during the Bush administration. To argue the Bush \nadministration's hands are clean when it comes to America's debt defies \ncommon sense and history. So what is so controversial about these \nunambiguous facts that our children will be inheriting a large national \ndeficit created since the time President George W. Bush took office? \nSince when has stating the truth--and obvious truth at that--turned out \nto be too controversial for America to witness?\n  Think about it for a moment. CBS was the network, 30 years ago, that \ndared to put on a sitcom called ``All in the Family.'' In that sitcom \nabout a blue-collar, opinionated, rough-talking guy named Archie \nBunker, we heard the reality of a family saying some things which, \nfrankly, we had never heard before on television. Can you imagine if \nthese timid souls running from controversy at CBS today were asked to \nlook at a pilot for a sitcom with Archie Bunker? Frankly, I guess they \nwould force Archie Bunker to wear a suit and tie and call Meathead his \nbeloved son-in-law. Otherwise, it just might be too controversial, too \nrisky for the American people.\n  Maybe controversy is in the eye of the beholder, and the eye of CBS \nnow runs from controversy. Or maybe there is another dynamic at work. \nMaybe network executives at CBS are so afraid of political pressure \nfrom the rightwing and their business advertisers who are in league \nwith the rightwing politics of America that they are afraid to put \nanything on the air that might in fact make things uncomfortable. If \nthat is the case, it is time for CBS to announce the name of their \nnetwork is the ``conservative broadcasting system'' and come clean with \nAmerican viewers.\n\n  Look at the record, though. CBS has run controversial ads, many of \nwhich were good for America to see. Ads sponsored by the White House \nDrug Control Policy Agency confronted a tough issue, maybe in \ncontroversial terms to some, but ads that were important. The White \nHouse Drug Policy ad that ran during last year's Super Bowl accused \nAmerican drug companies of directly supporting international terrorism \nthat led to the taking of lives of American citizens. Risky, edgy, \ncontroversial? Yes. Did we have a right to see that as Americans? You \nbet we did.\n  Why was CBS ready to run those ads a year ago, but won't let \nMoveOn.org address the issue of the debt of America that will be borne \nby our children? CBS also runs ads by tobacco companies and antismoking \ngroups to advocate viewpoints on health. In fact, they are scheduled to \nrun during the Super Bowl--ads from two different groups, which are the \nAmerican Legacy Foundation and Phillip Morris, which are basically \nantismoking adds. I fully support these ads. Some may view them as \ncontroversial. But so what. If these airwaves are truly the realm of \nthe public to learn, why do we run away from a controversial ad even if \nit relates to a public health policy some disagree with?\n  CBS also routinely runs a whole range of controversial, if not \ndownright offensive, ads during the Super Bowl. We have seen that CBS \nhas no qualms about running ads featuring comely young women mud \nwrestling while a couple of beer-drinking fellows look on. \nControversial? Perhaps to some, but they will run those ads. It appears \nCBS executives consider it important to run not one, two, but three \nseparate ads promoting drugs for sexual dysfunction during the Super \nBowl. They believe in a national debate on such sexual problems is more \nimportant to the public interest than a discussion about the future of \nthis Nation. In the CBS eye, sexual dysfunction is a topic families \nwith children can watch. But budgetary dysfunction, which our children \nwill pay for, is just too controversial, too hot to handle.\n  So how does CBS define controversial content? Let's take a look at \nwhat goes into their thinking. Remember the series on President Ronald \nReagan? The CBS executives did a complete reversal overnight and pulled \nthe plug on the miniseries, ``The Reagans,'' after spending millions of \ndollars producing it. We learned that the decision was made after \nconservative Republicans barraged the boardroom and executives and said \nwe cannot run this, even though we have not seen it. In fact, CBS caved \nin, without the public ever having seen one single episode.\n  These are the same executives at CBS, incidentally, who, during 1999 \nand 2000 gave 98 percent of their soft money political contributions to \nthe Republican Party. They decided this MoveOn.org ad, which just might \nraise a question about President Bush's policies leading this Nation, \nand the deficit and debt our children face, those same CBS executives \nsaid we don't think we ought to step into this controversial area.\n  The major pharmaceutical companies, which will be running ads on \nthree different sexual dysfunction drugs during the Super Bowl, have \nalso been consistently placed among the five top spenders on lobbying \nthe Republican Congress and in soft money and PAC contributions to \nRepublican candidates.\n  Now let's connect all the dots because there is something more direct\n\n[[Page S277]]\n\nand topical behind this CBS decision, from my point of view. These are \nthe same executives at CBS who successfully lobbied this Congress to \nchange the FCC rules on TV station ownership to their corporate \nadvantage. The provision that was sneaked into the Omnibus \nappropriation bill that passed last week and has been signed by the \nPresident. It establishes a new ceiling of 39 percent as the maximum \npercentage of American TV viewers in a market that may be reached by TV \nstations owned by any one company. Remember that number, 39 percent.\n  Before the FCC adopted rules in June to raise the cap to 45 percent, \nthe cap was limited to 35 percent. Upset at what the FCC had done, a \nstrong majority in the House and Senate agreed to roll back the FCC \nrule and take it back down to 35 percent. Why is this important? The \nWhite House and the Republicans in this conference on this Omnibus \nappropriation bill, with no Democrats present, came up with a figure of \n39 percent as the new cap--39 percent. What is so magic about 39 \npercent? Allow me to explain. This wasn't chosen at random; it wasn't a \ngood-faith compromise. No, it just so happens that Viacom, which owns \nCBS, currently owns stations reaching 38.8 percent of American \nhouseholds, and Rupert Murdoch's news corporation, the owners of that \n``fair and balanced'' Fox Network, owns stations reaching 37.8 percent.\n  Interesting. Interesting that the White House and Republican leaders \nin Congress pushed a provision in a spending bill in the dark of night, \nwithout Democrats present, that benefited two corporations when it came \nto their ownership of television stations--Fox, which is a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of the Republican Party, and now Viacom, CBS. Both entities \ncurrently violate the old FCC limitation. They needed this new \nlanguage. They would have been forced to sell off stations if their \nRepublican friends in Congress and the White House had not come through \nfor them.\n  So the White House and the congressional Republicans give CBS a \nsignificant corporate favor and CBS rewards them by killing an ad \ncritical of the Bush White House during the Super Bowl. Doesn't that \nsound like a perfect subject for a ``60 Minutes'' investigation? Oh, I \nforget. ``60 Minutes'' is a CBS program. I don't think we are going to \nhear about this on ``60 Minutes.'' I don't think Mike Wallace and \nLesley Stahl are going to be taking an undercover camera into the \nboardrooms of CBS to find out what is going on there.\n  Listen to what our colleague, Senator John McCain of Arizona, said \nabout this provision that was sneaked into this bill at the last minute \nto benefit Viacom and CBS, the biggest corporate favor they could ever \nask for. I am quoting my colleague, Senator John McCain, who said on \nthe floor:\n\n       This provision is objectionable because while purporting to \n     address public concerns about excessive media consolidation, \n     it really only addresses the concerns of special interests. \n     It is no coincidence, my friends--\n\n  And this is John McCain speaking--\n\n     that the 39 percent is the exact ownership percentage of \n     Viacom and CBS. Why did they pick 39 percent? So that these \n     two major conglomerates would be grandfathered in, \n     purportedly, in order to reduce the media ownership, which \n     was voted down 55 to 40 in the Senate. The fact is now they \n     are endorsing Viacom and CBS's 39 percent ownership, \n     grandfathering them in because they should have been at 35 \n     percent.\n\n  In the words of Senator McCain:\n\n       Remarkable.\n\n  It is clear from the examples, such as the rejection of MoveOn.org's \nad, that CBS and other media companies are dominant in a marketplace \nthat exercises vast influence over what the American people can see on \ntelevision. This is exhibit A in the case against media concentration.\n  Too much power has been given to media executives who now are going \nto pick and choose and censor the content of political material which \nwe as Americans can see. They can decide on one hand that their friends \nwill be favored with ads and then reject ads critical of their \npolitical friends as just too controversial for America to witness.\n  That is exactly what they have done on this MoveOn.org ad. CBS is \nable to reject MoveOn.org and anyone else whose views they disagree \nwith because the executives know there are thousands of other companies \nstanding in line ready to pay for ads during the Super Bowl.\n  It all comes down to this: Through years of deregulation, we have \ncreated a situation in America where massive media conglomerates, such \nas CBS, are operating without any effective oversight and with little \nor no feeling of responsibility to the public.\n  It used to be people remembered that the airwaves these TV stations \nuse don't belong to these TV stations, they don't belong to the media \ngiants, such as Viacom, they don't belong to CBS. They belong to you, \nme, and every American. We allow these companies to use the airwaves, \nand they make a fortune. We licensed them for that purpose. We used to \nsay, before the Reagan administration changed the law: If you are going \nto use America's airwaves, you have to be fair in the use of the \nairwaves. The fairness doctrine was thrown out. Now the only standard \nis that they only have to serve the public interest.\n  It is such a vague term, ``serve the public interest,'' that CBS, \nundoubtedly, can get by with rejecting ads for political reasons, such \nas their rejection of this MoveOn.org ad. But if the public interest \nstandard is to mean anything, it must require broadcast licensees to \nair diverse points of view on issues of national interest.\n  It is all right for me as an American to watch something on \ntelevision with which, frankly, I disagree. Maybe I want to pick up the \nphone and call the station manager or register my complaint with one \ngroup or the other. Isn't that what free speech in America is all \nabout? Not from CBS's point of view. From the CBS point of view, they \nwill pick and choose what you can watch. Ads for beer with young folks \ndoing things which maybe you don't want your children to see--not \ncontroversial. Ads by pharmaceutical companies for sexual dysfunction \ndrugs you may not want your children to watch--not controversial. But \nan ad which says that our children are going to pay off a $1 trillion \nnational debt created by this administration--over the line, way too \nscandalous, way too controversial. Children and good American families \nshould not be subjected to that, in the eyes of CBS. I certainly \ndisagree.\n  Broadcasters and executives running broadcast stations should \nremember that, first and foremost, they are journalists. They have a \nresponsibility to the American people to speak the truth, to give us \nthe information and let us decide. They have a professional and ethical \nobligation to be fair and balanced, even if it means they have to set \naside their own political views and prejudices and perhaps--perhaps--\njust once in a while, step on the toes of their political allies and \nfriends, even the ones who just handsomely rewarded them with the \nprovision in the recent appropriations bill.\n  While broadcasters may wish to exercise their discretion in selecting \nads that would run afoul of a community's decency standards, \nbroadcasters should not and must not become censors of content. That is \nthe fundamental promise of the first amendment. It is wrong for the \nGovernment to censor content. It is wrong for corporate stewards of our \npublic airwaves to do so.\n  If you believe, after watching this ad by MoveOn.org, that CBS was \nwrong, that CBS should have allowed this ad, which shows children at \nwork and says, in its closing frame, ``Guess who's going to pay off \nPresident Bush's $1 trillion deficit?''--if you think CBS made a \nmistake, you have a right, as an American, to contact them. You can \nwrite to them at: CBS Television Network, 51 West 52nd Street, New \nYork, NY, 10019, or you can call them: (212) 975-4321. Ask to talk to \nthe corporate executive who decided this ad was too controversial for \nyour family to see. Make certain they understand, as I feel and hope \nyou feel, that America is ready for an ad which tells the truth, an ad \nwhich may be controversial in the eyes of one political party but \ncertainly deserves to be aired so the public can finally decide what is \nright and what is wrong.\n  I hope the American people will not sit idly by and watch as these \nmedia giants, such as CBS, become bigger, more powerful, and decide \njust exactly what we as Americans will get to see on TV.\n  I urge everyone watching to call CBS and remind the executive that \nyou, the American people, are the owners of the American public \nairwaves.\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\n  For CBS, let me say this: The CBS eye has been closed to truth, \nclosed to fairness, closed to presenting the facts honestly to the \nAmerican people. CBS has a great legacy. It is a storied name when it \ncomes to public information in America. This chapter is sad and \ndisgraceful.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, if my friend from Iowa will yield, I express \nmy appreciation, for the Senate and the staff, to the leader for \ngetting us out of here as early as possible. The weather is \ntreacherous. There was a meeting at the White House that prevented us \nfrom getting out earlier. For everyone, I express my appreciation to \nthe leader for adjourning at this time.\n  Senator Inhofe and I just finished a very constructive conversation. \nI have spoken to Senator Jeffords and to Senator Bond. We feel very \ngood about moving forward on the highway bill next week. I know the \nchairman of the Finance Committee is here. They are going to meet on \nMonday to work on a provision on taxes. We can't do the bill unless \nthey do that. I have spoken to the Senators from Alabama and Maryland, \nSenator Sarbanes and Senator Shelby. They are going to mark their \nprovision up on Tuesday as it deals with mass transit.\n  I hope this most important bill, creating hundreds of thousands, if \nnot millions, of jobs over the next 5 years can be completed before we \ngo for our break in the middle of February.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks the \ndistinguished assistant Democratic leader just made about the highway \nbill. It is one of the most important jobs bills we can have before the \nSenate this year. It should have been done last year. We couldn't get \nit done. But we can do that now and the Senate is committed to that. I \nthink the leadership in the House is committed to it. Obviously, we \nneed to get it done.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/27/senate-section/article/S278-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S278-S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MOULIN ROUGE HOTEL AND CASINO\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, March 24, 1955, was a significant date in \nthe history of Las Vegas. That date marked the opening of Nevada's \nfirst racially integrated hotel--the Moulin Rouge Hotel and Casino.\n  At that time, the city of Las Vegas was already earning international \nrecognition as an entertainment and resort mecca. However, black \nentertainers performing in Las Vegas were not allowed to stay in the \nhotels where they performed, nor were they allowed to enter the casinos \nor restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip. Instead, entertainers such as \nSammy Davis Jr., Nat ``King'' Cole, and Lena Horne were forced to seek \naccommodations in local boarding houses.\n  The Moulin Rouge changed all that. When the Moulin Rouge opened, it \nimmediately became the night spot for top stars such as Davis, Harry \nBelafonte, and Frank Sinatra. They were joined by Ella Fitzgerald, \nLionel Hampton, Count Basie, Bob Hope, Tallulah Bankhead, Louis \nArmstrong, and many more.\n  When shows on the Strip ended, entertainers and their followers \nflocked to the Moulin Rouge where they would continue performing into \nthe wee hours of the morning.\n  The hotel became home to black entertainers headlining on the Strip, \nand a venue where they performed, alongside their white peers, to \naudiences of all races.\n  The Moulin Rouge closed in October of 1955, just 6 months after its \ncelebrated opening. However, its impact lived on. Other Las Vegas \nhotels began their own efforts at desegregation. And when the civil \nrights movement reached full swing in early 1960, the old Moulin Rouge \nbecame the site of an historic meeting between Governor Grant Sawyer, \nleaders in the African-American community, and Las Vegas\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\nhotel operators. The meeting resulted in an agreement by resort \noperators to end their segregation practices, and to make their \ncasinos, restaurants, and hotel rooms accessible to all people \nregardless of race.\n  The ``Moulin Rouge Agreement'' made national news, and the building \nhas since been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It \nis a living symbol and tribute to the struggle for equality and civil \nrights. Over the years, a number of owners tried to bring the Moulin \nRouge back as a viable resort, but none was ultimately successful. \nThen, last year, a tragedy occurred. On May 29, 2003, one day before a \nnew owner was scheduled to take over the property, an arsonist's fire \nravaged the casino. The three-alarm blaze destroyed many irreplaceable \nhistoric photos and relics, including the famous Moulin Rouge wall \nmural and its unique mahogany bar.\n  Miraculously, the entire front facade and the historic Moulin Rouge \nneon sign survived the fire, along with the original tile-covered \ncolumns and the signature tower. These structures, along with the \noriginal hotel building which also survived, will provide the \nfoundation from which a new Moulin Rouge will rise.\n  This year marks the 40th anniversary of the landmark Civil Rights Act \nof 1964, so it seems fitting to announce that the Moulin Rouge, a \nsymbol of civil rights change in Las Vegas, will rise from the ashes.\n  The Moulin Rouge Development Corporation, which was stymied in its \nefforts to purchase the hotel by the tragic fire, will soon finalize \npurchase of the property. This Thursday, January 29, the company will \npublicly announce its plans for the new Moulin Rouge.\n  These plans call for restoration of the original facade and the \noriginal hotel, along with construction of a new hotel, casino, and \nshopping mall. This new facility will include museum exhibits, provided \nby the Moulin Rouge Museum and Cultural Center, that celebrate the \nhistory of the property and the achievements of minority leaders, \nentertainers, and other pioneers of the civil rights era.\n  I congratulate Dale Scott, Rod Bickerstaff, Chauncey Moore, and other \nofficials of the Moulin Rouge Development Corporation for their vision \nand hard work in bringing forth this proposal.\n  It has been a long road. But those of us who love history are \ndelighted that the Moulin Rouge will be saved, and that its famous neon \nsign will shine once again. It will serve as a reminder of how far we \nhave come, and how much remains to be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/27/senate-section/article/S279-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S279-S280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n             CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER TWO BRIAN D. HAZELGROVE\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nEdinburgh, IN. CWO2 Brian D. Hazelgrove, 29 years old, died outside of \nMosul, Iraq, on January 23, 2004, after his Kiowa Warrior helicopter \ncrashed while returning from a combat mission. Brian joined the Army \nwith his entire life before him. He chose to risk everything to fight \nfor the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway \naround the world.\n  Brian was the 24th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Brian leaves behind his father, \nRon; his wife, Kimmi; his half brother, Brad; and his children, Taylor, \nZachary, Brandon, and Katelyn. May Brian's children grow up knowing \nthat their father gave his life so that young Iraqis will some day know \nthe freedom they enjoy.\n  Today, I join Brian's family, his friends, and the entire Edinburgh \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover his death, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is this courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nBrian, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  Brian graduated from Edinburgh High School in 1994, where he played \non the basketball team. Friends and family members remember Brian for \nthe love he shared with his entire family, his energetic personality \nand his unfailing sense of humor. His half brother Brad spoke for all \nwho were blessed to have known Brian when describing him to the \nIndianapolis Star as ``just a joy . . . the guy was amazing.''\n  After joining the Army in 1994, Brian began his military career in \nintelligence. He later became a helicopter pilot, serving with the 3rd \nSquadron, 17th Air Cavalry Regiment from the 10th Mountain Division at \nFort Drum, NY. Prior to Brian's service in Operation Iraqi Freedom, he \nalso served two tours of duty in South Korea. He was deployed to the \nMiddle East in November.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Brian's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas I am certain that the impact of Brian's actions will live on far \nlong than any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Brian D. Hazelgrove in the \nofficial record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Brian's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said:\n\n       He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will \n     wipe away tears from off all faces.\n\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless us all.\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SGM PHILIP ALBERT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in tribute to U.S. Army SGM Philip \nRobert Albert, of Plymouth, CT, who lost his life on duty in \nAfghanistan on November 23, 2003. He was 41 years old.\n  Sergeant Major Albert, a member of the 2nd Battalion of the 87th \nInfantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, was killed along with four \nother soldiers in a helicopter crash in northeastern Afghanistan. His \nservice to his country will not be forgotten.\n  Philip Albert was a career military man. He enlisted in the Army \nafter graduating high school at 18 years of age, and he never looked \nback. He fought in the first gulf war in 1991 and was serving his \nsecond tour of duty in Afghanistan. Sergeant Major Albert was on the \nfront lines in the war on terror, searching the mountains of \nAfghanistan for members of al-Qaida and the Taliban, protecting \ncoalition forces as well as the Afghan people.\n  Like so many of the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces, \nPhilip Albert didn't consider himself a hero. For him, putting his life \non the line for his country was simply part of his job--a job he did \nwith dignity, courage, and honor.\n  Sergeant Major Albert's devotion to his country was matched only by \nhis love for his family. The youngest of 8 siblings, he enjoyed the \ncompany of his brothers and sisters, and he was especially fond of the \ntime he spent with his many nieces and nephews.\n  In recent years, Sergeant Major Albert had spoken with his family and \nfriends about the possibility of retiring from the Army. But it was \ndifficult for an individual like Philip Albert to walk away from the \njob he loved. After he witnessed the horrific attacks of September 11, \nhe must have decided that America could use his experience, his \ndedication, and his service. Because once again, when his country \ncalled on him, Philip Albert answered the call.\n  Philip Albert perished just a few days before Thanksgiving. The \nThanksgiving holiday will obviously have a very different meaning for \nhis family and friends for many, many years to come. But I would like \nthem to know that each and every one of us in the Senate--and indeed \nevery single American--owes a tremendous debt of thanks to Philip \nAlbert.\n  It is people like Sergeant Major Albert who make it possible for us \nto live each and every day in freedom, peace, and security. It is their \nsacrifices, in lands thousands of miles away, that keep us safe here at \nhome. We must\n\n[[Page S280]]\n\nnever forget those sacrifices--especially those of people like Philip \nAlbert who have left us with a debt we can never repay.\n  I offer my deepest sympathies to Philip Albert's family, and to \neveryone who knew and loved him.\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF PFC JEFFREY BRAUN\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise to speak in memory of PFC Jeffrey Braun, \nof Stafford, CT, who was killed in Iraq on December 11, 2003. He was 19 \nyears old.\n  Private Braun was truly an inspiration to everyone who knew him. He \njoined the Army shortly after the attacks of September 11, motivated by \na desire to be part of the global campaign to rid the world of terror. \nAfter completing his senior year at Stafford High School in 2002, he \nbecame a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division.\n  Jeff Braun's heroic sacrifice in Iraq will never be forgotten. But in \nthe words of a friend, Adrian Scarpa, ``He was a hero even before he \nwent over.''\n  No matter what he did, Jeff Braun was always striving to be part of \nsomething greater than himself. At Stafford High School, wherever you \nlooked, you could find Jeff Braun. He played soccer, wrestled, and ran \ntrack. He sang, acted in school plays, and was active in local \ncommunity service projects.\n  Jeff's friends and family members knew him as a young man who always \nhad a kind word, a smile, and an outgoing and infectious sense of \nhumor. He would make friends with classmates who were lonely. He would \ngive away his own lunch to students who didn't have any.\n  Jeff Braun was a fascinating person, and he had a fascinating life \nstory. He was born in the village of San Pedro Sula in Honduras. When \nhe was 6 months old, he was adopted by Meredith and William Braun, who \nbrought him to Stafford. He came to love his adopted country so much \nthat he joined its armed forces. But he also shared a deep and \nmeaningful connection with his homeland. Even while in Iraq, Jeff was \nactively pursuing his dream of building an orphanage in his native \nHonduras. It's a dream that Jeff's parents have said they will strive \nto make a reality.\n  Jeff didn't have to enlist in the military. But with his enthusiasm, \nhis generosity, his spirit, and his character, he simply couldn't stay \non the sidelines and watch as his fellow countrymen fought overseas in \ndefense of freedom. Jeff saw a job that needed to be done--and he knew \nthat he had to be a part of it.\n  I join the town of Stafford, the State of Connecticut, and the entire \nUnited States Senate in mourning the loss of Private Jeffrey Braun, a \ntruly remarkable individual who was taken from us far, far too soon.\n  I offer my deepest sympathies to Jeff's parents William and Meredith, \nto his sister Julie, his entire family, and the many, many people whose \nlives were touched by Jeff Braun.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/27/senate-section/article/S280-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Is it the chairman's intention that the administration should \nimplement the language contained in the Senate Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Report, 108-106?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Vermont. Before I respond, I \nwas wondering if he could take a moment to read the Senate report \nlanguage for the benefit of our colleagues.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would be happy to. It reads:\n\n       The Committee recommends that USAID provide $2,000,000 in \n     Child Survival and Health Programs Fund and Development \n     Assistance to Laos--one of the world's poorest and most \n     repressive countries--through non-governmental organizations. \n     The Committee intends that these funds will not be used to \n     offset or substitute INL funding that would otherwise go to \n     Laos.\n       The Committee is concerned by the actions of the regime in \n     Laos, which continues to be responsible for serious human \n     rights abuses. The Committee is also concerned by the recent \n     detention and trial of an American citizen and two foreign \n     journalists in Laos. While the Committee is pleased that \n     these individuals have recently been released, it is deeply \n     troubled that the fate of four Laotian citizens accompanying \n     the journalists is still unknown.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As I know my friend from Vermont is particularly \ninterested in this issue, it would be both accurate and fair to say \nthat it is our collective intention that this language be implemented.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased we are in agreement. As I know of your strong \ninterest in the region, I hope we can continue to work together to \nsupport United States funded programs through Southeast Asia.\n   Mr. McCONNELL. I look forward to our continued cooperation, and urge \nthe State Department and USAID to meet with our respective staffs to \ndiscuss countries of particular concern, including Laos, Vietnam, \nCambodia, Thailand, and Burma.\n  Mr. LEAHY. On the issue of Burmese refugees along the Thailand-Burma \nborder, is it the chairman's expectation that funds from the ERMA \naccount should be used to provide funding for these refugees?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, it is. The situation on the Burma-Thailand border \nis disturbing, and if sufficient funds cannot be found from the MRA \nbudget then the administration should consider using ERMA funds to \nameliorate this situation.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, 1 year ago this month, a powerful new force \njoined together and it has since swept through the neighborhoods in \nArkansas. Its members said enough to the homicides plaguing our \nstreets, enough to the violence in our schools and homes and enough to \nstanding by to watch our communities crumble.\n  Members of the community saw that although African Americans \ncomprised 12 percent of the national population, a staggering 45 \npercent of all murder victims in 2002 were black. A resounding 91 \npercent of those murders were incidents of black on black crime.\n  Homicide was and is still literally tearing apart African-American \nfamilies, serving as the leading cause of death for black men ages 15 \nto 24, and the second leading cause of death for black women of the \nsame age group. Black-on-black crime remains an epidemic, having a \ndevastating impact on our families and ultimately compromising the \nsafety and quality of life in my great State of Arkansas.\n  One year ago this month, community leaders, faith leaders, government \nofficials, community organizations, and businesses did more than just \nsay enough is enough. They formed the Black on Black Crime Coalition to \ninform and educate the citizens of Little Rock about black-on-black \ncrime, but also to implement programs and initiatives to reduce \nhomicides, reduce violent crimes and take back their streets and \nneighborhoods.\n  I am proud to be a partner of this coalition, to join with coalition \nmembers and its wide array of partners and raise public awareness about \nblack-on-black crime. The coalition has spent its first year creating \nand supporting intervention and mentoring programs, conducting \nworkshops for community organizations, supporting neighborhood \nassociations, implementing youth programs and lobbying elected \nofficials to implement policies for effective change. The coalition is \nworking through the statistics, trying to understand the systemic \ncauses, determining the solutions and reversing this epidemic that is \nstealing away our future leaders.\n  This January, in Arkansas, we celebrate Black on Black Crime \nPrevention Month. The coalition has organized a month filled with \nceremonies, roundtable discussions, town meetings, and prayer to help \nmeet its mission. By all means, these efforts are contributing to a \nbetter understanding of the challenges that Arkansas' black communities \nface each and every day, but we are also learning and implementing \nstrategies to beat back and overcome these challenges.\n  As the former attorney general of my State, I have worked closely \nwith law enforcement officers and the community to make Arkansas a \nsafer place to live and raise a family. As a Senator, I have continued \nto fight for legislation, programs, technology and budgets to \naccomplish this goal. And I pledge to continue this commitment.\n  It is a tremendous responsibility that the Black on Black Crime \nCoalition\n\n[[Page S281]]\n\nhas accepted. I commend the members of this coalition for their \ndedication and teamwork, and congratulate them for several meaningful \nand successful events during this year's Black on Black Crime \nPrevention Month and for their unyielding efforts throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/27/senate-section/article/S281-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ISRAEL'S DESIGNATION OF JANUARY 27, 2004 AS ``NATIONAL DAY TO COMBAT \n                            ANTI-SEMITISM''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, people in Israel and around the \nworld are joining in solidarity to commemorate January 27, 2004, as a \n``National Day to Combat Anti-Semitism.'' At a time when many Jewish \ncommunities are facing a rising tide of anti-Semitism, it is important \nthat all people of goodwill work together to educate and fight anti-\nSemitism. This insidious form of hatred has lingered in this world for \nso long that it has been dubbed ``the longest hatred.''\n  Today marks the 64th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. \nWhile six decades have passed since the genocidal regime of Adolf \nHitler fell, the urgency of combating anti-Semitism has never ceased. \nIn the past year, numerous anti-Semitic acts have occurred across the \nworld. In many European countries, including several countries that are \namongst our closest allies, the frequency of anti-Semitic attacks are \nincreasing. Jewish cemeteries, schools, synagogues, and individuals \nhave been the center of an increasing number of violent incidents.\n  These targets have essentially remained the same over the millenia. \nSuch attacks seek to intimidate and threaten individuals and desecrate \ninstitutions. We face an increasing array of groups who would \nperpetrate these acts.\n  In November 2003, people across the world were horrified when suicide \nbombers targeted two synagogues in Istanbul, Turkey. At least 25 people \nwere killed and almost 300 people, both Jewish and Muslim, were \nwounded. One of the synagogues was Neve Shalom, the center of Turkey's \nJewish community. This crowded congregation was celebrating a young \nboy's Bar Mitzvah at the time of the bombing. This attack was, without \nquestion, a specific and politically charged choice, given Turkey's \nclose ties with Israel, the United States and NATO as well as its \ncommitment to democracy.\n  Another widely reported anti-Semitic act came a month earlier when \nformer Malaysian Prime Minister Mahatir Muhammed stated that, ``The \nEuropeans killed 6 million Jews out of 12 million. But today the Jews \nrule this world by proxy. They get others to fight and die for them.'' \nThat a leader would make allusions to a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, \none of the foremost claims of anti-Semitic hatred, is particularly \nappalling. It is unconscionable to think that a longtime leader of a \nsovereign nation would fan the flames of hatred and recrimination \nagainst people of the Jewish faith. It is more disconcerting that 57 \nleaders of the countries in the Islamic conference stood and applauded \nhis speech. Mahatir's rhetoric was both ignorant and dangerous.\n  Even while these two events splashed the front pages of newspapers \nworldwide, numerous other incidents that hardly received notice caused \nirreversible damage all the same.\n  During an exhibit held in Australia last month called ``Courage to \nCare,'' two extremist groups sprayed a museum with anti-Semitic and \nracist slogans and covered it with swastikas. This was an exhibit that \ncommemorated Australian survivors of the Holocaust. The criminals also \nleft papers at the scene that portrayed a skull and crossbones and \nsaid, ``Death to Israel.''\n  In an attack in a suburb of Paris that coincided with the synagogue \nbombings in Turkey, a Jewish school was set on fire. Just a month \nearlier in Paris, a rabbi was verbally and physically attacked on his \nway to synagogue. In October, tombstones in a Jewish cemetery east of \nBerlin, Germany, were defaced by vandals who painted swastikas and \nanti-Semitic statements such as ``you got what you deserved,'' and \n``Heil Hitler.''\n  The United States has not been free from such attacks, either. \nEarlier this year, a Holocaust Museum in Terre Haute, IN, was destroyed \nby arson, with only the words ``Remember Timmy McVeigh,'' left behind.\n  In April 2002, I joined with 99 of my colleagues in sending a letter \nto President Bush that requested that he and his administration ``make \nevery effort possible to raise, at the highest level, our concerns \nabout anti-Semitic acts in Europe and anti-Semitic portrayals in the \nArab media.''\n  I was heartened by German Foreign Minister Joshka Fischer's statement \nat a conference on anti-Semitism last fall that, we are firmly \ncommitted to countering every kind of anti-Semitism, every kind of \nracism and xenophobia.'' In addition, French Prime Minister Chirac \nannounced that ``attacking a Jew in France is an attack on all of \nFrance.'' Such remarks fully acknowledge the threat posed by anti-\nSemitism. Anti-Semitism is not merely the enemy of Jews. It is the \nenemy of tolerance, freedom and openness; the very core values of all \ndemocracies.\n  Attacks on one religion, race or ethnicity threaten all of us. We \nhave learned that when hatred is allowed to fester and grow, it can \nspread with a frightening degree of rapidity and virulence. It is \nimperative that the global community work to address not only the \ncontinuing prevalence of anti-Semitism, but also hatred against all \nreligious and ethnic minorities.\n  I hope all my colleagues will join with me in commemorating Israel's \n``National Day To Combat Anti-Semitism,'' and in rededicating their \ncommitment to fight hatred wherever it may be found.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/27/senate-section/article/S281-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              CONGRATULATIONS TO HOSKINS COIN AND JEWELRY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I pay tribute and congratulate Mr. \nand Mrs. Charles and Doris Hoskins of Paducah, KY on their dedication \nand entrepreneurial spirit in their 50th year of business at Hoskins \nCoin and Jewelry, Inc.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Hoskins opened business together in 1953, selling mostly \nfurniture in downtown Paducah, KY. Mr. Hoskins, building on his \nmilitary service in World War II, joined the Paducah police force and \nserved for the next 16 years. Meanwhile, Mrs. Hoskins ran their small \nbusiness and kept its books.\n  Over the last few decades, their business has flourished an evolved. \nThis small family business looked for opportunities to expand--moving \nto a larger location down Third Street. Following the passions of Mr. \nand Mrs. Hoskins, the store started to buy and sell coins, estate \njewelry and eventually began to offer a full line of retail jewelry.\n  Hoskins Coin and Jewelry, Inc. is now a staple of downtown Paducah. \nTheir children, Ronnie and Linda Hoskins Duff, work alongside their \nparents who have even found room for grandson Brent Hoskins to work \npart-time. Local residents walk into this families store looking for a \nspecial gift, to learn about the latest coin they have found or just to \ntalk about the community. This small family business is a shining \nexample of one of the many small businesses that form the local \neconomic foundations in Kentucky.\n  Thank you, Charles and Doris, for your commitment to the city of \nPaducah and your entrepreneurial spirit. I have sincere appreciation \nfor your work. I wish you and your family continued success and \nhappiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/27/senate-section/article/S281-3", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S281-S284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE SPIRIT OF IDAHO AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

I would like to take a moment today and \nrecognize each of these outstanding individuals.\n  Kamrud Jacobson delivers newspapers in Twin Falls. While completing \nhis route one day, Kamrud noticed unusual smoke coming from the chimney \nof a nearby house. He quickly asked a neighbor to call 911.

He prefers to report on his visits \nin poetic form, and after visiting his most recent patient wrote: ``I \ncan already see it getting harder, I can already see it ending hard. I \ncan already see it lasting too long, and not long enough.'' The Hospice \nStaff appreciates his insight and poetry as they work to assist the \nHospice's patients.\n  When the Hospice had patients in the St. Anthony, Rexburg area, Barry \nLeeck of Chester was, for an extended period, the only volunteer close \nenough to be of assistance.

His volunteer hours also include helping the Hospice office \nwith clerical matters. I commend him for his service.\n  Domestic violence is a terribly destructive, hurtful thing. The \nvictims of this horror need help and protection. The Family Service \nAlliance of Pocatello provides this support.

This important organization is truly representative of the \n``Spirit of Idaho.''\n  It was an honor to present the Spirit of Idaho award to a group of \ndialysis patients from Coeur d'Alene. This group rides stationary \nbicycles to remain healthy during treatment. The group collectively set \na goal to ride the miles equivalent to a biking trip across the United \nStates. Their journey had a special destination for me--they were \npedaling to Crapo, Maryland. As a result, this group is affectionately \ncalled the ``Crapo Bikers.''

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2032. A bill to provide assistance and security for women and \nchildren in Afghanistan and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, yesterday was an important and historic \nday for Afghanistan. President Hamid Karzai signed a new constitution \nthat guarantees the equal rights of all Afghans, including women.\n  Given the terrible hardship women and girls in Afghanistan faced \nduring the years of war, drought and the draconian policies of the \nTaliban, this new constitution is an important step forward.\n  However, yesterday's victory will be sort-lived if the constitution \nis not implemented and women continue to suffer from discrimination and \nviolence, and are denied access to health care, education and job \ntraining.\n  The biggest challenge facing women today is a lack of basic security. \nHuman Rights Watch reported earlier this month that:\n\n     women and girls bear some of the worst effects of \n     Afghanistan's insecurity. Conditions are generally better \n     than under the Taliban, but women and girls continue to face \n     severe governmental and social discrimination. Those who \n     organize protests or criticize local rulers face threats and \n     violence. Soldiers and police routinely harass women and \n     girls, even in Kabul city. Many women and girls are afraid to \n     remove the burqa. Because soldiers are targeting women and \n     girls, many are staying indoors, especially in rural areas, \n     making it impossible for them to attend school, go to work, \n     or actively participate in the country's reconstruction.\n\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that will ensure that women and \nchildren are able to thrive in a post-Taliban Afghanistan.\n  This legislation authorizes $300 million each year to provide \nassistance to Afghan women and children with four specific goals. \nFirst, the bill seeks to enhance the political and human rights of \nwomen by providing assistance to help them exercise property, \ninheritance and voting rights and to enforce provisions in the new \nconstitution that ensure equal rights for women.\n  Second, the bill provides funding for health care, including \nassistance to reduce maternal and infant mortality and to train \nmidwives, nurses and traditional birth attendants.\n  Third, funding is authorized to be used for education and training, \nincluding expanding schools for women and girls, technical and \nvocational training and literacy programs.\n  Finally, the bill addresses the issue of security by providing \nprograms to prevent the trafficking of women and girls, support the \nreturn of refugees, and provide general security to prevent violent \nattacks against schools. The bill also calls for an expansion of \ninternational peacekeeping forces throughout the country.\n  We have heard many times that failure is not an option in \nAfghanistan. Passage of this legislation will go a long way to ensure \nthe success of a democratic and peaceful nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2033. A bill to designate the Federal building located at Fifth \nand Richardson Avenues in Roswell, New Mexico, as the ``Joe Skeen \nFederal Building''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nrename the Federal building in Roswell, NM, after my dear friend, \nRepresentative Joe Skeen. On December 7, 2003, Joe lost his valiant \nbattle with Parkinson's Disease. He will be deeply missed.\n  I first met Joe more than 40 years ago when I was fresh out of law \nschool and Joe was a rising star within the New Mexico Republican \nparty. From that moment, I knew that Joe was destined for great things. \nTo the great benefit of the people of the State of New Mexico and the \nNation, Joe chose to dedicate his life to public service.\n  For those of us who knew Joe, it came as no surprise when he became \nonly the third person in our Nation's history to win a U.S. House seat \nas a write-in candidate in 1980. During his 22 year tenure as New \nMexico's representative for the 2nd Congressional District, Joe was a \npowerful voice for the people of his district and its rural lifestyle. \nFor instance, he was a staunch defender of New Mexico's farming and \nranching interests.\n  Many have described Joe as one of the most powerful members of \nCongress that New Mexico ever sent to Washington, DC. But Joe never \nforgot who he was and where he was from. He was part and parcel of this \nland and its people. Joe truly represented the people of the 2nd \nCongressional District, both politically and in spirit.\n  Joe sought committee assignments that would most benefit the largely \nrural district that he represented. During his time in the U.S. \nCongress, Joe served 17 years on the House Appropriations Committee, \nserving as Chairman of both the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee \nand the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  In 2002 Joe retired from Congress. After 11 terms in Congress, Joe \ndecided to return to his ranch, a place that he described as being ``at \nthe center of my upbringing and which shaped my character and \nprinciples in life.'' I feel truly blessed to have had the honor to\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\nserve with Joe for those 22 years. I know Washington will go on without \nJoe, but it will not be nearly as good a place.\n  For all the good that Joe accomplished during his 22 years as a \nCongressman, I know he could not have done it alone. We owe a great \ndebt of gratitude to Mary, his wife of 57 years. She and the Skeen \nchildren deserve great credit for making his life so remarkable.\n  Today I introduce legislation that would designate the Federal \nBuilding in Roswell, NM, the ``Joe Skeen Federal Building.'' I would \nlike to thank my distinguished colleague Senator Jeff Bingaman for co-\nsponsoring this legislation. Additionally, Representatives Wilson, \nPearce and Udall will introduce shortly a companion bill honoring Joe \nfor his service to his State and Nation.\n  Joe was born in Roswell, NM, represented the people of the Second \nCongressional District for 22 years and spent his final days in \nRoswell, NM. It is fitting that the Roswell Federal Building bear his \nname. One of Joe's first actions after he took office in 1981 was to \nintroduce legislation to name the Federal Building in Las Cruces after \nthe man he replaced, the late Congressman Harold Runnels. I believe \nit's appropriate, 22 years later, to return the favor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2033\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The Federal building located at Fifth and Richardson \n     Avenues in Roswell, New Mexico, shall be known and designated \n     as the ``Joe Skeen Federal Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the Federal building \n     referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to \n     the Joe Skeen Federal Building.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/27/senate-section/article/S288-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S288-S289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 292--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING FEBRUARY 2, 2004, \n                 AS ``NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. \nDodd) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 292\n\n       Whereas the American School Counselor Association has \n     declared the week beginning February 2, 2004, as ``National \n     School Counseling Week'';\n       Whereas the Senate has recognized the importance of school \n     counseling through the inclusion of elementary and secondary \n     school counseling programs in the reauthorization of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       Whereas school counselors have long advocated that the \n     American education system must leave no child behind and must \n     provide opportunities for every student;\n       Whereas personal and social growth results in increased \n     academic achievement;\n       Whereas school counselors help develop well-rounded \n     students by guiding them through their academic, personal, \n     social, and career development;\n       Whereas school counselors were instrumental in helping \n     students, teachers, and parents deal with the trauma of \n     terrorism inflicted on the United States on September 11, \n     2001, and its aftermath;\n       Whereas students face myriad challenges every day, \n     including peer pressure, depression, and school violence;\n       Whereas school counselors are usually the only \n     professionals in a school building that are trained in both \n     education and mental health;\n       Whereas the roles and responsibilities of school counselors \n     are often misunderstood, and the school counselor position is \n     often among the first to be eliminated in order to meet \n     budgetary constraints;\n       Whereas the national average ratio of students to school \n     counselors of 485 to 1 is more than double the 250 to 1 ratio \n     recommended by the American School Counselor Association, the \n     American Counseling Association, the American Medical \n     Association, the American Psychological Association, and \n     other organizations; and\n       Whereas the celebration of ``National School Counseling \n     Week'' would increase awareness of the important and \n     necessary role school counselors play in the lives of the \n     Nation's students: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should designate the week beginning \n     February 2, 2004, as ``National School Counseling Week''.\n       (b) Proclamation.--The Senate requests the President to \n     issue a proclamation--\n       (1) designating the week beginning February 2, 2004, as \n     ``National School Counseling Week''; and\n       (2) calling on the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe the week with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities that promote awareness of the role \n     school counselors perform within the school and the community \n     at large to prepare students for fulfilling lives as \n     contributing members of society.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution \ndesignating the week of February 2, 2004, as ``National School \nCounseling Week,'' on behalf of my colleagues Senator Biden, Senator \nDorgan, Senator Johnson and Senator Dodd. This resolution would honor \nand celebrate the important work of school counselors, which the Senate \nhas recognized since 1965 through the inclusion of school counseling in \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Across the country, there are approximately 95,000 school counselors, \nincluding 2,100 in Washington State. School counselors are critical \ncomponents of a successful school and contribute significantly to the \ngrowth and success of students. In fact, school counselors were \ninstrumental in helping students, teachers, and parents deal with the \ntrauma of terrorism on September 11, 2001, and its aftermath. However, \ndespite their important service, counselors are expected to serve, on \naverage 485 students each, and are overwhelmed. The American School \nCounseling Association, the American Medical Association, and the \nAmerican Psychological Association recommend the ratio of students to \nschool counselors be 250 students to 1 school counselor.\n  I want to share just a few examples of how school counselors \nthroughout America are helping students.\n  In a middle school in southern California, school counselors realized \nthat 257 students were in danger of not passing onto the next grade. \nThey discovered that only 15 percent of the students understood the \npromotion and retention requirements. The school counselors presented a \nseries of individual and small group lessons on promotion and retention \ncriteria. After the lessons, 100 percent of the students understood the \nrequirements. As a result, 72 of the 257 students, about 28 percent, \navoided retention that year.\n  In a high school in Racine, WI, a math teacher realized that 100 of \nhis students failed algebra in the first quarter of the year. He asked \na school counselor for help. Together, they discovered some of the \nreasons why students were failing. They initiated several programs, \nsuch as peer tutoring and homework assistance. As a result, 93 of the \n100 students passed algebra by the end of the year and were able to \nmove on to the next level of math.\n  A school district in Kentucky realized that the retention rate among \nninth grade students was unacceptably high. School counselors, teachers \nand administrators worked together to develop and implement strategies \ntargeted at helping ninth graders move to 10th grade. As a result, \nretention rates improved in 16 of the 17 high schools in the county in \njust one year. One school saw the retention rate improve more than 25 \npercent.\n  This resolution is merely the beginning of what we need to be doing \nto support school counselors. We need to reduce the ratio of students \nto counselors to, at the most, 250 to 1. We need to help schools \nmaintain their funding so that school counselors are not cut from \nschool budgets. And we need to support our school counselors so that \nthey can continue to be integral in the fabric of our schools and help \nour students achieve success in high school and beyond.\n  School counselors design and implement comprehensive developmental \nschool counseling programs that are integral to the success of every \nstudent. They help students improve academic achievement, develop \npersonally and socially and prepare for successful careers that will \nenable them to be contributing members of society. National School \nCounseling Week focuses\n\n[[Page S289]]\n\npublic attention on the unique contribution of professional school \ncounselors and highlights the tremendous impact that school counselors \nhave in helping students achieve success in school and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/27/senate-section/article/S289-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n  SA 2262.

Mr. GRASSLEY (for Mr. Nickles) proposed an amendment to \namendment SA 2233 proposed by Mr. Grassley (for himself, Mr. Baucus, \nMr. Gregg, and Mr. Kennedy) to the bill H.R. 3108, to amend the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to temporarily replace the 30-year Treasury rate \nwith a rate based on long-term corporate bonds for certain pension plan \nfunding requirements and other provisions, and for other purposes; \nwhich was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON STATUS OF PRIVATE PENSION \n                   PLANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:-\n       (1) The private pension system is integral to the \n     retirement security of Americans, along with individual \n     savings and Social Security.\n       (2) The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is \n     responsible for insuring the nation's private pension system, \n     and currently insures the pensions of 34,500,000 participants \n     in 29,500 single-employer plans, and 9,700,000 participants \n     in more than 1,600 multiemployer plans.\n       (3) The PBGC announced on January 15, 2004, that it \n     suffered a net loss in fiscal year 2003 of $7,600,000,000 for \n     single-employer pension plans, bringing the PBGC's deficit to \n     $11,200,000,000. This deficit is the PBGC's worst on record, \n     three times larger than the $3,600,000,000 deficit \n     experienced in fiscal year 2002.\n       (4) The PBGC also announced that the separate insurance \n     program for multiemployer pension plans sustained a net loss \n     of $419,000,000 in fiscal year 2003, resulting in a fiscal \n     year-end deficit of $261,000,000. The 2003 multiemployer plan \n     deficit is the first deficit in more than 20 years and is the \n     largest deficit on record.\n       (5) The PBGC estimates that the total underfunding in \n     multiemployer pension\n\n[[Page S291]]\n\n     plans is roughly $100,000,000, and in single-employer plans \n     is approximately $400,000,000. This underfunding is due in \n     part to the recent decline in the stock market and low \n     interest rates, but is also due to demographic changes. For \n     example, in 1980, there were four active workers for every \n     one retiree in a multiemployer plan, but in 2002, there were \n     only two active workers for every one retiree.\n       (6) This pension plan underfunding is concentrated in \n     mature and often-declining industries, where plan liabilities \n     will come due sooner.\n       (7) Neither the Senate Committee on Finance nor the Senate \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), \n     the committees of jurisdiction over pension matters, has held \n     hearings this Congress nor reported legislation addressing \n     the funding of multiemployer pension plans;\n       (8) The Senate is concerned about the current funding \n     status of the private pension system, both single and multi-\n     employer plans;\n       (9) The Senate is concerned about the potential liabilities \n     facing the PBGC and, as a result, the potential burdens \n     facing healthy pension plans and taxpayers;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions should conduct hearings on the \n     status of the multiemployer pension plans, and should work in \n     consultation with the Departments of Labor and Treasury on \n     permanent measures to strengthen the integrity of the private \n     pension system in order to protect the benefits of current \n     and future pension plan beneficiaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/27/senate-section/article/S291-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
