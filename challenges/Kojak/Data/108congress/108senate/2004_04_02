Mr. President, earlier this week the OPEC cartel announced \nit would reduce oil production by 1 million barrels of oil per day \nstarting April 1. This move is designed solely for one purpose: to keep \npushing up oil prices in the United States and other oil-consuming \ncountries.\n  Most energy experts say that given current inventory levels in the \nUnited States and elsewhere and current consumption rates, OPEC's cuts \nmean that gasoline prices will likely stay high, hurting American \nfamilies; jet fuel prices will stay high, hurting our airlines; and \ndiesel fuel prices will stay high, hurting our truckers, manufacturers, \nand farmers.\n  As OPEC was planning this price hike, what was the response of the \nadministration? Just a few days before, the Secretary of Energy stated \nhe was not about to go begging for oil.\n  One step we should take immediately to counteract high prices and \nOPEC's action is to stop filling our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This \nmonth, the administration is going to put about 200,000 barrels per day \nof oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. If OPEC's cuts are \ndistributed equally among its customers, this is about how much the \nOPEC cut will reduce U.S. supplies. Since the U.S. imports about 20 \npercent of OPEC's output and OPEC plans to cut production by about 1 \nmillion barrels per day, about 200,000 barrels per day will be the \nreduction in the supply to the United States.\n  Holding off additional deposits into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nwould keep about as much oil on the U.S. oil market as OPEC is taking \noff our market. One way to fight back is to cancel these additional \ndeposits which will otherwise go into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \nwhich is already 93-percent filled.\n  Mr. President, 200,000 barrels per day is a lot of oil. It is as much \noil as is produced in several of our major oil-producing States. For \ninstance, Oklahoma produces about 180,000 barrels a day. It is about as \nmuch as we import from Kuwait. Last year we imported about 205,000 \nbarrels per day from Kuwait.\n  Over time, 100,000 to 200,000 barrels per day adds up to a \nsignificant amount of oil. Over the course of the next year or so, \nthese daily fills will add up to about 50 million barrels of oil. In \nother words, over the next year or so, the Department of Energy, if it \nsticks to its plan to continue to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nto 100 percent, the DOE will take about 50 million barrels of oil off \nthe market and put them into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  If we keep that oil in the market, in the private sector, we would \nget both short-term and long-term benefits. The day after the Senate \npassed the amendment which I offered with Senator Collins to cancel the \nplanned delivery of 50 million barrels of oil into the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, prices on the New York and London crude oil \nexchanges fell by more than $1, just on the news that the Senate had \nacted, even before anyone knew whether the House would follow suit. \nPrices rose back to their previous levels when the Department of Energy \nand some key Members of Congress said that the DOE should keep putting \nthat oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  The market's reaction to the news that the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve deliveries might be canceled is good evidence of how the market \nwill react to the cancellation of those deliveries. We should listen to \nwhat the market is telling us. Keeping 50 million barrels of oil on the \nmarket rather than putting them into the reserve will enable our \nprivate sector inventories to build back to normal levels. They have \nnot been at normal levels for some time now. They have been well-below \nnormal and recently fell to historic lows.\n\n  If we restore those private sector inventories, this will reduce \nprices substantially, and most experts agree that absent some type of \nadditional supplies in the market, oil and gas prices are going to stay \nvery high.\n  I want to make it clear that we are not proposing removing oil from \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve at this time. What we are talking about \nis simply to stop putting even more oil into the reserve which is \nalready 93 percent of capacity.\n  The administration says the daily addition is too small to make a \ndifference in the price of oil. This is wrong for two reasons.\n  First, the amount the DOE is putting into the reserve each day is a \nlot of oil. Second, the administration's position ignores the long-term \neffect of putting these barrels of oil into the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve--and this is the DOE's own staff I am going to quote. This is \nwhat DOE's own staff said:\n\n       Essentially, if the reserve inventory grows, and OPEC does \n     not accommodate that growth by exporting more oil, the \n     increase comes at the expense of commercial inventories. Most \n     analysts agree that oil prices are directly correlated with \n     inventories, and a drop of 20 million barrels over a 6-month \n     period can substantially increase prices.\n\n  In fact, commercial inventories did fall on average by 20 million \nbarrels in each of the three successive 6-month periods following the \nDOE staff's warning.\n  The Department of Energy's own staff who operates the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve recommended against buying more oil for the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve in tight markets.\n  In the spring of 2002, as prices were rising and inventories in the \nprivate sector were falling, this is what the Department of Energy \nstaff warned:\n\n       Commercial petroleum inventories are low, retail product \n     prices are high and economic growth is slow.\n\n  This is DOE staff's bottom line:\n\n       The Government should avoid acquiring oil for the Reserve \n     under these circumstances.\n       Commercial petroleum inventories are low,--\n\n  They are still at an all-time low.\n\n     retail product prices are high--\n\n  They are at an all-time high now.\n\n     and economic growth is slow.\n\n  And it does continue to be sluggish. This is what their bottom line \nis:\n\n       The Government should avoid acquiring oil for the Reserve \n     under these circumstances.\n\n  The administration chose to ignore those warnings. The reserve \ndeliveries proceeded, and just as the DOE staff predicted, supplies \ntightened and prices climbed.\n  The administration continues to ignore the advice of these experts at \nthe reserve, and American consumers are paying the price.\n  A wide variety of experts outside the Department of Energy has stated \nthat\n\n[[Page S3601]]\n\nfilling the reserve during tight oil markets increases oil prices. This \nJanuary, Goldman Sachs, which is the largest crude oil trader in the \nworld, said the following:\n\n       Government storage builds will provide persistent support \n     to the markets--\n\nmeaning filling the reserve pushes prices up, and\n\n       Government increases in storage lowered commercially \n     available petroleum supplies.\n\n  Bill Greehey, who is the chief executive of Valero Energy, the \nlargest independent refiner in the United States, has criticized the \nadministration for filling the reserve when commercial inventories were \nlow, thereby preventing increases in the commercial inventories.\n  Last September, when oil prices were at $29 a barrel, Greehey \ncomplained the reserve program was diverting oil from the marketplace. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       If that was going into inventory, instead of the reserve, \n     you would not be having $29 oil, you'd be having $25 oil. So, \n     I think they've completely mismanaged the strategic reserve.\n\n  Now that is the chief executive of the largest independent refiner in \nthe United States.\n  One of the top energy economists in the country, Phil Verleger, \nestimates the reserve program has added $8 to $10 to the price of a \nbarrel of oil.\n  Economist Larry Kudlow said:\n\n       Normally, in Wall Street parlance, you're supposed to buy \n     low and sell high, but in Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     actions, we're buying higher and higher and that has really \n     helped keep oil prices high.\n\n  Now that is from a conservative economist.\n  In an article explaining why oil prices are so high, a recent issue \nof the Economist reported the following:\n\n       Another factor . . . propping up oil prices may be what [a] \n     trader calls ``supply disruption risk.''\n\n  Here is what the Economist went on to say:\n\n       These worries have, in part, been fueled by a most \n     unexpected source, the American government. Despite the high \n     prices, American officials continue to buy oil on the open \n     market to fill their country's strategic petroleum reserves. \n     Why buy, you might ask, when prices are high, and thereby \n     keep them up? The Senate has asked that question as well. It \n     passed a nonbinding resolution this month calling on the Bush \n     administration to stop SPR purchases, but Spencer Abraham, \n     the Energy Secretary, has refused.\n\n  In January, the Petroleum Argus, an energy industry newsletter, \nstated the following:\n\n       The act of building up strategic stocks diverts crude \n     supplies that would otherwise have entered the open market. \n     The natural time to do this is when supplies are ample, \n     commercial stocks are adequate and prices low. Yet the Bush \n     administration, contrary to this logic, is forging ahead with \n     plans to add [more oil] to the stockpile.\n\n  After the Senate passed our amendment that said we should hold off \nfurther purchases, Todd Hultman, who is president of Dailyfutures.com, \na commodity research provider, was quoted as saying the amendment:\n\n       . . . makes good sense and is designed to make more crude \n     oil available at a time when unleaded gasoline prices have \n     been making new record highs.\n\n  Last summer, Dr. Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Centre for \nGlobal Energy Studies, criticized the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nprogram:\n\n       They've continued filling the reserve, which is crazy, \n     putting the oil under the ground when it is needed in \n     refineries.\n\n  Now that is why the Senate, with support from both Republicans and \nDemocrats, recently approved an amendment, which I offered with Senator \nCollins, to stop Strategic Petroleum Reserve shipments, sell the oil \nthat would have been placed in the reserve and use the money from those \nsales for important homeland security programs.\n\n  Fifty-three House Members, 39 Republicans and 14 Democrats, recently \nwrote the President requesting a suspension of SPR petroleum reserve \nshipments. The House letter states the following:\n\n       Filling the SPR, without regard to crude oil prices and the \n     availability of supplies, drives oil prices higher and \n     ultimately hurts consumers.\n\n  The administration still chooses to ignore common sense and it adds \noil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, no matter how high the price or \nhow tight the supply of oil.\n  Even though this discussion is about suspending additional deposits \ninto the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when prices are high and private \nand commercial inventories are low, I would like to comment on a \nmisimpression regarding what happened the last time the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve was actually used to release oil. Again, we are now \nshifting the discussion from talking about not putting more oil to the \nreserve to what happened last time we took oil out of the reserve. This \nis what happened during the Clinton administration when 30 million \nbarrels were taken from the reserve and put on the private market. This \nwas in September of the year 2000. Here is what the Washington Post \nrecently stated:\n\n       The last time an administration tapped the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve, the impact on price was negligible. When \n     President Bill Clinton ordered the sale of 30 million barrels \n     of oil on September 22, 2000, the average price of regular \n     gas had climbed to more than $1.56. By October 24, when the \n     oil began to hit the market, prices had slipped one penny, \n     according to the Energy Department's Energy Information \n     Administration.\n\n  Well, that statement is highly misleading because it omits critical \ninformation. Here is the full story: On September 22, 2000, with crude \noil prices at $37 a barrel, home heating oil stocks at historic lows \nand winter around the corner, President Clinton ordered the release of \n30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Within a few \ndays of the announcement of the release, crude oil prices had fallen by \n$6 a barrel. Within a week, home heating oil prices fell by 10 cents \nper gallon. Within 2 weeks, wholesale gasoline prices had fallen by 14 \ncents per gallon.\n  So what the statement omitted is what happened to oil and gas prices \nimmediately after the order for the release of that 30 million barrels \nfrom the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. There was an immediate impact \ndownward on gasoline prices, wholesale prices for home heating oil, in \nthe amounts of 10 cents a gallon for home heating oil and 14 cents a \ngallon for gasoline. So the statement that gasoline prices on October \n24, a month later, were only a cent lower than on September 22 omits \nthe critical information that oil and gasoline prices fell \nsignificantly immediately after the release but then rose later due to \nunrelated events in the Middle East.\n  Two weeks after the release, crude oil prices were still $6 per \nbarrel lower than the prerelease prices and wholesale gasoline prices \nwere 14 cents per gallon lower. Only when a wave of violence hit the \nMiddle East during the third week after the release did gasoline prices \nrise to their prerelease levels.\n  So the release of 30 million barrels of reserve oil during the \nClinton administration did have a significant, immediate effect on oil \nand gas prices downward.\n  Just as taking oil out of the reserve can significantly affect \nprices, putting oil into the reserve can have a significant effect as \nwell. That is what is going on now. The administration should listen to \nits energy experts and the economists and stop adding oil to the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve which is already 93 percent full. The \nresult will be lower oil and gasoline prices, a welcome relief to \nAmerican consumers, manufacturers, and airlines.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

The report shows the unemployment rate is little changed at \n5.7 percent. But some 308,000 new jobs were added last month, the most \nin 4 years, and about 3 times more than Wall Street predicted.\n  Over the past year, we have added three-quarters of a million new \njobs.

Well, I think we all know this is an election year, and \none\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\nparty can't win the White House if the economy is doing well. \nTherefore, the ``sky is falling'' crowd has to spin the wheel of \nmisfortune, telling us good news is in fact bad news. They are going to \ntry to convince us good news is really bad news. It is a sort of \nnewspeak approach. But it is not that easy.\n  This town is full of people very experienced when it comes to putting \nlipstick on a pig. But this is different. This is like scribbling a \nmustache on the Mona Lisa. It is not so easy, but it can be done. For \nexample, you can do it if you first ignore all of the facts around \nyou--just ignore them all. Next you have to ignore your own past claims \nthat the same fact was a good fact. Lastly, you have to search very \nhard to find a dark lining in the silver clouds, take that one fact and \nwrap some blue-in-the-face hyperbole around it, and repeat it day after \nday after day until anyone hearing it turns blue, too.\n  The reason you can keep repeating that scratched, warped record is \nbecause it may be the only sad song you can play. The simple facts, the \noverwhelming weight of facts, are on the President's side.\n  First, the U.S. has had the strongest economic growth of any modern \neconomy over the past 12 months. Let me repeat that. The United \nStates--our country--has had the strongest economic growth of any \nmodern economy over the past 12 months. Our 4.3-percent economic growth \nrate is the best economic performance in the world. But we are told \nthis stunning success is bad, that somehow the best is the worst.\n  Absolutely wrong. The U.S. economy is the best. This chart \nillustrates the point. It compares the U.S. growth rate over the last \n12 months--this line--with Australia, Japan, Britain, Spain, Sweden, \nCanada, Belgium, Austria, France, euro area, Denmark, Germany, Italy, \nSwitzerland, and Netherlands. It compares to all of the industrialized \nworld. We had dramatically better growth than any other country. The \nonly one close to us is Australia.\n  Not only did we do well over the last 12 months, but what is \nprojected? The U.S. is projected to have the strongest economic growth \namong developed countries in the next year.\n  So let's look ahead at the projections. The consensus of \ninternational economists, as reported in the Economist, indicates the \nU.S. will have 4.7 percent growth this year. While far and away the \nbest projection for growth in the industrialized world, we are told \nthat somehow here at home the worst is yet to come. Look at the \nprojections.\n  Over the next year, we are projected to have the strongest GDP growth \nof any country in the industrialized world. But they will continue to \ntry to convince us that the best is not here.\n  The U.S. jobs record compared to other modern economies is indeed \nreason for optimism, in fact even pride. Not only is there reason for \noptimism, there is reason for pride. America has an unemployment rate \nalmost one-third less than that of Europe's, with 5.7 percent here, 8.8 \npercent in Europe. We have an unemployment rate that is one-third less \nthan Europe. Of all the European nations, only the three EU members \nhave a local unemployment rate lower than the national unemployment \nrate in the U.S. So the U.S. jobs record is the best of Europe, \nAustralia, and Canada. The U.S. jobs record is the best of any of these \nindustrialized nations--any of them. Ours is better.\n  Next, let's compare America's job record today to that of our own \npast, because we have heard a lot of discussion about our economy today \nversus what it used to be like in the ``good old days,'' as they say.\n  It is clear that America is on a course to have the best jobs decade \nin half a century, the decade we are currently in. Right now, America \nis poised to experience the best decade, in terms of the unemployment \nrate, in 50 years. The decade we are in now is likely to be the best, \nin terms of unemployment, in 50 years.\n  We are halfway to the best jobs decade in half a century. From 2000 \nto 2004, it was 5.2 percent. Looking at the same first 4 years in the \nprevious decade, it was 6.6 percent. The first 4 years in the 1980s, it \nwas 8.3 percent. Look at the first of the 4 years in the 1970s, when it \nwas 5.4 percent. In the first 4 years in the 1960s, it was 5.7 percent. \nBack in 1950 to 1954, it was 4 percent.\n\n  So we are on the way to having the best jobs decade in the last 50 \nyears. Again, some will try to convince the American people that things \nare not going well. If the unemployment rate for 2004 stays around 5.7 \npercent for the year--no improvement at all but no worsening--then the \nunemployment rate for the period of 2000 to 2004 will be 5.2 percent. \nHow does that compare to the jobs performance in the first half of the \nprevious decade? I just went over it. We are in the process of having \nthe best first half of the decade in terms of jobs performance in the \nlast 50 years.\n  But, again, we are told that somehow the best is the worst. The sky \nis falling crowd is wrong again. The best is still the best. It is \nfunny how they thought the best was the best not long ago.\n  For example, in 1996, another election year, we had some around here \nwho thought a 5.6-unemployment rate was something to crow about. They \nwere happy about it. Back in 1996, when we had an incumbent President \nrunning in the other party and the unemployment rate was about what it \nis today, they were crowing about it.\n  When the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent under President Clinton in \n1996, Senator Kerry said:\n\n       Unemployment is down. The economy is doing well.\n\n  He said that in 1996 when we had essentially the same unemployment \nrate we have today.\n  Also that year, Senator Kerry was bragging about the fact that \n``unemployment is the lowest in the industrial world,'' when it was \nessentially what it is today. He was bragging about it then; this was \nterrific then but it is not so good today.\n  When the unemployment rate was at 5.6 percent under President Bush, \nSenator Kerry said:\n\n       The fact is that Americans are worse off.\n\n  He said:\n\n       The bottom line is, for America's workers, there is no \n     ``greater prosperity'' under George Bush.\n\n  These comments were made when the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent, \njust recently. These other comments were made when the unemployment \nrate was 5.6 percent and President Clinton was running for reelection \nin 1996. The same individual, looking at the same unemployment figure, \none time acted as if it is something to applaud, and next suggested the \ncountry is going to heck in a handbasket.\n  It is kind of funny how they thought the best was the best not so \nlong ago. As I just said, in April of 1996, Senator Kerry said:\n\n       Unemployment is down. The economy is doing well.\n\n  He praised the economy, saying unemployment was the lowest in the \nindustrialized world. That is what he said when unemployment was at 5.6 \npercent in April of 1996. But now, facing the same facts in the last \nweek or two, it is somehow not good news.\n  So when unemployment is 5.6 percent under a Democratic President, \nBill Clinton, it is the best of times; when it is 5.6 percent under \nPresident Bush, it is the worst of times.\n  That is just spin: 5.6 percent is the worst of times under George \nBush; 5.6 percent is the best of times under Bill Clinton. It is just \nWashington spin.\n  Does anyone not have any memory around here? Today we will hear the \nsame debate but with a different number. The unemployment rate edged up \nto 5.7 percent. We will hear that a 5.7 percent unemployment rate was \ngood back then but bad now. So why is a 5.7 percent unemployment rate \ngood then and bad now?\n  They claim millions of jobs have been lost since President Bush took \noffice, creating, as you have heard them say, the worst performance \nsince the Great Depression. Think of that. They believe today is like \nthe Great Depression.\n  In 1937, Franklin Roosevelt stated:\n\n       I see one-third of our Nation ill housed, ill clad, and ill \n     nourished.\n\n  Yet we are told that today, when home ownership is the highest ever \nrecorded--home ownership is the highest ever recorded--when the poverty \nrate is the fourth lowest in a quarter century, and when we have the \nstrongest economy in the developed world, we are practically in a Great \nDepression.\n  On what single fact do they hang this utterly absurd charge? \nActually, they don't have a fact but, rather, they have a survey of \nbusiness establishments.\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\nThat survey suggests that from March 2001 to February 2004, payroll \njobs are down by 2.5 million.\n  Of course, another survey of jobs, the household survey, says that we \nhave more jobs now than at any time in our history, 138 million jobs--\n138 million jobs--the most in our history under the household survey. \nWe have not lost jobs by this measure; we have gained jobs, half a \nmillion jobs more than at any time in American history, leading to the \nquestion: Which survey is right?\n  Let's look at the statistical abstract for 2003. If you look at this \nabstract, which is the final word on facts and statistics in America, \nyou will not see the measure showing job loss. Instead, the statistical \nabstract uses the job measure that says the U.S. today has the most \njobs ever in our entire history.\n  This is the Economic Report of the President. Whether it is the \nreport of a Democratic President or a Republican President, this report \nuses the job measure that says the U.S. today has the most jobs ever.\n  If you look at the unemployment rate announced today by the Labor \nDepartment, the unemployment rate calculation by that Department and \nrepeated by every newspaper, TV, and radio, uses the job measure that \nsays the U.S. has the most jobs ever--the most jobs ever--in our \nhistory.\n  If you ask the farmer, if you ask the self-employed worker, the \nprivate household worker, the domestic servant, or the family-run \nbusiness, they are part of the job measure that says the U.S. has the \nmost jobs ever--the most jobs ever.\n  These workers, roughly some 8 million and some of the hardest working \nin our country, the ``sky is falling crowd'' does not count these \nworkers under the measure they use. We think they work for a living. My \nfriends across the aisle apparently do not.\n  So, you can make this absurd charge about job losses if you ignore \nthe statistical abstract, if you ignore the Presidential reports, if \nyou ignore the Department of Labor's unemployment rate, and if you \nignore 8 million workers, but after all is said and done, after we have \nall revved up the spin machine so that we are all dizzy, after all this \nis over, we are going to have an election. On that day, all the \nspinning will stop, and the American people will decide. They will \ndecide if America is closer to the worst of times--the ``sky is falling \ncrowd'' claim--or nearer to the best of times, as the facts suggest. I \nlook forward to the day all the spin is set aside.\n  The unemployment rate today is a good number. We would like for it to \nget even better, but it is a good number. It is the same good number as \nin 1996 when President Clinton was bragging on it. It is the same good \nnumber as in 1996 when Senator Kerry was bragging on it. So I can say \ndespite our challenges, despite 9/11 and recessions, stock crashes and \ncorporate scandals, our economy is strong, our security is rising.\n  Challenges remain, of course. We will not rest until everyone who \nwants a job can find a job. But for America, have no doubt about it, \nthe best is yet to come. It is not behind us; it is ahead of us. I \nthink the facts are compelling that the economy is good and getting \nbetter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/02/senate-section/article/S3603-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  JOBS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for 38 months, the Bush administration has \nhad job loss. We join in the celebration that we have had jobs created, \nand the President during the next 7 months until the election will have \nto create another 2.5 million jobs to not be known as the only \nPresident since Herbert Hoover who created no private sector jobs. So \nhe has 2.5 million more jobs to go, and we hope that he beats Herbert \nHoover's record.\n  Let me also say, the numbers that came out today indicate the \nunemployment rate went up this month. It was not stable. It went up. It \nwent up from 5.6 percent to 5.7 percent. This number is not an \nirrelevant number.\n  I will also say that when Senator Kerry spoke, of course, he was \ndealing with what took place in the Clinton years. When President \nClinton took office from President Bush 1, the unemployment rate was \n7.4 percent. During President Clinton's administration, as a result of \nthe very difficult deficit reduction vote that took place in 1993 where \nnot a single Republican voted in the House or the Senate for the \ndeficit reduction plan, the deficits disappeared and unemployment \ndropped downward significantly, from 7.4 percent to 4 percent. That is \nwhere we were when this man, the President of the United States George \nBush, took office. Senator Kerry was talking about how good things were \nwhen it was 5.4 percent because it had dropped 2 percent from Bush 1 to \nClinton 1.\n  The number of people unemployed in America today--5.7 percent--is not \nirrelevant. It is not irrelevant to the millions of Americans who are \nout of work. So many are out of work. The unemployment rolls are around \n9 million or 10 million, but there are millions no longer listed on the \nunemployment rolls because they are taken off after they are unemployed \nfor such a long period of time. The average time a person is unemployed \nin America today is almost 1 year. I do not think we should be doing \nhigh-fives out here.\n  I join with my friend, the senior Senator from Kentucky, in talking \nabout it is good we have had for the first time in a long time a \nsignificant rise in the number of employed. But we have to go forward \nbecause during this President's term of office, we will have to gain \nabout 2.5 million more jobs for him not to be considered a President in \nthe same category as Herbert Hoover.\n  Speaking of ignoring past claims, the administration, as we know, \nclaimed there would be millions of jobs created with these tax cuts, \nand we have lost jobs. Let me also say this: Of course, there are more \njobs now than there were because we have millions more people in this \ncountry today. That is the reason.\n  As happy as we are with the creation of new jobs last month, let's \nunderstand we have a long way to go. We have gas prices that are high. \nNevada has the second highest gas prices in America. We have to focus \non the fact that we had nine Americans killed in Iraq yesterday. We \nhave to focus on the fact that the number of dead in Iraq is now over \n600. We have to focus on the fact now that casualties in Iraq are more \nthan 3,500, with people missing arms, legs, and being paralyzed.\n  So we still have lots of problems. I have no doubt, and I join with \nmy friend from Kentucky, about the greatness of America. We believe in \nthe greatness of America, but as legislators we also believe we have an \nobligation to make our country even greater. That is why we think it is \nwrong that 8 million Americans are not going to be able to have \novertime under the Bush rule that has been promulgated. We also think \nit is wrong that people who are on minimum wage are not going to get an \nincrease as other people in America are getting. We think that is \nimportant. We also believe those people who are going off the \nunemployment rolls every week deserve extended unemployment benefits, \nas was done during the Reagan administration and during the first Bush \nadministration.\n  So there is a lot of work we have to do. I hope next month we can \nagain be talking about the increased jobs. Certainly it is something we \nshould be happy about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/02/senate-section/article/S3603-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3603-S3604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CBO REPORTS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The bill would authorize the National Park Service \n     (NPS) to acquire the added acreage by purchase, donation, or \n     exchange, except that lands that are already owned by the \n     federal government would be acquired by transfer. Finally, \n     the bill would authorize the appropriation of whatever \n     amounts are necessary for these purposes.\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 1576 would cost the federal \n     government about $5 million over the next year or two. Of \n     this amount, we estimate that $4 million would be used to \n     purchase about 190 acres of private property, and $1 million \n     would be used to develop that land. The remaining acreage \n     that would be added to the park is either already owned by \n     the federal government or would be donated by the nonprofit \n     Civil War Preservation Trust.

Mr. President, two weeks ago, the Violence Policy Center \nreleased a report rebutting a number of assertions made by the Fifty \nCaliber Institute about the civilian sale of .50 caliber anti-armor \nsniper rifles.\n  The .50 caliber sniper rifle is among the most powerful weapons \nlegally available. According to the Violence Policy Center's report, a \n.50 caliber sniper rifle is capable of accurately hitting a target over \n1,500 yards away, and the ammunition available for the .50 caliber \nincludes armor-piercing, incendiary, and explosive bullets. The report \nalso cites the U.S. Army's manual on urban combat, which states that \n.50 caliber sniper rifles are designed to attack bulk fuel tanks and \nother high-value targets from a distance, using ``their ability to \nbreak through all but the thickest shielding material.''\n  One of the most disturbing parts of the report quotes a brochure from \nthe leading manufacturer, Barrett Firearms, advertising the .50 caliber \nsniper rifle.\n\n       The Model 82A1 is designed to provide extreme accuracy at \n     extended ranges with standard military ammunition. . . . The \n     accuracy of the Model 82A1 makes possible the placement of \n     the shot in the most vulnerable area of the target. The \n     compressor sections of jet engines or the transmissions of \n     helicopters are likely targets for the weapon, making it \n     capable of destroying multi-million dollar aircraft with a \n     single hit delivered to a vital area. The cost-effectiveness \n     of the Model 82A1 cannot be overemphasized when a round of \n     ammunition purchased for less than 10 USD [U.S. Dollars] can \n     be used to destroy or disable a modern jet aircraft.\n\n  I believe that information detailing the potential destruction these \nweapons can cause should alert us to the dangers to airline safety, as \nwell as homeland security. That is why I cosponsored Senator \nFeinstein's Military Sniper Weapon Regulation Act, S. 429. This bill \nwould change the way .50 caliber guns are regulated by placing them \nunder the requirements of the National Firearms Act.

Mr. President, last night the University of \nMichigan Wolverines defeated the Rutgers University Scarlet Knights 62-\n55 in the final game of the 2004 Men's Basketball National Invitation \nTournament to complete a 23-11 season.\n  The win was even sweeter for the Wolverines as they defeated Rutgers \nbefore a crowd of 16,064, largely cheering for the Scarlet Knights, at \nMadison Square Garden in New York City. Throughout the season and \nparticularly during the NIT, a vocal home crowd at Crisler Arena \ncheered Michigan to victory. Cheering their team through the first \nthree games of the tournament, Michigan's fans were truly the team's \nsixth man.\n  For the season, Michigan won 16 of their 19 home games. Prior to the \nNIT, they had only won five of their 13 road games. Winning two games \nin Madison Square Garden proved the mettle of this young team that has \nrelied heavily upon its many sophomores and freshmen. I know I speak \nfor all of Michigan in extending my heartiest congratulations to \nUniversity of Michigan men's basketball team on their championship. \nThis was a hard fought victory and one that I'm sure Wolverines fans \nenjoyed immensely.\n  Twenty years ago, Bill Frieder coached a young Wolverines team that \nwon the NIT Championship. That team used their championship as a \nspringboard to greater success: in each of the next two years they won \nthe Big Ten Championship. I am sure that Michigan Coach Tommy Amaker \nand his players have similar hopes for a program that has not been to a \npostseason tournament since 2000. This banner will be raised in the \nrafters of Crisler Arena next to the 1989 NCAA championship and the \n1984 NIT championship banners.\n  For 68 years, the National Invitation Tournament has showcased some \nof the\n\n[[Page S3605]]\n\ngreatest talents in college basketball and this year was no exception. \nLast night, players from both teams displayed their excellent training \nand hard work. Michigan was led by tournament Most Valuable Player \nDaniel Horton, who led Michigan with 14 points and Dion Harris who had \n13 points.\n  Michigan opened a lead of 41-29, but a 15-2 Rutgers' run quickly \nnudged the Scarlet Knights in front, albeit briefly. The old adage \n``the best offense is a good defense'' came true as Michigan \nconstructed its win around a defensive strategy where defensive \nspecialist Bernard Robinson, a senior whose leadership helped guide \nthis young team, limited Rutgers' hot-shooting freshman to just two \npoints.\n  In his third year with the Wolverines, Coach Amaker not only \nassembled the winning game plan, but also brought together a team that \nwill consistently compete with any team in the nation. Last night's \nvictory is testament to a team that worked hard to salvage its season \nand reputation. While individual performances by Robinson, Daniel \nHorton and Dion Harris played a key role in this game, Michigan's \nchampionship was a team effort that has helped restore the pride in the \nMichigan basketball program. I congratulate Coach Amaker and his team \nfor their selfless efforts in putting University of Michigan basketball \nback on the national map.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating the University of \nMichigan men's basketball team on their victory, and I know we all look \nforward to next year when this team really comes of age.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the players and coaches names be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The list follows:\n\n       Players: Lester Abram; John Andrews; Amadou Ba; Ashtyn \n     Bell; Graham Brown; Colin Dill; Sherrod Harrell; Dion Harris; \n     Daniel Horton; Chris Hunter; J.C. Mathis; Brent Petway; \n     Bernard Robinson Jr.; Courtney Sims; Dani Wohl.\n       Coaches: Head Coach Tommy Amaker; Assistant Coach Charles \n     E. Ramsey; Assistant Coach Chuck Swenson; Assistant Coach \n     Andrew Moore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/02/senate-section/article/S3605-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SUBMISSION OF CONCURRENT AND SENATE RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following concurrent resolutions and Senate resolutions were \nread, and referred (or acted upon), as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n       S.

Res. 330\n\n       Whereas the United States currently imports the majority of \n     its crude oil;\n       Whereas ensuring access to and stable prices for imported \n     crude oil for the United States and major allies and trading \n     partners of the United States is a continuing critical \n     objective of United States foreign and economic policy for \n     the foreseeable future;\n       Whereas the 11 countries that make up the Organization of \n     Petroleum Exporting Countries (``OPEC'') produce 40 percent \n     of the world's crude oil and control three-quarters of proven \n     reserves, including much of the spare production capacity;\n       Whereas beginning in February 2004, OPEC instituted \n     production cuts, which reduced production by 2,000,000 \n     barrels per day and have resulted in dramatic increases in \n     crude oil prices;\n       Whereas in February 2004, crude oil prices were around $28 \n     per barrel and have steadily risen since then, exceeding $38 \n     per barrel in March 2004, the highest prices in 13 years;\n       Whereas the increase in crude oil prices has translated \n     into higher prices for gasoline and other refined petroleum \n     products; in the case of gasoline, the increases in crude oil \n     prices have resulted in a pass-through of cost increases at \n     the pump to an average national price of $1.75 per gallon;\n       Whereas increases in the price of crude oil result in \n     increases in prices paid by United States consumers for \n     refined petroleum\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\n     products, including home heating oil, gasoline, and diesel \n     fuel; and\n       Whereas increases in the costs of refined petroleum \n     products have a negative effect on many Americans, including \n     the elderly and individuals of low income (whose home heating \n     oil costs have doubled in the last year), families who must \n     pay higher prices at the gas station, farmers (already hurt \n     by low commodity prices, trying to factor increased costs \n     into their budgets in preparation for the growing season), \n     truckers (who face an almost 13-year high in diesel fuel \n     prices), and manufacturers and retailers (who must factor in \n     increased production and transportation costs into the final \n     price of their goods): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President and Congress should take both a short-\n     term and a long-term approach to reducing and stabilizing \n     crude oil prices as well as reducing dependence on foreign \n     sources of energy;\n       (2) to address the problem in the short-term, the President \n     should communicate to the members of the Organization of \n     Petroleum Exporting Countries ``OPEC'' cartel and non-OPEC \n     countries that participate in the cartel of crude oil \n     producing countries that--\n       (A) the United States seeks to maintain strong relations \n     with crude oil producers around the world while promoting \n     international efforts to remove barriers to energy trade and \n     investment and increased access for United States energy \n     firms around the world;\n       (B) the United States believes that restricting supply in a \n     market that is in demand of additional crude oil does serious \n     damage to the efforts that OPEC members have made to \n     demonstrate that they represent a reliable source of crude \n     oil supply;\n       (C) the United States believes that stable crude oil prices \n     and supplies are essential for strong economic growth \n     throughout the world; and\n       (D) the United States seeks an immediate increase in the \n     OPEC crude oil production quotas;\n       (3) the President should be commended for sending Secretary \n     of State Powell to personally communicate with leaders of \n     several members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \n     Countries on the need to increase the supply of crude oil;\n       (4) to ameliorate the long-term problem of the United \n     States dependence on foreign oil sources, the President \n     should--\n       (A) review all administrative policies, programs, and \n     regulations that put an undue burden on domestic energy \n     producers; and\n       (B) consider lifting unnecessary regulations that interfere \n     with the ability the United States' domestic oil, gas, coal, \n     hydro-electric, biomass, and other alternative energy \n     industries to supply a greater percentage of the energy needs \n     of the United States; and\n       (5) to ameliorate the long-term problem of United States \n     dependence on foreign oil sources, the Senate should \n     appropriate sufficient funds for the development of domestic \n     energy sources, including measures to increase the use of \n     biofuels and other renewable resources.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Reuters news service is reporting that \nSaudi Arabia, and their Foreign Minister specifically, have said in the \nlast day or so they have not been contacted by the Bush administration \nover OPEC's decision to cut oil production once again. As a result, \ntoday I am introducing a resolution urging the President communicate to \nOPEC that oil production be increased, and I intend next week to ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  I am very troubled by the comments of the Foreign Minister of Saudi \nArabia. In fact, what Reuters has reported is the Saudi Foreign \nMinister was asked whether the United States had expressed its \ndisappointment over OPEC's cut in production and the Saudi Foreign \nMinister said at the time:\n\n       I didn't hear from this Bush administration. I'm hearing it \n     from you that they are disappointed.\n\n  This is very troubling. Up and down the west coast of the United \nStates our constituents are getting mugged by high oil prices. We have \nto have an administration that is willing to put some heat on OPEC to \nstep up oil production at a critical time, particularly as we move in \nthis country to the high driving season. These high gasoline prices are \ndevastating to consumers. They are going to be very harmful to our \neconomy overall, particularly job production. It is consumer spending \nthat is driving the Oregon economy, and if we continue to see our \nconsumers shellacked with these high gasoline prices, it is going to be \nharder and harder for us to create family wage jobs and generate \nbusiness growth.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues will support this resolution I am \nintroducing today and which I am going to ask for immediate \nconsideration of next week. The reason I am hopeful for such bipartisan \nsupport is this resolution, in terms of its substance, is identical to \none introduced on February 28 of 2000, with our current Secretary of \nEnergy, our friend Spencer Abraham, as one of the principal sponsors. \nBack then it was clear our colleagues thought it was important, \nparticularly with influential Senators on the other side. Then the \nSenator from Michigan, Senator Abraham, also the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Grassley, Senator Santorum, and a number of \nour distinguished colleagues were cosponsors of that legislation. The \nfeeling was then it was important to put some heat on OPEC. It was \nimportant to make it clear it was the position of the Senate that OPEC \nboost production.\n  Of course, that is what then-candidate George W. Bush said, that it \nwas important to boost oil production. Yet with the comments of the \nSaudi Foreign Minister in the last day or so, I think it is very clear \nat best it is not a case of getting a full court press, in terms of \nthis administration, on Saudi Arabia and on OPEC.\n  I will tell you, if ever there was an administration that had some \nbargaining chips to play with Saudi Arabia in terms of boosting oil \nproduction, it is certainly this administration. If you look at what \nhappened after 9/11, in terms of people being helped out of the \ncountry, various issues with respect to declassifying Government \ndocuments, it is very clear Saudi Arabia has been treated pretty darned \nwell by this administration. If ever there was an administration that \nhad some bargaining chips to play in terms of trying to get OPEC to \nincrease oil production, it is certainly this administration. Yet the \nSaudi Foreign Minister has said, just in the last day, he wasn't even \ncontacted by the Bush administration with respect to oil production.\n\n  Let me also say there are some other troubling signs, and why I feel \nso strongly about the Senate next week passing the resolution I am \nintroducing. When Secretary Powell was in Saudi Arabia about 2 weeks \nago, he also had a chance to talk about the oil crunch and how it is so \nharmful to American consumers. The press release that came from the \nU.S. Information Agency--this is again another document coming from our \nGovernment--indicated the Secretary and the Crown Prince and Foreign \nMinister talked about a variety of subjects, terrorism and governmental \nreforms, but nothing was said about oil prices. What we have, and I \nhave said this before, is OPEC is going to stick up for OPEC. OPEC is \nnot going to stick up for the American consumer. If you think OPEC is \ngoing to stick up for the American consumer, then you think Colonel \nSanders is going to stick up for the chickens. It is not going to \nhappen. It is the job of our administration to stick up for the \nconsumer, and when the Saudi Foreign Minister says he hasn't even been \ncontacted, that he heard from reporters the administration was \ndisappointed, that is not good enough. It is not good enough for my \nconstituents where consistently we are paying some of the highest \nprices for gasoline in our country, where we faced anticompetitive \npractices like redlining and zone pricing for years. It is not good \nenough where you have a situation such as we have in Bakersfield, CA, \nwhere a very large refinery has been closed. They didn't even look for \na buyer. There is a lot of oil in the area.\n  The American people are entitled to some answers. They are certainly \nentitled to an administration that does what then-Governor George W. \nBush said was important, and that was to fight for the consumer, to \npush OPEC to increase production. Instead, what we learned from the \nSaudi Foreign Minister is the administration has essentially just sat \non its hands.\n  I was following the remarks of the Senator from Kentucky a bit ago. \nHe makes the point, and it is certainly one that makes sense to me, \nthat what is good for then-President Clinton should be good for \nPresident Bush. What I say to my friend is the same principle ought to \nbe applied when it comes to a Senate resolution on OPEC and high oil \nand gasoline prices.\n  I hope we will have a good debate in the Senate in the days ahead \nwith respect to our policy as it relates to OPEC and oil production. A \nnumber of\n\n[[Page S3607]]\n\nour distinguished colleagues were there when this resolution was \nconsidered earlier: Senator Grassley, Senator Santorum, our current \nSecretary of Energy, a good friend of mine, Senator Abraham. I also \nnote the distinguished Presiding Officer of the Senate, Senator Chafee, \nwas also a cosponsor of that resolution.\n  I am hopeful we will be able to do as the Senator from Kentucky said \nand that is apply the same principle to this administration as was \napplied to the Clinton administration. Every administration ought to be \npushing OPEC to increase oil production. We certainly ought to take \naction when the Saudi oil minister was saying he wasn't even contacted.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article \nfrom the Reuters news service. The title of this article is ``Saudi \nSays Not Heard From Bush Over OPEC Oil Cut.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From Reuters News Service, Apr. 1, 2004]\n\n            Saudi Says Not Heard From Bush Over OPEC Oil Cut\n\n       Vienna, April 1.--Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said on \n     Thursday he had not been contacted by the Bush administration \n     over OPEC's decision on Wednesday to cut crude output by one \n     million barrels per day.\n       U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham told a House of \n     Representatives committee on Thursday President George W. \n     Bush had spoken to most of the leaders of OPEC nations about \n     global crude oil supplies and rising prices.\n       But Abraham declined to respond to a lawmaker's question \n     about whether the president had specifically spoken to Saudi \n     Arabia, the cartel's largest member which led a push this \n     week to cut OPEC production by one million barrels per day in \n     April.\n       Asked if the United States had expressed its disappointment \n     to him over the cut, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-\n     Faisal told reporters:\n       ``I didn't hear this from the Bush administration. I'm \n     hearing it from you that they're disappointed.''\n       The Bush administration faces growing pressure from \n     Democrats to take action amid record-high U.S. retail \n     gasoline prices.\n       In the run-up to Wednesday's OPEC meeting, the \n     administration abandoned its so-called ``quiet diplomacy'' \n     and instead said publicly that it was pressuring OPEC to \n     delay a production cut.\n       Its request was supported by OPEC members Kuwait and the \n     United Arab Emirates, but opposed by Saudi Arabia, a longtime \n     U.S. ally.\n       Abraham said Bush administration officials may have spoken \n     to Saudi officials in recent weeks.\n       ``We are very disappointed with the decision (OPEC) made \n     yesterday and obviously are evaluating what we might'' do, \n     Abraham added.\n       U.S. crude fell 50 cents to $35.26 on Thursday after losing \n     1.4 percent on Wednesday on news of a huge build in U.S. \n     crude inventories and the Saudi foreign minister said earlier \n     the fall justified the cartel's decision.\n       ``As you have seen, since we reduced production in OPEC the \n     price went down. This reflects the veracity of the position \n     that Saudi Arabia has taken that there is an excess capacity \n     on the market rather than shortages,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be back on the floor in the days \nahead to talk about this critical question. It seems to me what is \ncoming in this country on this oil issue is a perfect storm. The \ncombination of the fact this administration is unwilling to push OPEC \nover its production cuts, the fact the Federal Trade Commission is \nunwilling to do anything about these anticompetitive practices or even \ninvestigate this refinery closure in Bakersfield, which has great \nimplications for the west coast, all of these factors are coming \ntogether to create what I believe is a perfect storm for the gasoline \nconsumer in this country. Given that consumer spending is what is \ndriving our economy right now, we cannot afford to have these high \ngasoline prices continue or, as I fear, escalate to $3 a gallon.\n  We will continue to focus on the question of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, swiping oil out of the private sector and squirreling it away \ninto the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a time when it already has a \nvery high level and national security questions are being addressed. \nBut that is not the focus of my comments today. The focus of my \ncomments today is every Member of the Congress ought to be very \ntroubled when the Saudi Foreign Minister says he wasn't contacted by \nthe administration over these production cuts.\n  We ought to do as was done in 2000 when the Senate, led by a number \nof our distinguished colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nmoved ahead on a resolution to boost oil production by OPEC. We ought \nto do the same now and stand up for the American consumer.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/02/senate-section/article/S3607-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3010.

Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Hatch (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nDeWine, and Mr. Kohl)) proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 1086, to \nencourage the development and promulgation of voluntary consensus \nstandards by providing relief under the antitrust laws to standards \ndevelopment organizations with respect to conduct engaged in for the \npurpose of developing voluntary consensus standards, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n  TITLE I--STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION ADVANCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n     SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Standards Development \n     Organization Advancement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1993, the Congress amended and renamed the National \n     Cooperative Research Act of 1984 (now known as the National \n     Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 (15 U.S.C. \n     4301 et seq.)) by enacting the National Cooperative \n     Production Amendments of 1993 (Public Law 103-42) to \n     encourage the use of collaborative, procompetitive activity \n     in the form of research and production joint ventures that \n     provide adequate disclosure to the antitrust enforcement \n     agencies about the nature and scope of the activity involved.\n       (2) Subsequently, in 1995, the Congress in enacting the \n     National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 \n     U.S.C. 272 note) recognized the importance of technical \n     standards developed by voluntary consensus standards bodies \n     to our national economy by requiring the use of such \n     standards to the extent practicable by Federal agencies and \n     by encouraging Federal agency representatives to participate \n     in ongoing standards development activities. The Office of \n     Management and Budget on February 18, 1998, revised Circular \n     A-119 to reflect these changes made in law.\n       (3) Following enactment of the National Technology Transfer \n     and Advancement Act of 1995, technical standards developed or \n     adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies have replaced \n     thousands of unique Government standards and specifications \n     allowing the national economy to operate in a more unified \n     fashion.\n       (4) Having the same technical standards used by Federal \n     agencies and by the private sector permits the Government to \n     avoid the cost of developing duplicative Government standards \n     and to more readily use products and components designed for \n     the commercial marketplace, thereby enhancing quality and \n     safety and reducing costs.\n       (5) Technical standards are written by hundreds of \n     nonprofit voluntary consensus standards bodies in a \n     nonexclusionary fashion, using thousands of volunteers from \n     the private and public sectors, and are developed under the \n     standards development principles set out in Circular Number \n     A-119, as revised February 18, 1998, of the Office of \n     Management and Budget, including principles that require \n     openness, balance, transparency, consensus, and due process. \n     Such principles provide for--\n       (A) notice to all parties known to be affected by the \n     particular standards development activity,\n       (B) the opportunity to participate in standards development \n     or modification,\n       (C) balancing interests so that standards development \n     activities are not dominated by any single group of \n     interested persons,\n       (D) readily available access to essential information \n     regarding proposed and final standards,\n       (E) the requirement that substantial agreement be reached \n     on all material points after the consideration of all views \n     and objections, and\n       (F) the right to express a position, to have it considered, \n     and to appeal an adverse decision.\n       (6) There are tens of thousands of voluntary consensus \n     standards available for government use. Most of these \n     standards are kept current through interim amendments and \n     interpretations, issuance of addenda, and\n\n[[Page S3608]]\n\n     periodic reaffirmation, revision, or reissuance every 3 to 5 \n     years.\n       (7) Standards developed by government entities generally \n     are not subject to challenge under the antitrust laws.\n       (8) Private developers of the technical standards that are \n     used as Government standards are often not similarly \n     protected, leaving such developers vulnerable to being named \n     as codefendants in lawsuits even though the likelihood of \n     their being held liable is remote in most cases, and they \n     generally have limited resources to defend themselves in such \n     lawsuits.\n       (9) Standards development organizations do not stand to \n     benefit from any antitrust violations that might occur in the \n     voluntary consensus standards development process.\n       (10) As was the case with respect to research and \n     production joint ventures before the passage of the National \n     Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993, if relief \n     from the threat of liability under the antitrust laws is not \n     granted to voluntary consensus standards bodies, both \n     regarding the development of new standards and efforts to \n     keep existing standards current, such bodies could be forced \n     to cut back on standards development activities at great \n     financial cost both to the Government and to the national \n     economy.\n\n     SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 2 of the National Cooperative Research and \n     Production Act of 1993 (15 U.S.C. 4301) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7) The term `standards development activity' means any \n     action taken by a standards development organization for the \n     purpose of developing, promulgating, revising, amending, \n     reissuing, interpreting, or otherwise maintaining a voluntary \n     consensus standard, or using such standard in conformity \n     assessment activities, including actions relating to the \n     intellectual property policies of the standards development \n     organization.\n       ``(8) The term `standards development organization' means a \n     domestic or international organization that plans, develops, \n     establishes, or coordinates voluntary consensus standards \n     using procedures that incorporate the attributes of openness, \n     balance of interests, due process, an appeals process, and \n     consensus in a manner consistent with the Office of \n     Management and Budget Circular Number A-119, as revised \n     February 10, 1998.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This Act may be cited as the ``Standards Development \n     Organization Advancement Act of 2003''.\n\n     [SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       [The Congress finds the following:\n       [(1) In 1993, the Congress amended and renamed the National \n     Cooperative Research Act of 1984 (now known as the National \n     Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 (15 U.S.C. \n     4301 et seq.)) by enacting the National Cooperative \n     Production Amendments of 1993 (Public Law 103-42) to \n     encourage the use of collaborative, procompetitive activity \n     in the form of research and production joint ventures that \n     provide adequate disclosure to the antitrust enforcement \n     agencies about the nature and scope of the activity involved.\n       [(2) Subsequently, in 1995, the Congress in enacting the \n     National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 \n     U.S.C. 272 note) recognized the importance of technical \n     standards developed by voluntary consensus standards bodies \n     to our national economy by requiring the use of such \n     standards to the extent practicable by Federal agencies and \n     by encouraging Federal agency representatives to participate \n     in ongoing standards development activities. The Office of \n     Management and Budget on February 18, 1998, revised Circular \n     A-119 to reflect these changes made in law.\n       [(3) Following enactment of the National Technology \n     Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995, technical standards \n     developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies \n     have replaced thousands of unique Government standards and \n     specifications allowing the national economy to operate in a \n     more unified fashion.\n       [(4) Having the same technical standards used by Federal \n     agencies and by the private sector permits the Government to \n     avoid the cost of developing duplicative Government standards \n     and to more readily use products and components designed for \n     the commercial marketplace, thereby enhancing quality and \n     safety and reducing costs.\n       [(5) Technical standards are written by hundreds of \n     nonprofit voluntary consensus standards bodies in a \n     nonexclusionary fashion, using thousands of volunteers from \n     the private and public sectors, and are developed under the \n     standards development principles set out in Circular Number \n     A-119, as revised February 18, 1998, of the Office of \n     Management and Budget, including principles that require \n     openness, balance, transparency, consensus, and due process. \n     Such principles provide for--\n       [(A) notice to all parties known to be affected by the \n     particular standards development activity,\n       [(B) the opportunity to participate in standards \n     development or modification,\n       [(C) balancing interests so that standards development \n     activities are not dominated by any single group of \n     interested persons,\n       [(D) readily available access to essential information \n     regarding proposed and final standards,\n       [(E) the requirement that substantial agreement be reached \n     on all material points after the consideration of all views \n     and objections, and\n       [(F) the right to express a position, to have it \n     considered, and to appeal an adverse decision.\n       [(6) There are tens of thousands of voluntary consensus \n     standards available for government use. Most of these \n     standards are kept current through interim amendments and \n     interpretations, issuance of addenda, and periodic \n     reaffirmation, revision, or reissuance every 3 to 5 years.\n       [(7) Standards developed by government entities generally \n     are not subject to challenge under the antitrust laws.\n       [(8) Private developers of the technical standards that are \n     used as Government standards are often not similarly \n     protected, leaving such developers vulnerable to being named \n     as codefendants in lawsuits even though the likelihood of \n     their being held liable is remote in most cases, and they \n     generally have limited resources to defend themselves in such \n     lawsuits.\n       [(9) Standards development organizations do not stand to \n     benefit from any antitrust violations that might occur in the \n     voluntary consensus standards development process.\n       [(10) As was the case with respect to research and \n     production joint ventures before the passage of the National \n     Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993, if relief \n     from the threat of liability under the antitrust laws is not \n     granted to voluntary consensus standards bodies, both \n     regarding the development of new standards and efforts to \n     keep existing standards current, such bodies could be forced \n     to cut back on standards development activities at great \n     financial cost both to the Government and to the national \n     economy.\n\n     [SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1993, the Congress amended and renamed the National \n     Cooperative Research Act of 1984 (now known as the National \n     Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 (15 U.S.C. \n     4301 et seq.)) by enacting the National Cooperative \n     Production Amendments of 1993 (Public Law 103-42) to \n     encourage the use of collaborative, procompetitive activity \n     in the form of research and production joint ventures that \n     provide adequate disclosure to the antitrust enforcement \n     agencies about the nature and scope of the activity involved.\n       (2) Subsequently, in 1995, the Congress in enacting the \n     National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 \n     U.S.C. 272 note) recognized the importance of technical \n     standards developed by voluntary consensus standards bodies \n     to our national economy by requiring the use of such \n     standards to the extent practicable by Federal agencies and \n     by encouraging Federal agency representatives to participate \n     in ongoing standards development activities. The Office of \n     Management and Budget on February 18, 1998, revised Circular \n     A-119 to reflect these changes made in law.\n       (3) Following enactment of the National Technology Transfer \n     and Advancement Act of 1995, technical standards developed or \n     adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies have replaced \n     thousands of unique Government standards and specifications \n     allowing the national economy to operate in a more unified \n     fashion.\n       (4) Having the same technical standards used by Federal \n     agencies and by the private sector permits the Government to \n     avoid the cost of developing duplicative Government standards \n     and to more readily use products and components designed for \n     the commercial marketplace, thereby enhancing quality and \n     safety and reducing costs.\n       (5) Technical standards are written by hundreds of \n     nonprofit voluntary consensus standards bodies in a \n     nonexclusionary fashion, using thousands of volunteers from \n     the private and public sectors, and are developed under the \n     standards development principles set out in Circular Number \n     A-119, as revised February 18, 1998, of the Office of \n     Management and Budget, including principles that require \n     openness, balance, transparency, consensus, and due process. \n     Such principles provide for--\n       (A) notice to all parties known to be affected by the \n     particular standards development activity,\n       (B) the opportunity to participate in standards development \n     or modification,\n       (C) balancing interests so that standards development \n     activities are not dominated by any single group of \n     interested persons,\n       (D) readily available access to essential information \n     regarding proposed and final standards,\n       (E) the requirement that substantial agreement be reached \n     on all material points after the consideration of all views \n     and objections, and\n       (F) the right to express a position, to have it considered, \n     and to appeal an adverse decision.\n       (6) There are tens of thousands of voluntary consensus \n     standards available for government use. Most of these \n     standards are kept current through interim amendments and \n     interpretations, issuance of addenda, and periodic \n     reaffirmation, revision, or reissuance every 3 to 5 years.\n       (7) Standards developed by government entities generally \n     are not subject to challenge under the antitrust laws.\n       (8) Private developers of the technical standards that are \n     used as Government standards are often not similarly \n     protected, leaving such developers vulnerable to being named \n     as codefendants in lawsuits even though the likelihood of \n     their being held liable is remote in most cases, and they \n     generally have limited resources to defend themselves in such \n     lawsuits.\n       (9) Standards development organizations do not stand to \n     benefit from any antitrust violations that might occur in the \n     voluntary consensus standards development process.\n\n[[Page S3612]]\n\n       (10) As was the case with respect to research and \n     production joint ventures before the passage of the National \n     Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993, if relief \n     from the threat of liability under the antitrust laws is not \n     granted to voluntary consensus standards bodies, both \n     regarding the development of new standards and efforts to \n     keep existing standards current, such bodies could be forced \n     to cut back on standards development activities at great \n     financial cost both to the Government and to the national \n     economy.\n\n     SEC. 103.

Mr. President, I rise today to support passage of H.R. \n1086, the Standards Development Organization Advancement Act of 2003. \nThis legislation, along with provisions added to it during the \nJudiciary Committee markup and by the substitute amendment that I have \noffered along with Senators Leahy, DeWine, and Kohl, provides several \nimportant and significant improvements to our antitrust laws.\n  This legislation incorporates the limited antitrust protection for \nStandards Development Organizations that Senator Leahy and I introduced \nas S. 1799, and that Chairman Sensenbrenner introduced in the House as \nH.R. 1086. Under this provision, the civil liability for Standards \nDevelopment Organizations or ``SDOs'' will be limited to single, rather \nthan treble, damages for standards-setting activities about which they \nhave informed the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission \nusing a newly-created notification procedure.\n  The bill also increases the maximum criminal penalties for antitrust \nviolations so that they are more in line with other comparable white \ncollar crimes. I will note that this provision of the legislation is \nsubstantially the same as the one included in S. 1080, a Leahy-Hatch \nbill.\n  This legislation also provides increased incentives for participants \nin illegal cartels to blow the whistle on their co-conspirators and \ncooperate with the Justice Department's Antitrust Division in \nprosecuting the other members of these criminal antitrust conspiracies. \nThis is accomplished by allowing the Justice Department, in appropriate \ncircumstances, to limit a cooperating company's civil liability to \nactual, rather than treble, damages in return for the company's \ncooperation in both the resulting criminal case as well as any \nsubsequent civil suit based on the same conduct.\n  Finally, this substitute would amend the Tunney Act to end the \nproblem of courts simply ``rubber-stamping'' antitrust settlements \nreached with the Justice Department. In my view, this amendment \nessentially codifies existing case law, while reemphasizing the \noriginal congressional intent that lead to passage of the Tunney Act. \nWhen this provision was added to H.R. 1086 in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, I noted that, although I supported it in principal, I \nthought that continued modifications of the actual language might be \nnecessary to respond to concerns that had been raised. I am pleased to \nbe able to state that, largely through the efforts of Senator Kohl and \nhis staff, a compromise on this language was reached that is \nsupported--or at least not strongly objected to--by the parties \ninvolved.\n  With that introduction, I will briefly discuss the four principal \nsections of the legislation.\n  The section Protection of Standards Development Organizations, which \ncomes from S. 1799, a bill that Senator Leahy and I introduced as a \nSenate companion to H.R. 1086, is designed to extend limited antitrust \nprotection to Standards Development Organizations, or ``SDOs''.\n  In the United States, most technical standards are developed and \npromulgated by private, not-for-profit organizations called SDOs. \nNumerous concerns have been raised that the threat of treble damages \ndeters SDOs from their pro-competitive standard-setting activities. \nThis legislation addresses those concerns by providing a notification \nprocess whereby SDOs may inform DOJ and the FTC regarding their \nintended standards-development activities. If the authorities do not \nobject to the proposed activities but the SDO is subsequently sued by a \nprivate plaintiff, the SDO's civil liability is limited\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\nto single rather than treble damages. Importantly, this legislation \ndoes not in any way immunize industry participants who cooperate in the \ndevelopment of standards from antitrust liability for using the \nstandards-setting process for anti-competitive purposes.\n  I thank Senator Leahy and Chairman Sensenbrenner and their staffs for \ntheir vigilant efforts toward passage of the Standards Development \nOrganization Advancement Act of 2003.\n  The legislation also amends the antitrust laws to provide \ncorporations and their executives with increased incentives to come \nforward and cooperate with the Department of Justice in prosecuting \ncriminal antitrust cartels. It does so by enhancing the effectiveness \nof the already-successful Corporate Leniency Policy issued by the \nJustice Department's Antitrust Division.\n  In general, the leniency policy provides that a corporation and its \nexecutives will not be criminally charged if the company is not the \nringleader of the conspiracy and it is the first of the conspirators to \napproach the division and fully cooperate with the division's criminal \ninvestigation. The program serves to destabilize cartels, and it causes \nthe members of the cartel to turn against one another in a race to the \nGovernment. Cooperation obtained through the leniency program has led \nto the detection and prosecution of massive international cartels that \ncost businesses and consumers billions of dollars and has led to the \nlargest fines in the Antitrust Division's history.\n  Though this important program has been successful, a major \ndisincentive to self reporting still exists, the threat of exposure to \na possible treble damage lawsuit by the victims of the conspiracy. \nUnder current law, the successful leniency applicant is not criminally \ncharged, but it still faces treble damage actions with joint and \nseveral liability. In other words, before voluntarily disclosing its \ncriminal conduct, a potential amnesty applicant must weigh the \npotential ruinous consequences of subjecting itself to liability for \nthree times the damages that the entire conspiracy caused.\n  This provision addresses this disincentive to self-reporting. \nSpecifically, it amends the antitrust laws to modify the damage \nrecovery from a corporation and its executives to actual damages. In \nother words, the total liability of a successful leniency applicant \nwould be limited to single damages without joint and several liability. \nThus, the applicant would only be liable for the actual damages \nattributable to its own conduct, rather than being liable for three \ntimes the damages caused by the entire unlawful conspiracy.\n  Importantly, this limitation on damages is only available to \ncorporations and their executives if they provide adequate and timely \ncooperation to both the Government investigators as well as any \nsubsequent private plaintiffs bringing a civil suit based on the \ncovered criminal conduct. I should also note that, because all other \nconspirator firms would remain jointly and severably liable for three \ntimes the total damages caused by the conspiracy, the victims' \npotential total recovery would not be reduced by the amendments \nCongress is considering. And again, the legislation requires the \namnesty applicant to provide full cooperation to the victims as they \nprepare and pursue their civil lawsuit.\n  With this change, more companies will disclose antitrust crimes, \nwhich will have several benefits. First, I expect that the total \ncompensation to victims of antitrust conspiracies will be increased \nbecause of the requirement that amnesty applicants cooperate. Second, \nthe increased self-reporting incentive will serve to further de-\nstabilize and deter the formation of criminal antitrust conspiracies. \nIn turn, these changes will lead to more open and competitive markets.\n  The enhanced criminal penalties provision, which was originally part \nof S. 1080, which I introduced with Senator Leahy, improves current law \nby increasing the maximum prison sentences and fines for criminal \nviolations of antitrust law. This change puts the maximum prison \nsentences for antitrust violations more in line with other white collar \ncrimes. By increasing these criminal penalties, we are recognizing the \nprofoundly harmful impact that antitrust violations have on consumers \nand the economy.\n  This legislation also amends the Tunney Act to end what some have \nseen as courts simply ``rubber-stamping'' antitrust settlements reached \nwith the Justice Department without providing meaningful review. As I \nhave stated, while I agree with the principle behind this proposal, I \nhad significant concerns with the specific language that was reported \nout of the Judiciary Committee. After several months of discussions, I \nam happy to say that the current language appears to have answered \nmost, if not all, of the principal concerns that were raised regarding \nthe amendments to the Tunney Act.\n  In conclusion, I would like to thank Senators Leahy, Kohl, and DeWine \nand their staffs for their efforts on this bill. In particular, I would \nlike to thank Susan Davies of Senator Leahy's staff, Jeff Miller and \nSeth Bloom of Senator Kohl's staff, and Pete Levitas and Bill Jones of \nSenator DeWine's staff. I also appreciate the expert and energetic \nefforts of my own antitrust counsel, Dave Jones. And finally, I thank \nMakan Delrahim, my former chief counsel, for all of his ``technical \nassistance.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that Senator Hatch, Senator \nKohl, Senator DeWine, and I have been able to work together to develop \na version of this bill that can pass today as the Standards Development \nOrganization Advancement Act. Technical standards help to promote \nsafety, increase efficiency, and allow for interoperability in a \nvariety of products Americans use every day. Despite the fact that they \ngo largely unnoticed, we would be markedly less safe without airbags \nthat deploy properly in serious automobile collisions, more vulnerable \nwere there not technical standards for fire retardant materials in \nhomes. And consumers would be less likely to make the purchases that \ndrive our economy without the technical standards that ensure a light \nbulb will fit in its socket or allow DVDs to function properly \nregardless of the manufacturer.\n  In the United States, most technical standards are developed by \nprivate, not-for-profit Standards Development Organizations, which \noften possess superior knowledge and adaptability in highly technical \nmatters. Rather than Government overregulation of technical standards, \nSDOs promulgate guidelines that frequently are then adopted by State \nand Federal governments. Like many conveniences we take for granted, \ntechnical standards are so deeply infused in our lives that they may \nattract little or no individual attention.\n  While standards serve this vital societal role, there exists a \nnatural tension between the antitrust laws that prohibit businesses \nfrom colluding and the development of technical standards, which \nrequire competitors to reach agreement on basic design elements. The \nStandards Development Organization Advancement Act reduces this \ntension, providing relief for SDOs under current law while preserving \nthe trademark features of antitrust enforcement that benefit consumers.\n  Without creating an antitrust exemption, the Standards Development \nOrganization Act allows SDOs to seek review of their standards by the \nDepartment of Justice or Federal Trade Commission prior to \nimplementation. If these agencies do not object to the standard during \nthis ``screening'' phase, but the organization is later sued by a \nprivate plaintiff, the SDO would be limited to single damages, rather \nthan the treble damages levied under existing law.\n  Additionally, this bill amends the National Cooperative Research and \nProduction Act of 1993, by directing courts to apply a ``rule of \nreason'' standard to SDOs and the guidelines they produce. Under \nexisting law, standards may be deemed anticompetitive by a court even \nif they have the effect of better serving consumers. Courts should be \nable to balance the competing interests of safety and efficiency \nagainst any anticompetitive effect, making certain that the law is \ndoing everything possible to meet the needs of the one constituent we \nall share--the American consumer. The Standards Development \nOrganization Advancement Act gives our courts the authority to do so.\n  We may fail to notice the technical standards that provide \ndependability,\n\n[[Page S3615]]\n\nsecurity, and convenience in our lives, but they serve an increasingly \nvital role in a country driven by technological change but devoted to \nsafety and reliability.\n  Title II of the Standards Development Organization Advancement Act \nalso addresses several areas of our antitrust laws that merit updating, \nas our experience with the actual practice in the world has shown. \nFirst, the act strives to eliminate the disparity between the treatment \nof criminal white collar offenses and antitrust criminal violations. \nWithout this legislation, offenders who violated the criminal \nprovisions of the antitrust laws would face much less significant \npenalties than would their wire fraud or mail fraud counterparts. The \nact increases the maximum penalty for a criminal antitrust violation \nfrom 3 years to 10 years and raises the maximum fines to corporations \nfrom $10 million to $100 million per violation. Senator Hatch and I had \nintroduced this provision in S. 1080, the Antitrust Improvements Act of \n2003, and I am pleased that this useful update to the penalties for \ncriminal violations of the antitrust laws can be made as part of this \nbill.\n  Title II will also update the Justice Department's amnesty program in \nthe criminal antitrust context. We have worked with the antitrust \ndivision of the Department of Justice and our States' attorneys general \nto give prosecutors the maximum leverage against participants in \ncriminal antitrust activity. The Department has long had an ``amnesty'' \nor ``leniency'' policy that is generally available to the first \nconspirator involved in a criminal cartel that offers to cooperate with \nthe authorities. But under the current policy, the Department may only \nagree to not bring criminal charges against a corporation, and its \nofficers and directors, in exchange for cooperation in providing \nevidence and testimony against other members in the cartel. Under this \nbill, to qualify for amnesty, a party must provide substantial \ncooperation not only in any criminal case brought against the other \ncartel members, but also in any civil case brought by private parties \nthat is based on the same unlawful conduct.\n  This bill would then give our prosecutors the authority to \neffectively limit a cooperating party's potential civil liability as \nwell, and to limit that liability to single damages in any subsequent \ncivil lawsuit brought by a private plaintiff. And while a party that \nreceives leniency would only be liable for the portion of the damages \nactually caused by its own actions, the rest of its non-cooperating co-\nconspirators would remain jointly and severally liable for the entire \namount of damages, which would then be trebled, to ensure that no \ninjured party will fail to enjoy financial redress.\n  Finally, the Standards Development Organization Advancement Act makes \nsome useful adjustments to the Tunney Act. That law provides that \nconsent decrees in civil antitrust cases brought by the United States \nmust be reviewed and approved by the District Court in which the case \nwas brought. Under the Tunney Act, before entering a consent decree, \nthe court must determine that ``the entry of such judgment is in the \npublic interest.'' In making this determination, the court may, but is \nnot required to, consider a variety of enumerated factors. As currently \ndrafted, the court has discretion in making this public interest \ndetermination, and some have expressed concerns that this lack of \nguidance results in courts that are overly deferential to prosecutors' \njudgments. Thus, this bill intends to explicitly restate the original \nand intended role of District courts in this process by mandating that \nthe court make an independent judgment based on a series of enumerated \nfactors. In addition, the legislation makes clear that this amendment \nto the Tunney Act will not change the law regarding whether a court may \nbe required, in a particular instance, to permit intervention or to \nhold a hearing in a Tunney Act proceeding.\n  A final and important technical change would allow a judge to order \npublication of the comments received in a Tunney Act proceeding by \nelectronic or other means. Currently, the Tunney Act requires the \nAntitrust Division to publish in the Federal Register the public \ncomments received on its proposed consent judgments, along with the \nDivision's response to those comments. This can be very expensive--it \ncost almost $3 million in the Microsoft case--with little benefit, \nbecause those materials are, if anything, more accessible on the Web \nthan in a library. Of course, interested people who lack Internet \naccess will need to go to a library, but they would have had to do that \nfor a paper copy as well.\n  This is an important bill that makes necessary, well-conceived, and \nbipartisan reforms.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nAntitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act of 2003. It \npassed the Judiciary Committee unanimously in November 2003. Today, \nalong with Senators Hatch, Leahy, and DeWine, we offer a substitute \namendment to H.R. 1086. This legislation will enhance and improve the \nenforcement of our nation's antitrust laws in several important \nrespects.\n  In light of the importance of this legislation to the administration \nof our antitrust laws, as well as the infrequency with which we amend \nmajor provisions of the antitrust laws, it is essential to describe in \ndetail the reasons we our advancing this bill. Our proposal will \naccomplish four important goals. First, our legislation will restore \nthe ability of Federal courts to review the Justice Department's civil \nantitrust settlements to be sure that these settlements are good for \ncompetition and consumers. We will amend the Tunney Act, the law passed \nin 1974 in response to concerns that some of these settlements were \nmotivated by inappropriate political pressure and failed to restore \ncompetition or protect consumers. Congress concluded then, and it is \nstill true now, that judicial review will ensure that cases are settled \nin the public interest. Unfortunately, in recent years, many courts \nseem to have ignored this statute and do little more than ``rubber \nstamp'' antitrust settlements. This practice is contrary to the intent \nof the Tunney Act and effectively strips the courts of the ability to \nengage in meaningful review of antitrust settlements. Our bill will \noverturn this precedent and make clear that the courts have the \nauthority to do this vital job.\n  Second, our legislation enhances criminal penalties for those who \nviolate our antitrust laws. It will increase the maximum corporate \npenalty from $10 million to $100 million; it will increase the maximum \nindividual fine from $350,000 to $1 million; and it will increase the \nmaximum jail term for individuals who are convicted of criminal \nantitrust violations from 3 to 10 years. These changes will send the \nproper message that criminal antitrust violations, crimes such as price \nfixing and bid rigging, committed by business executives in a boardroom \nare serious offenses that steal from American consumers just as surely \nas does a street criminal with a gun.\n  Our legislation will give the Justice Department significant new \ntools under its antitrust leniency program. The leniency program helps \nthe Government break up criminal cartels by encouraging wrongdoers to \ncooperate with the authorities. Our bill will give the Justice \nDepartment the ability to offer those applying for leniency the \nadditional reward of only facing actual damages in antitrust civil \nsuits, rather than treble damage liability. This will result in more \nantitrust wrongdoers coming forward to reveal antitrust conspiracies, \nand thus the detection and ending of more illegal cartels.\n  Finally, our bill incorporates a provision in the original House \npassed version of H.R. 1086. This provision limits the liability that \nstandards setting organizations face under the antitrust laws to single \ndamages in most circumstances. It will protect these important \norganizations from the threat of liability. However, it will not in any \nway limit the damages available to any company that is a member of such \nan organization for antitrust violations, nor limit damages should a \nstandard setting organization engage in conduct that is a per se \nviolation of antitrust law.\n  It is important to explain clearly and specifically why it is \nnecessary to amend the Tunney Act and what we intend to accomplish with \nthese changes. In recent years, courts have been reluctant to give \nmeaningful review to antitrust consent decrees, and have been only \nwilling to take action with respect to most egregious decrees that\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\nmake a ``mockery'' of the judicial function. Our bill will effectuate \nthe legislative intent of the Tunney Act and restore the ability of \ncourts to give real scrutiny to antitrust consent decree.\n  The Tunney Act was enacted in 1974 and provides that consent decrees \nin civil antitrust cases brought by the United States must be reviewed \nand approved by the district court in which the case was brought to \ndetermine if they are in the public interest. However, the text of the \nstatute contains no standards governing how a court is to conduct this \nreview. While the legislative history of the law is clear that it was \nmeant to prevent ``judicial rubber stamping'' of consent decrees, the \nleading precedent of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals currently \ninterprets the law in a manner which makes meaningful review of these \nconsent decrees virtually impossible. Leading cases stand for the \nproposition that only consent decrees that ``make a mockery of the \njudicial function'' can be rejected by the district court. The changes \nin the Tunney Act incorporated in this legislation, as well as the \nstatement of Congressional findings, will make clear that such an \ninterpretation misconstrues the legislative intent of the statute.\n  The amendments to the Tunney Act found in our bill will restore the \noriginal intent of the Tunney Act, and make clear that courts should \ncarefully review antitrust consent decrees to ensure that they are in \nthe public interest. It will accomplish this by, No. 1, a clear \nstatement of congressional findings and purposes expressly overruling \nthe improper judicial standard of recent D.C. Circuit decisions; No. 2, \nby requiring, rather than permitting, judicial review of a list of \nenumerated factors to determine whether a consent decree is in the \npublic interest; and No. 3, by enhancing the list of factors which the \ncourt now must review.\n  The Tunney Act was enacted in 1974 to end the practice of courts \n``rubber stamping'' antitrust consent decrees, and to remove political \ninfluence from the Justice Department's decision as to whether to \nsettle antitrust cases. There were several prominent decisions in the \npreceding years in which antitrust settlements by the Justice \nDepartment came under strong criticism as inadequate or motivated by \nillegitimate purposes, and which were not scrutinized by the courts. \nOne of the leading early cases applying the Tunney Act noted that\n\n     the legislators found that consent decrees often failed to \n     provide appropriate relief, either because of miscalculations \n     by the Justice Department [citation omitted] or because of \n     the ``great influence and economic power'' wielded by \n     antitrust violators [citing S. Rep. No. 93-298, 93d Cong., \n     1st Sess. 5 (1973)]. The [legislative] history, indeed, \n     contains references to a number of antitrust settlements \n     deemed ``blatantly inequitable and improper'' on these bases \n     [citing 119 Cong. Rec. 24598 (1973) (Remarks of Sen. \n     Tunney)].\n\nU.S. v. American Telephone and Telegraph, 552 F.Supp. 131, 148 (D.D.C. \n1982), aff'd sub nom., Maryland v. U.S., 460 U.S. 1001 (1983).\n  While there were several notable cases which gave rise to the concern \nthat the government was settling for inadequate remedies for antitrust \nviolations, see U.S. v. AT, 552 F.Supp. at 148 n. 72; 119 Cong. Rec. \n24598, Remarks of Sen. Tunney, the most prominent case was the \nGovernment's settlement in 1971 of an antitrust suit brought against \nITT. Critics alleged that the Nixon administration had been influenced \nby campaign contributions to the Nixon reelection effort in 1972. The \nreasons for the settlement were not publicly disclosed, and the \nsettlement was strongly criticized by consumer advocates. The \nsettlement's critics attempted to have the settlement overturned by the \ndistrict court, but the court rejected these efforts. ``[T]here was no \nmeaningful judicial scrutiny of the terms of the consent decree and no \nconsideration of whether it was in the public interest.'' Anderson, \nsupra, 65 Antitrust Law Journal at 8.\n  The legislative history of the original Tunney Act is clear that the \npurpose of the statute was to give courts the opportunity to engage in \nmeaningful scrutiny of antitrust settlements, so as to deter and \nprevent settlements motivated either by corruption, undue corporate \ninfluence, or which were plainly inadequate. In introducing the bill, \nSenator Tunney highlighted his concern that antitrust settlements could \nresult from the economic power of the companies under scrutiny. He \nnoted that ``[i]ncreasing concentration of economic power, such as \noccurred in the flood of conglomerate mergers, carries with it a very \ntangible threat of concentration of political power. Put simply, the \nbigger the company, the greater the leverage it has in Washington.'' \n119 Cong. Rec. 3451, Feb. 6, 1973.\n\n  Senator Tunney also pointed with concern at the lack of scrutiny the \ncourts were applying to antitrust settlements. He argued that ``too \noften in the past district courts have viewed their rules [sic] as \nsimply ministerial in nature--leaving to the Justice Department the \nrole of determining the adequacy of the judgment from the public's \nview.'' Id. at 3542. Thus, his legislation was intended to \nsubstantially expand the role of the court in considering an antitrust \nconsent decree. Senator Tunney described the criteria in the bill under \nwhich the courts to review the settlements, and stated that\n\n       The thrust of those criteria is to demand that the court \n     consider both the narrow and the broad impacts of the decree. \n     Thus, in addition to weighing the merits of the decree from \n     the viewpoint of the relief obtained thereby and its \n     adequacy, the court is directed to give consideration to the \n     relative merits of other alternatives and specifically to the \n     effect of the entry of the decree upon private parties \n     aggrieved by the alleged violations and upon the enforcement \n     of antitrust laws generally.\n\n  In a later floor debate on the legislation, Senator Tunney cited the \ntestimony of Judge J. Skelley Wright of the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe D.C. Circuit, who had testified at an earlier hearing of the Senate \nAntitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee expressing concern as to whether \nantitrust settlements ``might shortchange the public interest.'' 119 \nCong. Rec. 24597, July 18, 1973. Commenting on this testimony, Senator \nTunney stated that ``I think Judge Wright gets to the heart of the \nproblem--it is the excessive secrecy with which many consent decrees \nhave been fashioned, and the almost mechanistic manner in which some \ncourts have been, in effect, willing to rubber stamp consent \njudgments.'' Id. at 24598 (emphasis added). The bill passed the Senate \nthat day on a 92 to 8 vote.\n  The later House debate in which the bill was passed echoed Senator \nTunney's concern. Congressman Seiberling of Ohio commented that, in \nconsidering antitrust consent decrees, ``too often the courts have, in \nfact, simply rubber-stamped such agreements, and the public or \ncompetitors that might be affected have had an effective way to get \ntheir views before the court . . .'' 120 Cong. Rec. 36341, Nov. 19, \n1974. Similar sentiments were expressed by Congressman McClory, id., \nCongressman Jordan, id. at 36343, and Congressman Heinz, id. at 36341. \nCongressman Holtzman of New York commented that these procedures would \n``insure that our antitrust laws are not for sale.'' Id. at 36342.\n  The House and Senate Committee Reports on the legislation also echo \nthe floor debate. The Report of the House Judiciary Committee states \nthat\n\n     [o]ne of the abuses sought to be remedied by the bill has \n     been called ``judicial rubber stamping'' by district courts \n     of proposals submitted by the Justice Department. The bill \n     resolves this area of dispute by requiring district court \n     judges to determine that each proposed consent judgment is in \n     the public interest.\n\nHouse Rep. No. 93-1463, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess. (1974), reprinted in 1974 \nU.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 6535, 6538.\n  In one of the first cases to construe the statute, the Government's \ncase to break up the AT phone monopoly, Judge Greene of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia reviewed, and then \nsummarized, the legislative history of the Tunney Act. He concluded \nthat:\n\n       To remedy these problems [that led to the passage of the \n     Tunney Act], Congress imposed two major changes in the \n     consent decree process. First, it reduced secrecy by ordering \n     disclosure by the Justice Department of the rationale and the \n     terms of proposed consent decrees and by mandating an \n     opportunity for public comment. Second, it sought to \n     eliminate ```judicial rubber stamping' of proposals submitted \n     to the courts by the Department,'' by requiring an explicit \n     judicial determination in every case that the proposed decree \n     was in the public interest. It is clear that Congress wanted \n     the courts to act as an independent check upon the terms of \n     decrees negotiated by the Department of Justice. . . .\n\nU.S. v. AT, 552 F. Supp. at 148-149 (emphasis added) (citations \nomitted).\n  This conclusion is supported by a recent law journal article co-\nauthored by\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\nJohn J. Flynn, who was special counsel to the Senate Antitrust \nSubcommittee during the period when the Tunney Act was drafted and \nadopted. Professor Flynn writes that, in enacting the Tunney Act, \nCongress rejected the ``notion that courts must give deference to the \nDOJ when determining if a consent decree is in the public interest. \nInstead, Congress wanted the courts to make an independent, objective, \nand active determination without deference to the DOJ.'' Flynn and \nBush, The Misuse and Abuse of the Tunney Act: The Adverse Consequences \nof the ``Microsoft Fallacies'', 34 Loyola U. Chicago L. J. 749, 758 \n(2003).\n  The early case law that followed the adoption of the Tunney Act in \n1974 imposed fairly stringent requirements on courts reviewing \nantitrust settlements reached by the Justice Department.\n  The leading early case is the district court's review of the \nGovernment's proposed settlement with AT in the massive antitrust \ncase that broke up the telephone monopoly, U.S. v. AT, supra (D.D.C. \n1983). Judge Greene of the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia rejected an argument for a highly deferential review of the \nproposed consent decree. The court stated that\n\n       uIt does not follow . . . that courts must unquestionably \n     accept a proffered decree as long as it somehow, and however \n     inadequately, deals with the antitrust and other public \n     policy problems implicated in the lawsuit. To do so would be \n     to revert to the ``rubber stamp'' role which was at the crux \n     of the congressional concerns when the Tunney Act became law.\n\nU.S. v. AT, 552 F. Supp. at 151.\n  Instead the standard the court applied to determine if the public \ninterest was served by the consent decree was rather exacting. The \ncourt stated it would only enter the proposed consent decree ``if the \ndecree meets the requirements for an antitrust remedy that is, if it \neffectively opens the relevant markets to competition and prevents the \nrecurrence of anticompetitive activity, all without imposing undue and \nunnecessary burdens upon other aspects of the public interest.'' Id. at \n153.\n  The more recent precedent under the Tunney Act have sharply retreated \nfrom Judge Green's opinion in AT to a much more deferential standard \nof review. It is this misinterpretation of the Tunney Act that our bill \ncorrects. In describing the recent Tunney Act precedent, one \ncommentator has called it a ``retreat toward rubber stamping.'' \nAnderson, supra, 65 Antitrust Law Journal at 19. We agree. It is this \noverly deferential standard review which makes reform of the Tunney Act \nnecessary so that the legislative intent can be effectuated and courts \ncan provide an independent safeguard to prevent against improper or \ninadequate settlements. The changes we make to the Tunney Act today \naddress these problems and correct the mistaken precedents.\n  The precedent continues to recognize that the Tunney Act is intended \n``to prevent ``judicial rubber stamping' of the Justice Department's \nproposed consent decree,'' and for the court to `` `make an independent \ndetermination as to whether or not entry of a proposed consent decree \n[was] in the public interest.' '' U.S. v. Microsoft, 56 F.3d 1448, 1458 \n(D.C. Cir. 1995), quoting S. Rep. No. 298 at 5. Further, in reviewing \nthe proposed consent decree, the court should inquire into ``the \npurpose, meaning, and efficacy of the decree.'' Microsoft, 56 F.3d at \n1463.\n  However, these same decisions improperly and strictly circumscribe \nthe role of the trial court and give it little leeway to fail to \napprove an antitrust consent decree. The D.C. Circuit has stated that:\n\n       [T]he district judge is not obligated to accept [an \n     antitrust consent decree] that, on its face and even after \n     government explanation, appears to make a mockery of judicial \n     power. Short of that eventuality, the Tunney Act cannot be \n     interpreted as an authorization for a district judge to \n     assume the role of Attorney General.\n\nId., 56 F.3d at 1462 (emphasis added). In other words, under this \nprecedent, unless the proposed decree would ``make a mockery of \njudicial power,'' the consent decree must be entered by the Court. In \nanother portion of this opinion, in language much cited by lower \ncourts, the D.C. Circuit held that the court should not insist that the \nconsent decree is the one that will ``best serve society,'' but only \nconfirm that the resulting settlement is ``within the reaches of the \npublic interest.'' Id. at 1460, citations omitted; emphasis in \noriginal.\n  In a subsequent decision, the D.C. Circuit summarized a district \ncourt's review under the Tunney Act, as follows:\n\n       The district court must examine the decree in light of the \n     violations charged in the complaint and should withhold \n     approval only if any of the terms appear ambiguous, if the \n     enforcement mechanism is inadequate, if third parties will be \n     positively injured, or if the decree otherwise makes ``a \n     mockery of judicial power.''\n\nMassachusetts School of Law v. U.S., 118 F.3d 776, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1997) \n(emphasis added) (quoting Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1462). This is plainly \nquite a limited standard of review, which contains no admonition to \nreview the likely effects of the consent decree on competition, and \nmakes it very unlikely that a court would fail to enter almost any \nconsent decree.\n  In the opinion of a leading academic commentator on the Tunney Act,\n\n     the court of appeals in Microsoft made a potentially serious \n     mistake by formulating a rule that, so long as procedural \n     niceties are followed, all antitrust consent decrees must be \n     approved unless they are a ``mockery.'' Once the real threat \n     of meaningful scrutiny is eliminated, the benefits of \n     deterrence and mediation would be destroyed and the Tunney \n     Act would be nullified.\n\nAnderson, supra, 65 Antitrust Law Journal at 38. Professor Flynn, who \nwas involved in drafting the Tunney Act, agrees with this criticism of \nthe D.C. Circuit's approach. Professor Flynn states that ``from the \nlanguage of the Tunney Act and its legislative history, this is \nprecisely the sort of deferential standard the drafters of the Tunney \nAct did not want. . . . [T]he D.C. Circuit chose to ignore the \nlegislative intent and cast judicial review of consent decrees back to \nthe days when rubber-stamping was prevalent.'' Flynn and Bush, supra, \n34 Loyola U. Chi. L. J. at 780-781.\n  As originally written, the Tunney Act serves two goals deterrence and \nmediation. The prospect of judicial scrutiny deters the Justice \nDepartment from heeding political pressure to enter into a \n``sweetheart'' settlement. And real Tunney Act review also provides an \nopportunity for a judge to act as a mediator, obtaining modifications \nto deficient settlements. As Professor Anderson points out, ``[i]f the \ngovernment and antitrust defendants come to perceive that meaningful \n[judicial] scrutiny is not a real threat, the door will be wide open \nfor attempts to swing sweetheart deals and for the public to lose \nconfidence in antitrust enforcement by the government.'' 65 Antitrust \nLaw Journal at 38.\n  In sum, as the Tunney Act is currently interpreted, it is difficult \nif not impossible for courts to exercise meaningful scrutiny of \nantitrust consent decrees. The ``mockery'' standard is contrary to the \nintent of the Tunney Act as found in the legislative history. Our \nlegislation will correct this misinterpretation of the statute. Our \nlegislation will insure that the courts can undertake meaningful and \nmeasured scrutiny of antitrust settlements to insure that they are \ntruly in the public interest, and to remind the courts of Congress' \nintention in passing the Tunney Act.\n\n  In an effort to explain how the revisions to the Tunney Act in H.R. \n1086 correct the mistaken standard used by certain courts in applying \nthe law, it is important to describe each of the specific provisions of \nsection 221 of H.R. 1086. Today we have introduced, with Senators \nHatch, Leahy, and DeWine, a Managers' Amendment to H.R. 1086. These \ncomments address H.R. 1086 as amended.\n  First, section 221(a) of our bill contains Congressional Findings and \nDeclarations of Purposes. These provisions clarify that we are \ndetermined to effectuate the original Congressional intent of the \nTunney Act. In other words, after the enactment of this legislation, \ncourts will once again independently review antitrust consent decrees \nto ensure that they are in the public interest. The Congressional \nFindings expressly state that for a court to limit its review of \nantitrust consent decrees to the lesser standard of determining whether \nentry of the consent judgments would make a ``mockery of the judicial \nfunction'' misconstrues the meaning and intent in enacting the Tunney \nAct. The language quoted paraphrases the D.C. Circuit decisions in\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\nMassachusetts School of Law v. U.S., 118 F.3d 776, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1997) \nand U.S. v. Microsoft, 56 F.3d 1448, 1462 (D.C. Cir. 1995). To the \nextent that these precedents are contrary to section 221(a) of our bill \nregarding the standard of review a court should apply in reviewing \nconsent decrees under the Tunney Act, these decisions are overruled by \nthis legislation. While this legislation is not intended to require a \ntrial de novo of the advisability of antitrust consent decrees or a \nlengthy and protracted review procedure, it is intended to assure that \ncourts undertake meaningful review of antitrust consent decrees to \nassure that they are in the public interest and analytically sound.\n  Section 221(b)(2)(A) of our bill amends the existing subsection of \nSection 5 of the Clayton Act (codified at 15 U.S.C. Sec.  16(e)) \ncontaining the requirement that courts review antitrust consent decrees \nto determine that these consent decrees are in the public interest. Our \nbill modifies the law by stating that, in making this determination, \nthe court ``shall'' look at a number of enumerated factors bearing on \nthe competitive impact of the settlement. The current statute merely \nstates that the court ``may'' review these factors in making its \ndetermination. Requiring, rather than permitting, the court to examine \nthese factors will strengthen the review that courts must undertake of \nconsent decrees and will ensure that the court examines each of the \nfactors listed therein. Requiring an examination of these factors is \nintended to preclude a court from engaging in ``rubber stamping'' of \nantitrust consent decrees, but instead to seriously and deliberately \nconsider these factors in the course of determining whether the \nproposed decree is in the public interest.\n  Our bill, in section 221(b)(2)(B), also revises and enhances the \nfactors which the court is now required to review in making its public \ninterest determination. In addition to the factors enumerated under \ncurrent law, the court must examine whether the terms of the proposed \ndecree are ambiguous. While complete precision when dealing with future \nconduct may be impossible to achieve, an overly ambiguous decree is \nincapable of being enforced and is therefore ineffective. A mandate to \nreview the impact of entry of the consent judgment upon ``competition \nin the relevant market or markets'' is also added by our bill. This \nwill ensure that the Tunney Act review is properly focused on the \nlikely competitive impact of the judgment, rather than extraneous \nfactors irrelevant to the purposes of antitrust enforcement. Finally, \nthis list is not intended to be exclusive, as the court is directed to \nreview any other competitive consideration ``that the court deems \nnecessary to a determination of whether the consent judgment is in the \npublic interest.''\n  Under the existing statute, the trial court is granted broad \ndiscretion as to how to conduct Tunney Act proceedings. Our amendments \nmake no changes to these procedures. In deciding whether to approve the \nconsent decree, the court may, but is not required to, hold a hearing \non the proposed decree. Id. Sec.  16(f). In such a hearing, the court \nmay take the testimony of Government officials or expert witnesses. The \ncourt may also take testimony from witnesses or other ``interested \npersons or agencies'' and examine documents relevant to the case. The \ncourt may also review the public comments filed during the sixty-day \nperiod pursuant to the Tunney Act. In addition, the court may appoint a \nspecial master or outside consultants as it deems appropriate. Finally, \nthe court is granted the discretion to ``take such other action in the \npublic interest as the court may deem appropriate.'' Id. While the \ncourt may do any of the preceding, it is not required to follow any of \nthese procedures.\n  Our amendments to section five of the Clayton Act add language \nstating that nothing in that section will be ``construed to require the \ncourt to conduct an evidentiary hearing or to require the court to \npermit anyone to intervene.'' This language is not intended to make any \nchanges to existing law, but merely to restate the current \ninterpretation of the law. Under the statute, the court is not required \nto conduct an evidentiary hearing, but is permitted to do so or to take \ntestimony if it wishes to do so. See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 16(f). This will \nremain the procedure, a court will be permitted, but not required, to \nconduct evidentiary hearings in making its Tunney Act determination. \nAdditionally, the statute currently permits in 15 U.S.C. Sec. 16(f)(3) \nintervention by interested parties in the Tunney Act review proceeding. \nThis will remain the procedure a court will be permitted, but not \nrequired, to allow parties to intervene.\n  Our amendments also make two other minor and technical changes to \nTunney Act procedures. First, section 221(b)(1) of the bill permits the \ndistrict court to authorize an alternative means of publication, rather \nthan publication in the Federal Register, of the public comments \nreceived in response to the announcement of the proposed consent \ndecree. A court may only authorize such alternative means of \npublication if it finds the expense of Federal Register publication \nexceeds the public interest benefits to be gained from such \npublication. This provision is intended to avoid unnecessary expense in \npublishing proposed consent decrees if alternate means are available, \nsuch as, for example, posting the proposed decrees electronically, \nwhich are sufficient to inform interested persons of the proposed \nconsent decree.\n  The second technical amendment, found in section 221(b)(3) of our \nbill, amends the provision of the Tunney Act codified in 15 U.S.C. \nSec.  16(g) which requires that defendants notify the court of all \ncommunications with the Government relevant to the consent decree, \nexcept for communications between the defendant's counsel of record and \nthe Justice Department. Our bill adds language which clarifies the \nstatute's language to make clear that only communications with the \ndefendant, or any officer, director, employee, or agent of such \ndefendant, or other person representing the defendant must be \ndisclosed. The defendant is not required to disclose contacts with the \nGovernment concerning the settlement by persons not affiliated with, \nrepresenting, or acting on behalf of the defendant, for example, \ncompetitors of the defendant. The defendant's obligation to disclose \ncontacts by agents or persons representing the defendant, including \noutside lobbyists, is unaffected by this technical change.\n  In sum, our bill will mandate that courts engage in meaningful review \nof the Justice Department's antitrust consent decrees and not merely \n``rubber stamp'' the decrees. It will make clear that it is a \nmisinterpretation of the Tunney Act to limit a court's review to limit \njudicial review of these consent decrees to whether they make a mockery \nof judicial function, and therefore overrule recent D.C. Circuit \ndecisions holding to the contrary. The bill is expressly intended to \neffectuate the legislative intent of the Tunney Act and ensure the \nability of courts to effectively review consent decrees to ensure that \nthey are in the public interest. It will require, rather than permit, a \ncourt to review a list of enumerated factors to determine whether a \nconsent decree is in the public interest. By restoring a robust and \nmeaningful standard of judicial review, our bill will ensure that the \nJustice Department's antitrust consent decrees are in the best \ninterests of consumers and competition.\n  Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Hatch, \nSenator Leahy and Senator Kohl, as a sponsor of H.R. 1086, the \nStandards Development Organization Advancement Act of 2003. H.R. 1086 \nwas passed unanimously by the Judiciary Committee in November 2003, and \nI am proud to say that H.R. 1086 encompasses many of the provisions of \nS. 1797, the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act of \n2003, which Senator Kohl and I introduced in October 2003. H.R. 1086 is \na comprehensive bill that will enhance and improve the enforcement of \nU.S. antitrust law in four key areas.\n  First, and perhaps most important, this bill will raise the penalties \nfor criminal violations of antitrust law and bring those penalties more \ninto line with penalties for other, comparable white collar offenses. \nAntitrust crimes such as bid rigging or cartel activity cheat consumers \nand distort the free market just as surely as any other type of \ncommercial fraud, and should be strongly punished. Under current \nantitrust laws, the maximum criminal penalties for individuals guilty \nof\n\n[[Page S3619]]\n\nprice-fixing are three years incarceration and $350,000 in fines. For \ncorporations, the maximum fine is $10 million. This bill will, No. 1, \nraise the maximum prison term to 10 years; No. 2, raise the maximum \nfine for individuals to $1,000,000; and No. 3, raise the maximum \ncorporate fine to $100 million. By increasing the prison terms for \nindividuals, this bill brings criminal antitrust penalties closer in \nline with the maximum penalties assessed for mail fraud and wire fraud, \nwhich are both 20 years. Executives and other antitrust offenders need \nto know that they face serious consequences when they collude with \ntheir competitors, and this bill will send that message to the \nmarketplace.\n  Second, this bill improves on an investigative and prosecutorial tool \nalready being employed effectively by the Justice Department. Since \n1993 the Antitrust Division has successfully used a revised corporate \namnesty program to help infiltrate and break-up criminal antitrust \nconspiracies. In short, if a corporate conspirator self-reports its \nillegal activity to the Antitrust Division and meets certain \nconditions--it must be the first conspirator to confess, it cannot be \nthe ringleader of the conspiracy, and it must agree to cooperate fully \nwith the investigation, among other things--it will receive a ``free \npass'' from prosecution. This program has been extremely successful in \ncracking conspiracies, because it creates a strong uncertainty dynamic \namong co-conspirators; members of the cartel can never be sure that one \nof the other conspirators will not confess its illegal activity to the \nAntitrust Division in order to avoid criminal liability. This \nuncertainty decreases the likelihood of cartels forming to begin with, \nand makes cartels less stable when they do form.\n  H.R. 1086 helps to enhance the Division's corporate amnesty program \nby expanding its reach. The current amnesty program does not affect the \ncivil liability of the conspirators; that is, a corporation cooperating \nwith the Division through the amnesty program receives protection from \ngovernment prosecution, but may still be sued in court by private \nparties for treble damages. This bill decreases that liability by \nlimiting the damages a private plaintiff may recover from a corporation \nthat has cooperated with the Antitrust Division. Specifically, the \nconspirator is not liable for the usual treble-damages; instead, it is \nonly liable for actual damages. This modification recognizes that a \ncorporation that has fully cooperated with the Antitrust Division is \nless culpable than other conspirators, and provides a far greater \nincentive for corporations to cooperate with the Antitrust Division.\n  Third, H.R. 1086 addresses a concern raised recently by a string of \ncourt opinions that appear to limit the depth of review required by the \nTunney Act. In brief, the Tunney Act requires that prior to \nimplementing an antitrust consent decree a court must review that \ndecree to assure that it is in the public interest; historically, that \nrequirement has been understood to require that the courts engage in \nmore than merely ``rubber-stamping'' those decrees. A number of recent \nopinions have led some to question the depth of review required by the \nTunney Act. This bill makes clear that the Tunney Act requires what it \nhas always required, and that mere rubber-stamping is not acceptable. \nIn addition, H.R. 1086 makes a small number of minor modifications and \nrevisions to ensure both that the Tunney Act accurately reflects its \noriginal intent and that it effectively functions in the modern legal \nand economic environment.\n  Finally, this bill will treat Standard Development Organizations \n(SDOs) more favorably under the antitrust laws. SDOs are private, \nvoluntary non-profit organizations that set standards for industry \nproducts--e.g., one SDO sets the standard for the required depth of a \nswimming pool before a diving board may be installed. Under the bill, \nqualifying SDOs which pre-notify the Antitrust Division of their \nstandard-setting activities will not be subject to treble damages in \nprivate suits brought against them. Moreover, SDO activities will be \nscrutinized for antitrust violations under the less strict ``rule of \nreason'' legal standard, and SDOs may be awarded certain costs and \nattorney fees if they substantially prevail in litigation which is \nlater held to be frivolous.\n  In all of these ways, H.R. 1086 modernizes and enhances the \nenforcement of U.S. antitrust laws, and I am proud to sponsor it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the Hatch-Leahy amendment \nat the desk be agreed to, the committee-reported substitute, as \namended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, and \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to celebrate the good \nemployment news we received today.\n  I think it is important for us to at least take a few moments to \ncelebrate what was revealed today in the March employment figures \nreleased by the Department of Labor statistics.\n  I just left a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee, of which I am \na\n\n[[Page S3620]]\n\nmember. It was held in the House this time. We had the Department of \nLabor statistician give those reports. They were good numbers indeed.\n  There were 308,000 new jobs added this month. Since last fall, we \nhave added over 700,000 new jobs. These are not vague numbers. These \nnew jobs are payroll jobs that are identified easily because these are \npayroll jobs where the employer is sending the money to the Federal \nGovernment for Social Security, Medicare, and income tax withholding. \nThese are really hard numbers.\n  For some time, we have had a divergence between the household survey \nand the payroll numbers. Payroll numbers have not been as good as the \nhousehold numbers. Household numbers are a survey of homes in America. \nMany think they are even more accurate, because they ask whether you \nare employed and whether you are working. The truth is a lot of people \ndo not show up on a payroll because they are self-employed, they are \nconsultants, or they operate a business out of their home. They help \ntheir spouse or family member with a job. They do not show up on a \npayroll. Also, a large number of people are working here illegally and \nare not counted. That is something we need to get more serious about.\n  It is odd to me that Members in this Senate who are most angry and \nmost upset about unemployment seem to have no concern whatsoever about \nhow many jobs are being taken by people coming into this country \nillegally. We are a nation of immigrants, and we believe in \nimmigration. But we also want to know who is coming to make sure they \nare coming legally, they are not terrorists, and that they are not \nflooding our job market and putting Americans out of work who could \nhave had those jobs.\n  So the question becomes, where did all these new jobs come from? I \nthink we can say with some fairness and objectivity with the history of \nour current situation--not to try to be partisan in any way--President \nBush last year said he believed this economy was not where it should \nbe. Our unemployment rate was not where it should be. It was too high. \nWe needed to increase employment in America, and we needed to increase \ngrowth. The way you increase employment in this country is to increase \ngrowth, so we set out to do that.\n  What did we do? We carried through on a plan to stimulate this \neconomy through tax cuts for American citizens, businesses, and \ninvestment. We began to see some real change. Growth began to occur.\n  During the third quarter of last year, growth was 8.2 percent. That \nis the highest rate of growth in 20 years. The fourth quarter was over \n4 percent. We expect, according to Mr. Greenspan, growth this year to \nbe 5 percent. That is a tremendous level of growth. It is something we \nshould be very proud of.\n  Economists also say that growth creates jobs. If the economy does not \ngrow, if businesses are not expanding, then they don't hire people. You \ndon't have jobs created. If you want to create jobs, you have to have \ngrowth. So we have created growth.\n\n  There has been some concern about the number of jobs added as we \nbegan to grow. It has not been at the rate we would like to see. It is \nsomewhat below historical averages. You would think jobs would increase \nfaster considering the highest level of growth we have seen, but as we \nheard in the hearing this morning I attended--and I think most \neconomists would agree--the problem has been productivity. Productivity \nhas a short-term adverse impact on employment, but it is not a problem \nin the long term. Increased productivity means that a plant, a factory, \nor a business is doing better than they have done before. They are \nproducing more widgets at less cost and less employment, and they are \nmore efficient. In the long run, that is good. In the short run, it \ncould mean an increase in unemployment.\n  We have had incredible increases in productivity and this has made us \ncompetitive in the world market. If you do not have productivity \nincreases, how can a high-wage country like the United States compete \nwith other countries around the world that pay less wages?\n  Productivity is the key to our being competitive in the world market. \nEverybody who is honest and who understands the situation would agree \nwith that. But it has caused us to lag in jobs.\n  Growth is occurring. Now we see a 308,000-person increase in \nemployment this month. It is really good news. I think it is something \nwe should celebrate.\n  There has been so much political rhetoric going on. President Bush is \na strong leader. He takes responsibility. He says he is not satisfied \nright now with the employment level in our country, although this \nunemployment rate we have today is below the 20-year average for \nunemployment in America. It is an unemployment rate that existed when \nPresident Clinton ran for reelection last time. The unemployment rate \nof 5.7 percent is not an extreme situation when viewed in historical \nterms. In fact, today's unemployment rate is less than the average rate \nfor the decade of the 1980s and its less than the average rate for the \ndecade of the 1990s.\n  Let me show you this chart that I think is pretty dramatic. It is \nentitled, ``Best Is Yet To Come, U.S. Picked to Have the Strongest \nGross Domestic Product Growth Over Next Year.''\n  These were economists picking which countries have the greatest \neconomic growth this year. The United States is almost 5 percent. All \nthe rest of the countries--Australia, Canada, Britain, Spain, Japan, \nSweden, Denmark, France, Euro Area, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, \nItaly, Germany, and the Netherlands--all have lower growth.\n  Whose economy is doing well? Our economy is doing well. Why? We are \ndoing better for several reasons. One is we have lower taxes than those \ncountries. Another is that we have fewer regulations than those \ncountries. We are committed to a more free market economy. That \nproduces growth. That is the engine for American prosperity. It always \nhas been, and we should never abandon that and move to the Socialist \nstate economies in these other countries.\n  This is tremendous. How people can come around and whine and complain \nand grumble about the kind of situation we are in now is beyond me.\n  This chart shows the gross domestic product growth in the past 12 \nmonths. The United States has the highest growth in gross domestic \nproduct of all of these nations: Australia, Japan, Britain, Spain, \nSweden, Canada, Belgium, Austria, France, Euro Area, Denmark, Germany, \nItaly, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. All of those countries have \nlower growth rates than we do. The European Union unemployment rate is \n8.8. Ours is 5.7. Canada's is 7.4.\n  Something is being done right here. We are not quite as bad as people \nwould like to moan and groan about.\n  We just added 300,000 new payroll jobs last month. These are not \nsurvey jobs. These are people who are on the payroll and who are paying \nwithholding taxes--Social Security and Medicare taxes. These are \nsubstantially payroll and employment taxes. Things are moving along \npretty well. I have been concerned. I don't think it is fair that many \non the other side have blamed President Bush because the economy has \nnot done as well as we would like and it slipped into recession.\n\n  I will take a moment to explain some things. Back when former \nPresident Bush was President, he had been in office a year or so, the \nReagan boom had been going on, and all of a sudden we got into a \nslowdown. A lot of economists know why it occurred, but we got into a \nslowdown. We had negative growth a couple of quarters when former \nPresident Bush was in office, about his second year in office. \nPresident Clinton ran for office and said: It's the economy, stupid. He \nsaid the economy was bad and President Bush would be removed from \noffice and he won, to a large degree, on that issue.\n  The truth was, by the time President Clinton took office, the economy \nhad grown during the fourth year of President Bush's Presidency and \nPresident Clinton inherited a growing economy. The fourth quarter of \nPresident Bush's last year in office showed significant growth. So it \nis clear: President Clinton inherited a growing economy when he took \noffice. And for most of his two terms in office, the economy performed \nwell. I guess he gets credit for that, although I am not sure how much \nany President deserves credit for these things, but they think they do. \nSo they get the credit and the blame, whether they deserve it or not.\n  So President Clinton enters office and the economy goes along well \nfor a\n\n[[Page S3621]]\n\nwhile. But it was in trouble his last year in office. And during the \n2000 campaign President Clinton and Vice President Gore spent a lot of \ntime saying how wonderful the economy was and how much his Vice \nPresident, Mr. Gore, deserved credit for it, but, this just wasn't so. \nIn fact, the economy had already begun to sink dramatically during \nPresident Clinton's last year in office.\n  For example, the NASDAQ exchange lost one-half of its value during \nthe last year of President Clinton's tenure and before President Bush \ntook office. When President Clinton was President, the economy was in \ntrouble. Another fact is that during the third quarter of President \nClinton's last year in office the economy experienced negative growth.\n  To compound the problem further, the first quarter President Bush \ninherited also experienced negative growth, even though the President \nhadn't been in office long enough to have this slowdown occur as the \nresult of any of his policies. The fact is, President Bush inherited an \neconomy from President Clinton that was already in trouble. There was \nno doubt about it. The numbers I have given are indisputable. President \nBush's opponents want to ignore them and pretend that these facts did \nnot happen. They want to promote the myth that President Bush is \nresponsible for this economy, for the economic troubles we had, not \nthat he inherited them.\n  But to his credit, President Bush has not whined or complained about \nthe economic problems he inherited. Instead, he set about on a program \nto get our economy moving again by empowering the American people. He \ndid this by allowing people to keep more of the money they earn instead \nof sending it to Washington to be spent by this gaggle in the Senate \nand the House. This President trusts the American people. In a nutshell \nhis program is based on the premise that our economy functions best \nwhen we put more money into the hands of the people who earned it in \nthe first place.\n  And the President's approach has created this growth we are now \nseeing. It resulted in 8.20-percent growth the third quarter of last \nyear. It resulted in significant growth in the fourth quarter of last \nyear. It is an approach that leads many people, such as Alan Greenspan, \nto predict the economy many sustain GDP growth of 5% this year. And it \nis an approach that has helped create the 300,000 new jobs we celebrate \ntoday.\n\n  Things are moving well. We want to see it continue. We want to see \nthe unemployment numbers fall, and we want to see continued growth in \nproductivity and jobs. In the long run, growth will determine whether \nwe are successful as an economy and whether people will have jobs.\n  We hear all these things about China and Mexico being a threat to us, \noutsourcing and all these problems, and we need to look at every single \none of them and be very protective of jobs in America.\n  The President of the United States understands this. He understands \nthat he is not president of the European Union. He is not president of \nthe world. President Bush understands that he represents the United \nStates of America. He is working every day to help our interests.\n  We have a lot to celebrate with these numbers today. They are really \ngood. If we could maintain something close to that for the next 4, 5, \nor 6 months, we will feel a difference in income and revenue to the \nGovernment. We have 300,000 people now paying money to the Federal \nGovernment in taxes. One reason we have had a revenue shortage is \nbecause we have had less employment, so they are paying less taxes. If \nbusinesses are in a recession, they do not make a profit; the \ncorporation does not pay a tax unless they make a profit.\n  Maybe we are back in the mood of growth and profitability and hiring \nthat will make a difference not only in jobs for American citizens but \nmaybe it will also make a difference for revenue to our Government and \nhelp us get this budget balanced again, which is something I feel very \nstrongly about.\n  These tax reductions have been mischaracterized. Right now, we are \ndealing with it, as part of our budget process that we need to \ncomplete. We need to extend the child tax credit of $1,000 per child \nfor a working family in America today. The marriage penalty falls on \nworking families and the expansion of the 10-percent bracket--in other \nwords, people who are used to paying 15 percent income taxes--the lower \nincome taxpayers, some pay 10 percent, the middle group pays 15 \npercent--more people will be paying at a lower rate. All of those are \nin doubt right now. We need to make that happen, allow the American \npeople to keep more of their money, follow the great American \ntradition--not the European Socialist tradition--the American tradition \nof individual responsibility, lower taxes, free markets, less \nregulation, and we will continue to beat the world in economic growth \nand productivity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nJersey is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/02/senate-section/article/S3621-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3621-S3622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ECONOMIC INDICATORS\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, it is good news to have an increase in \nemployment in America today. Everyone is pleased to see more jobs are \ncoming into our economy and Democrats, as well as Republicans, are \npleased to see more Americans are going to work.\n  But that said, working men and women, and everyone, has to understand \nnumbers of 1 month do not indicate a change in whether one assesses \neconomic policy working for average Americans, for middle-class \nAmericans, for moderate-income Americans, for those who are trying to \nmake ends meet in our economy.\n  These good numbers we would like to see continued. We would like to \nsee more Americans going to work, but the American people need to \nunderstand this number, this 1-month number, in the context of a whole \n38 months of development of economic policy in this country, is a \nrecord that I believe, and I think many people would believe, has put \nenormous stress on the American people.\n  We are pleased with the job growth, but the fact is, we saw growth in \nthe unemployed this month of about 184,000. We now have 8.4 million \nAmericans unemployed in this economy. That is up substantially this \nmonth.\n  We have also seen the unemployment rate tick up about one-tenth of a \npercent. I heard some spinning about Senator Kerry saying 5.6 was \npretty good in 1996. There is a difference when you come from 7.2 \npercent, which is where President Clinton's unemployment rate was when \nhe came to office, going to 5.6--on the way, by the way, to 3.8 \npercent--than when we have a 5.6 or 5.7 percent rate, coming up from \n4.2 percent, which is what the current administration inherited.\n  We have rising unemployment in this country, not declining. One month \nis a good thing to have happen, even a good quarter is a good thing to \nhappen, but let's put it into the context of the 38 months of the \nstewardship of this administration's economic policies.\n  The fact is, we have had the worst record in 70 years, and it still \nstands. It has not been substantially altered by a 1-month performance \nin job growth in private sector jobs that we have seen since the \nHerbert Hoover years in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n  The fact is, every other President from that point in time on--\nRoosevelt right through Clinton; including George Bush 1, Ronald \nReagan, Carter--produced private sector jobs. And we have about a .7-\npercent decline in jobs under this administration in the private \nsector. We have lost about 2.6 million of those jobs, even after these \nnumbers.\n  In fact, we have been producing more jobs in Government during the \nPresidency of someone who said they did not believe in Government--\nwhich is quite strange--relative to an emphasis on the private sector.\n  Again, I repeat, you have to look at this in the overall context. One \nmonth is good, and we are all pleased about that, but the fact is we \nhave lost private sector jobs in this economy. It is a fact of which I \nthink the American people have a real understanding.\n  Economic policy is something to analyze over a period of time, in \ncontext. It is not just a month. Remember, in the Clinton years, there \nwere roughly 21 million jobs created--21 million jobs created--over \nthat 8-year period. Right now, we have lost something in the\n\n[[Page S3622]]\n\nneighborhood of 2.5 to 2.6 million jobs over the term of this \nstewardship of the economy.\n  It is the context you have to think about, what kind of economic \npolicy leads to sustained economic growth and sustained economic job \ncreation, which is the end result that I think people will measure in \ntheir own lives--whether they have a job, whether they are working, \nwhether they are actually able to take care of their families.\n  By the way, it is not just jobs; it is actually the earnings one gets \non those jobs. One of the things that has been happening in our job \nmarket is, as people lose a job, and then they take another job, we \nhave seen a 21-percent decline in the average wages of people who get \nreemployed.\n  So those factory workers in Edison, NJ, where our last Ford factory \nwas closed--they go from a Ford manufacturing job to a service sector \njob that is, on average, 21 percent lower in real earnings than the job \nthey had before. So they may be working but going into a Wal-Mart or \ngoing into hamburger flipping, which is not as good a job as the ones \nwe are losing.\n  That is the problem in this economy, even though we might be seeing \njob growth. By the way, if you look at the actual numbers in this \nmonth's job creation, so many of them are in the service sector, where \nyou are seeing this phenomenon happening, where there is a decline in \nthe earnings of families and their purchasing power. They are losing \ntheir ability to go into the economy and have the strength to \nparticipate in the way they were before.\n  So it is not just the jobs; it is the quality of jobs that is at \nstake in the debate we have with regard to economic policy. So not only \ndo we have a poor performance with regard to job creation, we have poor \nperformance with regard to the quality and the earnings power that is \nassociated with those jobs.\n  I think it is hard to hear some of the celebration and spinning that \nI have heard this morning on some of the television stations and from \nothers who are focusing only on the good news of the 308,000 jobs \ncreated. That is great. How about the 184,000 people who lost their \njobs? How about the 8.4 million people who are unemployed? How about \nthe 2 million people who are on long-term unemployment in this country, \nwho are detached or who have dropped out and are not looking for jobs? \nIt is the highest number we have ever seen.\n\n  By the way, if you added that into the unemployment rate--the people \nwho have stopped looking because they have given up hope looking for a \njob--the unemployment rate would be 7.2 percent. This is not just a \nsingle number. I know there is going to be a lot of focus on it, and \nthat is a good thing. I hope it sustains itself over a long period of \ntime so we can start correcting this malaise we have in our jobs market \naround this country. And it is serious.\n  People know about outsourcing. They know about offshoring. They know \nabout the fact that the minimum wage has not increased so that real \nearnings can grow for working men and women in America. There is a real \nproblem.\n  In January 2001, we had about 700,000 long-term unemployed. Today, we \nhave 2 million. You tell me whether that is a good stewardship of our \neconomic policy and our jobs policy in this country. Where I come from \nthat does not sound like a good performance.\n  I saw one of my esteemed colleagues from the other side of the \naisle--I know he was trying to make a positive case--saying we have \nrecord employment at 138.4 million jobs in this country. That may be \ntrue, but last time I checked the population just keeps growing every \nmonth. Every month, the population keeps growing. If the employment \nrate does not go up, do you know what. What happens this week or what \nhappened in this month's numbers is exactly what is taking place. We \nget rising unemployment, particularly when you add in all those people \nwho have dropped out of the workforce. It is not that hard to do \nfractions. If you keep the base the same, and the numbers go up, you \nare going to get a changed number. And that is what is happening. It is \nhard for me to understand why we want to take victory laps when there \nare 8.4 million Americans without jobs.\n  Now, this is something we all hope turns and continues along the \npath. By the way, it is sure coming at a fairly serious price. The last \ntime I checked, the President's own OMB Director was projecting we are \ngoing to have a $540 billion budget deficit. I guess if you go out with \na credit card and spend up a storm, you can get some activity going on \nin the marketplace. If you go to the malls and spend until you are in \ndebt to the point where you cannot sustain it over a long period of \ntime, you can get some economic stimulus, but that does not mean that \nis good economic policy. In fact, that means we are mortgaging our \nchildren's future so we can get results now. Funny, we want results \nabout 6 months in front of an election, but we are spending in an \nuncontrolled manner, and almost everyone, on both sides of the aisle, \nis troubled. Spending and tax cuts and borrowing just make no sense, \nbut they are getting some results in stimulating the economy. I do \nthink we have a good thing going on with regard to the Federal Reserve. \nWe have had the lowest interest rates now for 15, 16, 17 months--the \nlowest interest rates in 45 years. That actually does put some stimulus \nin the economy.\n  We could not do any more with regard to trying to stimulate. The \nproblem is, we did not do it very efficiently. We put it in all at the \ntop income brackets, and it sort of trickles down.\n  And that may create jobs. But I want to go back to what I think maybe \nis as important as anything that needs to be analyzed in the job \nmarket. When we trade manufacturing jobs, white collar technology jobs, \nfor service sector jobs, what happens to the American people? Their \nstandard of income goes down.\n  Madam President, $44,570 is the average wage for a job that was lost \nin 2001. And the average wage today, when you get a new job, is \n$35,410, according to this calculation. That is a decline of 21 \npercent. When you go from manufacturing and high-technology jobs to \nservice jobs, you see a deterioration in the real earnings of the \nAmerican people. That is happening. And we still have a major \nunemployment problem in this country: 8.4 million people, 2 million of \nwhom are unemployed on a long-term basis. We have the longest average \ntenure on unemployment we have had in 20 years.\n  So, yes, it is a good thing that we saw 308,000 jobs created this \nmonth. It is a good thing that we are starting to see some pickup. But \nby my calculation--and by anyone's calculation--we still have the worst \njob performance record of any President since Herbert Hoover. Those are \nthe facts. People can talk about the facts however they want. We have \nnot performed for the American people in creating jobs and creating \nreal earnings that will make a difference in their lives.\n  So I hope we do not start celebrating and spinning so much that we \nlose track of what the reality is for people in their own lives--\ncertainly what is the reality for those people in Edison, NJ, who just \nhad their Ford plant closed. I can tell you, it is happening all across \nmy State. We have seen the elimination of high-quality jobs, and people \nare replacing them with those lower earning ones. I think we have \nserious issues to debate as we go through this campaign season. We \nought to stay focused on the facts--both the number of jobs created and \nthe quality of those jobs. I look forward to having greater discussion \nabout these issues in the weeks and months ahead.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/02/senate-section/article/S3622-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 5, 2004, AT 1 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
