Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor this \nmorning to talk a little bit more about the State of the Union Message \nwe heard last night from the President of the United States. We all had \noccasion to respond to members of the media last night, but I do think \nit is important, as we contemplate his message and as we react to it, \nthat, at least to a certain extent, we do so in an official capacity \nhere on the Senate floor.\n  The President came to Congress to deliver his annual State of the \nUnion Message in fulfilling his constitutional obligation to report to \nCongress and the American people on where our Nation is and the \ndirection in which we are headed.\n  The reason our Founders included that obligation is they recognized \nthat democracy requires discussion. So I want to take a moment today to \nadd my thoughts to that discussion.\n\n[[Page S1690]]\n\n  In many instances, the President's words were powerful, and there are \nmany areas where I see room for enthusiastic agreement.\n  For example, his call, last night, for a renewed commitment to \naddress the international pandemic on AIDS was welcome. I can say, \nwithout equivocation, that our caucus, and I believe Democrats in the \nCongress in its entirety, will be supportive of the efforts made by the \nPresident and this administration to address the international AIDS \ncrisis more effectively.\n  Let me also say I was pleased that the President made the \nannouncement he did with regard to the Federal commitment to \nalternative fuels.\n  I wish he had gone further, frankly, but a recognition of the \nimportance of continuing the development through research of hydrogen \nfuels is a welcome bit of news. As we have progressed over the course \nof the last couple of years, the alternative fuels market, the need for \nthe continued development of alternative fuels, is important to the \nPresiding Officer, to myself, and to many others who recognize that we \nwill never rid ourselves of dependency upon foreign sources until we \nmake a more complete commitment to the development of alternative \nfuels.\n  So the President's willingness to do that, his prioritization of that \nquestion, is one that was received in a very enthusiastic way, I am \nsure, on both sides of the aisle.\n  There are other areas, however, where the President's words seemed \nout of step with his actions and, frankly, out of touch with his \nproposals.\n  Today, and in the days ahead, the real test of the President's words \nis not whether they sound good but whether they lead to action and \nwhether that action leads to progress.\n  Today, the triple threat of war, terrorism, and recession is \ncombining to make Americans unsure about their future and unclear about \nthe course our Nation is taking.\n  On the economy, it is almost impossible to believe, but just 2 years \nafter the longest economic expansion in history, today we have more \nthan 2 million jobs lost in 2 years; the worst job creation record of \nany administration in 60 years; the first back-to-back years of job \nloss in 50 years; middle-class income is down for the first time in 10 \nyears; the highest unemployment rate in 8 years; the highest poverty \nrate in 8 years; and a Federal budget more than half a trillion dollars \nin debt.\n  In fact, as the budget is about to be produced for the coming fiscal \nyear, we are told we will see the biggest indebtedness that we have \nseen now in more than 10 years. We started out 2 years ago with the \nprojection of $5.5 trillion in surplus. We are now told because of the \nPresident's tax cuts and, in part, because of the recession and the \npotential for war, our projected deficit over the course of the next 10 \nyears will be $1.7 trillion, $1.7 trillion deficit from a $5.5 trillion \nsurplus just 2 years ago. That represents nearly a $7 trillion swing in \na mere 24 months--$7 trillion from surplus to deficit in 24 months.\n  The economic plan the administration passed in 2001 has, \nunfortunately, been an abject failure. Yet, last night, the President \nseemed to be asking for more of the same. Before this ditch gets dug \nany deeper, the President must explain why he thinks this time the \nresults will be any different than the last time.\n  Mr. President, I have expressed on the floor in past speeches my \nconcern for his plan and how serious a concern we have for the \nramifications of that plan. The President started by calling his plan \n``stimulus.'' I have noticed in recent months or weeks that he has \nchosen not to use that word, and I think for good reason. There is very \nlittle stimulus in the President's proposal. In fact, by their own \nrecognition and acknowledgement, only 5 percent of the budget in the \nproposal made by the President in his $674 billion tax reduction plan \nis stimulative this year. Ninety-five percent of what the President is \nproposing takes place next year and the year after--5 percent. That 5 \npercent is expected to raise 190,000 jobs. Ironically, 190,000 jobs is \nexactly the number of jobs lost in November and December of last year. \nSo while we have lost 2.3 million jobs, the President is proposing that \nwe enact an economic plan that produces 190,000 jobs this year. So we \nought to be clear about that.\n  There is very little stimulative value in what the President has \nproposed. Let me say I could understand that if there were some merit \nto the proposals themselves. But the problem we have with the proposals \nthemselves is they are not broad based. Last night, the President noted \nthere would be some who would benefit by up to $1,200 and, certainly, \nin some cases, because of his advocacy of the child tax credit, that \nwould be the case. But there are thousands and thousands of people who \nare not able, because they don't have children, to benefit from the tax \nplan as the President proposed. In fact, in his plan, $20 billion in \nthe first year goes to 226,000 people whose income exceeds $1 million; \n$15 billion goes to the 92 million Americans whose incomes are no \ngreater than $50,000. So there is an extraordinary disparity between \nthose who would benefit at the very top and those who benefit in a much \nmore marginal way with incomes of $50,000 or less.\n  What troubles me the most about the fairness question is not the \nincome disparity, but the notion that we could be sending people to \nwar, that we could actually be asking people to give their lives in \npursuit of a war with Iraq at the very time we turn around and tell \nthose with incomes of more than $1 million they are going to get an \n$89,000 tax break. It would be hard--in fact, impossible--for me to \naccept 10 or 15 or 20 years from now, as the question is asked: So what \ndid you do? What was your sacrifice in the war on Iraq?--the only \nanswer being, in the case of those making more than a million dollars: \nI got an $89,000 tax break. So the fairness question has economic, as \nwell as very real and personal implications that are troubling to many \nof us.\n\n  Perhaps the third and final of all of the many concerns we have with \nregard to this particular plan is the recklessness. As I said, we are \ngoing from a $5.5 trillion surplus to a $2 trillion deficit in 2 years. \nBut that doesn't tell the whole story. States are now experiencing \ndeficits that, in total, exceed $100 billion. Economists have now \nproposed analyses that would suggest, in addition to the $100 billion, \nthe tax plan proposed by the President would exacerbate that debt by at \nleast $4 billion to $6 billion more. So, ironically, at the very time \nwe are cutting taxes at the Federal level, the President is turning \naround and requiring Governors to increase taxes at the local and State \nlevels. It just doesn't make sense.\n  It is reckless as well in the recognition that we are going to be \nborrowing every dollar in resources that we turn around and give out in \nthe form of tax cuts. Every dollar in those tax cuts comes directly \nfrom the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. We have no other \nresources to send out.\n  Finally, I simply say, as we consider this recklessness, as we \nconsider our priorities, there is no possible way that we can fight a \nwar in Iraq, that we can dedicate ourselves to the priorities the \nPresident articulated in his address last night--which I will turn to \nin a moment--there is no way we can help the States with the tremendous \nfiscal crisis they are now facing--a crisis, we are told, that is the \nworst in 50 years--and turn around and provide a $1.7 trillion \nadditional tax cut this year.\n  There is growing concern, as we consider the ramifications of what \nthe President is proposing, that we can cause even more serious damage \nto the economy were we to take the proposals of the President and enact \nthem as they have been sent to us. It is essential that we go back to \nthe drawing board, essential that we live up to the economic principles \nthat mainstream economists tell us are essential if we are going to do \nthis right. They tell us whatever stimulus we pass ought to be \nimmediate, ought to be time limited, and, indeed, that is what \nDemocrats have proposed--a limited, immediate stimulus that will take \neffect this year, not in the outyears; that it be fiscally responsible; \nthat we not exacerbate overall indebtedness by $1.7 trillion; that if \nanything we limit what exposure there is budgetarily to no more than \n$100 billion to $150 billion--1.5 percent GDP. Our Democratic plan will \ndo that.\n\n  A third point they tell us is we ought to be broad based in our \napproach, provide assistance to where it can do the most good, spur \nconsumption. We do\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\nthat with the $300 rebate, $1,200 for families with children; the \nbusiness tax cuts we advocate for accelerated appreciation, for \nexpensing of equipment, and for reducing the cost of health care for \nemployees, in addition to providing the unemployment compensation to \nthe millions of Americans who have not been provided those benefits in \nrecent weeks.\n  We have done some analysis of families who were in the gallery last \nnight with the First Lady, people who were invited to come because, \naccording to the President, they benefited from the plans the President \narticulated.\n  As we calculate those specific benefits, we find, ironically, that \nthey actually do better under the Democratic plan than under the \nPresident's plan. The Becks, for example, the senior citizens he cited, \nget a 43 percent larger benefit under the Democratic plan than they do \nunder the President's plan.\n  I start with that. I wish the President would have devoted more time \nto the economy, more time to the concerns that many of us have raised \nabout his proposal, more time to how we are going to address the \ndeficit and how we are going to deal with spurring the economy to bring \ndown that deficit than he did last night. But I stand ready to work \nwith him.\n  I think it is critical we work together. I am hopeful we can find \nmeaningful bipartisan consensus, and I hope we do it sooner rather than \nlater.\n  There are reports that some of our colleagues would prefer to wait \nuntil April or May before we take up economic stimulus. I think that \nwould be a lost opportunity and a real mistake if, indeed, we want to \nget this economy back on track at the earliest possible date.\n  Last night, the President also indicated in his comments that \neducation remained important, but what surprised me about his assertion \nthat it is important is that last night, in a 1-hour speech, education \ngot just one line. The President said we had passed ``historic \neducation reform, which now must be carried out in every school and \nevery classroom so that every child in America can read and learn and \nsucceed in life.''\n  Speaking of education reform and other measures passed over the last \n2 years, he said:\n\n       Some might call this a good record. I call it a good start.\n\n  The President is right, it is a good start but only a start. Right \nnow, unfortunately, it appears to be a false start because the \nPresident has refused to adequately fund his own education reforms. The \nBush administration has proposed the smallest education budget in 7 \nyears despite continued record enrollments in America's public schools, \ndespite new testing requirements and other mandates in new law, despite \nthe worst State budget crises in 50 years--crises that are forcing many \nStates to cut education budgets--despite a looming teacher shortage \ncrisis, despite growing problems with overcrowded and obsolete school \nbuildings, despite the fact that higher education is slipping farther \nand farther out of reach for more families, despite the critical \nimportance of education to the social and economic health of America's \nfuture--despite all the rhetoric, the Bush administration is proposing \nan education budget that underfunds his own education reforms by more \nthan $7 billion.\n  This, again, begs the question: How in the world, if the President \ncan propose $1.7 trillion, can he explain underfunding his own \neducation reforms by $7 billion?\n  Last night, the President spoke eloquently about the environment. He \nasked us to pass an initiative he calls ``Healthy Forests.'' Healthy \nforests is a euphemism for logging without limits to many. It opens \nmore than 20 million acres of national forests to logging and thinning. \nIt allows those projects to avoid environmental laws, public comment, \nor judicial review. Democrats want a balanced approach to forest \nmanagement.\n  The President also talked about a proposal he calls ``Clear Skies,'' \nanother euphemism. Clear Skies is actually weaker than the current \nClean Air Act. It delays reductions in air pollution and makes it \nharder for States to limit pollution.\n  Again, the President is using all the right rhetoric but clinging to \nall the wrong policies. When he calls something ``Healthy Forests'' and \nit is not, when he calls something ``Clear Skies'' and it will not, the \ncredibility gap widens.\n  The President last night also promised a prescription drug benefit \nunder Medicare. What he proposed last night is a prescription drug plan \nthat comes at the expense of Medicare. It is not, as the President said \nlast night, the same as the health care choices that Members of \nCongress get. Members of Congress get a prescription drug program and \nbenefit regardless of the plan they choose.\n  Under the President's Medicare privatization plan, seniors can only \nget drug coverage if they drop out of traditional Medicare and join an \nHMO. The President omitted this crucial detail last night.\n  Of all the decisions facing this President, none has more profound \nconsequences than the launching of a war against any country. We all \nknow, in the case of Iraq, that Saddam Hussein is not a man to be \ntrusted. We all know that North Korea has nuclear weapons and is the \nworld's biggest proliferator, and we face three very serious threats. \nWe face the threat that Iraq could acquire and deploy weapons of mass \ndestruction. We face the threat of North Korea, a country that already \nhas nuclear weapons and is threatening to develop more. And we face the \nthreat of additional terrorist attacks, including the horrific prospect \nof an attack with weapons of mass destruction. We have to prioritize \nhow we confront these threats, and the President needs to explain why \nhe is approaching each one in the way he is.\n  My concern is the President has not adequately laid out to the \nAmerican people or to the international community why our top priority, \nin light of the other ones, ought to be war with Iraq, and how we can \nensure that if we go to a war with Iraq, we will not jeopardize our \nother priorities, including defending ourselves against terrorist \nattacks at home.\n  The President needs to lay out as clearly and as compellingly as he \nis able what imminent threat Iraq poses for the United States and what \nwe will do as a nation to ensure international cooperation and \ninternational support if war becomes an inevitability.\n  I look forward to hearing more from Secretary Powell next Wednesday, \nFebruary 5, but if the President has information about what he will \nshare with the United Nations and others on February 5, I ask that he \nshare it with us now. If there is information that has been withheld \nfrom Congress, if he has not provided the same information to us that \nhe intends to share with them, I ask that he do so \nimmediately. Certainly, we have every right to know. For us to know now \nwould help us clarify the confusion and the lack of certainty about the \nthreat posed by Iraq which the President addressed last night.\n\n  There were also a number of things the President did not mention, \nwhich I think needed to be mentioned: Racial reconciliation, hate \ncrimes, diversity in education, equal opportunity. Amazing. There was \nnot one word about these issues, in spite of the fact that a hate crime \noccurs every 3\\1/2\\ minutes in this country; in spite of the fact that \nthe Supreme Court may be dealing with the issue of diversity in \neducation and equal opportunity in the very near future and the \nadministration has chosen to oppose it; in spite of the fact that we \nare troubled by our inability to deal with these issues in a meaningful \nway legislatively in the weeks and months ahead without the direct \ninvolvement and leadership on the part of the administration.\n  The President did not address veterans and health care, and veterans' \nhealth in particular. There are 164,000 veterans who may be forced off \nthe rolls because of new criteria involving their eligibility. That, \ntoo, could have been addressed and should have been addressed if indeed \nit was the priority the President maintains.\n  One million workers were left out of unemployment insurance and the \nPresident did not mention that as well. The President did not mention \nagriculture, did not mention the rural crisis we face, and the \ntremendous attrition we find in small communities across this country. \nHe did not talk about the issues involving agriculture and the \nextraordinary challenges farmers and ranchers are facing as we \nrecognize the extraordinary effect that\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\nthe drought and other natural disasters have had in recent years.\n  The President was right when he said this country has many \nchallenges. He was right to say we cannot ignore them and that we \nshould not pass them on to future generations. To prevent that from \nhappening, we need to work together. We need to make sure what is \npromised is done. Only then will we be able to reduce America's anxiety \nand truly strengthen our Union.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I certainly publicly acknowledge the \nstatement made by our leader. I approve of the statement, as does our \nDemocratic Caucus, and would simply say we look forward to working on a \nbipartisan basis with the President. There are a lot of things we need \nto do, but this is a democracy and we have to act accordingly. So I \nlook forward to working with the President on all of these issues about \nwhich the Democratic leader spoke.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1692-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1692-S1694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TITLE IX\n\n  Mr. REID. The time is now mine, and I want to talk about something \nthat is real important to me, important to the State of Nevada, and the \ncountry. I do not think it would be a stretch to say this \nadministration does not have a good record on protecting civil rights. \nRepublicans say they are for diversity, but they are fighting against \npolicies that promote diversity. Embarrassed and on the defensive \nfollowing recent events that focused attention on the Republican \nParty's position on civil rights, the President and other prominent \nRepublicans professed a new willingness to support efforts to expand \nopportunities for all Americans.\n  Unfortunately, they have not taken any action to suggest that they \nhave a sincere change of heart. In fact, to the contrary, the President \nhas recently opposed affirmative action policies that open the doors of \nhigher education to a generation of talented and motivated minority \nstudents, and he does not oppose affirmative action that gets people in \nsome of our best schools because they are children of alumni, that some \nstudents get into because of their athletic ability, and a lot of other \nissues that were not brought up in the brief the President filed with \nthe Court.\n  The President has to fully fund education programs, including those \ntargeting minority and low income students. The President has nominated \nand continues to nominate judicial candidates who have expressed and \ndemonstrated hostilities to civil rights enforcement and has placed \nopponents of civil rights in positions of power.\n  Now comes the disturbing news that this administration is on the \nbrink of attacking title IX, programs that have made America better, \nstronger, and fairer by enabling millions of young women the same \neducational opportunities as young men. We cannot--I personally will \nnot--let the administration do that. We cannot let this administration \neven think about dismantling title IX, taking away opportunities from \nAmerican women, and undoing the progress we have made over the last 30 \nyears.\n  Title IX of the education amendments of 1972 was the landmark \nlegislation that prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded \neducational athletic programs.\n  In my career, as in the career of the Presiding Officer, I have had \nthe opportunity to meet some very outstanding people. One of the people \nI met was a woman by the name of Molly Yard. Molly Yard was five foot \ntwo, from Pennsylvania, a graduate of Swarthmore, born in China to \nmissionary parents. She came back to the United States when she was age \n13. Having participated in athletics in China, when she came back to \nthe United States there were no programs for girls. She always felt \nless of a person than she could have been for not having the ability to \nparticipate in athletics. For this woman, who later in life became the \npresident of the National Organization of Women and was heavily \ninvolved in all kinds of activities, the one issue of utmost importance \nto her was title IX and having young women involved in athletics.\n\n  I met Molly Yard. I met her when she was an older woman. She was \nstill very dynamic. Even though, after I met her, she had a stroke and \nwas physically infirm, she was still very enthusiastic about having \nworked for title IX and young women, girls, participating in athletics.\n  Evan Bayh, who is presently the Senator from Indiana, should be proud \nof his father for many achievements. All of us who know Birch Bayh, a \nformer Senator from the State of Indiana, know what a fine man he is \nand what a great legislative record he accumulated while in Congress, \nbut Evan should be most impressed with his father for being the sponsor \nof title IX. In 1972, it was Birch Bayh who wrote and introduced these \namendments that made title IX what it is today.\n  I will focus my remarks primarily on equal opportunity in athletics, \nnot the whole statute.\n  As a sports fan, I love athletics. As a young boy, my dream was to be \na professional baseball player, but I was not good enough. So I am a \nSenator instead. As an avid sports fan, I wake up in the morning and \nthe first thing I do is read the sports page. I do it because there is \nalways good news on the sports page. People may not always be happy \nwith the outcome of athletic events, but there is always something good \nhappening on the sports page; somebody won this or won that.\n  I enjoy very much going out to our university campuses in Nevada. I \nlive in the southern part of the State and go to UNLV most of the time \nto watch girls athletics. I love to watch softball. I don't know how \nmany people watch college level or high school level girls softball, \nbut it is so exciting. I hope I don't offend Jim Bunning, but it is \nmore exciting than baseball. It is quick and fast.\n  I have had the opportunity to watch some great athletes play \nsoftball. Lori Harrigan pitched and won games in two successive \nOlympics. I recently had a thrilling experience with a young lady named \nNicole Truax, an intern from the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, a \npitcher on one of their softball teams. I love to talk to Nicole. When \nshe was 12 years old, her father could no longer catch her ball. She \nthrew the ball so hard that her dad could not catch it.\n  That is what girls athletics is all about. I went to a UNLV girls \nbasketball game recently and I went into the locker room afterwards and \ntalked to them about title IX, about the reason they can participate in \nathletics, because of a law we passed in Congress.\n  On the high school level, I recently visited Gorman High School and \nwatched Gorman High School play. The main reason I went was one of my \nfriend's two girls play. They are both athletes, Danielle and Jackie \nBates. They run track and play basketball.\n  I recently visited with and helped present some awards to the Green \nValley High School golf team. This golf team set a national record for \nconsecutive victories. On October 1 of last year they broke the record \nof 128 straight duel match wins by completing another unbeaten season, \nextending the streak to 133 over 11 years. Girls playing golf; they won \nthe State championship last year by 70 streaks. That is what girls do \nin athletics.\n  Before title IX, it was rare to see girls and young women playing \nsports. Even if they wanted to play and were tall, they could not play \nin organized competitions because high schools and universities did not \nhave women's teams. When I was in high school, my wife, who I am sure \nwas more athletic than I, could only be a cheerleader. She could not \nplay basketball. Of course, she is only 5 feet tall. There are a lot of \n5-foot tall basketball players in women's sports. In those days, a \nyoung lady could only become a cheerleader; there were no other \nathletic competitions for her.\n  My oldest child is a daughter. Title IX was just coming into being. \nPrograms were very sparse when she was in school and she did not \nparticipate in athletics. All my four boys participated. There were \nprograms all over for them.\n  Thanks to title IX, women today have a much broader range of athletic \nand educational opportunities at all schools in Nevada and all over \nAmerica. It has helped to dramatically increase participation in sports \namong female students. Since the implementation of title IX, there has \nbeen an already tenfold participation in high\n\n[[Page S1693]]\n\nschool sports for girls. Now, there are 3 million girls participating \nin athletics. At the college level, the number is 150,000 athletes. \nThis shows if you build it, they will come. Girls and young women have \na high level of interest in sports and have embraced the opportunity to \nparticipate.\n  This dramatic increase in women participating in athletics has taken \nplace even though women athletes still do not get equal treatment or \nequal funding that boys and men get. At schools in cities and towns and \ncommunities across the country, the boys who play sports are worshipped \nas heroes and get fancy uniforms, sometimes two or three seats for each \nplayer, new training facilities, and the best practice fields and games \nand an expensive travel budget.\n\n  I am sure women, before title IX, would have welcomed a chance to \nplay on any school team, even if it meant wearing an old worn-out \nuniform, playing at less convenient times. But for girls it is not \nenough just to play. They deserve equal treatment. That is the law. \nDespite the inequality and unfairness, girls and young women \nparticipate in record numbers.\n  Remarkably, some critics of title IX trot out old stereotypes, \nclaiming that women are not interested in sports. That is simply not \ntrue. The statistics show otherwise. The participation rate of girls in \nhigh school athletic programs since 1992 has increased 800 percent. \nThere are five times as many women in college athletics.\n  We all know young men are actively pursuing opportunities to play \nsports. They see Michael Jordan and they want to be just like Michael, \nto jump to new heights. Girls also admire women who are successful in \nathletics, such as a Mia Hamm or a Julie Foudy, who played on our World \nCup championship team, or Sheila Leslie, who plays basketball, or Gail \nDevers, who can run faster than most men in the world. That is whom \nthey admire. And even though there are the Greg Madduxes and Steve \nYoungs men admire and respect, there are women athletes whom young \nwomen aspire to be like, such as Tasha Schwikert from Las Vegas, still \nin high school, a gymnast who is ranked No. 1 in the country and fifth \nin the world. It inspires other young ladies. They see Serena and Venus \nWilliams shining on the court and ask, Why not me?\n  Last summer, the Secretary of Education announced the appointment of \na panel to study title IX. It would have been great if he called for a \nreview of how better to enforce the law, but he did not. Although no \none in the administration dares to criticize title IX, and Secretary \nPaige praised it, they are poised to gut it. American girls and young \nwomen must be thinking that with friends like these, who claim to \nfollow the law and like the law but are acting to undermine it, who \nneeds enemies.\n  This week, the President's Commission on Opportunity in Athletics is \nholding its final meeting and will soon make recommendations that \nthreaten the achievements American society has made because of title \nIX. It would be better entitled the President's Commission to Prevent \nOpportunity in Athletics.\n  I am deeply concerned about the stealth attack on women. If the \nPresident agrees with recommendations of this Commission--which, by the \nway, is heavily weighed by very large schools with great big football \nprograms--he can make revolutionary changes. Even though Congress and \nthe courts and the American people and women and men have consistently \nsupported title IX, he could do this, but it would be wrong.\n  Yesterday, new data released by the Women's Sports Foundation found \nthat the proposed changes being made by the President's Commission \ncould result in a loss of as many as 931,000 opportunities for girls to \nparticipate in high school sports each year. Is this bad or wrong? Of \ncourse.\n  What are some of the facts about title IX? What is it and what is it \nnot? No. 1, opponents of title IX claim they are in favor of title IX \nbut not as policies. They certainly do not want to jeopardize men's \nathletics. No. 2, in reality, nothing in the law or policy requires \nschools to set aside a certain mandatory number of slots for athletics. \nIn fact, every court that heard this argument has said title IX does \nnot require quotas.\n  No. 3, then, means title IX is not a quota system. Although one way a \nschool can comply with the law is by ensuring the percentage of male \nand female students is about equal--the race of men and women in the \nstudent body is not the only way you can do it--there are many other \nways.\n  For example, schools can comply with title IX simply by showing it is \ntrying to expand opportunities for female athletes or that it has \naccommodated interests of female students at the school, whatever the \nnumber of opportunities it provides. One proposal apparently being \nreviewed allows colleges and universities to limit the number of \nscholarships awarded to female athletes. Regardless of how many women \nare enrolled, a school would be allowed to limit women to just 43 \npercent of college scholarships. Why? On average, women comprise 53 \npercent of the student body's division 1 colleges at the top level of \ncompetition, but they are only 41 percent of the athletes,\n  For most Americans title IX is synonymous with our efforts to provide \ngirls and women an equal opportunity to participate in sports, but \ntitle IX addresses a whole range of important programs and issues \nrelated to education. In fact, only a small fraction of the title IX \ncomplaints received by the Department of Education's Office for Civil \nRights are related to athletics. Maybe that is too bad, but it is a \nfact.\n  Title IX also has helped to provide women with equal access to higher \neducation. Years ago, many universities excluded or severely restricted \nwomen from admission to certain programs. Now, however, the percentages \nof women enrolled in American law schools and medical schools are \napproximately the same as for men.\n  Unfortunately, according to reports recently issued both by the \nNational Women's Law Center and the National Coalition for Women and \nGirls in Education young women continue to be subject to persistent \ngender segregation and discriminatory counseling in high school \nvocational and technical education programs at American high schools. \nThey are often steered toward programs like cosmetology, health aide \npreparation, and child care training all of which lead to lower paying \njobs while male students congregate in programs leading to higher \npaying careers in technology and the trades. This has significant \nnegative implications for women's employment prospects and earning \npower.\n  We need to vigorously defend and enforce title IX in all of the areas \nit covers, so that we can sustain and expand upon the progress we have \nmade. We need not to weaken the programs but to strengthen them.\n  We need to recognize the importance of title IX in opening \neducational opportunities for women in math, science, engineering and \ntechnology and examine the underrepresentation of female students at \nboth the secondary and post-secondary levels in traditionally male \nareas of study such as physical science, engineering and technology \nprograms, and the barriers that women continue to face in these \nprograms.\n  I am concerned that it the President takes steps to deny girls and \nyoung women equal opportunity in athletics some will see that as a \nmessage that it is also okay to chip away at other laws and programs \nthat protect women and promote fairness.\n  We need effective title IX enforcement--not weakening--to ensure \nwomen have the same opportunities as men to participate in science and \ntechnology programs and classes.\n  While we should be happy with all the progress we have made providing \ngirls and women with opportunities previously denied them, we must \ncontinue our efforts to promote gender equality because the job is not \ncomplete.\n  Programs that have proven so effective in helping girls and women are \nunder assault from critics who would like to turn the clock back.\n  We cannot allow these challenges to succeed--and we will not.\n  The girls and women playing sports now, their ``soccer Moms'' and \n``basketball Dads'' will not tolerate a reversal of title IX--and \nneither will those of us in Congress who advocate equal opportunity for \nwomen.\n  We must continue to encourage participation in sports and provide \ngirls and women the same opportunities\n\n[[Page S1694]]\n\nthat boys and men have traditionally had. Athletic training and \ncompetition have the same benefits for females as for males: teaching \nthem not only how to score goals but also how to set goals--and work \nhard to achieve them, promoting cooperation and teamwork, developing \nleadership skills, and instilling self-confidence.\n  Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to serve in the Senate with \ntwo great athletes, two Hall of Fame athletes. One is Bill Bradley, who \nuntil recently was a Senator from New Jersey. What a fine man he is. A \nlot of his greatness was as a result of his athletic abilities.\n  Senator Jim Bunning from Kentucky, with whom I have had the pleasure \nto serve and get to know, is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, as \nSenator Bradley is of the Basketball Hall of Fame. Jim Bunning is here \nfor a lot of different reasons, however most notably, this man, as he \nwent through his baseball career, developed this tremendous confidence. \nAnyone who knows Jim Bunning knows of his tremendous self-confidence. \nThat came as a result of his athletic prowess, ability, and hard work. \nThat is what athletics is all about, and it works for women as it does \nfor men.\n  At a time when far too many American youth lead sedentary lifestyles \nand are obese, we must support programs that lead to improved fitness \nand health. Adolescent female athletes are more likely than non-\nathletes to develop a positive body image and less likely to become \npregnant. They also are at less risk for diseases and health problems \nthat afflict women like osteoporosis or breast cancer.\n  In addition, sports provide a safe and health alternative to drugs, \nalcohol, and tobacco, and to anti-social behavior. Students who \nparticipate in these programs feel a greater connection to school, have \nan additional incentive to attend classes and keep their grades up so \nthey can maintain their eligibility.\n  I am disappointed, if not surprised, that some critics would like to \nhalt this progress. They are making misleading and unfair criticisms of \ntitle IX. We are watching what this commission does this week in \nWashington.\n  So while we remain vigilant against attacks on title IX, we must also \npush for its continued implementation and enforcement, and the only \nchanges we will allow will be changes for the better.\n  Often, we hear that girls and women are the beneficiaries of title \nIX. I'm sure they are. But I think it is more accurate to say that we \nall benefit from this important civil rights legislation. Certainly, \nAmerican society as a whole is better when women--who after all make up \nmore than half of our population--are provided a fair and equal \nopportunity to develop their full potential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1694-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I rise to very briefly comment on the \nPresident's message last night and to initiate my own reflection, which \nI hope to have the opportunity to continue over the next several days \nand weeks as we respond to the vision that he painted for us in a very \neloquent, very direct, and very focused way last night.\n  Last night, the President said we will not deny or ignore or pass \nalong today's problems to future leaders and future generations. He \nsaid we will confront them head on, we will confront them directly, we \nwill do it with clarity, and we will do it with courage.\n  He is right. We have much to do. And our success in this body very \nmuch depends on our own focus and our own clarity and our own courage.\n  Let me begin with health care--specifically, this whole issue of \nMedicare, strengthening and improving Medicare and prescription drugs.\n  Last night, the President made it clear that if seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities are satisfied, if they like and are \npleased with the Medicare coverage they have today--the way the \nMedicare system works for them today--that they will, in this vision \nthat he paints, have the option of not changing anything, for keeping \nit just the way it is. Remember, about two out of three of our seniors \nand individuals with disabilities today do have some prescription drug \ncoverage. Many of those individuals may say: I don't want to change \nanything.\n  He also made it clear--and this is what is exciting to me as a \nphysician and as one who has taken care of thousands of Medicare \npatients--that seniors and individuals with disabilities should have \nanother option, another alternative. That is best understood by saying \nthey will have an opportunity to choose from among a menu of options, \nmuch like Bill Frist does as a Senator or Senator Kit Bond from \nMissouri does or Senator Hagel or others.\n  We hear from the other side of forcing people into HMOs. Let's make \nit very clear that the option the President began to spell out last \nnight--that I believe in heartily--is that we should give seniors the \nsame options we have to choose from among a variety of plans, not just \nHMOs, as the other side of the aisle comes back to because they know \nHMOs are demonized today, but an option of coordinated plans which \ninclude prescription drugs.\n  Nine million Federal employees have this option for a type of care \nthat we all consider very good, that does allow us to choose our own \ndoctors, if you choose such a plan. And those are the sort of options \nthat will be made for seniors. It works for us. It works for 9 million \nemployees. It works for our staffs. So don't seniors deserve the same \nopportunities?\n  It is going to take real courage for anyone to tell Americans they \nshould not have the same options that we have, which is the President's \nproposal: to give those same opportunities to seniors and individuals \nwith disabilities.\n  Opponents of choice in health care for seniors are saying the \nPresident's plan forces individuals to give up their doctors, their \nfamily doctors, or forces them to use a particular physician. Indeed, \nif a senior so chooses to go that route, maybe for larger benefits, \nhigher prescription drug coverage, that may be one route to going in, \nbut that is not what we necessarily have to do. We have that broader \nchoice. To say that people are going to be forced into plans where they \nhave to give up their physicians, that is not what happens to 9 million \nFederal employees unless that is what they choose to do. I am in the \nsame program, and I choose my own doctor.\n  What we are hearing is a lot of the same old, tired rhetoric. And it \nreally comes down to scare tactics. When we last talked about Medicare, \nimproving Medicare, in the Senate, this word, ``Mediscare,'' became \npopularized because that is what people saw, that is what the rhetoric \nresulted in.\n  Indeed, some people are using these ``Mediscare'' tactics to frighten \nseniors and to create anxiety and insecurity. It is time for us to pull \ntogether, in a bipartisan way, to elevate the discussion well above \nthat.\n  The pursuit of these scare tactics results in nothing but fear and \nanxiety. Our seniors simply deserve better.\n  The President talked about the Federal employees' health care program \nas one model. Under that model, there is a strong public-private \npartnership where you get the very best out of the\n\n[[Page S1695]]\n\nprivate models combined with the very best oversight and, yes, \nregulation in terms of the Government model, and you marry the two of \nthose together in a way that you can best--in a coordinated way--take \ncare of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of seniors and individuals \nwith disabilities.\n  Many of those plans, as I implied earlier, have an unlimited choice \nof physicians. In my particular plan, that I chose in the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program, I can go to any physician I would \nlike. So to say it takes away choice is, to me, not being entirely \nhonest with what is being proposed.\n  To do the right thing for our seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities is going to take a lot of the focus and the clarity that \nthe President spoke about last night in his address. It is going to \ntake a lot of courage in this body to focus on the policy itself--on \nthe policy itself--and not on the politics and the ``Mediscare'' \ntactics, to really get down to the substance of the issue itself. \nPolitics and policy each have their time and their place, but when we \nare talking about the health care for 40 million Americans now and in \nthe future--in essence, all Americans--we really do need to put \npolitics aside. Politics has no place when we are talking about the \nhealth of Americans.\n  My first priority--from medical school, internship, residency, \nfellowship, and in the practice of medicine--has been to improve access \nto the best, most affordable health care. As majority leader, in \nworking with the Republican caucus and the Democratic caucus, I want to \ncontinue that lifelong commitment to improved access.\n  It is clear the current Medicare system, the 2003 system, has not \nkept up with the advances that have been made in preventive health \ncare--in terms of prescription drugs, in terms of chronic care \nmanagement--because the system has become too rigid.\n  We are essentially operating with a system designed in 1965, which \nhas been slow to change because the system worked well through the late \n1960s, 1970s, and even into the early 1980s. However, we have now \ngotten to a point where the current Medicare system is limiting choice, \nwhere our seniors don't even have a choice of prescription drugs. \nPrescription drugs has become equally powerful to the operating rooms, \nwhere I spent my career using the surgeon's knife.\n  A survey this month by the AMA tells us that nearly half, 50 percent, \nof all physicians today are considering either reducing their Medicare \npatients--the number of patients they will see--or they are leaving the \nMedicare Program. Why? Because of reduced Medicare reimbursement year \nafter year--a 5-percent reduction last year and another 5 percent this \nyear, they see continued reimbursement below their cost, and they \nsimply cannot stay in business.\n  The President mentioned medical liability insurance last night. I \nthink it is important to address it head on because we are reaching a \nthreshold where we are about to see catastrophe. It comes down to \nfrivolous lawsuits. Can we tolerate the lawsuits when the escalation \nand number of lawsuits, and the money entailed, takes money away from \nhealth care and drives people from the practice of medicine to the \npoint that we are having trauma centers close down--most notably in \nNevada last year. And 6 weeks ago, we saw the doctors in West \nVirginia--it hurts me to even think about going on strike in terms of \nwhat physicians are doing. When you cannot stay in business, physicians \nreally have no choice. We saw what happened in West Virginia.\n  The President said frivolous lawsuits have not cured one patient. He \nis exactly right. I can tell you what will cure patients, and that is \nchanging our medical liability system so doctors can afford to heal, so \nthey can be allowed to heal.\n  Again, as a doctor, I will fight for the right of any patient to sue \nand receive fair and just compensation if they have been a legitimate \nvictim of a medical malpractice incident or an error. That is critical \nand that is right. What is not right, and what I will continue to fight \nagainst, is the reduction of access to good health care because doctors \nand hospitals can no longer afford to continue doing what they do \nbest--diagnose, treat, and heal, provide care--because of these \nskyrocketing costs that are associated with frivolous, illegitimate \nlawsuits.\n  It comes down to the fact that family doctors are having a hard time \nstaying in business and keeping the doors open; trauma units are \nshutting down; pregnant women in rural America are having a hard time \nfinding an obstetrician because they are having to leave that \nparticular area because of the exorbitant rates they are forced to pay, \nnot because they are bad doctors but because of these skyrocketing \nlawsuits. It is going to take laser-like focus to fix this, and I agree \nwith the President that we have no option but to fix it now.\n  The President introduced many positive policies last night. I want to \ncomment on one that means a great deal to me that I think we will be \nable to address in this body early in the session, and that is the \ninternational pandemic of the HIV/AIDS virus. What the President said \nlast night was truly historic, truly unprecedented in the history of \nthe world, addressing head on a problem that has killed 23 million \npeople in the last 20 years--a virus nobody knew anything about in 1981 \nand that, in the best of all worlds, will kill, for every one person in \nthe last 20, two in the next 20, or almost 45 million people. I cannot \nbegin to say how important this is and how impressed I am that the \nPresident is taking bold action, demonstrating bold leadership, by \nmaking the United States of America a courier of medical care, of \neducation, and thereby making the United States of America a courier \nfor international hope, in the sense that it is addressing what is \ndestroying a nation, a continent, and now spreading throughout the \nworld.\n\n  I also commend the President for his commitment to the protection of \nall Americans from this whole threat of bioterrorism. The threat is \nreal and these biological agents are in the hands of our enemy. These \nagents are deadly. When you talk about anthrax and Ebola, which the \nPresident mentioned last night, and you talk about plague, you are \ntalking about agents that are more powerful than nuclear weapons. These \nweapons of mass destruction--now in the hands of terrorists--are more \npowerful than nuclear weapons. A biological agent is a tiny \nmicroorganism that can be transported in a little vial in your pocket, \nunlike most nuclear weapons. They are cheap, they are easily \ntransportable, and they are more deadly than nuclear weapons.\n  My closing point is on this particular facet of weapons of mass \ndestruction. We know our enemies--I speak now of Saddam Hussein and his \nhenchmen--have in their possession quantities that serve no purpose but \nthat of weapons of mass murder. Saddam Hussein, we know, is a serial \nkiller. He has used chemical weapons--they are not biological weapons. \nThere are chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. Chemical weapons \nare similar to biological but a little bit different. Saddam Hussein \nhas used chemical weapons and, in 1 day, killed 5,000 of his own \npeople, and 10,000 people in addition to those who were injured, and \ntens of thousands between 1983 and 1988 were killed by these chemical \nweapons. We know he has these weapons; we know he harbors terrorists. \nWhy in the world would a rational person believe he would hesitate to \nhelp others terrorize the United States or Europe or Asia or Israel, \nwherever anyone has an agenda of hate?\n  Some question the wisdom of a preemptive attack against Saddam. It is \nakin to being against preventive health care, against these deadly \nmicroorganisms which are used as weapons of mass destruction, for which \nthere is no cure. We have no cure or vaccine. The Ebola virus kills, \nand we have no vaccine right now. We have no treatment for the Ebola \nvirus today. It was overlooked, but the President introduced a $6 \nbillion program last night to best protect us from these biological \nagents, which we know other countries have developed in the past as \noffensive weapons of mass destruction.\n  I look forward to Secretary Powell's presentation at the United \nNations next week, as this President continues to use every diplomatic \nmeans to force Saddam Hussein to fulfill his responsibilities to the \nworld community. I am proud this Congress voted overwhelmingly to \nendorse the ability of our President to do whatever is necessary to \nprotect America, including force, if\n\n[[Page S1696]]\n\nit is necessary, and we pray that it doesn't come to that.\n  Our President has shown courage. He has shown clarity. He has shown \nfocus in his efforts to rid the world of terrorists and others who are \nthreats to freedom. I hope all of us in this body show the same \ncourage, clarity, and focus. The health of our Nation depends on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the thoughtful discussion our \nmajority leader has given on health issues, on combating AIDS, and on \nthe need to prepare vaccines and protection against the biological \nweapons that terrorists may use. It was a very important part of the \nPresident's speech last night, and certainly there is no one more \nqualified in this body, or elsewhere, than the distinguished majority \nleader, the Senator from Tennessee, to speak about these matters.\n  Following on the State of the Union Message, some commentators were \nsaying today they wish the President had spoken more about the economy. \nHe did speak about the economy. He made it clear that his goal is to \nsee that every American who wants a job and needs a job can find one, \nand he proposed tax relief to make sure that the money is there for \nsmall businesses to expand and grow and hire more people.\n  Money for working families, for child care and health deductions on \ntheir tax returns, and putting a thousand dollars in the pocket of \nevery American family is going to make the economy move.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1696-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1696-S1697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the news has been focusing, and much of the \ndiscussion in this Chamber has been on, the threat that Iraq poses. I \nhave listened to some of my colleagues today on the question of what to \ndo about Iraq. Over and over, there is this clarion call for more time: \nmore time for inspectors to do their work; more time to enlist more \nallies; more time for Saddam Hussein to comply.\n  With all due respect, I ask them: How much is enough? We have already \nbeen at this for 12 years, 12 years since the end of the Persian Gulf \nwar. Do we need 12 more years? One more year?\n  I would like to flip the question on my colleagues and ask: How much \ntime do we have? Every minute we wait, Saddam Hussein's efforts to \nacquire weapons of mass destruction and to share them continue. Every \nminute we wait, the surviving al-Qaida terrorists plot their next \nattack. We fear it may be a weapon of mass destruction, particularly \nchemical and biological attack.\n  Sooner or later, either here or somewhere else in the world, we will \nrun out of time. We ran out of time in New York, Pennsylvania, and the \nPentagon on September 11. Brave sailors on the USS Cole ran out of \ntime. Our two embassies in Africa ran out of time in 1998. Over 200 \ninnocent victims, mostly Australians, ran out of time in a Bali, \nIndonesia, nightclub.\n  How many more attacks must we absorb before we realize that time is \nnot on our side? Where will the next attack be? Will it be against a \nsoft target? Certainly the soft targets are the ones the terrorists say \nthey want to attack. Will it be St. Louis, Kansas City, San Francisco, \nNew York, or someplace in New Hampshire or someplace in South Carolina?\n  What will it be the next time? More airplanes flown into buildings? \nProbably not. Truck bombs against sports stadiums? Suicide bombers in \ncrowds? More likely a toxin released in a subway or a skyscraper or at \na large public event.\n  Right now there are people who are sworn enemies of this Nation \nplotting the next attack. We know their intentions and, unfortunately, \nwe know their capabilities. What we do not know is their next method of \nattack, although they have a track record of intentional \nunpredictability.\n  Will they get their next weapon from Iraq? After 12 years of cat and \nmouse or rope-a-dope--whatever one wants to call it--we want to call \nSaddam Hussein's strategy of delay and deception unacceptable.\n  We cannot wait much longer. We already know too well the true nature \nof the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq. He has failed to live up to his \nobligations under the 1991 cease-fire after the gulf war. Still, some \nfriends on the other side of the aisle plead for more time. I cannot \nunderstand why anyone would plead for more time for Saddam Hussein, a \nman who has been in clear breach of U.N. obligations since 1992.\n  Specifically, Iraq has been in material breach of U.N. Resolution 687 \nwhich was passed in the spring of 1991. That resolution called upon \nIraq to ``unconditionally accept'' the destruction, removal or \nrendering harmless ``under international supervision'' of all \n``chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and all \nrelated subsystems and components of all research, development, support \nand manufacturing facilities.''\n  Some may be unable to understand that Iraq has been in material \nbreach of the U.N. obligation since 1991. Sadly, this is nothing new. \nThis latest round under U.N. Resolution 1441 was Saddam's last chance \nto get back into compliance.\n\n  Dr. Hans Blix reported to the U.N. Security Council on Monday that in \nlarge part, Saddam Hussein has failed to get back into compliance. Even \nthe Washington Post editorialized that it is an ``indisputable truth'' \nthat ``Iraq is in material breach'' of 1441. If Iraq is not complying, \nthen it must be lying.\n  Iraq has not only failed to disarm, it has worked to obstruct and \nevade international supervision. There are reports Saddam Hussein has \ntried to infiltrate the U.N. teams; that Iraq has threatened its \nscientists with death if they cooperate with U.N. inspectors; that \nIraqi security agents have posed as scientists to thwart the \ninspectors' work. Clearly, Iraq is in violation of 1441 for having \nfailed to comprehensively account for missing weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Secretary Colin Powell had it right when he said it makes no sense \nfor the inspectors to stumble around in the dark looking for evidence \nof noncompliance. It is instead Saddam Hussein's legal obligation to \nturn the lights on and turn over the goods.\n  In addition, Saddam Hussein continues to violate U.N. resolutions by \nfiring at coalition aircraft. He refused U.N. inspectors' request for \naerial surveillance, and yet some still plead for more time.\n  We have drawn so many lines in the sand that we are running out of \ndesert, we are running out of sand in which to draw lines.\n  The American people will not forgive us if another attack comes when \nwe dither with procedures and process in the corridors of the United \nNations. What do we say to the victims then? What words of comfort \ncould we possibly give to widows or children who have lost their \nparents? Can we say: I am sorry, but we had to enlist the support of \nthe French before we could act? What solace would that provide a family \nmourning a loved one lost forever?\n  What about our military troops ordered into harm's way? Every moment \nof delay allows Saddam Hussein to ready himself for battle, and the \nmore ready he is will quickly translate into higher casualties among \nU.S. and allied forces.\n  Time, regrettably, is not on our side. We know what we have to know \nto act. Indeed, I believe we would be failing our sworn obligation to \ndefend this Nation if we fail to act in light of all we know about the \nthreats we face in Iraq.\n  For all of my colleagues who are still asking for more time, I plead \nwith them to read the key findings about Iraqi weapons of mass \ndestruction efforts taken directly from the CIA's unclassified Web \nsite. It was reported there last fall.\n  We know from U.S. and British intelligence reports that have been \nmade public that since 1991, Iraq has repeatedly been caught redhanded \nlying about the extent of its missile and weapons of mass destruction \nprograms.\n  With the defection of Saddam's son-in-law, Hussein al-Kamel, in 1991, \nas head of the Iraq WMD program, he revealed the extent of the \ncontinued illegal operations in the face of sanctions and prohibitions. \nBaghdad illegally retained proscribed al-Hussein missiles and \nlaunchers. It constructed a new test engine for the development of \nmissiles capable of threatening much of the region. And it pursued \nillegal programs to procure materials for illegal development of \nlonger-range missiles. We know that if Iraq acquires sufficient weapons \ngrade material, it could\n\n[[Page S1697]]\n\nmake a nuclear weapon within a year and, as the President said last \nnight, from the British Government we know that Baghdad has sought \nsignificant quantities of uranium from Africa, despite having no active \ncivil program that could require it.\n\n  Iraq has recalled specialists to work on its nuclear programs. All \nkey aspects of Iraq's biological warfare program are still active, and \nmost elements are larger and more advanced than before the gulf war. \nIraq has begun renewed production of chemical warfare. Iraq has mobile \nlaboratories for military use, corroborating reports about the mobile \nproduction of biological weapons. Dr. Blix has corroborated much of \nU.S. and British intelligence citing unresolved disarmament issues and \ncomplaining Iraq's cooperation is not active and should not be a game \nof catch-as-catch-can.\n  Mr. President, clearly, Iraq is in material breach of its \ninternational obligations, and that should serve as a sufficient \ntrigger for forced disarmament by the international community led by \nthe U.S. and its willing allies at the appropriate time.\n  After 12 years of consistent evasion, I cannot foresee any \ncircumstance in which the Iraqi regime would now change its stripes. \nDeception is a reflex of Saddam Hussein's government, and it will \npersist until the regime is gone.\n  Iraq has had 12 years worth of opportunity to avoid war. And at every \nturn, it has chosen a course of action that is delivering us again \ntoward hostilities.\n  I believe that at this point, the only way truly to disarm Iraq is by \nforce.\n  If France does not want to go along, obviously, that is no excuse for \ninaction. Multilateralism should not stall us. We took oaths as Members \nof this body to defend this Nation against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic, not on the condition that the United Nations and France \nagree.\n  President Bush is well within his duty and obligation to defend this \nNation by the use of force against Iraq at any time now. The Risks \nbefore this Nation and the world demand that he be ready and willing to \nuse military force, with or without universal international support.\n  This is a moment of truth for our longtime allies of France and \nGermany. By their action or inaction, will they strengthen or weaken \nthe international laws that protect all our nations and citizens?\n  Obviously, it is better to have international support than to not \nhave it. But as Colin Powell said, multilaterialism should never be an \nexcuse for inaction.\n  When I took the oath as a U.S. Senator, I did not swear to defend \nthis Nation against all enemies foreign and domestic--only if the \nUnited Nations voted its approval.\n  I note the remarks of the senior Senator from Delaware yesterday who \nlamented that never in his career had he heard such disapproval from so \nmany of our allies.\n  I too am saddened by this situation. I genuinely wish it were not so.\n  But I disagree with my colleague in assuming that the root cause of \nour disagreement lies in a faulty U.S. position.\n  Why is it that so many of my colleagues prefer the judgment of our \nEuropean allies to that of our own best experts and analysts?\n  I think there is very little in the historical track record of many \nof our old European allies that inspires confidence in their ability to \nidentify and deal with threats.\n  In particular, I find little in France's history to envy with regard \nto identifying and standing up to threats.\n  Frankly, I would be worried about our course of action if the French \nwere on board in full. They have a great interest in oil. Thirty \npercent of the oil out of Iraq goes to a French oil company. That is \nnot grounds to trust them.\n  It reminds me of when one of my hometown newspapers, the St. Louis \nPost-Dispatch, editorialized in favor of something I had done. I \nimmediately told my staff that I must have taken an incorrect position \non the issue.\n  I have often found during my career that the right thing is often in \ndirect opposition to the professional stone-throwers and nay-sayers.\n  But in all seriousness, in contrast to many of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, I believe the root cause of the disagreement \nbetween some of our old European allies and the United States lies \nwithin more within the realm of political and naked economic interests \nthan with matters of national security.\n  The irony of the current situation is that American unilateralism may \nbe the last best hope of old Europe, the Middle East and the United \nNations--as it has been so many times over the last few decades.\n  Our President is on the right course. It is not the easy path. But it \nis the right one. And he deserves the support of this body and the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last evening, the distinguished \nPresident said we were not going to pass on our problems to the next \ngeneration. There has to be a time of sobriety. We have to get off of \nthis deficit binge and get to reality. The best way I know to really \nbring it to the attention of my colleagues is to go right back to \nPresident Bush coming into office. Everyone agrees and says, oh, the \nClinton era started the recession, and so it did. But in February of \n2001, right after the President had taken office, at the end of that \nmonth he acted like instead of a recession it was an economic boom. He \ntalked of $5.6 trillion in surplus, and he outlined a budget of some \n$2.6 trillion for Social Security. He was going to protect Social \nSecurity. He had another $2 trillion for tax cuts, domestic and defense \nspending, and in the year before last, he went on to say we should \nprepare for the unexpected. His budget set aside $1 trillion over 10 \nyears for additional needs. That is one trillion additional reasons \neveryone can feel comfortable supporting the budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a pertinent portion of the President's \naddress be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       My budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing \n     operations. It has funded our nation's important priorities. \n     It has protected Social Security and Medicare. And our \n     surpluses are big enough that there is still money left over.\n       Many of you have talked about the need to pay down our \n     national debt. I listened, and I agree. (Applause.) We owe it \n     to our children and grandchildren to act now, and I hope you \n     will join me to pay down $2 trillion in debt during the next \n     10 years,. (Applause.) At the end of those 10 years, we will \n     have paid down all the debt that is available to retire. \n     (Applause.) That is more debt, repaid more quickly than has \n     ever been repaid by any nation at any time in history. \n     (Applause.)\n       We should also prepare for the unexpected, for the \n     uncertainties of the future. We should approach our Nation's \n     budget as any prudent family would, with a contingency fund \n     for emergencies or additional spending needs. For example, \n     after a strategic review, we may need to increase defense \n     spending. We may need to increase spending for our farmers or \n     additional money to reform Medicare. And so, my budget sets \n     aside almost a trillion dollars over 10 years for additional \n     needs. That is one trillion reasons you can feel comfortable \n     supporting this budget. (Applause.)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. On September 6, 2001--I will never forget it--Mitch \nDaniels, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said we \nwere going to have a surplus at that time because we had passed the tax \ncut and we had actually passed the stimulus.\n  This is the Senator who forced the vote to have the stimulus in March \nof that year, because we were thinking of a $100 billion stimulus, 1 \npercent of the GDP. What happened instead? They cut it back. They did \nnot give it to the wage earners, to the payroll taxpayers, but they \ngave it to all the rich and they cut it back some 40-some-billion \ndollars and it did not work. It was passed in June, along with the tax \ncut.\n  By September 6, just before September 11, Mitch Daniels came in and \nhe projected at that particular time a surplus of $158 billion. Three \nweeks later we ended up with a deficit of $143 billion, a swing of some \n$300 billion.\n  They go into the litany now of the recession, which they never wanted \nto recognize except in debate, and corruption and, of course, the war. \nThey never want to pay for the war. The President says when we have \nwar, we are going to run deficits.\n  Getting right to the point, I asked the Congressional Budget Office \nto estimate the cost of September 11th at\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\nthat particular fiscal year 2001 and they said $34 billion, not the \n$300 billion swing from a $158 billion surplus to a $143 billion \ndeficit.\n  The President had set up his contingency of $1 trillion and talked \nabout his tax cuts in the same breath. So we had voodoo II. I will \nnever forget under President Reagan, Vice President Bush, the \nPresident's father, had called that voodoo.\n  I went to a budget meeting last evening with the new Budget \nCommittee, and I heard our distinguished chairman, the Senator from \nOklahoma, mention growth, growth. So they got into the buzz word \n``growth.'' Let me say what it grows. It grows deficits. It grows debt. \nIn 200 years of history, the cost of all the wars from the Revolution \nright on up to World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, we never \nreached a trillion dollar debt. With only the cost of the gulf war, \nwith the Saudis paying for most of it, we hardly paid the cost of the \nwar. Yet with this growth that we are going to hear about, we are \ntalking about $6.3 trillion in deficits. We grew into horrendous debt \nand horrendous interest costs as a result of voodoo, and now we have \nvoodoo II.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this chart printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          TAXES TO PAY FOR WAR\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Individual           Corporate\n               War                     increases           increases\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCivil War.......................  0-10%.............

Early last year, the President said the deficit was \ngoing to be small and short-lived. Those were his exact words. I ask \nunanimous consent to have those remarks printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Once we have funded our national security and our homeland \n     security, the final great priority of my budget is economic \n     security for the American people. (Applause.) To achieve \n     these great national objectives--to win the war, protect the \n     homeland, and revitalize our economy--our budget will run a \n     deficit that will be small and short-term, so long as \n     Congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally \n     responsible manner. (Applause.) We have clear priorities and \n     we must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have \n     shown overseas: We'll prevail in the war, and we will defeat \n     this recession. (Applause.)\n       Americans who have lost their jobs need our help and I \n     support extending unemployment benefits and direct assistance \n     for health care coverage. (Applause.) Yet, American workers \n     want more than unemployment checks--they want a steady \n     paycheck. (Applause.) When America works, America prospers, \n     so my economic security plan can be summed up in one work: \n     jobs. (Applause.)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We have been going up, up and away. These are small and \nshort-lived. They can understand the chart better upside down, but here \nis the actual fact.

US Government FY 1998; Beginning in 1962, CBO's The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2003-2012, January\n  23, 2002.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have run down all of these so-called \ndeficits and interest costs from President Truman on through President \nBush. You can find that the deficits now of Presidents Truman, \nEisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, for 6 presidents and \nalmost--in almost 30 years, the cost of World War II, the cost of \nKorea, and the cost of Vietnam, cumulative, add them all up, those \ndeficits are $358 billion. Guess what we added up--we ended up with \nthis past September? The end of the fiscal year, September 30, little \nless than 4 months ago, we ended up with a deficit of $426 billion. \nThey had estimated at that particular time it was going to be $173 \nbillion. That was a swing of some $283 billion.\n  So when they say they are not going to pass on the costs, and let's \nnot get bogged down in all of these figures around here, we are telling \nthe American GI we are going to war and we hope you do not get killed. \nBut if you are lucky enough not to get killed, come on home because we \nare going to give you the bill for the war. Have my colleagues ever \nheard of such a thing?\n  I want to remind everybody of last year, we tried our best to be \nfiscally responsible, and I commend our leader for withholding the \nbudget. They said we could not pass one. Why didn't we pass one? \nBecause we passed out the budget resolution, but if we had called up \nthat budget, they would have put on tax cuts. The distinguished Chair \nknows it because he was a member of the Budget Committee over on the \nHouse side--we would have put on reconciliation and they, with the \nmajority vote, could have passed those tax cuts. That is what we were \nholding up for. We did not want tax cuts on last year and that is why \nwe held up the budget. Listen to what the former Director of the \nbudget, Mr. David Stockman, said when he saw the disaster, the so-\ncalled growth, how are we going to grow out of it; all you do is just \ncut all your revenues.\n\n  Call up one of the Governors now with deficits--and they are trying \nto make it up--and say: Cut the taxes. They would be run out of the \nState capital. I cannot understand it. I cannot run at home unless I \npromise to pay the bill; I cannot run for the Senate unless I promise \nnot to pay the bill. It is the darndest nonsense I have ever engaged \nin. We were trying to cancel the tax cuts. But what did David Stockman \nsay about the Reagan tax cuts?\n  On page 342 in ``The Triumph of Politics'':\n\n       The President had no choice but to repeal or substantially \n     dilute the tax cut. That would have gone far toward restoring \n     the stability of the strongest capitalist economy in the \n     world. Ronald Reagan chose to be not a leader but a \n     politician. His obstinacy was destined to keep America's \n     economy hostage to the errors of his advisers for a long, \n     long time.\n\n  Voodoo 1, long, long time. We had to get President Clinton in to \nraise taxes, get the best 8 years of an economy, and now we are going \nto have not only Voodoo 2 in 2001, but now for 2003 we are going to \npass, for next year, another tax cut. It is a foregone conclusion, now \nthat the Republicans have a majority of the Senate as well as a \nmajority of the House.\n  I commend everyone to read ``The Triumph of Politics'' and see what \nthe Director of the Budget thought about that particular tax cut.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article in \nthis morning's Washington Post: 2004 Budget Likely to Show Record \nDeficits; OMB Chief Projects Annual Shortfalls of More Than $300 \nBillion for 2003-2004.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               2004 Budget Likely To Show Record Deficits\n\n\n  OMB Chief Projects Annual Shortfalls of More Than $300 Billion for \n                               2003, 2004\n\n                  (By Jonathan Weisman and Mike Allen)\n\n       The White House is likely to project record budget deficits \n     next week when President Bush releases a 2004 budget that \n     will include large tax cuts as well as big boosts in spending \n     on homeland defense, Medicare and the military.\n       In a series of telephone interviews yesterday, White House \n     Office of Management and Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels, \n     Jr. said the deficits for 2003 and 2004 would approach 3 \n     percent of the economy, or more than $300 billion a year. \n     That would surpass the 1992 record deficit of $290 billion, \n     even before the cost of a possible war with Iraq is factored \n     in. It would also be nearly triple the $109 billion deficit \n     for 2003 that was forecast by the White House six months ago.\n       ``We're about to disappear into the deepest of red ink,'' \n     said Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.VA.).\n       Still, expressed as a percentage of the gross domestic \n     product, Daniels said, a $300 billion deficit is manageable \n     and could be reversed easily if Congress and the president \n     make it a priority. ``If what the nation should care about \n     most is getting back to balance, it's no great trick to do \n     it,'' Daniels said. ``We can do it in a year or two. All we'd \n     have to do is limit spending growth to inflation and \n     undertake no new initiatives.''\n       That contention was echoed by Treasury secretary nominee \n     John W. Snow at his confirmation hearing yesterday, when he \n     said: ``There is some level of deficits that is troublesome, \n     that begins to tilt the financial markets. We're not there \n     yet. We're a long way from there.''\n       Nevertheless, the numbers appeared to put to rest any \n     prospect of a return to surpluses this decade. Two years ago, \n     the White House and the Congressional Budget Office forecast \n     a surplus of $5.6 trillion this decade. In July, the OMB \n     projected a deficit of $109 billion in 2003, declining to $48 \n     billion in 2004 before surpluses return. Now, Daniels said he \n     expects the 2004 deficit to be close to his 2003 estimate.\n       Daniels said the White House will no longer issue 10-year \n     budget projections. ``Those numbers would be, in my view, \n     worse than a wasted effort,'' he said.\n       The CBO in August projected deficits of $145 billion in \n     2003 and $111 billion in 2004. The CBO will update those \n     projections today with a relatively optimistic 2003 deficit \n     of between $165 billion and $175 billion, according to Senate \n     Republican aides. The CBO will likely project a 2004 deficit \n     of about $130 billion.\n       But unlike the White House projections, those figures do \n     not include a new round of tax cuts or the increases in \n     spending for defense, homeland security and Medicare that \n     Bush will be seeking in his new budget.\n       Daniels said the 2004 budget would propose more than $40 \n     billion more for homeland security, between a 7 percent and 8 \n     percent increase over last year. Military spending would jump \n     between 4 percent and 5 percent under the plan. Spending on \n     the rest of the government would rise between 3 percent and 4 \n     percent, Daniels said.\n       A senior administration official said Bush will also seek \n     about $400 billion over 10 years to overhaul Medicare and add \n     a prescription drug benefit for some seniors.\n\n  (Mrs. DOLE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. What we are headed for is deficits of $500 billion--if \nyou have got just $426 billion and you are already $167 billion. Let me \ninclude the debt to the penny. I want everyone to understand. Do not \ngive me all of this off budget, on budget, unified budget. Just find \nout how much you spend and how much you pay, and we can find out the \nshortfall or the deficit.\n  We are already in a shortfall this year, a little less than 4 months, \nthe public debt to the penny as of the 27th, the most recent.

There you are. We are in a heck of a fix and somewhat \nsimilar, if you please, to the situation we had with President Clinton.\n  I will never forget because I was active member and a former chairman \nof the Budget Committee. We had a $403.6 billion deficit in 1992. That \nis the big reason our distinguished President lost reelection and lost \nto that little Governor down there in Arkansas. The President was \nrunning $403.6 billion deficits. And they said: Yes, you did \nwonderfully well in the gulf war. But heavens above, you have to get \nsomeone to get ahold of it.\n  We brought the Governor up who balanced budgets. And what did the \nGovernor do? Right after his nomination, in Little Rock, he invited a \ngroup of the best financial minds down to Little Rock, sat them all \ndown, including Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve, and \nsaid: I have won now, but what is for the good of the country, what are \nwe going to do?\n  Greenspan told him: Mr. President, you not only are going to have to \ncut spending, you are going to have to increase taxes.\n  President Clinton went around the room and asked: Do you all agree \nwith that, we have to increase taxes? They said, to a man: That is what \nwe need to do. We need to cut down these deficits, cut down this debt, \nand keep up the long-term interest rates because we are not investing \nin the stock market with these horrendous interest costs, almost $1 \nbillion a day--and it is still almost $1 billion a day.\n  The first thing the Government does at 8 o'clock in the morning is go \ndown to the bank and borrow $1 billion and add it to the debt--every \nSaturday morning, every Sunday morning, and every Christmas morning. We \nhave got the debt going up, up, and away. But the President says: Don't \nworry about debt. It is a time of war.\n  I cannot agree with him on that. What happens, in time of war, is we \nbelieve in sacrifice, not just for those who are facing battle. I went \nback to the Civil War. I remember they chastised my friend Senator \nLott, and they all hail the party of Lincoln. I have heard that now, \nthat chat on the weekend shows--the party of Lincoln. Where is Abraham \nwhen we need him now? President Lincoln taxed dividends to pay for the \nwar. Go back and look at the record. He taxed dividends.\n  President Bush, instead of inviting Alan Greenspan, invited Charles \nSchwab. He said: Eliminate the tax on dividends. And we call it a \nstimulus. Come on, who is kidding whom around here? When are we going \nto sober up and understand the American people? If you are in the war, \nwe want to sacrifice and we want to at least pay for the war.\n  In World War I, we went up to 77 percent of personal income tax for \nthe highest tax bracket; World War II, up to 94 percent; the Korean \nwar, 91 percent; Vietnam, 77 percent. We are at 38.6 percent right now.\n  Instead, in the Afghan, Iraq, and terrorism wars we say: Let's cut \ntaxes. We are not going to pay for it.\n  When we are running a $6.3 trillion debt and, according to the \nmorning paper--you can interpret what Mitch Daniels says--we will be \nrunning a $500 billion deficit this year, who wants to bet? Tell them \nHollings is here. September 30 will come around, and we will add it up, \nand I will bet your boots if we get all these things for homeland \nsecurity, for AIDS, for health care, prescription drugs, and everything \nelse of that kind, and put in this tax cut, we will have a $500 billion \ndeficit. And they say: Don't worry about it.\n  Worse, they try to sell the dividend tax cut. It is wrong. You tax \nthe income of the corporation, and you tax the individual when he gets \nhis dividends.\n  I remember my distinguished friend from Texas, Phil Gramm. He stood \nover there when we were increasing taxes under President Clinton in \n1993 and could not get a single Republican vote. And Senator Gramm \nlooked at me and said: You are increasing taxes on Social Security; \nthey will be hunting you Democrats down like dogs in the street.\n  You ought to look at the record. Now we pay taxes in order to get the \nSocial Security trust fund, and then when I receive the Social Security \nbenefit, I pay taxes--double tax on Social Security. Nobody mentions \nthe Social Security tax. They all mention dividends and all the other \nthings for the rich. And they are trying to say the economy is \nrecovering when the economy is declining. You can't go along with this \nkind of tax cut here. We tried our best to stop it, and we will do our \nbest here when we show that you have taxed like this before.\n\n  I have introduced a value-added tax of 1 percent. I would like to \nhave 2 percent, but I didn't want to argue about the amount. I want to \nstart a value-added tax to pay for the war. It takes the IRS one year \nto really administer and set it into collection. During that year's \ntime, it could have no effect whatsoever on the economy. They say by \nthe next year we will have recovered. That is what they are telling us. \nSo they can't give me that argument that the value added tax will \nweaken economy this year if it is passed.\n  But I have a 1-percent VAT for the payment for the war--not for \nincreased spending, not for tax cuts or anything else, but a tax to pay \nfor the war.\n  They say their economic initiative is going to be stimulative. Let me \nget right to the point. You are not going to stimulate anything with \nthe Democratic or the Republican initiative. President Bush wants a \n$674 billion tax cut, plus the interest costs of $300 billion, plus \nextending and making permanent the tax cut they passed in 2001. All of \nthis adds up to $4 trillion. I am looking at it the way my market \nfriends look at it. They say: Heavens above, this fellow is going to \ntake $5 trillion out of the economy in the next several years; I am not \ngoing to invest. And we are going to war, and we are not paying for the \nwar. We are looking at $500 billion deficits, or more.\n  I don't know any better way to stultify this economy and make sure it \ndoesn't recover. I never heard of such things. This is the worst I have \never seen.\n  Why do I say it is not going to be a stimulus? If you just run $426 \nbillion, that is $35 billion a month. That is the deficit for just last \nyear. And then October, November, December, January--you are already up \nto $167 billion in deficits. That is $40 billion a month. We are \nspending $40 billion a month, and the President's stimulus plan of $110 \nbillion is, let's say, $10 billion a month. The Democrats', Senator \nDaschle's stimulus plan, is $143 billion, or $12 billion a month. I \ndon't think $10 billion or $12 billion a month more is going to \nstimulate this economy. You know that, and I know that. But it is \nbuying the vote and making the mistakes--the Democrats are--even \ncalling either one a stimulus.\n  There is not going to be any stimulus. It is just throwing away \nfiscal responsibility, running up the debt, and running up the interest \ncosts. I have many quotes right here with respect to where we are as a \nresult of it.\n  Let me show just exactly where we are now. For a stimulus, we are \ngoing to have one, whether we like it or not. If you listen to the \nPresident and you listen to us Democrats, we will agree with him on \nhomeland security, we will agree with him on defense, we will agree \nwith him on health care. It is just a matter of whatever it is. If you \npay for defense, $20 billion; if you pay for health care, another $40 \nbillion; if you pay for the first responders, if you pay for port \nsecurity, if you pay for rail security, if you pay for homeland\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\nsecurity, you add another $20 billion or $30 billion. If we pay the \nStates money--and we should--that is another $20 billion or $30 \nbillion.\n  That is another $120 or $130 billion stimulus we are going to be \nputting into the pipeline. We are going to be putting that out this \nyear as a stimulus without a tax cut. With the Democrats or the \nRepublicans, we are still going to be paying out $40 billion or $50 \nbillion a month that we cannot account for--we cannot pay for.\n\n  That is stimulus enough. That would send a message, we are not going \nto run $500 billion deficits, because for that amount we could pay for \nthe blooming homeland security and the war and prescription drugs and \nAIDS in Africa and all of those things we heard about last night. Fine \nbusiness. Let's go to it. But let's not fool the American people and \nsay this is going to stimulate or kick-start things. Everybody has the \nbuzz words that pollsters and consultants give them: Kick-start, and \ngrowth, and stimulate. They just throw out the words, and we have \nthrown the economy into a decline.\n  Let me show just how bad off we are. It came to my attention that the \nMaastricht Treaty says: In order to be a member of the European Union, \nthe budget deficits have to be held to 3 percent of the GDP, and the \ngross federal debt to GDP ratio has to be held to 60 percent, in order \nto assure avoidance of excessive borrowing of members. That is exactly \nthe point. They can see what fiscal responsibility is. They are not \ngoing to invest.\n  You have that fellow who runs around saying deficits don't matter \nbecause the Europeans will come over here and supplant the market and \nthey will buy. No, no, they are not going to buy. When the Europeans \nsee this, that you have 3 percent of the GDP and you have to reduce the \ngross federal debt to the GDP ratio to 60 percent--we have computed it \nhere. Turn to page 17. We can't put the entire record in here. This is \nthe Budget and Economic Outlook for Fiscal Year 2004 to 2013, just \nissued this morning by the Congressional Budget Office. You will find \non page 17 that the debt, the gross Federal debt, is $6,620 trillion \nfor 2003. And the gross domestic product is $10,756 trillion. So the \ndebt as a percent of the GDP is 61.5 percent, and that exceeds the 60 \npercent requirement.\n  We can't even join. These smart rascals around here are criticizing \nthe Europeans. We can't even get into the European Union, fiscally, as \nthis article says.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        TABLE 1-4.--CBO'S PROJECTIONS OF FEDERAL DEBT UNDER ITS ADJUSTED BASELINE\n                                                                [In billions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Actual\n                                    2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007      2008      2009      2010      2011      2012      2013\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDebt held by the public at the       3,320     3,540     3,766     3,927     4,013     4,045     4,034     3,983     3,894     3,766     3,501     3,062\n beginning of the year..........\n                                 =======================================================================================================================\nChanges to debt held by the\n public:\n    Surplus (-) or deficit......       158       199       145        73        16       -26       -65      -103      -140      -277      -451      -508\n    Other means of financing....        63        27        16        13        16        15        14        14        13        12        12        11\n                                 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total.....................       220       226       161        86        32       -11       -51       -90      -127      -265      -440      -497\n                                 =======================================================================================================================\nDebt held by the public at the       3,540     3,766     3,927     4,013     4,045     4,034     3,983     3,894     3,766     3,501     3,062     2,565\n end of the year................\n                                 =======================================================================================================================\nDebt held by government\n accounts:\n    Social Security.............     1,329     1,489     1,664     1,858     2,070     2,302     2,552     2,820     3,106     3,409     3,727     4,057\n    Other government accounts        1,329     1,364     1,447     1,546     1,660     1,780     1,907     2,038     2,174     2,315     2,463     2,615\n     \\1\\........................\n                                 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total.....................     2,658     2,854     3,112     3,404     3,730     4,082     4,459     4,858     5,280     5,724     6,190     6,671\n                                 =======================================================================================================================\nGross federal debt..............     6,198     6,620     7,039     7,417     7,776     8,116     8,442     8,752     9,046     9,225     9,251     9,236\nDebt subject to limit \\2\\.......     6,161     6,598     7,017     7,395     7,753     8,094     8,419     8,729     9,023     9,201     9,227     9,212\nMemorandum: Debt held by the          34.3      35.0      34.7      33.6      32.2      30.4      28.5      26.5      24.3      21.5      18.0      14.4\n public at the end of the year\n as a percentage of GDP.........\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Mainly the Civil Service Retirement, Military Retirement, Medicare, Unemployment Insurance, and Airport and Airway Trust Funds.\n\\2\\ Differs from gross federal debt primarily because it excludes most debt issued by agencies other than the Treasury.

We would be subject to a $20 billion to $50 billion \nfine right quickly.\n  We need to rebuild the economy. They will invest. We will get jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article in \nthis week's Business Week, on page 50.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Business Week, Feb. 3, 2003]\n\n       (By Pete Engardio, Aaron Bernstein, and Manjeet Kripalani)\n\n                        The New Global Job Shift\n\n       The sense of resignation inside Bank of America (BAC) is \n     clear from the e-mail dispatch. ``The handwriting is on the \n     wall,'' writes a veteran information-technology specialist \n     who says he has been warned not to talk to the press. Three \n     years ago, the Charlotte (N.C.)-based bank needed IT talent \n     so badly it had to outbid rivals. But last fall, his entire \n     15-engineer team was told their jobs ``wouldn't last through \n     September.'' In the past year, BofA has slashed 3,700 of its \n     25,000 tech and back-office jobs. An additional 1,000 will go \n     by March.\n       Corporate downsizings, of course, are part of the ebb and \n     flow of business. These layoffs, though, aren't just \n     happening because demand has dried up. Ex-BofA managers and \n     contractors say one-third of those jobs are headed to India, \n     where work that costs $100 an hour in the U.S. gets done for \n     $20. Many former BofA workers are returning to college to \n     learn new software skills. Some are getting real estate \n     licenses. BofA acknowledges it will outsource up to 1,100 \n     jobs to Indian companies this year, but it insists not all \n     India-bound jobs are leading to layoffs.\n       Cut to India. In dazzling new technology parks rising on \n     the dusty outskirts of the major cities, no one's talking \n     about job losses. Inside Infosys Technologies Ltd.'s (INFY) \n     impeccably landscaped 22-hectare campus in Bangalore, 250 \n     engineers develop IT applications for BofA. Elsewhere, \n     Infosys staffers process home loans for Greenpoint Mortgage \n     of Novato, Calif. Near Bangalore's airport, at the offices of \n     Wipro Ltd. (WIT), five radiologists interpret 30 CT scans a \n     day for Massachusetts General Hospital. Not far away, 26-\n     year-old engineer Dharin Shah talks excitedly about his \n     $10,000-a-year job designing third-generation mobile-phone \n     chips, as sun pours through a skylight at the Texas \n     Instrument Inc., (TXN) research center. Five years ago, an \n     engineer like Shah would have made a beeline for Silicon \n     Valley. Now, he says, ``the sky is the limit here.''\n       About 1,600 km north, on an old flour mill site outside New \n     Delhi, all four floors of Wipro Spectramind Ltd.'s sandstone-\n     and-glass building are buzzing at midnight with 2,500 young \n     college-educated men and women. They are processing claims \n     for a major U.S. insurance company and providing help-desk \n     support for a big U.S. Internet service provider--all at a \n     cost up to 60 percent lower than in the U.S. Seven Wipro \n     Spectramind staff with PhDs in molecular biology sift through \n     scientific research for Western pharmaceutical companies. \n     Behind glass-framed doors, Wipro voice coaches drill staff on \n     how to speak American English. U.S. customers like a familiar \n     accent on the other end of the line.\n       Cut again to Manila, Shanghai, Budapest, or San Jose, Costa \n     Rica. These cities--and dozens more across the developing \n     world--have become the new back offices for Corporate \n     America, Japan Inc., and Europe GmbH. Never heard of Balazs \n     Zimay? He's a Budapest architect--and just might help design \n     your future dream house. The name SGV & Co., probably means \n     nothing to you. But this Manila firm's accountants may crunch \n     the numbers the next time Ernst & Young International audits \n     your company. Even Bulgaria, Romania, and South Africa, which \n     have a lot of educated people but remain economic backwaters, \n     are tapping the global market for services.\n       It's globalization's next wave--and one of the biggest \n     trends reshaping the global economy. The first wave started \n     two decades ago with the exodus of jobs making shoes, cheap \n     electronics, and toys to developing countries. After that, \n     simple service work, like\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\n     processing credit-card receipts, and mind-numbing digital \n     toil, like writing software code, began fleeing high-cost \n     countries.\n       Now, all kinds of knowledge work can be done almost \n     anywhere. ``You will see an explosion of work going \n     overseas,'' says Forrester Research Inc., analyst John C. \n     McCarthy. He goes so far as to predict at least 3.3 million \n     white-collars jobs and $136 billion in wages will shift from \n     the U.S. to low-cost countries by 2015. Europe is joining the \n     trend, too. British banks like HSBC Securities Inc. (HBC) \n     have huge back offices in China and India; French \n     companies are using call centers in Mauritius; and German \n     multinationals from Siemens (SI) to roller-bearings maker \n     INA-Schaeffler are hiring in Russia, the Baltics, and \n     Eastern Europe.\n       The driving forces are digitization, the internet, and \n     high-sped data networks that girdle the globe. These days, \n     tasks such as drawing up detailed architectural blueprints, \n     slicing and dicing a company's financial disclosures, or \n     designing a revolutionary microprocessor can easily be \n     performed overseas. That's why Intel Inc. (INTC) and Texas \n     Instruments Inc. are furiously hiring Indian and Chinese \n     engineers, many with graduate degrees, to design chip \n     circuits. Dutch consumer-electronics giant Philips (PHG) has \n     shifted research and development on most televisions, cell \n     phones, and audio products to Shanghai. In a recent \n     PowerPoint presentation, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Senior vice-\n     President Brian Valentine--the No. 2 exec in the company's \n     Windows unit--urged managers to ``pick something to move \n     offshore today.'' In India, said the briefing, you can get \n     ``quality work at 50% to 60% of the cost. That's two heads \n     for the price of one.''\n       Even Wall Street jobs paying $80,000 and up are getting \n     easier to transfer. Brokerages like Lehman Brothers Inc. \n     (LEH) and Bear, Sterns & Co. (BSC), for example, are starting \n     to sue Indian financial analysis for number-crunching work. \n     ``A basic business tenet is that things go to the areas where \n     there is the best cost of production,'' says Ann Livermore, \n     head of services at Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), which has \n     3,300 software engineers in India. ``Now you're going to see \n     the same trends in services that happened in manufacturing.\n       The rise of globally integrated knowledge economy is a \n     blessing for developing nations. What is means for the U.S. \n     skilled labor force is less clear. At the least, many whit-\n     collar workers may be headed for a tough readjustment. The \n     unprecedented hiring binge in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin \n     America comes at a time when companies from Wall Street to \n     Silicon Valley are downsizing at home. In Silicon Valley, \n     employment in the IT sector is down by 30% since early 2001, \n     according to the nonprofit group Joint Venture Silicon \n     Valley.\n       Should the West panic? It's too early to tell. Obviously, \n     the bursting of the tech bubble and Wall Street's woes are \n     chiefly behind the layoffs. Also, any impact of offshore \n     hiring is hard to measure, since so far a tiny portion of \n     U.S. white-collar work has jumped overseas. For security and \n     practical reasons, corporations are likely to keep crucial \n     R and the bulk of back-office operations close to home. \n     Many jobs can't go anywhere because they require fact-to-face \n     contact with customers. Americans will continue to deliver \n     medical care, negotiate deals, audit local companies, and \n     wage legal battles. Talented, innovative people will adjust \n     as they always have.\n       Indeed, a case can be made that the U.S. will see a net \n     gain from this shift--as with previous globalization waves. \n     In the 1990s, Corporate America had to import hundreds of \n     thousands of immigrants to ease engineering shortages. Now, \n     by sending routine service and engineering tasks to nations \n     with a surplus of educated workers, the U.S. labor force and \n     capital can be redeployed to higher-value industries and \n     cutting-edge R ``Silicon Valley doesn't need to have all \n     the tech development in the world,'' says Doug Henton, \n     president of Collaborative Economics in Mountview, Calif. \n     ``We need very good-paying jobs. Any R that is routine can \n     probably go.'' Silicon Valley types already talk about the \n     next wave of U.S. innovation coming from the fusion of \n     software, nanotech, and life sciences.\n       Globalization should also keep services prices in check, \n     just as it did with clothes, appliances, and home tools when \n     manufacturing went offshore. Companies will be able to keep \n     shaving overhead costs and improving efficiency. ``Our \n     comparative advantage may shift to other fields,'' says City \n     University of New York economist Robert E. Lipsey, a trade \n     specialist. ``And if productivity is high, then the U.S. will \n     maintain a high standard of living.'' By spurring economic \n     development in nations such as India, meanwhile, U.S. \n     companies will have bigger foreign markets for their goods \n     and services.\n       For companies adept at managing a global workforce, the \n     benefits can be huge. Sure, entrusting administration and R \n     to far-flung foreigners sounds risky. but Corporate America \n     already has become comfortable hiring outside companies to \n     handle everything from product design and tech support to \n     employee benefits. Letting such work cross national \n     boundaries isn't a radical leap. Now, American Express (AXP), \n     Dell Computer (DELL), Eastman Kodak (EK), and other companies \n     can offer round-the-clock customer care while keeping costs \n     in check. What's more, immigrant Asian engineers in the U.S. \n     labs of TI, IBM (IBM), and Intel for decades have played a \n     big, hidden role in American tech breakthroughs. The \n     difference now is that Indian and Chinese engineers are \n     managing R teams in their home countries, General Electric \n     Co. (GE), for example, employs some 6,000 scientists and \n     engineers in 10 foreign countries. GE Medical Services \n     integrates magnet, flat-panel, and diagnostic imaging \n     technologies from labs in China, Israel, Hungary, France, and \n     India in everything from its new X-ray devices to $1 million \n     CT scanners. ``The real advantage is that we can tap the \n     world's best talent,'' says GE medical Global Supply Chain \n     Vice-President Dee Miller.\n       That's the good side of the coming realignment. There are \n     hazards as well. During previous go-global drives, many \n     companies ended up repatriating manufacturing and design work \n     because they felt they were losing control of core businesses \n     or found them too hard to coordinate. In a recent Gartner \n     Inc. survey of 900 big U.S. companies that outsource IT \n     work offshore, a majority complained of difficulty \n     communicating and meeting deadlines. As a result, predicts \n     Gartner Inc. Research Director Frances Karamouzis, many \n     newcomers will stumble in the first few years as they \n     begin using offshore service workers.\n       A thornier question: What happens if all those displaced \n     white-collar workers can't find greener pastures? Sure, tech \n     specialists, payroll administrators, and Wall Street analysts \n     will land new jobs. But will they be able to make the same \n     money as before? It's possible that lower salaries for \n     skilled work will outweight the gains in corporate \n     efficiency. ``If foreign countries specialize in high-skilled \n     areas where we have an advantage, we could be worse off,'' \n     says Harvard University economist Robert Z. Lawrence, a \n     prominent free-trade advocate. ``I still have faith that \n     globalization will make us better off, but it's no more than \n     faith.''\n       If the worries prove valid, that could reshape the \n     globalization debate. Until now, the adverse impact of free \n     trade has been confined largely to blue-collar workers. But \n     if more politically powerful middle-class Americans take a \n     hit as white-collar jobs move offshore, opposition to free \n     trade could broaden.\n       When it comes to developing nations, however, it's hard to \n     see a downside. Especially for those countries loaded with \n     college grads who speak Western languages, outsourced white-\n     collar work will likely contribute to economic development \n     even more than new factories making sneakers or mobile \n     phones. By 2008 in India, IT work and other service exports \n     will generate $57 billion in revenues, employ 4 million \n     people, and account for 7 percent of gross domestic product, \n     predicts a joint study by McKinsey & Co. and Nasscom, an \n     Indian software association.\n       What makes this trend so viable is the explosion of college \n     graduates in low-wage nations. In the Philippines, a country \n     of 75 million that churns out 380,000 college grads each \n     year, there's an oversupply of accountants trained in U.S. \n     accounting standards. India already has a staggering 520,000 \n     IT engineers, with starting salaries of around $5,000. U.S. \n     schools produce only 35,000 mechanical engineers a year; \n     China graduates twice as many. ``There is a tremendous pool \n     of well-trained people in China,'' says Johan A. van \n     Splunter, Philips' Asia chief executive.\n       William H. Gates III, for one, is dipping into that pool. \n     Although Microsoft started later than many rivals, it is \n     moving quickly to catch up. In November, Chairman Gates \n     announced his company will invest $400 million in India over \n     the next three years. That's on top of the $750 million it's \n     spending over three years on R and outsourcing in China. At \n     the company's Beijing research lab, one-third of the 180 \n     programmers have PhDs from U.S. universities. The group \n     helped develop the ``digital ink'' that makes handwriting \n     show up on Microsoft's new tablet PCs and submitted four \n     scientific papers on computer graphics at last year's \n     prestigious Siggraph conference in San Antonio. Hyderabad, \n     India, meanwhile, is key to Microsoft's push into business \n     software.\n       This is no sweatshop work. Just two years out of college, \n     Gaurav Daga, 22, is India project manager for software that \n     lets programs running on Unix-based computers interact \n     smoothly with Windows applications. Daga's $11,000 salary is \n     a princely sum in a nation with a per capita annual income of \n     $500, where a two-bedroom flat goes for $125 a month. \n     Microsoft is adding 10 Indians a month to its 150-engineer \n     center and indirectly employs hundreds more at IT \n     contractors. ``It's definitely a cultural change to use \n     foreign workers,'' says Sivaramakichenane Somasegar, \n     Microsoft's vice-president for Windows engineering. ``But if \n     I can save a dollar, hallelujah.''\n       Corporations are letting foreign operations handle internal \n     finances as well. Procter & Gamble Co.'s (PG) 650 Manila \n     employees, most of whom have business and finance degrees, \n     help prepare P's tax returns around the world. ``All the \n     processing can be done here, with just final submission done \n     to local tax authorities'' in the U.S. and other countries, \n     says Arun Khanna, P's Manila-based Asia accounting \n     director.\n       Virtually every sector of the financial industry is \n     undergoing a similar revolution. Processing insurance claims, \n     selling stocks, and analyzing companies can all be done in \n     Asia for one-third to half of the cost in the U.S. or Europe. \n     Wall Street investment banks and brokerages, under mounting \n     pressure to offer independent research to investors, are \n     buying equity analysis, industry reports, and summaries of \n     financial disclosures from outfits such as Smart Analyst Inc. \n     and\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\n     OfficeTiger that employ financial analysts in India. By \n     mining databases over the Web, offshore staff can scrutinize \n     an individual's credit history, access corporate public \n     financial disclosures, and troll oceans of economic \n     statistics. ``Everybody these days is drawing on the same \n     electronic reservoir of data,'' says Ravi Aron, who teaches \n     management at the Wharton School at the University of \n     Pennsylvania.\n       Architectural work is going global, too. Fluor Corp. (FLR) \n     of Aliso Viejo, Calif., employs 1,200 engineers and draftsmen \n     in the Philippines, Poland, and India to turn layouts of \n     giant industrial facilities into detailed specs and \n     blueprints. For a multibillion-dollar petrochemical plant \n     Fluor is designing in Saudi Arabia, a job requiring 50,000 \n     separate construction plans, 200 young Filipino engineers \n     earning less than $3,000 a year collaborate in real time with \n     elite U.S. and British engineers making up to $90,000 via Web \n     portals. The principal Filipino engineer on plumbing \n     design, 35-year-old Art Aycardo, pulls down $1,100 a \n     month--enough to buy a Mitsubishi Lancer, send his three \n     children to private school, and take his wife on a recent \n     U.S. trip. Fluor CEO Alan Boeckmann makes no apologies. At \n     a recent meeting in Houston, employees asked point-blank \n     why he is sending high-paying jobs to Manila. His \n     response: The Manila operation knocks up to 15 percent off \n     Fluor's project prices. ``We have developed this into a \n     core competitive advantage,'' Boeckmann says.\n       It's not just a game for big players: San Francisco \n     architect David N. Marlatt farms our work on Southern \n     California homes selling for $300,000 to $1 million. He fires \n     off two-dimensional layouts to architect Zimay's PC in \n     Budapest. Two days later, Marlatt gets back blueprints and 3-\n     D computer models that he delivers to the contractor. Zimay \n     charges $18 an hour, vs. the up to $65 Marlatt would pay in \n     America. ``In the U.S., it is hard to find people to do this \n     modeling,'' Zimay says. ``But in Hungary, there are too many \n     architects.''\n       So far, white-collar globalization probably hasn't made a \n     measurable dent in U.S. salaries. Still, it would be a \n     mistake to dismiss the trend. Consider America's 10 million-\n     strong IT workforce. In 2000, senior software engineers were \n     offered up to $130,000 a year, says Matt Milano, New York \n     sales manager for placement firm Atlantic Partners. The same \n     job now pays up to $100,000. Entry-level computer help-desk \n     staffers would fetch about $55,000 then. Now they get as \n     little as $35,000. ``Several times a day, clients tell me \n     they are sending this work off shore,'' says Milano. \n     Companies that used to pay such IT service providers as IBM, \n     Accenture (ACN), and Electronic Data Service (EDS) $200 a \n     hour now pay as little as $70, says Vinnie Mirchandani, CEO \n     of IT outsourcing consultant Jetstream Group. One reason, \n     besides the tech crash itself, is that Indian providers like \n     Wipro, Inforsys, and Tata charge as little as $20. That's why \n     Accenture and EDS, which had few staff in India three years \n     ago, will have a few thousand each by next year.\n       Outsourcing experts say the big job migration has just \n     begun. ``This trend is just starting to crystallize now \n     because every chief information officer's top agenda item is \n     to cut budget,'' says Gartners Karamouzis. Globalization \n     trailblazers, such as GE, AmEx, and Citibank (C), has spent a \n     decade going through the learning curve and now are ramping \n     up fast. More cautious companies--insurers, utilities, and \n     the like--are entering the fray. Karamouzis expects 40 \n     percent of America's top 1,000 companies will at least have \n     no overseas pilot project under way within two years. The \n     really big offshore push won't be until 2010 or so, she \n     predicts, when global white-collar sourcing practices are \n     standardized.\n       If big layoffs result at home, corporations and Washington \n     may have to brace for a backlash. Already, New Jersey \n     legislators are pushing a bill that would block the state \n     from outsourcing public jobs overseas. At Boeing Co. (BA), an \n     anxious union is trying to ward off more job shifts to the \n     aircraft maker's new 350-person R center in Moscow (page \n     42).\n       The truth is, the rise of the global knowledge industry is \n     so recent that most economists haven't begun to fathom the \n     implications. For developing nations, the big beneficiaries \n     will be those offering the speediest and cheapest telecom \n     links, investor-friendly policies, and ample college grads. \n     In the West, it's far less clear who will be the big winners \n     and losers. But we'll soon find out.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. ``Is your job next?'' I have been at this 36 going on \n37 years now. We said we were going to create so many jobs when we had \nNAFTA. We have lost exactly 57,100 jobs in textiles alone in the State \nof South Carolina since NAFTA--57,100.\n  We have lost 2 million jobs since President Bush took office. He \nsaid: My economic plan last year is encapsulated in one word--jobs. So \nhe got fast track. Everybody, as this article shows, headed to China. \nNot just the smokestack jobs, but the service jobs. Not just the \nservice jobs, but the high-tech jobs.\n  What we need to do, like President Nixon, is take those States where \nwe have a deficit in the balance of trade and put in a 10-percent \nimport surcharge. I was here when we did it. We went around with \nSenator Mansfield to explain it to all the heads of state--nine \ncountries in Europe--that is what we ought to do: We ought to hold up \non this Eximbank financing the building of your plants. Because if you \ndid get the economy going, it is not going in America, instead it is \ncreating jobs in downtown Shanghai.\n  Right to the point, we ought to enforce 301. We ought to do away with \nthat Bermuda thing. I am talking fast because my time has reached the \nendpoint here. But right to the point here, we have to start rebuilding \na competitive trade policy, on the one hand, and get ahold of ourselves \nlike the Governors and the mayors, and start paying the bill and cut \nout this nonsense about tax cuts stimulating.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1703-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1703-S1704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL SECURITY AND OUR ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the President of the United States \nstated that America faces decisive days for our economic and national \nsecurity needs. He has called for strong steps and unity to make \nAmerica stronger and prosperous.\n  From this call, will America get the leadership from its elected \nofficials or will it, instead, get just partisan rancor? We all hope \nfor the former but begin to suspect the latter.\n  No one can imagine the awesome responsibility and burden of \nprotecting the lives of millions of Americans and defending the free \nworld. With such a daunting challenge as protecting American lives, I \nhave deferred to the judgment of the President, whether a Democrat or a \nRepublican.\n  On September 11, 2001, that challenge became immeasurably greater. An \nunimaginable act of evil changed the world of today, tomorrow, and for \ndecades ahead. Yet only the President seems to have taken to heart that \nthe matrix of terror has multiplied.\n  The options and choices and avenues for a terrorist to strike at \nAmerica are almost beyond human comprehension. The President must not \nonly comprehend these new terrorist risks to America, but he also must \ndefend against them. Of all terrorist threats to America and the world, \nis any greater than the terrorists of al-Qaida employing the modern, \ndestructive weapons of Saddam Hussein?\n  If outlaw regimes and suicide terrorists conspire, entire cities--\nentire cities--not just buildings are at risk and millions, rather than \nthousands, of lives could be lost.\n  The time when America could sleep and let outlaw regimes fester is \nover. But before the President can prevent this murderous alliance, \nmany in this Chamber say they need proof. They do not demand proof that \na ruthless terrorist-supporting despot has disarmed, as required by the \nU.N. over a decade ago. Instead, they demand proof from our President \nthat Iraq is still armed.\n  The proof is in, and the President has provided more. U.N. and U.S. \nintelligence report that for a dozen years Iraq has had materials to \nproduce 26,000 liters of anthrax, 38,000 liters of botulism, 500 tons \nof sarin, mustard and VX nerve gas, and 30,000 munitions capable of \ndelivering chemical agents.\n  He has used these weapons of mass destruction against his own people. \nAnd the U.N. says there is no proof that Iraq has rid itself of these \nchemical and biological weapons. Yet we are told the President must \nshow proof.\n  Iraqi defectors tell of mobile biological labs, but we need more \nproof, they say. U-2 surveillance planes over Iraq are blocked, but the \ncritics say more proof is needed.\n  Iraqi security officers intimidate and threaten the lives and \nfamilies of cooperative scientists, but the critics say more proof is \nneeded.\n  In the past, such demands for more proof, in the face of overwhelming \nevidence, have been fully answered with such notable events as the \ninvasion of Poland in 1939 and the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. The \nprice of that proof was measured in millions of lives.\n\n[[Page S1704]]\n\n  What price of proof will America pay before we act? The President \nsays the price will be a day of horror like none we have ever known.\n  As the President does everything to prevent that day, too many see \nthe U.N. inspections as a game of hide and seek rather than life and \ndeath, which is the issue that it is. So that is really what is before \nus with regard to Iraq.\n  With regard to economic growth, economic security for working \nAmericans and hope for those unemployed will not come from growing the \nGovernment but only from growing the economy. To get the economy \ngrowing--to create a job for every man and woman seeking employment--\nthe President has proposed broad tax relief for 92 million taxpayers at \nan average of $1,100 each.\n  The President's plan will increase the reward Americans receive for \nworking, producing, saving, and investing--everything that is part of a \ngrowing economy. Small businesses, married couples, families with \nchildren, and retirees will all be the individual beneficiaries. But \nthe biggest winner will be the U.S. economy. For 40 years, every tax \nrelief proposal saw its opponents try to divide and conquer taxpayers \nwith claims of ``tax breaks for the rich.'' And again this year is no \ndifferent.\n  What specific part of the President's plan do they object to? Do they \nwant to penalize marriage for a few more years? Do they think parents \nwith kids should wait longer for the $1,000-per-child tax credit? \nShould the tax rate reductions be delayed along with the incentives to \ngrow the economy? Some of our colleagues across the aisle supported \nthese changes last year, but it seems there is always some reason now \nis the wrong time for tax relief. In fact, I cannot remember when there \nwas a right time for tax relief, listening to our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. So it is always the wrong time. It is always \nno, maybe later, or it is, yes, but not now for you, or you, or you.\n  We hear a lot of talk about the stock market. But it sounds as if we \nare talking about the weather. Everybody talks about it and complains \nbut no one wants to do anything about it. The President does something \nabout it by ending double taxation of dividends. His plan will get the \nstock market growing again, but we have no Democratic plan for the \nstock market, other than to complain. If the President's opponents \nwould show the same determination to grow the economy as they do in \ngrowing the Government--as we saw here on the floor of the Senate just \nover the last couple of weeks with amendments offered and, thankfully, \ndefeated, that would have added in excess of $300 billion to the \ndeficit--America would be in fine shape. Over the last 2 weeks, as I \njust indicated, our friends on the other side of the aisle forced votes \non new spending that would have paid for almost half of the President's \ntax cut. Other spending add-ons that were offered, but not voted on, \nprobably doubled that amount. The President's opponents have called for \na $300 tax rebate for individuals and up to two children. So much for \nno child left behind.\n  Now, if we had a budget surplus and the economy was humming along, \nfine, I would support a broad rebate. But today we need to get the \neconomy going again; we need to prime the pump, not splash limited \nresources around in a manner that does nothing to grow the economy.\n  When it comes to our national and economic security, the world \nchanged on 9/11 and, more than anyone else, the President has realized \nthis. His determination to stamp out the outlaw regime of Saddam \nHussein is the President's realization that the threat to national \nsecurity today is far greater than it was prior to 9/11. For national \nsecurity, we need to do more than we have done before. His \ndetermination to enact an economic growth package is based on the \nPresident's understanding that the impact to our economy from the 9/11 \nattack was far greater than anyone imagined.\n  For economic security, we need to do more than we have done before. \nHe knows we need to do more, and the American people know it, too. The \nonly question is when will this Congress figure out that the world has \nchanged and catch up?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was privileged to be present last night \nat the President's State of the Union Address. Earlier today, I said \nthe State of the Union Address was delivered magnificently, in a way \nthat I think touched the hearts and souls of millions of Americans. \nCertainly this heart and soul was deeply touched. I was very proud for \nthe manner in which the President delivered that message--with \nsincerity, calmness, and confidence. It happened to be my 25th State of \nthe Union Message. For a quarter of a century I have been privileged to \nrepresent the great State of Virginia and be a part of this \ninstitution. I have never been more proud of any President at any time \nthan I was of George Bush last night.\n  I want to address those very clear remarks with regard to the state \nof the world and, most specifically, the leadership that our Nation has \ngiven in the worldwide fight against terrorism. We are committed, and \ncommitted until the end, and the end is nowhere in sight. We made great \nprogress. The President detailed that progress. We have much more \nprogress to make. I am very pleased over the creation of the Department \nof Homeland Security. I have been a strong supporter of that from the \nbeginning. I remember, before the White House staff decided we should \nmove in that direction, I was among those, with many others in the \nChamber, who advocated that we move in the direction to create a \nseparate Department. We have done that. We have selected a fine \nSecretary and two of his first deputies to take up the heavy \nresponsibilities. It is my hope that we will give it strong support in \nthis Chamber, that we will give it strong financial support in terms of \nappropriations.\n  We must guard against a competitive battle between the Department of \nHomeland Security and the Department of Defense, because homeland \nsecurity begins on the far-flung battlefields of the world. Today, it \nis Afghanistan and Indonesia; it is all across the world. And to the \nextent that we can defeat the efforts of any one, two, three, or four \ngroups of individuals who, through the mechanism of terrorism wish to \nbring harm against the United States, let us hope we can do that in the \nfar-flung lands of the world. That is homeland defense. That is the \nprincipal responsibility of the Department of Defense, with our troops \nin forward projection. They are to deter, first and foremost, to stop, \ndiscourage before it starts, any attack against the United States; but \nshould that attack occur, then engage.\n  We have seen the heroism of the men and women of our Armed Forces, \ntogether with the Armed Forces of other nations in Afghanistan. While \nthat operation is by no means complete--and certainly in the last few \ndays we witnessed another outbreak of hostilities--we are making steady \nprogress.\n  As we approach our budgetary responsibilities of the Department of \nDefense, and now the new Department of Homeland Security, we don't want \nto see a competition and a push-pull. Each is deserving of our full and \nstrongest measure of attention and, eventually, authorizations and \nappropriations. I hope to take a strong lead in that effort.\n  Returning to the remarks of our great President last night, he \noutlined the steps we have taken thus far with regard to the enormity \nof the threats posed by Iraq, most particularly under the leadership of \nSaddam Hussein, and recited what we have done. The President did not \nhave to come to the Congress of the United States, but he did come to \nthe Congress, and he received an overwhelming vote of approval--77 \ncolleagues, I among them as one of the coauthors of the resolution--77 \nstrong votes.\n  He has now indicated further steps he is taking, working with the \ncommunity of nations in the world--the United Nations and other nations \nsuch as Great\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\nBritain, Great Britain having taken a strong leadership role. He will \nbe meeting with the Prime Minister of Great Britain in the coming days, \ntalking regularly with heads of state in government worldwide in an \neffort to strengthen the already strong coalition of those nations \nwilling, if force is necessary, to use force, to join us in support.\n  The President has always said war is the last option. He reiterated \nthat last night. Quite clearly, the steps he is taking, this weekend \nwith heads of state in government, by sending our distinguished \nSecretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations to, once again, \nundertake the persuasion, which he has brilliantly displayed to date, \nare required among various nations in the course that is right and the \ncourse that is just and the course that will preserve the integrity of \nthe United Nations as an organization.\n  Saddam Hussein has thumbed his nose at that organization for 12 \nyears, defied all the resolutions, even kicked the inspectors out, \ninspectors who were there pursuant to resolutions of the Security \nCouncil. That is a sad and distressing record, and we would not be \nwhere we are today with the world focusing on this situation, with the \nUnited Nations Security Council meeting, acting, and passing Resolution \n1441, which is good and tough, had it not been for the leadership of \nour President working with Prime Minister Tony Blair and other heads of \nstate in government.\n  We owe our leaders a great debt because there may be a legitimate \ndiscussion about certain aspects of the policy on Iraq--and I welcome \nthat debate; I think it strengthens our resolve--but there can be no \ndispute that Saddam Hussein possesses these weapons of mass \ndestruction, has used them in the past, and today he is in absolute \ndefiance of Resolution 1441.\n  An impartial observer, Hans Blix, charged with the mission of \nconducting the inspections under the resolution has now reported to the \nUnited Nations and reported to the whole world about the continuous \nnoncompliance, lack of cooperation by Saddam Hussein.\n  Let me read a part of the Blix report. In Mr. Blix's words:\n\n       Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance, not \n     even today, of the disarmament that was demanded of it and \n     which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the \n     world and live in peace.\n\n  Saddam Hussein has the power this afternoon, tomorrow, as he had for \nthe 2 months of the inspections, to comply with Resolution 1441 and \navoid even the threat, much less the actuality, of the use of force. \nBut he has been defiant day after day, night after night, and I commend \nMr. Blix and his organization for doing their best and for putting \nforward to the United Nations and the Security Council and, indeed, \nthe whole world a very frank and candid report.\n\n  Again, our President continues to work within the framework of \nnations seeking a course referred to as diplomacy to try to avoid the \nuse of force, to try to have compliance with the security resolution.\n  For 12 years, he has defied the United Nations, and subsequent to \nResolution 1441 we have had these 2 months or so of inspections. Again, \nI commend you, Mr. President, for the calmness, for the confidence, and \nfor the wisdom to continue on the course that you established, on the \ncourse that 77 of the colleagues in this Chamber strongly backed, but \nat the same time, Mr. President, reminding Saddam Hussein and reminding \nthe world that diplomacy can be no stronger than the resolve of the \nnations to enforce it, and that resolve is there.\n  In the words of the President, let there be no doubt, he will not let \nthe security interests of this Nation or those of our principal allies \nand friends be put in peril by Saddam Hussein and his inventory of \nweapons of mass destruction if diplomacy fails.\n  No timetable was established. Again, step by step he is proceeding \nthrough a process that is very important.\n  I draw a contrast to what happened in 1991. Again, I was privileged \nto be the coauthor of that resolution. At the time, I was, with Senator \nDole, one of the floor managers on this side of that historic debate. \nMind you, we had some 500,000 men and women of the United States in \nposition in the gulf region. We had a coalition of at least 12 nations \nwith combatant troops that were going to join. This Chamber had its \nhistoric debate and, by a mere margin of five votes, was the resolution \napproved. Action was taken, and, very quickly and properly, the Members \nof this Chamber rallied behind the President and rallied behind the \ntroops.\n  We have troops today and will have troops tomorrow, as they did \nyesterday and the day before, leaving their families, leaving their \nhomes, leaving their military assignments in the United States, \nindividually and as units, and being forward deployed. Those forward \ndeployments are essential because they back up the resolve of those \ntrying to settle this matter diplomatically through a group of nations. \nWere it not for those deployments and the announcement by Great Britain \nand, indeed, some others to contribute forces, a lot of the rhetoric, a \nlot of the effort would simply not send a message to Saddam Hussein.\n  I wish to commend our President. I notice there has recently been a \nstatement to the effect that some of our colleagues might believe we \nshould at this time, which surprises me--we want to stand solidly \nbehind our President at this time as he continues his work with the \nheads of state in government; as our Secretary of State once again goes \nto the United Nations, we want to stand solidly behind him. But yet our \ncolleague, Mr. Kennedy, issued a release yesterday which said:\n\n       Much has changed in the many months since Congress debated \n     war with Iraq.\n\n  I think the inspectors have diligently worked hard. Some could say \nprogress is being made. But stop to think of the progress that would \nhave been made had Saddam Hussein just complied with Resolution 1441 \nand shown the inspectors where his arsenal was located, such that it \ncould be verified, such that it could be audited and eventually \ndestroyed. If we are to undertake debate, whether it is today or \ntomorrow, as indicated by my distinguished friend and colleague who \nserves on the Armed Services Committee, the first question I put is: Is \nthe debate timely in terms of the steps our President committed to \ntake, and has taken, this week and next week? Is the time of such a \ndebate helpful to our President?\n\n  Second, he says much has changed. Is there any indication Saddam \nHussein has done one thing to comply with the most recent Resolution \n1441, much less the resolutions of the 12 previous years? As an \nindividual Senator, I have worked and attended almost all the briefings \non this subject. I have participated in most of the debates. I have not \nseen a Senator bring to the forefront clear and convincing evidence \nthat Saddam Hussein has done anything to comply with the terms of \nResolution 1441. If anything, he has taken steps to thwart the efforts \nof the inspectors, to impede them.\n  This type of inspection regime is not new. It was implemented in \nSouth Africa successfully. It was implemented in the Ukraine \nsuccessfully. So there is a track record with the United Nations that \nis well known in the field of diplomacy and among the nations of the \nworld, but that does not have any parallel to what Saddam Hussein has \nsteadfastly refused to do. He has not budged an inch to comply with the \ncurrent Security Council resolutions.\n  That would be the second question I pose to Mr. Kennedy or other \ncolleagues were they to come to the Chamber. Is it timely? Show me what \nSaddam Hussein has done to merit this further consideration, either by \ndebate or otherwise in this Chamber.\n  Time is not on our side. I am not suggesting I can set a timetable. \nUnder the Constitution, that is the prerogative of the President of the \nUnited States, in accordance with those provisions which say that the \nexecutive branch shall negotiate. The executive branch sets the foreign \npolicy of this country. We have the right to disagree, but they set the \nforeign policy. And the President did that last night.\n  It is clear to me that every day that goes by, Saddam Hussein has the \nability to take these weapons of mass destruction, which nobody \ndisagrees he has--Hans Blix pointed it out clearly--and proliferate \nthem around the world, and not necessarily by truckloads. A very small \nvial, one, two, or three dozen, can be distributed into the hands of a \nterrorist network. Those vials can make their way back and do untold \nharm to free citizens in the world. He has ability to disperse tons\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\nof anthrax. Two envelopes directed at this very Senate Chamber, which \nwere never opened, resulted in tragic loss of life by postal workers \nand others. That was just two little envelopes, not vials, not tons, \nwhich he possesses.\n  These are the threats that concern me. Time is not on our side. It is \non Saddam Hussein's side. So I welcome the debate, if it is to come, \nand I hope those questions which I have posed today can be answered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, throughout the day today there has been a \nlot of discussion of the President's State of the Union Message. I was \ninterested in the comment that was in the press this morning that said \nthe President gave two speeches.\n  The first one has been virtually forgotten. The first one was on our \ndomestic issues, on our economy, on what we need to do to deal with \nsome of our problems at home. I think the Senator from Virginia has \nappropriately and properly addressed the question of the second speech \nwhich had to do with Iraq, but since much of the rhetoric we have heard \ntoday has had to do with the deficit and attacks on the President's \nfirst speech, I will take a few minutes to go back to that first \nspeech, that forgotten speech, the first half of the President's \nstatement on the state of the Union, and talk about some economic \nimpact of what would happen if we were to do what the President wanted \nus to do.\n  From the rhetoric we have heard today, all of our problems stem from \none thing and one thing only, and that is the tax cut that passed very \nstrongly in this Chamber and in the other body when the Presidency of \nGeorge W. Bush began. If we had only not passed that tax cut, we would \nnot have a deficit. If we had only not passed that tax cut, we would \nhave enough money to fund everything. If we had only not passed that \ntax cut, somehow Medicare would be taken care of as far as the eye can \nsee and Social Security would be secure forever. Everything stems from \nthat terrible tax cut.\n  I remind us once again of a few fairly basic, fundamental truths.\n  We can choose, at least for a time, what level of expenditures we \nwill have in the Federal Government. We can get carried away with our \nability to make pledges for expenditures, and we can set the level \nwherever we want. We cannot choose, by legislative fiat, the level of \nrevenue that will come to pay for that level of expenditure, because \nthe level of revenue goes up and down as the economy prospers or \nfalters.\n  I have seen examples of countries in Africa that laid out a budget of \nexpenditures that was absolutely marvelous in all of the benefits that \nwould come from their government spending on this and that and the \nother thing. Anything that anybody wanted, the government promised to \ntake care of them. But they discovered the fundamental truth I have \njust stated: They could set the level of expenditures pretty much where \nthey wanted, but with their economy not producing any money their level \nof taxation came nowhere near the level of expenditure. We must ask \nourselves, what is going to happen to the economy if the proposal that \nthe President's tax cut be repealed should pass? That question was put \nto Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and he \nanswered in a way that requires a little careful attention, because \nsome people picked up on his answer and said: Aha, Greenspan has said \nthere will be no economic impact if the tax cuts are repealed.\n  This is what he actually said--I do not have his exact words to \nquote, but in effect he said the markets have already assumed the tax \ncut will stay and indeed will be made permanent. Therefore, there is no \nfurther stimulus to come out of these tax cuts.\n  So everybody says the tax cuts were not stimulative. However, he went \non to say--and this paragraph they do not quote--if they were now \nrepealed, the markets would react negatively. Having made the \nassumption that they will be permanent, the market would react \nnegatively and the economy would be hurt.\n\n  I raise that bit of history because I ask this rhetorical question: \nIf the market has already assumed the tax cuts and acted favorably and \npositively to that assumption, what would happen if those tax cuts were \nnot repealed, as some people in this Chamber charge, but were produced \nmore rapidly, accelerated, rather than repealed? I think the market \nwould respond positively. Say our first assumption that says they are \ngoing to remain permanent is not only proven valid by this but we will \nhave the permanence come more rapidly than we thought.\n  If the markets as a whole respond positively, if the economy as a \nwhole responds positively, what does that do to tax revenue? It \nincreases tax revenue so we can begin to have enough dollars to deal \nwith the challenges of the expenditure side.\n  I am a member of the Appropriations Committee. I remember attending \nthe conference on the final appropriations bill--not this year because \nthis year we did not get one until the new Congress convened; we did \nnot have a final conference at the end of the last Congress. It was the \nfinal conference the year before where Senator Stevens came in and said \nthis is the number that we have all agreed on for total appropriations \nand expenditures. It was substantially higher than the number where we \nbegan. He laid it on the table and said: This is the number. Even \nthough it is significantly higher than we thought we would have and \nexpenditures more than we thought, this is where we will be. Mr. Obey, \nthe ranking member on the House side, said that number is not high \nenough.\n  The number was a very significant increase over the previous year, \nsubstantially more than the growth in the population, substantially \nmore than any inflation, but that became the number. We finally passed \nit this way in order to get out, and then we started the next year.\n  At that period, Democrats were in charge of this Chamber and the \nspending went up significantly from that number. That is the new \nbaseline. We have seen in this Congress attempts made to take that \nbaseline even higher.\n  The most significant thing the President had to say about our long-\nterm economic health in last night's speech had nothing to do with the \ntax proposals. The most significant thing he had to say is: My budget \nwill hold the spending increase to 4 percent. If we can hold the \nspending increase to 4 percent after years of 7 percent and 9 percent, \none on top of the other, to establish a very high baseline for further \nincreases, it will be something of a miracle. But it will be far more \nimportant than all of the other rhetoric we have heard on the tax side. \nIf we can't get the spending under control, we cannot under any \ncircumstances raise the taxes to cover it. That is a fundamental truth \nthat we should remember over and over again.\n  In concluding, I repeat something I have said here many times, but I \nhave discovered in the Senate there is no such thing as reputation. \nEverything is said as if it is brand new. But it is a fundamental truth \nwe should understand over and over again. Money does not come from the \nbudget. Money does not come from legislation. Money comes into the \nGovernment from the productivity of the American economy. If we can \nmake the economy strong, if we can make the economy grow, we will have \nthe tax dollars that we need to pay for our expenditures. If we ignore \nthe health of the economy and then get carried away with our desire to \nincrease our expenditures, we will end up in fulfillment of the dire \npredictions we are hearing. That is not what the President is \nproposing, but what some of his opponents are proposing. I think the \nPresident was responsible in his first speech last night on the \ndomestic economy. We ought to pay attention and act accordingly.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to continue the discussion which was \nobviously laid forth last night in definitively strong terms by the \nPresident of the United States on the issue of our national defense and \nhow we address the terrorism and the linkage between terrorism and the \nIraqi situation. The\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n\nresponse to the President has been interesting. From some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, and others, it has been said \nthat the President is too bellicose. In fact, I understand today that \nSenator Kennedy will bring forth a resolution which will essentially \nsay that. Certainly we have heard from Members of the self-proclaimed \npeace movement, that is the case.\n  However, the President made a strong statement of facts that we as a \nnation are at risk. It is ironic that the Members who may subscribe to \nthis self-proclaimed peace movement which might better be defined as an \nappeasement movement, that they appear to ignore the fact we are \nalready at war. Approximately 3,000 people died in New York; hundreds \ndied here in Washington; over 100 died on a plane in Pennsylvania; men \nwere killed on a ship, the USS Cole, a U.S. military ship, in Yemen; \nAmericans were killed at two embassies in Africa. We are at war.\n  The representation that we should not fight that war with all our \nresources and all our capabilities is, I believe, inappropriate.\n  How do you link Iraq into this war? If this were a period of the 19th \ncentury or even large portions of the 20th century, you would not worry \nabout Iraq. You probably would not even worry about al-Qaida. They \nwould be, in the case of Iraq, a government of a petty despot; in the \ncase of al-Qaida, a group of Iraqi murderers. The difference today is \nthat this petty despot and these petty murderers have in their \npossession or may gain the possession of weapons which can kill not \nhundreds but can kill tens of thousands of people, weapons which would \nbe used, undoubtedly, against Americans. They intend America harm.\n  They have shown that in their attacks to date where Americans have \ndied. The President, as our Commander in Chief and the leader of our \nNation and the leader of the free world, is unquestionably correct in \npursuing the individuals who possess those weapons and who might use \nthem or the individuals who might seek those weapons and use them \nacross the globe.\n  There is absolutely no question but that Iraq possesses weapons of \nmass destruction, biological and chemical, and that it has an intention \nto obtain nuclear weapons. There is also virtually no question, at \nleast among anyone willing to look at the facts, that Iraq is in \ncommunication with our enemies in al-Qaida.\n  The idea we should subjugate our national security to others is also \none that I find inherently difficult to defend. Paris was not attacked. \nBerlin was not attacked. New York City was attacked. It is our national \nsecurity, America's national security, that is at risk.\n\n  The President has made it abundantly clear that his purpose is to \ndefend the homeland. He has every right--in fact, he has every \nobligation--to do that and to accomplish it. I believe he has laid out \na case that, year in and year out, the Iraqi Government, led by a \ndespot of inordinate inhumanity, who has killed thousands, who has used \nweapons of mass destruction, who has used gas on his own people, who \nhas tortured, raped, and murdered his opposition--that that Government \nrepresents an imminent threat to us as a nation and to our allies. \nUntil that Government disarms, it remains such a threat.\n  We have sought to disarm Iraq for 12 years through a process of \ninspections guided by the United Nations resolutions. At every turn, \nIraq has essentially gamed the process and has retained its capacity to \nkill while denying that it has such capacity.\n  At every turn, it has obfuscated and attempted to subvert the efforts \nof the inspectors, denying them access, just in the most recent weeks, \nto legitimate needs that they have as inspectors, of overflights, of \naccess to the scientists who produce the weapons of mass destruction, \nof accurate accounting of where the weapons are that we know are in \nexistence, where the anthrax is, where the VX gas is, where the \ndelivery systems are for those weapons.\n  There was another period in history when we confronted a time such as \nthis, and that was in the late 1930s to the run-up to World War II. \nDuring that period, once again people of good intention said: Give \nAdolf Hitler a chance. Give him the benefit of the doubt. Appease him. \nTry to work with him. Neville Chamberlain, in his famous flight to \nMunich, attempted to accomplish that.\n  But with people such as Adolf Hitler, with people such as Saddam \nHussein, you do not reason in a Western, rational way; you do not reach \naccommodations, because their purpose is not to accommodate; their \npurpose is to use their power aggressively and in a manner which will \nharm the people we consider our allies, and which may harm ourselves, \nour Nation.\n  So it is naive of us to presume we are going to succeed here if we \nfollow such a course. We should look to history to confirm that \nnaivete. The President has outlined a definitive purpose for our Nation \nand for the world. It is that we protect the rights of free nations to \ndefend themselves from despots who have weapons of mass destruction and \nterrorists who would use such weapons to kill thousands of innocent \npeople. We have that right. His words that ``the liberty we prize is \nnot America's gift to the world but is God's gift to humanity'' ring \nwith incredible accuracy and truth. We, as a nation have an obligation \nto protect that liberty.\n  Hopefully, working with the United Nations, we will be able to \ndevelop the coalitions necessary to accomplish that. It would still be \nappropriate to do it in a peaceful way. But that is not our call. We do \nnot have the offense on that issue. Saddam Hussein's government has the \noffense on that issue. If they wish to proceed in a peaceful way to \ndisarm, that course is sitting there for them. But they have shown no \ninclination to do that. In fact, just the opposite has been the course \nthey have decided to pursue--one of obfuscation, one of deceit, one of \ncontinued commitment to possess and potentially use these weapons which \nkill thousands of people, innocent people, weapons which they have used \nin the past.\n  When the President calls our Nation together and asks us as a society \nto join to protect ourselves and to protect the liberty which God has \ngifted to humanity, I believe we have an obligation to follow and to \nrespect that call. This Congress has voted twice, once under President \nClinton and once under President Bush, to empower the President to use \nthe necessary force, to take the necessary action to protect our Nation \nand to protect the liberty of the world. This President has stepped up \nto that charge. If he had failed to step up to that charge, he would \nnot be doing his job as Commander in Chief and as President. I believe \nthis Congress has an equal obligation to step up to that charge.\n  I hope as we move down this road, we will move united and recognize \nthat this is a time when it falls on all of us to support the defense \nof freedom and liberty as defined by the President in his extraordinary \nspeech last night.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of our time, yield the \nfloor, and make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I will speak a little bit on part of \nthe main topic the President talked about last night, where we heard \nPresident Bush eloquently address America's challenging agenda--an \nagenda of war and peace, of health care, and the American economy.\n  In fact, as it relates to the economy, he said our first goal is \nclear, that we must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ \nevery man and woman who seeks a job. He suggested that we work to have \na prosperity that is broadly shared. I am certain his rhetoric \nresonated well with the American people. It sounds good.\n  Today, I want to talk not about the rhetoric of the President's \naddress but of the reality of the policies that have both been \nimplemented and the purposes and possibilities of the policies he has \nlaid on the table, which he suggests would turn our economy around and \nmeet those lofty objectives.\n\n[[Page S1708]]\n\n  Let me be clear in my own view. There is a huge gap between the \nrhetoric and the reality of the President's economic stewardship and \ncertainly with respect to the policies and proposals laid on the table. \nLet me begin by saying I am glad the President seems to finally \nrecognize that our economy has problems. You will recall that the Vice \nPresident, only 2 weeks ago, was arguing at the National Press Club and \nat the Chamber of Commerce that the President's economic policies were \nsucceeding.\n  In this particular case, we will take the President's analysis \nbecause I think there is a need to get job growth and economic momentum \nback into our economy. I am afraid he really doesn't appreciate the \ndepth of the problems we have in our overall economy and the compelling \nneed to take effective and strong action now.\n  Since March 2001, 2.4 million Americans have lost their private \nsector jobs. That is a lot of folks. The unemployment rate stands at 6 \npercent, which is the highest it has been in 8 years. Mortgage \nforeclosures are at record highs. The stock market has declined \ndramatically in the past 2 years, losing about $5 trillion in value--a \nsignificant amount of value. Consumer confidence has been seriously \nundermined. In fact, yesterday we had an announcement that the consumer \nconfidence level is at its lowest in 9 years. By the way, that is lower \nthan in the 2 months that followed September 11. Demand has declined to \nsuch an extent in American business that businesses are operating at \nabout 75 percent of operating capacity--well below the mid-1980s, which \nis on average. We have had 2 years of declining business investment. \nOur current account deficit is exploding--it is at record highs--and \nour Federal deficit is growing, with little improvement in sight for \nyears.\n  I think all of us know that as recently as 2 years ago, we were \ntalking about projections of a $5.5 trillion surplus for America. \nToday, projections over the next decade have us anywhere from $2.5 \ntrillion to $3 trillion in deficits. I think we have some serious \nissues today. CBO announced they project a $200 billion deficit for \nthis current fiscal year, and that is before tax cuts and any changes; \nand those estimates are based on our activities in the Middle East and \na war on Iraq.\n  I could go on. But, in short, we have serious economic problems and \nwe need a serious and effective economic stimulus program, something \nthat will really deal with the soaring rhetoric the President talked \nabout to make sure every man and woman who seeks a job can have one and \nmake sure prosperity is broadly shared in the American economy.\n  I don't think the prescriptions on the table do the job, frankly. I \nwill try to talk about it in specifics. In many ways, I think some of \nthe President's suggestions are actually antigrowth. The President's \nrhetoric would lead one to think his plan would provide a stimulus. But \nthe reality is very different. Look at some of the facts. Only $36 \nbillion of the plan's $675 billion in total tax cuts would kick in this \nyear. By the way, that $675 billion--if you add the interest, it would \nbe $950 billion in the decade, and if you take the acceleration of the \ntax cuts that the President also has proposed, the cost to the Federal \nTreasury would be about $1.5 trillion--a relatively serious amount of \nmoney.\n  The $36 billion the President is targeting for fiscal year 2003 is a \nmere drop in the bucket. It is not even half of 1 percent of GDP. I do \nnot read anywhere or hear in broad discussions from the Congress that \nthis is going to do much of anything with regard to stimulating growth \ntoday and creating jobs today. The right and the left--it is almost \nuniversal--talk about growth packages as opposed to stimulus packages \nbecause it is such an insignificant amount of input into the current \neconomy.\n  In fact, the President's plan, in my view, actually could do real \nharm in the short run. Its proposed dividend exclusion will encourage \ncorporations to do something that is negative with regard to growing \nthe economy. It will shift cash off the corporate balance sheet, away \nfrom investments, away from employment into dividend payments. It may \nbe nice for the people who receive it, the very narrow segment of folks \nwho actually will receive dividend payments, but it reduces the \ncapacity of business to do anything.\n  Taking cash off the balance sheet is the opposite of what we want to \nbe doing if we are trying to stimulate the economy. Accelerated \ndepreciation puts cash on the balance sheets. It lets business retain \nvalue of cash. It is hard for me to understand why anyone thinks that \nis a stimulus program. In fact, as I suggest, it may actually be \nantigrowth.\n  We cannot spend a dollar twice, so for each dollar distributed as \ndividends, companies will have one less dollar to invest in plant and \nequipment, one less dollar to plow into research and development, one \nless dollar to hire or retain personnel. The end result will be lower \ninvestment and fewer jobs in the short run.\n  By the way, it takes a long time for those dividends to work their \nway back into the job growth and economic expansion that all of us \nwould like to see.\n  Another point I believe is very important within the context of the \nview that this proposal is antigrowth, the President's plan does \nabsolutely nothing to help our State and local governments which are \nsuffering severe fiscal crises throughout our country. The estimates \nare that it is a cumulative $90 billion deficit for States. That is \nbefore the local governments. That is much larger than that $36 billion \nwe are going to put into the economy.\n  Back home, our State governments are raising taxes and cutting \nservices $90 billion while we are putting $36 billion into the economy. \nI do not see how that relates to stimulating growth, and it fits pretty \nclearly into a commonsensical analysis to say we are not on the right \ntrack to get this economy moving again.\n  New York City, New Jersey's neighbor, is having to raise property \ntaxes 18 percent. In my State, property taxes have been raised 7 \npercent. Everywhere I go across the country, State and local \ngovernments are raising property taxes to offset those very actions we \nare trying to take to stimulate the economy in Washington.\n  I do not understand why we are not thinking about this in a more \nholistic and comprehensive approach. These cuts in services and rises \nin taxes are going to create more economic problems and lead to almost \nan antigrowth policy if we implement it as it now stands. The Federal \nGovernment needs to be a partner in this process.\n  By the way, in the long run, there are even more serious problems if \nthere is no help to the States. Dividend exclusion is actually going to \ncreate an investment instrument that will compete with how State and \nlocal governments borrow in the tax-exempt market. It is going to \nincrease the borrowing costs, that is at the same time we are laying \ndown new mandates with regard to homeland security and education--Leave \nNo Child Behind--where we are underfunding the mandates we promised we \nwould bring to bear, and I think we are putting our State and local \ncommunities in a financial vise that is actually going to offset a lot \nof what we are trying to accomplish in Washington, regardless of how \none feels about specific elements of the program.\n\n  All these reasons--the very small amount of stimulus for 2003, its \nincentives to take cash off the balance sheets, which is \nincomprehensible, in my view, and its failure to help States--make this \nplan one that is failed on arrival, even if it is not dead on arrival, \nand I certainly believe it is misguided. Again, the President's \nrhetoric sounds good. We are all for making sure every man and woman \nhas a job, but I think the reality of the program is substantially \ndifferent and should be evaluated accordingly.\n  Let's take a look at another part of the rhetoric of the speech last \nnight: The claim that somehow this plan would benefit ordinary middle-\nclass families and create a broad-based prosperity. I feel strongly \nthat it is not particularly an effective macroeconomic stimulus \nprogram, but I think there is a big gap in rhetoric and reality with \nregard to where the money goes.\n  We talk about averages as opposed to means. There is a general \nagreement among economists that people with low or moderate incomes are \nmore likely to spend; they have a higher propensity of consumption for \ntax cuts than people with higher incomes. This is a matter of general \neconomic policy.\n\n[[Page S1709]]\n\n  Any stimulus plan ought to focus--if you are really trying to \nstimulate the economy--largely on tax cuts for middle- and lower-income \nfamilies. The Bush plan does exactly the opposite. Over the next 10 \nyears, those with annual incomes of more than $1 million will get a tax \nbreak worth almost $90,000 a year. That is $900,000 over 10 years. Yet \nsome middle-class families with incomes--by the way, middle class in \nNew Jersey might very well fall into this category--$75,000 to $100,000 \nwould get only about 2 percent of that tax break, about $1,800 annually \nor $18,000 over the 10 years. Consider people making between $30,000 \nand $40,000, which is closer to the $27,000 median income for the U.S. \nas a whole, and that would be $350 from the Bush plan.\n  We are looking at different segments of income earners and seeing \nwhat this actually means, and that is about four-tenths of 1 percent of \nthe benefits going to $1 million earners. It certainly does not jibe \nwith trying to put the stimulus into the pockets of people who will \nturn around and spend it to stimulate the economy.\n  This is a hard sell. Consider the 25 million taxpayers who reported \nadjusted gross income of less than $10,000. These are people worrying \nhow they are going to put food on the table. They are 20 percent of all \ntaxpayers, if you consider payroll taxes. What will they get? They will \nget a grand total of $5 a year. Let's review: $90,000 a year for people \nover $1 million, $1,800 for those with incomes of between $75,000 and \n$100,000, $350 for those with incomes between $30,000 and $40,000, and \n$5 a year for 20 percent of taxpayers below $10,000 adjusted gross \nincome. I don't know, it does not sound to me we are going to put money \nin the hands of people who will spend it.\n  This is not class warfare, it is how we are going to get an \neffective, efficient stimulus program; how do we get this turned around \nso the economy is growing. Businesses are taking inventories off the \nshelf and restarting their businesses to restimulate those inventory \ngrowths. We need to go back to the principle of the President, which is \nwe want to promote prosperity for all Americans, and to do that, we \nought to make sure that a program works.\n  I am not against people doing well in our economy. As a matter of \nfact, we made more millionaires in the 1990s with an entirely different \nproposal with regard to taxes and structure with regard to taxes than \nat any time in the history of America. Rising tides do lift all boats, \nand I think it is important that when we are thinking about our tax \npolicy, we talk about how do we grow the total economy.\n  I think this program is focused in an upside down way completely \nignoring payroll taxes, State, local, sales and property taxes, and the \ndistribution of all of those taxes together on all these individuals, \nand we are getting too much of it going in one particular area.\n  The next type of Presidential rhetoric I want to address is in the \nadministration's claim that the President's plan benefits seniors. The \nreality is very different. There are 37 million seniors. I think most \npeople would agree with that number. Yet only about one-fourth of them, \nless than 10 million, receive dividends, according to the President. So \n75 percent, or 27 million, of America's seniors will get absolutely \nnothing from the President's dividend exclusion.\n  Moreover, only a small fraction of the wealthiest seniors would enjoy \nmost of the benefits. Nearly 40 percent of the dividend tax cut for \nseniors would flow to those filers with incomes exceeding $200,000. \nThat may be a high concentration of seniors in a lot of States, but I \ndo not know too many seniors in New Jersey, 65 years and older, who \nhave $200,000 incomes.\n  That is a mere 2.5 percent of the tax returns filed by senior \ncitizens. They get 40 percent of that so-called 10 million seniors \nbenefiting from the dividend exclusion. It is less than 500,000 of the \n37 million seniors that we are talking about. It can be cut and sliced \nin other ways, but we are talking about a very narrow segment of \nseniors in America getting the benefit from the dividend exclusion.\n  It is great rhetoric to claim that seniors will benefit, but the \nreality is it is a very small number relative to those who are doing \nwell and have a great deal of wealth.\n  More fundamentally, the truth is this plan will dramatically increase \nFederal deficits in the long term, and the problem with that is, how \nare we going to continue to sustain our Social Security programs and \nour Medicare programs if we are running serious deficits and they are \ngoing to explode as the baby boomers retire in the outyears. So if one \nwants to put all of these programs together, as we talk about seniors, \nI think we have a real gap between the rhetoric and the reality of who \nis going to benefit and how this is going to benefit our economy.\n  I have some other examples with regard to small business. With most \nof the numbers we hear talked about, the rhetoric does not match the \nreality. I think there are a whole series of flaws with regard to that. \nI would love to see us go back on a bipartisan basis and talk about an \nimmediate, temporary and substantial stimulus program more fairly \ndistributed across the breadth of America, as suggested in the \nPresident's opening remarks last night as he talked about the economy. \nI think we could all benefit.\n  If there is growth in the economy, our deficits will be reduced. We \nwill have greater resources to take care of the needs in this Nation. \nIt is hard to understand, at a time when we are talking about going to \nwar, when we are trying to ask people to sacrifice, that we have such \nan economic program so focused on those already doing well and doing so \nlittle to stimulate the economy. If one reviews almost all of the \neconomic literature and commentary, a lot of it from business, they \nwill find many of the views are that this program has grave weaknesses \nas far as the stimulus program and needs to be rethought. I hope we can \nstand back, work together, make a serious effort to come together to \nproduce an effective, efficient, bang-for-your-buck stimulus program, \nand get on with meeting those high-minded objectives that were part of \nthe rhetoric.\n  The quality of life for millions of Americans depends on our success \nand being able to come up with that integrated, cooperative, and \nbipartisan approach. There are a number of great ideas on the table. I \nhope we can sit down and work together to make that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, it is my understanding I have until 4 \no'clock to speak. Therefore, if I need a unanimous consent request for \nthat I will propound it at this time. If I do not, I will simply \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right until 4 o'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1709-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1709-S1712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE STATE OF THE UNION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will speak about the President's \nproposals articulated last night in his State of the Union speech to \nensure job creation and economic growth for the United States for the \nbenefit of all American families, and for our future.\n  I note with interest some of the comments my colleagues have uttered. \nI will respond to some of those before I get into what the President \nsaid last night.\n  I noted that the Senator from New Jersey and other colleagues have \nbeen very quick to criticize the President, but I have heard absolutely \nno proposals emanating from that side of the aisle that offer an \nalternative to what the President has proposed. There is an old phrase \nthat you cannot beat something with nothing, and I think that is true \nhere. If they have a better plan, then I would like to see it. If they \nunderstand better than President Bush and his economic advisers how to \nensure and sustain long-term growth in this economy, how to provide \nmore jobs for American families, how to better protect the investments \nof our senior citizens and the like, then let us see those proposals.\n  It is easy to stand on the sidelines and criticize, but it is not as \neasy to present good, solid information and be willing to defend it. I \nam ready to defend what the President has proposed, and I would like to \nsee those who have been critical come up with some ideas of their own \nrather than rhetoric.\n  Most of the people who have been critical of the President, \nespecially if they are Members of the Senate, begin that criticism by \nnoting the President's proposal, in their view, will increase the \ndeficit and they regard this\n\n[[Page S1710]]\n\nas a most serious sin. Virtually every one of these critics voted last \nweek for $502 billion more in new spending for the fiscal year 2003 by \nvirtue of supporting amendments that were offered to the fiscal year \n2003 omnibus appropriations bill. They cannot have it both ways. They \ncannot argue on the one hand they are very concerned about deficits, \nabout not having a balanced budget, and on the other hand vote over and \nover again last week to increase spending above what the President has \nproposed, above what the Appropriations Committee has proposed on the \nfloor, by over a half of a trillion dollars in 1 year. Compound that \nspending over time and, of course, the growth is exponential.\n\n  The bottom line is the critics of the President's plan, A, need to \ncome up with a plan of their own if they are going to be credible and, \nB, if they are going to be credible about concern over the deficit then \nthey should recant the votes they cast last week over and over again \nfor over half of a trillion dollars in new spending above what the \nappropriations bill called for and that we all supported.\n  Let's look at the specific criticisms they make. I note that almost \nall of them say the President needed to pay more attention to the needs \nof States. This is a curious argument. It is true that almost all \nStates are suffering from lack of finances to serve the needs of the \npeople of the States. That is true in my State as it is in other \nStates.\n  There are a lot of reasons for that. First of all, the Federal \nGovernment imposes some unfunded mandates. That is not fair or right. \nThe Federal Government should make up for those, but that does not \nexplain the whole problem. The problem of State and local governments \nis essentially the same problem the U.S. Government faces: Namely, the \neconomy is not as robust as it should be, as we would like it to be, as \nwe hoped it would be. Therefore, it is producing less in the way of tax \nrevenues.\n  In the case of the United States Government, we can relatively easily \ngo into debt. States cannot do that. As the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer knows from her experience in State government, you have to pay \nas you go in State government. So they are hurting because the economy \nis not as strong. People are not making as much money, and the States \nare not collecting as much in tax revenues as they had projected. So \nthey are in a deficit situation.\n  What do we do about that? What is the Federal Government expected to \ndo about it? Should the Federal Government tax American citizens even \nmore, bring the money back to Washington and then write 50 checks to \nthe States and send it back? How would that help the people who have \njust had the Federal Government take their tax dollars, then write a \ncheck back to the States? I do not see the logic of that.\n  States can raise their own taxes. If raising taxes is the answer, \nthey all have the capability of raising taxes much more quickly than \nthe Federal Government does, and of collecting that tax revenue because \nthey can do it in sales taxes so that the effect is immediate. They do \nnot need to wait for a whole year for income tax collections, which is \nthe Federal Government's means of financing to catch up with revenue \nneeds.\n  I found it interesting that the Senator from New Jersey said the \nPresident's plan ignored sales taxes and property taxes. Rightly so. \nThose are taxes traditionally left to the States to fund needs of State \ngovernments--not the Federal Government. Woe be to the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives if we begin collecting sales taxes and \nproperty taxes as a means of financing the Federal Government. Woe be \nto us. That is not right.\n  States and local governments can raise those taxes if they want. The \nreality is most of them are not going to do it. They understand, as \nmost of us understand, that taxing people more does not make them \nbetter off. It does not help to collect taxes at the State and local \nlevel and provide benefits to the very same people who paid the taxes.\n  What does make sense? What has always made sense in the past? If the \neconomy grows, it will create jobs, it will produce more wealth for \nAmerican families and, at the same time, more tax collections to the \ngovernmental entities that collect taxes.\n  The Federal Government's problems are primarily a result of a \nsluggish economy. It was pointed out yesterday in the confirmation of \nthe President's nominee for Treasury Secretary that just a 1-percent \ndifference in growth in our economy from 3 percent to 4 percent means--\nI hope this figure is correct--$8 trillion over a 10-year period. That \nis a lot of money. It illustrates the fact that very small measures of \ngrowth differential can mean a great deal in tax collections for both \nthe Federal Government and the State government.\n  If we can encourage economic growth on a sustained, long-term basis, \nwe will not have to worry about balancing budgets or about deficits or \nthe financial straits our States are in. A healthy economy not only \nhelps families but it also helps the State and local governments and \nthe Federal Government collect the necessary tax revenues to provide \nservices.\n  Therefore, when critics--such as Governors--say the President ignored \nthe States, I guess I put the challenge back to them: Do you think the \nFederal Government should raise taxes from your citizens so you can \ngive it back to them? If so, why don't you raise the taxes?\n  Tax increases are not the answer. Almost all would agree that a \nrobust economy is the answer. How do we get to a robust economy? The \nSenator from New Jersey is correct that there is not that much economic \nstimulus in this current fiscal year in the President's proposal. He \nidentified about $34 billion worth. I cannot contest that figure. It \nmay well be correct; I don't know. In any event, it was $34 billion \nmore than the Democrats proposed because they did not pass a budget for \nfiscal year 2003, provided no tax relief for fiscal year 2003, provided \nno way to stimulate the economy, provide economic growth or job \ncreation.\n  It was the Democratic Party that was in control of this body last \nyear. I guess it could be fair to say that $34 billion is not enough, \nbut it certainly beats what the Democratic leadership was able to \nproduce last year, which was exactly nothing.\n  Is the answer a stimulus? It is hubris in the first degree to suggest \nthat the Congress--in fact, the Government--can really affect a \nmultitrillion-dollar economy very much in a rapid way by the policies \nwe institute here. We can do far more to help the economy, as Alan \nGreenspan has said, by curbing our appetite to spend taxpayer money \nthan almost anything else we do. Yet my Democratic friends last week \nwere willing to spend over half a trillion more than the appropriations \nbill provided and that the President had requested. I don't think they \nare in a very good position to argue about the proper prescription here \nfor economic growth.\n\n  The reality is the best way to promote economic growth is to reduce \nthe tax burden of American businesses, small businesses, and American \nfamilies. That is what President Bush has attempted to do in the \nproposal he has made. Does he pretend that in 1 year we can turn \neverything around? No. As he said last night, if the tax relief we \npassed a year and a half ago, which was phased in over time, is good in \n5 years, 6 years, 7 years, why is it not even better to make it \neffective now? If my friends on the other side of the aisle are so \nconcerned about doing something now to stimulate the economy, then I \nchallenge them, let's make the tax reductions we passed a year and a \nhalf ago, that were phased in over a 10-year period of time, effective \nnow. That would do a lot of good. It goes up and down the entire \nspectrum of American taxpayers, from those who are the wealthiest all \nthe way down to those who are the least wealthy.\n  Interestingly enough, those small businesses that create most of the \njobs in this country--and we are very interested in job creation--would \nbenefit significantly because they are organized under our laws to pay \ntaxes at individual tax rates. For the most part, their tax rate is \nhigher than the corporate tax rate. So the small businesses we are \ntrying to encourage are paying a higher rate of taxes than the big \ncorporations. I ask, is that fair? Is it a way to stimulate job \ncreation, given they provide more of the jobs in the country than the \nlarge corporations?\n  Let's look at the President's program in more detail. Some on the \nother side\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\nof the aisle have been very critical of the dividend section of the \nPresident's proposal, the part that says it is fair to tax dividends \nonce when the corporation makes the profit but it is not fair to turn \naround and tax the dividends a second time when they are paid to the \nshareholder. It is a matter of basic equity and fairness and makes \ncommon sense.\n  But there are some who say, for some reason or other, that is not a \ngood idea. One of the arguments is that eliminating the double taxation \nof dividends gives money to shareholders. As my friend from New Jersey \nsaid a moment ago, that may be nice for the folks who receive it--\nmeaning the deduction for dividends paid by corporations--but does it \ndo much to help the economy?\n  Let's break that into two parts. It is nice for the people who \nreceive those dividends. Now, over half of the adults in America are \ninvestors in equities. Half of Americans are stockholders. A large \nnumber of those will receive a benefit by not having their dividends \ntaxed when the corporations pay the dividends to them.\n  The President's object is not to provide for consumer spending. It is \nnot to increase consumer spending. That is not the problem with our \neconomy now, but to increase capital formation, which is the problem. \nFor confirmation of that, the White House has provided some information \ncomparing personal consumption expenditures with private investment. \nThe top line, which is personal expenditures, is going up from $6 \ntrillion to $7 trillion in just over a 3-year period. Consumer spending \nis not the problem. The problem is this squiggly line down here, \ncapital formation, gross private investment. Gross private investment \nhas actually decreased from just after the year 2000, from $1.8 \ntrillion to currently $1.6 trillion. The problem is the need to enhance \ninvestment, not to deal with personal spending.\n  The dividends being taxed today are not going into reinvestment, into \nbusiness. But the President's proposal is to encourage this \nreinvestment by eliminating the double taxation of dividends. This \nattracts billions of dollars of new investment to the economy since \nincreasing the aftertax returns to capital will make new investments \nsufficiently profitable to be undertaken. Reducing the tax on dividends \nshould raise share prices by many times the amount of additional annual \ndividend payments. The more real earnings a company has, the more \nwilling the managers are to pay dividends and the more the share prices \nincrease--prosperity for everyone.\n  Moreover, what is lost on some critics: To eliminate double taxation, \nthis harmonizes tax treatment of debt and equity. We have been too \nfavorable to debt creation in the corporations, so some major \ncorporations have gone into bankruptcy because they created so much \ndebt. As soon as we had a downturn in the economy, they could not \nhandle the repayment of all that debt. We ought to promote less debt \ncapitalization of businesses and more equity capital.\n  Harmonizing the tax treatment of debt and equity removes the current \ntax preference for financing business expansions with debt. Debt is \nmore risky because, while dividends can be reduced or eliminated during \ndifficult economic times, companies that finance with debt must \ncontinue to pay the interest regardless of the economy. That is what \nleads to the bankruptcies.\n  In addition, eliminating this double taxation of dividends will \nencourage better corporate behavior. We certainly understand the need \nfor that, given some of the shenanigans that occurred during the last \nfew years. Companies that pay dividends must have real cash earnings \nrather than possibly doctored paper earnings--which was the case with \nsome corporations over the last few years.\n  It will help create new jobs. The main beneficiaries of the increased \ninvestment activity will be the workers who are employed to use the \nadditional capital and the consumers who get to enjoy the cheaper \nproducts and services that it makes possible.\n  I mentioned that it is simply unfair to tax the same income twice. We \nsometimes forget that basic argument when we are talking about all the \ngood reasons to eliminate the double taxation of dividends, but in \npractice I think we all appreciate that double taxation of dividends \nmeans that even an investor of modest means is paying a higher tax rate \non dividends that wealthy taxpayers pay on their income.\n  What about this distribution of benefits? Roughly 35 million American \nhouseholds receive dividend income that is taxable, and will directly \nbenefit under the President's plan. So this is not something that just \nbenefits a few--35 million American households receive dividend income \nthat is taxable and will directly benefit as a result of the \nPresident's plan.\n  Almost half of all savings from the dividend exclusion under the \nPresident's plan would go to taxpayers 65 years and older. The average \ntax savings for the 9.8 million seniors receiving dividends would be \n$936. To the argument that this dividend savings only goes to a very \nfew, the point here is that the average will be almost $1,000 per \nsenior receiving the tax break on the dividends.\n  It seems to me it is very difficult to argue that eliminating this \ndouble taxation of dividends is bad for seniors, bad for shareholders, \nor bad for the economy.\n  Let's talk about the other aspect of the plan, though, the major \npiece of the plan that the President spoke to last night and that is \nthe benefit of accelerating the marginal rate reductions.\n  What do we mean here? We are talking about the income taxes that we \npay. Depending upon which bracket you are in, you pay a higher \npercentage of your income in taxes. We decided a year and a half ago to \nreduce those rates but we couldn't get the votes to reduce them all \nimmediately, so we phased them in over time. We phased those reductions \nin over a 10-year period of time.\n  Last night the President said, look, if it was a good idea to reduce \nthe tax rate 6, 7, 8 years from now, why isn't it an even better idea \nto do it right now?\n  I ask that question of my colleagues who oppose this. Why is it not a \nbetter idea to do it right now?\n  Some of them might say that will cost the Federal Treasury money. My \nresponse to that is, Why did you vote for an additional $502 billion in \nspending? That also takes money out of the Federal Treasury.\n  Let's just talk about this marginal rate reduction in terms of \neconomic growth potential. This is where the economic growth really \noccurs, because reducing marginal tax rates provides an ongoing \nincentive for all taxpayers to work harder and longer, which is what \ncreates the increased economic activity that we seek. It also creates \nadditional income which can be taxed, so Government ends up making more \nmoney in the long run. Most importantly, it allows taxpayers to keep \nmore of their own money, which they can use to invest or spend or save \nas they choose.\n  When we talk about savings, we are really talking about investing. So \nregardless of how this money is used, it will benefit economic growth. \nIf you save it, you put it in a bank and the bank immediately turns \nthat money around, loaning it to others, and that will put the money to \nuse creating more jobs. If you spend it, it is going to eventually find \nits way back into the capital market and help create jobs. Of course if \nyou invest it, that is the most efficient way of all to provide \ncapitalization to companies to hire new people and produce new things.\n  I spoke before about small businesses and the benefit of the \nPresident's tax plan for small businesses. Reducing the top rate \nprimarily helps these small businesses. The current top individual rate \nis 38.6 percent. That is the rate at which most small businesses are \ncharged. The top corporate rate is 35 percent. So the small businesses \nare paying over 3.5 percent more in their income tax rate than the big \ncorporation. Accelerating these rate reductions to the year 2003 will \nharmonize the small business income tax rate with the corporate rate. \nThat is fair. It is equitable. It is the right thing to do, and it will \nstimulate economic investment and job creation because, as I said \nbefore, it is small businesses that create most of the jobs.\n  The small businesses would receive about 79 percent, which represents \nover $10 billion, of the $13.3 billion in tax relief that comes from \naccelerating the reduction of the top bracket to 35 percent in the year \n2003, as opposed to the\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\nyear 2006. That is why the President said let's bring that reduction \nforward 3 years and provide this benefit immediately.\n  There is another benefit for small business that has not been talked \nabout much. The President's proposal would increase from $25,000 to \n$75,000 the amount that small businesses may expense each year, that is \nto say that they can write off in their income taxes. There is broad \nbipartisan agreement that allowing small businesses to expense a larger \namount of their investment in equipment will provide a strong incentive \nfor small business to expand. As I said, these are the businesses that \nprovide most of the new jobs in our country.\n  Let me conclude by talking about this class warfare. The previous \nspeaker said he didn't want to talk about class warfare but immediately \ngot into the same argument about who benefits. He also acknowledged \nsomething that is very true. John Kennedy is famous for saying, back in \n1963 when he was proposing a capital gains tax reduction and people \npointed out that there were not very many people who had capital gains, \nPresident Kennedy said:\n\n       But a rising tide lifts all boats.\n\n  If some taxpayers benefit, in the long run all taxpayers benefit. \nThat is an acknowledged principle of economics.\n  One ought not be asking why do you get a $3,000 benefit from \nPresident Bush's tax proposal and I only get a $1,500 benefit? But \nrather, they should say, I am glad I got the $1,500 benefit and I am \nglad you got the $3,000 benefit, because for all of it is going to make \nthe economy healthier and in the long run it will make us all \nwealthier. That is the attitude, fortunately, most Americans have.\n\n  According to the IRS data from 2000, the top 5 percent of tax filers \npaid more than 50 percent of all income taxes, and the top half of all \ntax filers were responsible for nearly all of our taxes, 96 percent.\n  Who ends up paying a higher percentage or lower percentage after all \nof the Bush tax plan is put into effect? It turns out that the \nwealthier people end up paying an even higher percentage of taxes and \nthe people in the lower brackets pay an even smaller percentage of \ntaxes. So it does not help the wealthy at the expense of the poor. In \nfact, if you want to just measure it by that measure, the wealthy pay \neven more of the taxes than they do today.\n  If your income is over $200,000, you are going to be paying 45.4 \npercent of all of the Federal income taxes. Currently, they pay 44.8 \npercent. So that is an increase in the amount of taxes that are going \nto be paid by people who make $200,000 or more. If you are making above \n$100,000 and less than $200,000, you are going to be paying 27.9 \npercent of all Federal income taxes. Currently, you pay 27.6 percent--\nan increase.\n  Under the Bush plan, families with incomes of over $100,000 would end \nup paying 73 percent of all Federal income taxes.\n  By the way, it takes 3.8 million low-income taxpayers off the tax \nrolls completely, the Bush plan does. So it is not even an effective \nrebuttal to say it benefits the rich at the expense of the poor.\n  I have gone through all the different arguments. We talked about \nwhere is the alternative. We talked about the benefits to the States. \nWe talked about the benefits to families. I haven't even talked here \nabout the child tax credit or the marriage penalty elimination. All of \nthese features of the Bush plan are designed in one way or another to \nhelp different parts of our economy, different types of families in \nAmerica, so at the end of the day everybody benefits.\n  It is possible to pick out one little segment of the tax cuts \nproposed by the President and say that does not benefit everybody. Of \ncourse. If you don't have any children, the child tax credit isn't \ngoing to help you. But for those families with children, it is going to \nhelp a lot. Same thing if you are two single people; ending the \nmarriage penalty might not help you. If you are a married couple, you \nmight get the benefit of that. But you put it all together and end up \nwith a mosaic that provides not only help to all Americans but an \neconomic long-term growth package that can sustain the kind of living \nwe want in this country, while providing the kind of revenues to State \nand local governments as well as the Federal Government.\n  That is the philosophy of the Bush tax plan. It is a good philosophy, \nand I look forward to a robust debate with my colleagues who may \ndisagree with portions of that plan. It is a very defensible plan, and \nI am proud to support what the President has proposed here.\n  I hope we will have plenty of opportunity to debate this in the near \nfuture so we can enact all of the President's proposal as soon as we \npossibly can for the benefit of the American economy but, more \nimportantly, all American families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1712-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, President Bush last night warned the \nAmerican people to brace for war with Iraq. In his State of the Union \nAddress, he vowed that if Saddam Hussein does not disarm, the United \nStates will ``lead a coalition'' to disarm him.\n  Although the President stopped short of a declaration of war, his \nmessage was clear: In his view, Saddam Hussein constitutes an imminent \ndanger to peace and security in the world, and the United States is \nprepared to wage war, with or without the support of the United \nNations, to remove him from power. The chain of events that President \nBush set into motion last year when he inducted Iraq into what he \ncalled the ``axis of evil'' appears on the verge of spilling over into \nbattle and bloodshed.\n  The President's remarks come amid a firestorm of protest from some of \nour closest allies in Europe and the Middle East over the apparent \nwillingness of the United States to ride roughshod over the United \nNations and dictate to the rest of the world the terms of Iraq's \ndisarmament. The President in his State of the Union speech once again \nmade clear that Iraq will be dealt with on his timetable, at his hands, \naccording to his agenda.\n  Mr. President, I am fully cognizant of the danger presented by the \npossibility of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons in the hands of \na ruthless dictator like Saddam Hussein. I am fully cognizant of, and \nfrustrated by, the fact that Iraq has consistently flouted the United \nNations mandates to disarm, and has apparently shown only token \ncooperation with the current inspection regime. Iraq has much to answer \nfor, and the President is correct in demanding that Iraq respond to the \nUnited Nations.\n  What concerns me greatly, however, is that this President appears to \nplace himself above the international mandates of the United Nations. \nHe has turned a deaf ear to the concerns of other nations and has vowed \nthat the United States will lead an assault on Iraq regardless of the \njudgment of the United Nations. President Bush has\n\n[[Page S1713]]\n\nmade the overthrow of Saddam Hussein a personal crusade, and in his \nzeal to pursue his goal, he has failed to make the case to the American \npeople out there and to our allies abroad that the United Nations is \ndragging its feet, that war is the only option left, and that war \ncannot wait.\n  The President in his address alluded to tantalizing evidence that \nSaddam Hussein is in collusion with al-Qaida and that Iraq possesses \nweapons of mass destruction which it is hiding from the United Nations \nweapons inspectors. But the President has yet to present that evidence \nto the public or to demonstrate why it constitutes an immediate cause \nfor war. If the evidence is as compelling as the President indicates it \nwill be, surely the member states of the United Nations will close \nranks behind the United States and demand the forcible disarmament of \nIraq.\n  The President also set what appears to be a new deadline for the \nUnited Nations. On February 5, he said, the United States will ask the \nU.N. Security Council to convene to hear evidence of Iraq's illegal \nweapons programs and its links to terrorist groups. I look forward to \nlearning the details of that meeting. I wonder why the President is \nholding back for another week if he has such information today, and \nperhaps has had it for some time. I am confident that the U.N. weapons \ninspectors would welcome such evidence, not next week but today, so \nthat they could do their jobs more effectively. I wonder why the Senate \nhas not been given this evidence. I wonder why the American people, who \nare being asked to send their sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, \nbrothers and sisters into the battle zone, have not been made privy to \nthis important evidence.\n  Perhaps the answer lies in the followup comment by the President, \nwhen he said: ``We will consult, but let there by no misunderstanding. \nIf Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm for the safety of our people, \nand for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm \nhim.'' Despite all his comments to the contrary, it appears that the \nPresident has predetermined that war with Iraq is the only recourse \nleft.\n  If war is the answer, the support of the international community is \nessential. I believe that it would be a grave mistake for the United \nStates to preempt the work of the United Nations weapons inspectors and \ninitiate an invasion of Iraq without first seeking the express support \nof the Security Council. The United States is already seen by many as \nan aggressor in the Middle East. Speculation is rife in Europe that the \nUnited States is pressing to invade Iraq to give the U.S. control of \nthe Iraqi oil fields. America's reputation in the court of world \nopinion is in tatters.\n  Unfortunately, the President's State of the Union speech did little \nto allay the worries of the American people or the international \ncommunity. The President signaled to the world that America is ready \nfor war with Iraq, but he did not explain why Iraq suddenly presents \nsuch ``a serious and mounting threat'' to our country, our friends, and \nour allies that war is the only option. How is it that the threat from \nIraq is more serious than the threat from North Korea? How is it that \nthe threat from Iraq appears to have eclipsed the threat from al-Qaida \nto our own country and the threat from other terrorist organizations?\n  Nor did the President attempt to prepare the American people for the \npossible consequences of war with Iraq--the terrible toll on the lives \non innocent Iraqis, the potential for hundreds or thousands of \nbattlefield casualties of American service men and women, the sharply \nincreased threat of terrorist attacks on America and its allies. The \nPresident promised that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein would liberate \nthe people of Iraq, but he made no mention of what the American people \ncould expect from a postwar Iraq. The President made no mention of the \nburden the United States would have to bear to ensure that a postwar \nIraq did not devolve into chaos.\n\n  In his State of the Union Address last year, the President declared a \nglobal war on terror, and he called on all nations of the world to come \ntogether to combat the curse of terrorism. In his speech last night, \nthe global war on terror got remarkably short shrift. ``We are working \nclosely with other nations,'' the President said. ``We have the \nterrorists on the run.''\n  Unfortunately, having terrorists on the run means that terrorists \nhave escaped our dragnet and, according to intelligence assessments, \nare actively plotting new attacks on the United States and its allies. \nWe still do not know the fate of Osama bin Laden. We may have him on \nthe run, but we also fear that he continues to pose a real and imminent \nthreat to the United States. And unlike Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden \nhas demonstrated his willingness to attack American citizens at home \nand American interests abroad.\n  But instead of rallying the international community to the continued \nneed to cooperate in fighting global terrorism, the President's \npolicies and the President's rhetoric are polarizing the world.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Senate has a duty to speak to the issue \nof war with Iraq, and I believe that the United States has a duty under \ninternational law to work within the structure of the United Nations \ncharter. If we indict Saddam Hussein on the grounds that he has failed \nto disarm in accordance with the United Nations resolutions, how then \ncan we turn around and act against him without United Nations support? \nWhat signal does the United States send to the world regarding respect \nfor international law? The United Nations is acting responsibly. Iraq, \nif not fully cooperating, is at least straitjacketed. America's allies \nare calling on us to give the inspectors time to do their work. This is \nnot the time for precipitous action on the part of the United States.\n  For these reasons, I am today introducing a resolution urging that \nthe U.N. weapons inspectors be given sufficient time to complete their \nwork and calling for the President to seek a United Nations resolution \nspecifically authorizing the use of force before initiating any \noffensive military operation against Iraq.\n  Now, it may come to be that war is the only way to subdue the \nmalevolence of Saddam Hussein. But that is not a decision for the \nUnited States to make unilaterally. President Bush, in November, \ngalvanized the United Nations to act on the issue of Iraq. For that, \nthe President is to be commended. Now he must follow through on his \npledge to work with the United Nations. The United Nations has \ndemonstrated in the past 2 months that it is willing to act responsibly \nand vigorously in addressing the issue of Iraq's disarmament. No one \ncould accuse chief weapons inspector Hans Blix of sugar-coating his \ninterim report to the U.N. Security Council on January 27. He made \nclear that Iraq is not adequately cooperating on matters of substance. \nHe made clear his frustration with Iraq. But he did not slam the door \non the possibility of disarming Iraq without resorting to war.\n  As long as that door remains open even a crack, as long as Iraq is \nnot actively threatening its neighbors or the United States, as long as \nthe United Nations can maintain a stranglehold on Saddam Hussein's \nambitions, I believe that we have a duty to the American people to \nstrive to find an alternative to war. If war it must be, then it should \nbe a coordinated undertaking authorized by Congress and sanctioned by \nthe member states of the United Nations--not a preemptive strike \ninitiated by the President of the United States.\n\n  Mr. President, the consequences of war are incalculable. Before we \ntake such a momentous step, before we place the lives of American \nmilitary personnel and innocent civilians in harm's way, we should stop \nto reflect on the possible consequences, and we should redouble our \nefforts to find a peaceful solution to the disarmament of Iraq. If war \nis the only recourse, it must be a war endorsed and fully supported by \nthe United Nations.\n  Mr. President, if it must be war, we may be lucky. I hope we will be. \nBut we may not be lucky. I think of the words of Croesus, when he said \nto Cyrus the Great of Persia:\n\n       There is a wheel on which the affairs of men revolve and \n     its movement forbids the same man to be always fortunate.\n\n  Mr. President, I shall have more to say as the days come and go on \nthis matter that is so vital to the American people and to their \nfutures and to the futures of our children and grandchildren and their \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S1714]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe I have time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend from West Virginia for his eloquence \nonce again this afternoon. When the history of our time is written, \nthere will be many important chapters on the contributions the Senator \nfrom West Virginia has made, certainly for his State, but I also think \nthere will be an important chapter that will be written about his \ncontributions to our Constitution as the principal guardian of the \nConstitution in the Senate. He has done this on so many occasions. I \nhave admired him so much for that effort and the extraordinary insight \nhe has brought to all of us as a student of history.\n  All of us will remember very clearly the debates which were led by \nthe Senator from West Virginia some 3 months ago on the issues of war \nand peace, and now once again, as we are coming to the most significant \ntime, and that is the decision-making that will be made at the United \nNations about whether we will continue with a course of inspections and \nwhether we will try and galvanize the world community behind a common \npurpose, or whether we will go it alone. The Senator reminds us of the \ndangers of going it alone, of the unforeseen challenges we will be \nfacing, and draws attention to the importance that this is a matter \nthat is debated and discussed in the Senate; that the people in West \nVirginia, like the people in my own State, are eager to have more \nknowledge, more awareness, more understanding as to exactly where we \nare going and the circumstances of that commitment.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia so much for the thoughtful \nresolution which I am proud to cosponsor and for the comment he has \nmade, which is that we will be back here again to talk about this issue \nof war and peace.\n  As he has said on many occasions, there is no vote that is more \nimportant than a Senator's vote on war and peace. There is no issue \nmore important that we address in the Senate. The Senator reminds us of \nthat very solemn obligation and responsibility we have on that issue \nand has, in his resolution, found ways of giving expression to the \nconcerns of many of our fellow citizens.\n  I again thank him for all of the work he has done. I urge him to \ncontinue to lead this body to a better understanding of exactly what \npolicy we are undertaking, what the risks are, and the challenges we \nface with the real prospects of a war which may be initiated by the \nUnited States, in which the United States may be effectively going it \nalone with perhaps one or two of our allies. I thank him so much for \nhis attention and focus on this issue.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very able Senator for his \nthoughtful and gracious remarks. I thank him also for his cosponsorship \nof the sense-of-the-Senate resolution which I have just submitted. I \nthank him for his contributions to that resolution.\n  It is my understanding he will be submitting a resolution. We have \ndiscussed that as well, and I hope he will add my name to his \nresolution. He can be sure that, the Lord willing, I will be speaking \non this matter from time to time, and I know that he will join me, as I \nhope others in this Senate will join us. I think it is time for the \nAmerican people to hear more from the Senate. I do not think they have \nheard enough from the Senate on this matter that is so vital to them, \nto their loved ones, to their fortunes, and to their futures.\n\n  As far as the Lord enables me to do so, I intend to have more to say \non this subject. I thank the Senator. I know he will have more to say. \nAgain, I thank him for his remarks and for his cosponsorship of the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may I be reminded when I have 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so inform the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last October 16, President Bush signed \nPublic Law 107-243 which authorized the President to use military \nforce, if necessary, to defend our country.\n  I voted against that resolution and war with Iraq because I was not \npersuaded that Iraq posed an imminent threat to our national security \nand because of my belief that war with Iraq, especially without broad \ninternational support, would undermine our ability to meet the gravest \nthreat to our national security--terrorism against the United States by \nal-Qaida and other terrorist groups.\n  Circumstances have changed significantly since Congress approved that \nresolution last October. In the months that have passed, events have \nonly strengthened my belief that this is the wrong war at the wrong \ntime.\n  In those 3 months, al-Qaida has escalated its campaign of terror. \nNorth Korea has revived its nuclear weapons program. And United Nations \ninspectors are now on the ground in Iraq.\n  There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator. He \ninvaded Kuwait. He oppresses the Iraqi people. He murders his \nopponents. He has gassed his own people. He has defied the world \ncommunity.\n  So I commend President Bush for going to the United Nations and for \nworking with our allies to put inspectors on the ground again in Iraq. \nThe inspectors are making progress. Rather than commit American troops \nto war with Iraq at this time, we should give the inspectors our full \nsupport and assistance, including our best intelligence information, to \nstrengthen their disarmament efforts.\n  There are many other questions that must be answered before we go to \nwar:\n  Will war increase the chances of injury and harm to American citizens \nif Saddam Hussein, with his back pressed against the wall, decides to \nuse chemical or biological weapons? What will a postwar Iraq look like? \nWho will govern? How long will our troops need to stay? How many will \nneed to stay?\n  What will be the impact on the war against terrorism? Will we be \nincreasing support for al-Qaida?\n  What will be the impact of our allies in the region? Will stability \nbe undermined?\n  How will our Nation be able to manage three foreign policy crises at \nthe same time--the war against terrorism, the crisis with North Korea, \nand now war with Iraq?\n  When Congress voted on this issue in October, the President had not \nyet decided to go to war. The President said war was the last resort. \nHe said we would work with the international community to obtain Iraq's \ndisarmament. Clearly, we have not reached that last resort. Inspectors \nare on the ground in Iraq, and the international community wants the \ninspections to continue; yet, the President is poised to pull the \ntrigger of war.\n  I am delighted to work with Senator Byrd on this issue, and I am a \ncosponsor of his resolution. We share the goal of ensuring that war \nwill be the last resort; that if we do have to go to war in Iraq, it \nwill be with the support of Congress, the American people, and the \ninternational community.\n  In light of the changed circumstances since the previous votes by \nCongress, I am submitting another resolution supporting the inspection \nprocess and requiring the President to obtain approval from the \nCongress before committing American troops to war.\n  This decision may well be one of the most important that any of us \nwill make.\n  So much has happened since Congress voted to authorize force last \nOctober. On November 8, the United Nations Security Council unanimously \napproved a resolution that demanded unprecedented access to suspected \nweapons sites in Iraq. The passage of this resolution demonstrated the \nresolve of the international community to disarm Saddam, and was soon \nfollowed by the arrival of several hundred weapons inspectors in Iraq.\n  On January 27, the inspectors submitted a report to the Security \nCouncil about Iraq's cooperation with weapons inspections. Chief \nweapons inspector Hans Blix stated that Iraq has so far cooperated \n``rather well'' but that additional cooperation is necessary. The \ndirector general of the International Atomic Energy Agency said \ninspectors ``have found no evidence that Iraq has revived its nuclear \nweapons program since the elimination of the program in the 1990s'' and \nthat inspectors ``should\n\n[[Page S1715]]\n\nbe able within the next few months to provide credible assurances that \nIraq has no nuclear weapons program.''\n  The U.N. report demonstrated that the inspection process is working. \nThe inspectors are building their case, and Saddam Hussein is feeling \nthe pressure of the international community. Nothing in the report \nsuggests that war now is the only option to disarm Saddam. Clearly, the \ninspections should continue.\n  It is wrong for the administration to beat the drums of war. There is \ntime for thoughtful deliberation about whether war now is the right \npriority for our Nation and we in Congress have a responsibility to the \nConstitution and the American people to act again on this all-important \nissue of war or peace.\n  The administration has totally failed to make the case that Saddam \nHussein is an imminent threat to our security. No evidence, no proof, \nno ``smoking gun,'' no intelligence has ever been released to suggest \nwe must launch a pre-emptive strike in order to defend America from an \nunprovoked attack. Instead of making its case, the administration \nsimply says, ``Trust us. We know more than you do.''\n  Many experts believe that Iraq--especially without provocation--does \nnot represent an imminent threat to our security. In fact, it may well \nbe just the opposite. On October 7, CIA Director George Tenet released \nan unclassified assessment in a letter to the Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence that suggested Iraq would only be a threat if the \nUnited States attacked it first.\n  The letter said, ``the probability of [Saddam Hussein] initiating an \nattack [on the United States] would be low.'' It also said, ``should \nSaddam Hussein conclude that a U.S.-led attack could no longer be \ndeterred, he probably would become much less constrained in adopting \nterrorist actions. Such terrorism might involve . . . [chemical and \nbiological weapons].''\n  In spite of U.S. assertions that we have secret evidence of Iraq's \nWMD program, we have been transferring this information at a painfully \nslow pace. It is only this month, that we finally began to hand over \n``significant intelligence.'' The administration promises the release \nof new information and all of us hope that it will be more convincing \nthan what has been made available so far.\n  Secretary Powell will go to the Security Council to share \nintelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program on February \n5. But if the United States has significant intelligence, we should \nshare it with the U.N. inspectors today. We should not wait a further \nweek. If our goal is disarmament, we should do everything possible to \nassist the inspectors.\n  The disarmament of Saddam Hussein is essential. But the \nadministration has not made a persuasive case that the threat from Iraq \nis so immediate that it justifies resort to war now when the \ninspections process is obviously making progress. Clearly, we have not \nreached the last resort.\n  Our Nation faces another threat that is much more immediate: the \npossibility of new al-Qaida terrorist attacks. A unilateral invasion of \nIraq would not advance our war against terrorism--it would undermine \nit. Our highest national priority is to wage the unfinished war against \nal-Qaida and wage it effectively.\n  In the last 4 months there have been deadly new al-Qaida attacks \nworldwide, which have slaughtered hundreds. A French tanker was \nattacked in Yemen, a nightclub bombed in Indonesia, a hotel destroyed \nin Kenya, missionaries murdered in Yemen. The frequency and ferocity of \nthese attacks is increasing. It is only a matter of time before they \nstrike America again.\n  The administration would like us to believe that Saddam Hussein is \npublic enemy No. 1, ignoring the fact that Osama bin Laden is still at \nlarge. Chilling new evidence has arisen suggests that he is planning \nnew attacks.\n  At home, we still remain vulnerable. Last October, a Council of \nForeign Relations task force chaired by former Senators Gary Hart and \nWarren Rudman warned that ``America remains dangerously unprepared to \nprevent and respond to a catastrophic attack on U.S. soil.''\n  Another Task Force representative told a Senate Judiciary \nSubcommittee that ``a war with Iraq . . . elevates the risk in the near \nterm of an attack on the United States . . . [and] will likely consume \nvirtually all the nation's attention and command the bulk of the \navailable resources, leaving little left over to address our many \ndomestic vulnerabilities.''\n  For some time, the administration engaged in a complicated spin job \nto convince the American people that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden \nare co-conspirators. According to this view, waging war on Iraq is part \nof the war against terrorism. Last September, our Secretary of Defense \nwent so far as to claim publicly that he had ``bulletproof \nconfirmation'' of links between Iraq and al-Qaida.\n  But the administration has never presented any of this \n``bulletproof'' evidence. Most regional experts believe it is highly \nunlikely that fundamentalist al-Qaida leaders would ever find much \ncommon cause with the secular dictator Saddam Hussein. Last October, \nCIA Director George Tenet even conceded that the administration's \nunderstanding of the al-Qaida Iraq link was ``evolving'' and based on \n``sources of varying reliability.'' The administration claimed again \nthis week that they have new evidence of those ties, but so far we have \nonly seen a rehash of old allegations and unreliable anecdotes.\n  As the administration emphasizes the threat from Iraq, it gives less \nattention to other countries that pose an even more immediate threat to \nour security.\n  The greatest proliferation threat comes not from Iraq, but North \nKorea. North Korea is much more likely and capable to develop, use and \nsell these weapons. But unlike Iraq, North Korea probably already has \nnuclear weapons. Unlike Iraq, North Korea has no nuclear inspectors on \nthe ground to verify disarmament.\n  North Korea has a long and well-documented history of selling its \nmilitary technology, especially ballistic missiles, to whoever will pay \nthe highest price. Desperate and strapped for cash, it is the country \nmost likely to sell or transfer weapons of mass destruction to \nterrorists or nations that support terrorism.\n  In its single-minded focus on Iraq, administration officials at first \nrefused to acknowledge that a nuclear crisis even existed. Only very \nrecently has the Administration begun to devote the attention this \ncrisis deserves.\n  Nevertheless, the administration continues to focus on Iraq. They are \nnow suggesting an easy war, with few casualties. But our military \nleaders, especially those with significant combat experience are \nskeptical. On December 18, a press report said that the commandant of \nthe Marine Corps is concerned that civilian leaders in the Pentagon are \nunderestimating the risks of war, and that military chiefs have \nchallenged the optimistic view that Saddam Hussein's government will \ncollapse soon after a military campaign begins.\n  In December, we heard dire new forecasts about what war with Iraq \nwould actually be like. U.S. intelligence officials warned that Saddam \nHussein may pursue a ``scorched earth'' policy if the war goes badly. \nThey said that Hussein may try to destroy Iraq's oil fields, power \nplants and food facilities.\n  In the Armed Services Committee, we heard testimony from General Hoar \nand others about the dangers to our troops of urban guerilla warfare.\n  War will be a disaster not just for the soldiers who suffer and die, \nbut for the vast numbers of innocent civilians who will be affected. In \nDecember, the media reprinted a confidential U.N. planning document \npredicting a humanitarian crisis in the wake of war with Iraq. U.N. \nofficials also predicted a halt to Iraqi oil production, serious \ndegradation of Iraqi transportation, sanitation and power facilities, \nand the ``outbreak of diseases in epidemic if not pandemic \nproportions.'' The document also predicted a flow of up to 900,000 \nrefugees.\n  War will not be as easy as the administration would like us to \nbelieve. It may well turn into the first great humanitarian catastrophe \nof the 21st century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The debate giving the President authority to use force \nagainst Iraq occurred over 3 months ago. Since then, circumstances have \nchanged so significantly that Congress\n\n[[Page S1716]]\n\nmust consider the issue of war and peace again.\n  The administration is also not adequately considering the massive \npolitical commitment that will be required to Iraq's long-term \nreconstruction. If we wage this war without allies, the United States \nwill assume a massive and lonely responsibility to rebuild Iraq, \npreserve its territorial integrity and prevent chaos. Going to war \nalone will impose massive new responsibilities that could extend for \nyears, if not decades.\n  The Senate debated giving the President authority to use force \nagainst Iraq over three months ago. Since then, circumstances have \nchanged so significantly that Congress must consider the issue of war \nand peace again.\n  Since our debate last fall, we have finally implemented, with our \nallies, an active process to verify Iraq's disarmament. That process is \nworking and should be allowed to continue. We must help this process \nalong and give persuasive intelligence information to U.N. weapons \ninspectors.\n  It is possible that the inspections process will fail or that new \nevidence will be uncovered about the threat from Saddam Hussein. But \nunder the current conditions, I continue to believe that this is the \nwrong war at the wrong time.\n  If we rush to pull the trigger against Iraq, we will invite \ncatastrophe and condemnation. America, which has long been a beacon of \nfreedom for people around the world, will turn into a symbol of brute \nforce and aggression. The world may come to see us as a dangerous rogue \nstate, needing to be contained and deterred. This is not the America \nthat Abraham Lincoln called ``the last, best hope of mankind.'' War now \nwould be alien to our values, contrary to our interests, and must not \nbe waged.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask that I be recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask for a point of clarification. I was waiting in \nthe queue. I have no objection to the Senator from Arizona going first. \nI ask unanimous consent that directly following Senator McCain, I be \ngranted a privilege of the floor for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  MR. McCAIN. Mr. President, over 3 months ago, I worked with Senators \nLieberman, Warner, and Bayh to manage the resolution authorizing the \nuse of military force against Iraq on the floor of the Senate. Over the \ncourse of 8 days, we held a thorough, comprehensive, and honorable \ndebate that allowed all sides to express their views quite thoroughly. \nSeventy-seven Senators then voted to authorize the President to use our \nArmed Forces to ``defend the national security of the United States \nagainst the continuing threat posed by Iraq'' and ``enforce all \nrelevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.''\n  The resolution, which now has the force of law, was entitled the \n``Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of \n2002.'' One provision stated, ``Consistent with . . . the War Powers \nResolution, the Congress declares that this section is intended to \nconstitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of \nsection 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution.'' Congress has spoken, and \nits message could not be clearer.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts spoke repeatedly and at length over \nthe course of the Congressional debate on Iraq. He spoke eloquently and \npassionately, in the great tradition of the Senate. At the end of the \nday, his views did not prevail, but he made an important contribution \nto the debate.\n  That debate is over. After a months-long period in which the Bush \nadministration went to the Security Council--as the Senator called for \nlast fall, secured a new Council resolution demanding Iraqi compliance \nwith it s disarmament obligations--as the Senator called for last fall, \nand pursued patient diplomacy while educating the American public about \nthe threat Iraq poses to our interests--as the Senator called for last \nfall, I agree with him that ``much has changed in the many months since \nCongress last debated war with Iraq.''\n  What has changed is that the Administration has pursued the careful \ndiplomacy the Senator had urged on it and has refrained from using \nforce unilaterally against Iraq. The President has worked to make the \ncase for Iraqi disarmament to America and the world. The administration \nwas able to unite the Security Council behind our demand that Iraq \ndisarm or be disarmed. And the administration has worked diligently to \nassemble a coalition that will stand with us in the event military \naction is necessary.\n  Iraq has provided more evidence of its intentions, and its defiance, \nby its failure to provide anything resembling an honest declaration of \nits arsenal of banned weaponry, and its failure to cooperate \nsubstantively with the U.N. inspectors, as Hans Blix has stated. By its \nown actions, Iraq has placed itself before the world in material breach \nof the Security Council resolution the Senator from Massachusetts \ndemanded the administration seek, and honor, in the congressional \ndebate last fall. I agree with the Senator, much has changed.\n  As the President said last night, ``The dictator of Iraq is not \ndisarming. To the contrary, he is deceiving.'' The price of his \ndeception, if allowed to continue unchecked, could have catastrophic \nconsequences for the United States which none of us, no matter how \nwe voted on the Iraq resolution, could ever countenance.\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts apparently believes we should revoke \nthe President's authority as Commander in Chief to order our Armed \nForces to defend American national security against the threat posed by \nIraq, as enshrined in the Constitution and authorized in law by \nCongress, unless and until there is clear evidence of an imminent Iraqi \nthreat of attack on the United States. But in the world we live in, \nthere is no such thing as knowledge of imminence of attack. Had we \nknown what was to happen to our country you September 11, 2001, there \nis no American leader who would not have acted to prevent it.\n  Every one of us in this body had contemplated what could have \nhappened had the September 11 terrorists employed weapons of mass \ndestruction. We cannot abide a world in which outlaw regimes deeply \nhostile to American are free to develop weapons which, in the hands of \ndictators and terrorists, would be used against us. As long as those \ndictators reign, and as long as terrorists plot to strike us, the \nthreat can be understood to be imminent, because we don't know when the \nnext attack will happen--and as long as we don't act we can say with \ncertainty that there will be another attack.\n  Speaking of the nexus between rogue states with deadly arsenals and \nthe terrorists with whom they conspire, the President said, ``If this \nthreat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all \nwords, and all recriminations would come too late. Trusting in the \nsanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not \nan option.''\n  While I respect my colleague's differences with the administration \nand with a substantial majority of the Congress on the matter of Iraq, \nI believe the case for action to disarm Saddam Hussein has only become \nmore compelling since Congress debated the authorization to use force \nagainst Iraq last fall.\n  When I heard earlier today--as the word gets out around here--that \nthe Senator from Massachusetts might come to the floor and propose \nanother resolution to be debated, I must say I was of two minds. I \nthought this would be another marvelous opportunity to debate this \namendment, this entire situation, because in the intervening months, as \nI have stated, Saddam Hussein has proven he is not in compliance not \nonly with the Security Council resolutions but going all the way back \nto 1991 when he was required, according to Security Council Resolution \n687, to comply within 15 days and has not. He has violated some 12 or \n13 Security Council resolutions. I thought this would be a great \nopportunity because there is no doubt in my mind we would prevail again \nif a vote were held.\n  I also, on the other side of the coin, believe if we start a debate \nall over again that lasts for another week or 2 weeks, or whatever it \nis, surely we would be plowing the same ground. But also, would we be \nsending a signal that the American people are not united? Would the \noutcome of the vote be basically the same? Would Senator Lieberman or \nSenator Bayh decide to\n\n[[Page S1717]]\n\nvote against the resolution that they so fervently and eloquently \nsupported on the floor of the Senate? I don't think so.\n  Another thing about this terrible and difficult decision the \nPresident may have to make--which is the most difficult that any \nPresident of the United States is faced with, the dispatch of young \nAmericans into harm's way--the President knows full well that even \nthough we will win an overwhelming victory, young Americans will lose \ntheir lives.\n  I believe that conflict will be short. I believe that in 1991 when I \ndebated this same situation where we contemplated previously the \nsubject of military action against Iraq, colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, including Senators who will speak and have spoken in \nopposition, said: It will be another Vietnam; the body bags will be \ncoming back; we should not do this; this is terrible; let's delay; \nlet's give peace a chance.\n  The conflict was short. We freed the nation of Kuwait, and for a \nperiod of time we had peace in the Middle East without significant \nthreats to the United States national security. Now we have to finish \nthe job, perhaps.\n  I say two things. One, I regret and grieve the loss of any American \nlives that might occur as a result of this military action. But our \ninterests are threatened, as the President said last night.\n\n  I also want to say a word about post-Saddam Iraq, since that has been \nreferred to continuously by those who oppose any military action under \nany circumstances.\n  The people of Iraq are subjected to one of the most brutal, \nrepressive, God-awful regimes in the world today. Last week's New York \nTimes told stories of warehouses where people were hung from hooks, of \nrape, of torture, of murder. Claire Shipman did an interview with one \nof Saddam Hussein's previous mistresses. He derived some kind of \npleasure watching films of people being tortured.\n  These are bad people, a bad regime that has killed and oppressed its \nown people; a complete and total police state. Where are the advocates \nfor human rights?\n  I promise you there are many of us, at the time of the fall of Saddam \nHussein, who will devote American effort and treasure to the \nconstruction of a democratic, freely elected, free society in Iraq, and \ngive those people a chance to enjoy the human rights that it is our \nfundamental belief is the endowment of all men and women.\n  As far as the expense is concerned, I am sure any new Iraqi \nGovernment could cover those expenses. But shouldn't we give those \npeople an opportunity to enjoy their God-given rights rather than \ncontinue under the dictatorship of this brutal, mad dictator? He is the \nonly one I know of who has used weapons of mass destruction on his own \ncitizens.\n  Yes, I will admit, if he wasn't constructing these weapons of mass \ndestruction, and his relentless pursuit of them, we probably wouldn't \ndo anything about it. But this is an interesting nexus of our national \ninterests and our national values. Our values are that all men and \nwomen are created with certain inalienable rights. Our interests are \nthreatened by the certain knowledge that, sooner or later, Saddam \nHussein would acquire these weapons and use them. There has been no \nevidence that would indicate the contrary.\n  I sort of regret we are coming to the floor to begin a debate that \nmay last for some days, whether the Senator from Massachusetts \nwithdraws his resolution or not. I hope not. I hope the Senator from \nMassachusetts will recognize that time was over 3 months ago, and the \nprocess moved on, a process of constant consultation with the American \npeople, and with the United Nations Security Council, and a speech that \nI think was remarkably eloquent last night to the American people by \nthe President of the United States.\n  But I want to say I believe some time from now we will be pleased as \nAmericans that we placed this responsibility in the hands of the \nPresident of the United States; that he acted with maturity; that he \nacted with great and sound judgment, and the world some time from now \nwill be a far better place--not only for Americans but also for Iraqi \ncitizens.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins) The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona for his comments. He certainly is one who does know about \nwar, and I believe he also believes that war should be a last resort.\n  I also thank the distinguished Senators from West Virginia and from \nMassachusetts for introducing this legislation which I have decided to \nbe a cosponsor. Because of my support for the resolution which gave the \nPresident authorization for use of force, I felt I probably should come \nto the floor and explain my rationale for supporting the resolution \noffered by the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Essentially, Hans Blix's report Monday to the Security Council made \nit clear that, although there has been progress, Iraq is not fully \nliving up to its obligations, nor is it fully cooperating. Then the \nPresident, in last night's State of the Union Message, made clear, I \nthink, some outstanding questions.\n  The first question is: What has Iraq done with 500 tons of Sarin, \nmustard gas precursor chemicals, and VX nerve agents? That tonnage is \nmissing. It has not been declared. It has not been revealed or has not \nbeen found.\n  The second question is: What has really happened to the 8,500 liters \nof anthrax which Iraq has stated it unilaterally destroyed in the \nsummer of 1991? But it cannot document that.\n  And third, what of the 650 kilograms of bacterial growth media? Those \nare critical items.\n  These are key and serious issues the answers to which clearly provide \nthe evidence as to whether Iraq possesses chemical and biological \nweapons.\n  The fourth item is the U-2 plane. The United Nations, as we all know, \nhas access to a U-2 plane to gather intelligence. However, Iraq has \nrefused to provide it safe overflight. This remains another issue of \nmajor non-cooperation.\n  So the administration is correct in saying that Iraq needs to be \nimmediately forthcoming and immediately cooperative with the \ninspectors. These issues need to be resolved. These are mega issues \nfrom anyone's point of view.\n  As long as the inspectors believe there is sufficient access and as \nlong as Iraq has said, specifically Tariq Aziz, that Iraq will even \noffer greater cooperation, I would say there ought to be a period of \ntime where Iraq provides to the world and to the inspectors, the \nanswers to these questions. I think it is vital.\n  If Iraq is found to pose an imminent threat to the United States, \nthen clearly we have to take action--with others I hope, if we can. But \nright now that is not the case. If, indeed, after consultations with \nthe Security Council, the administration has clear evidence that Iraq \nis continuing an illegal program to produce chemical and biological \nweapons, or nuclear weapons, or possesses these weapons, the time has \nreally come to make it public.\n  What the President did, in my view, was present very clearly, not \nonly to the Congress of the United States but to the entire world, \nsignificant questions that need to be immediately addressed. Iraq must, \nin fact, step up to the plate.\n  The reason I believe this resolution--which essentially asks for time \nfor inspections to continue, essentially urges a second vote at the \nSecurity Council--is right is because I believe this situation must \nstand on its own. The degree of threat and the degree of violation must \nbe separately evaluated. But it is also part of a much bigger scenario \nand I want to spend time discussing that scenario here today.\n  I believe America's national security policy stands at a crossroads. \nI believe in the wake of 9/11, last year was fundamental in terms of \nthe administration's articulation of what constitutes, to my mind, a \nbrand new approach to foreign policy by the United States. Within about \n8 months last year, the administration put out three separate \ndocuments. One of them was the National Security Strategy. The second \nwas the Nuclear Posture Review. The third was the Doctrine of \nPreemption as represented in the President's speech at West Point.\n  Although individually each may appear innocuous, taken together these\n\n[[Page S1718]]\n\ndocuments are revolutionary. They posit a world in which the exercise \nof U.S. military power is the central organizing principle for \ninternational affairs in this new century. These documents, in fact, \nput forward a litany of ways in which the United States will make \nmilitary activism and adventurism the basic tool for pursuing national \nsecurity.\n  First, the National Security Strategy quite pointedly moves the \nUnited States away from the concept of deterrence and, to a great \nextent, substitutes preemption in its place.\n  Secondly, the administration's Nuclear Posture Review is \nextraordinarily provocative and dangerous. It blurs the line between \nthe use of conventional and nuclear weapons. It suggests that certain \nevents might compel the United States to use nuclear weapons first, \neven against non-nuclear states. And it calls for the development of a \nnew generation of United States nuclear warheads, including ``mini-\nnukes.''\n  As was well documented in the press last year, the Review also \ndiscusses contingencies in which nuclear weapons might be used, \nincluding--and I quote--``a North Korean attack on South Korea or a \nmilitary confrontation over the status of Taiwan'' in which our \nadversaries do not necessarily use nuclear weapons first.\n  The Review also addresses contingencies in which the United States \nmight use nuclear weapons not in retaliation to a nuclear strike on the \nUnited States but to destroy enemy stocks of chemical or biological \narms.\n  Karl Rove was specifically asked that question on television on \nSunday, and he did not answer the question.\n  This Review also states that in setting requirements for nuclear \nstrike capabilities, distinctions can be made among immediate, \npotential or unexpected contingencies, and that North Korea, Iraq, \nIran, Syria and Libya are among the countries that could be involved in \nthese immediate, potential or unexpected contingencies.\n  That is what makes what is being suggested here in Iraq--if you look \nat it, in its total expression--so troubling.\n  The fact of the matter is that several of the nations cited in the \nNuclear Posture Review's contingencies lack nuclear weapons. Using \nnuclear weapons against them would be constitute first use. Under the \nNuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the United States has agreed not to \nuse nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state unless that country \nattacks the United States ``in alliance with a nuclear weapons state.''\n  And finally, the doctrine of Preemption--which we may be seeing for \nthe time with Iraq--asserts a unilateral right for the United States to \npreempt a threat against our Nation's security.\n  The doctrine says:\n\n       [T]he United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive \n     posture as we have in the past. . . . We cannot let our \n     enemies strike first.\n\n  Further on:\n\n       The greater the threat, the greater the risk of inaction--\n     and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory \n     action to defend ourselves.\n\n  Taken at face value, this means the United States holds for itself \nthe right to strike against another sovereign nation--wage war, if you \nwill--even in the absence of a clear and present danger, an immediate \nthreat or provocative action, but based solely on the perception of a \nsufficient threat.\n  I deeply believe the administration's course in these areas stands in \ncontrast to the successful bipartisan tradition of supporting a world \nordered by law, with capable international institutions and reciprocal \nrestraints on action.\n  But the administration's emphasis on unilateral action, its dismissal \nof international law, treaties, and institutions, and its apparent \nfocus on the military, especially as documented in the National \nSecurity Strategy, the doctrine of Preemption and the Nuclear Posture \nReview, have created widespread resentment in the international \ncommunity.\n  I believe that these documents are the clearest statements in writing \nof the administration's long-term intentions, and I find them \nquestionable and seriously disturbing.\n\n  I must also tell you that Secretary Powell essentially said to me: \nWell, the Nuclear Posture Review really isn't operative. But, \nnonetheless, that is a doctrine that was released. It is serious in its \nramifications. And the way this relates to Iraq is Iraq may be the \nfirst test case. If there are chemical and biological weapons--and \nthere very well might be--does this then justify the use of a nuclear \nweapon to destroy them? The Nuclear Posture Review puts this on the \ntable as an option. I think we need to know.\n  So I ask these questions because I think they must be asked. And this \nis as good a time as any.\n  If we are going to depend on the might of the sword to right wrongs, \nand in so doing risk committing our own wrongs, how are we better off?\n  Coalitions, alliances, treaties, peacekeepers, inspection regimes--\nall can and have been successful instruments in deterring adversaries, \nsafeguarding American lives and U.S. security interests, and in \nresolving disputes, conflicts, and crises.\n  So, Madam President, I remind this body that since World War II, \nthere has been strong bipartisan support of a United States which has \nembraced international cooperation, not out of vulnerability or \nweakness but from a position of strength.\n  House Joint Resolution 114, which I supported, and which authorizes \nthe use of force against Iraq, specifically calls for a Presidential \ndetermination, that--and I quote--``reliance by the United States on \nfurther diplomatic or other peaceful means alone either will not \nadequately protect the national security of the United States against \nthe continuing threat posed by Iraq or is not likely to lead to \nenforcement of all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions \nregarding Iraq.''\n  That finding, that determination, required by our resolution--for \nwhich 77 of us voted--has not yet been made. The evidence has not yet \nbeen laid out. The conclusions have not yet been drawn.\n  What happened to the missing anthrax, the missing botulinum toxin, \nthe missing VX nerve agent, the missing precursor chemicals, has not \nyet been determined. So that is why I come to the floor to say that it \nis critical that Iraq fully cooperate. It is critical that the \ninspectors be allowed to continue.\n  If Iraq does not come clean, if Iraq does not submit the \ndocumentation as to the disposition of these chemicals and biological \nagents, then a legitimate conclusion can be drawn. But the reason I \nbelieve arms inspections must be given a chance to succeed and must \ncontinue is that I believe Iraq is just one small part of a larger sea-\nchange in U.S. national security policy. It is a small part of the \ndoctrine of Preemption, in which we move against a perceived or real \nthreat. It is a small part of the Nuclear Posture Review, which says \nthe United States would countenance the use of nuclear weapons against \nhard and deeply buried targets or biological or chemical weapons.\n\n  So I believe that restraint is the proper course. It means that \ndiplomacy is a prudent course, and it means that if international law--\nif international bodies are to have any relevance in this new \nmillennium--then the Security Council itself must respond.\n  It is my deep belief that in the long run a foreign policy oriented \ntoward cooperation and consultation will prove to be a more effective \nguarantor of U.S. national security than one of unilateral impulse and \nconfrontation.\n  Let us remember that we are currently engaged in a war on terror. It \nis a war that, if we are to win it, will require the cooperation of our \nfriends and allies.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that if the United States acts \nprecipitously against Iraq, Taliban and al-Qaida fighters in the \nhinterland of Afghanistan are gathering today and are prepared to \nstrike against our forces there and against the government of Hamid \nKarzai.\n  And let us recall that beyond Iraq, there are a host of other \nchallenges--the situation in the Middle East, the nuclear crisis on the \nKorean peninsula--that require international cooperation and action. So \nI am deeply concerned that if we are not careful in our approach to \nIraq, if we do not present a just case, if we do not build an \ninternational coalition, we may well precipitate the very events we are \ntrying to prevent. For example, a preemptive unilateral attack against \na Muslim nation may well create a divide between the United States and \nthe Muslim world so deep and so wide that it\n\n[[Page S1719]]\n\nwill bring with it negative consequences for decades, and unforeseen \nones.\n  I deeply believe that if Iraq is in possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction, it poses a real threat to the entire international \ncommunity; and there is no doubt, as the President pointed out, that \nSaddam Hussein is an evil dictator.\n  But at this point I believe it would be a tremendous mistake for the \nUnited States to unilaterally attack Iraq, and I urge the \nadministration to go slow, let the inspectors do their work, and build \nthat international coalition. War should be a last resort, not a \nforegone conclusion.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to read from a speech of a \nPresident of the United States. In order that there be no question \nabout its source, I ask unanimous consent that at the end of my remarks \nthe speech in full be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I intend to read excerpts of the \nspeech. It is too long to read completely in the time allotted to me. I \nhope my friends on both sides of the aisle will listen to it because \nwhen I heard of this speech in the first instance, I was very impressed \nby it. I think the Senate should be reminded of it. I will start off \nwith this paragraph, and it is not the first, but I will call attention \nto it. The President said:\n\n       I have just received a very fine briefing from our military \n     leadership on the status of our forces in the Persian Gulf. \n     Before I left the Pentagon, I wanted to talk to you and all \n     those whom you represent, the men and women of our military.\n\n  The President was speaking to the force of generals of the United \nStates.\n\n       You, your friends, and your colleagues are on the \n     frontlines of this crisis in Iraq. I want you and I want the \n     American people to hear directly from me what is at stake for \n     America in the Persian Gulf; what we are doing to protect the \n     peace, the security, the freedom we cherish; why we have \n     taken the position we have taken.\n\n  I will now move down in the speech.\n\n       This is a time of tremendous promise for America. The \n     superpower confrontation has ended on every continent; \n     democracy is securing for more and more people the basic \n     freedoms we Americans have come to take for granted. Bit by \n     bit, the information age is chipping away at the barriers, \n     economic, political, and social, that once kept people locked \n     in and freedom and prosperity locked out.\n       But for all our promise, all our opportunity, people in \n     this room know very well that this is not a time free from \n     peril, especially as a result of reckless acts of outlaw \n     nations and an unholy axis of terrorists, drug traffickers, \n     and organized international criminals. We have to defend our \n     future from these predators of the 21st century. They feed on \n     the free flow of information and technology. They actually \n     take advantage of the freer movement of people, information, \n     and ideas. And they will be all the more lethal if we allow \n     them to build arsenals of nuclear, chemical, and biological \n     weapons and the missiles to deliver them. We simply cannot \n     allow that to happen.\n       There is no more clear example of this threat than Saddam \n     Hussein's Iraq. His regime threatens the safety of his \n     people, the stability of his region, and the security of all \n     the rest of us.\n       I want the American people to understand, first, the past: \n     How did this crisis come about? And I want them to understand \n     what we must do to protect the national interests and, \n     indeed, the interest of all freedom-loving people in the \n     world.\n       Remember, as a condition of the cease-fire after the Gulf \n     war, the United Nations demanded--not the United States, the \n     United Nations--and Saddam Hussein agreed to declare \n     within 15 days--this is way back in 1991--within 15 days \n     his nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and the \n     missiles to deliver them, to make a total declaration. \n     That's what he promised to do.\n       The United Nations set up a special commission of highly \n     trained international experts, called UNSCOM, to make sure \n     that Iraq made good on that commitment. We had every good \n     reason to insist that Iraq disarm. Saddam had built up a \n     terrible arsenal, and he used it, not once but many times. In \n     a decade-long war with Iran, he used chemical weapons against \n     combatants, against civilians, against a foreign adversary, \n     and even against his own people. During the Gulf war, Saddam \n     launched Scuds against Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Bahrain.\n       Now, instead of playing by the very rules he agreed to at \n     the end of the Gulf war, Saddam has spent the better part of \n     the past decade trying to cheat on this solemn commitment. \n     Consider just some of the facts. Iraq repeatedly made false \n     declarations about weapons that it had left in its possession \n     after the Gulf war. When UNSCOM would then uncover evidence \n     that gave lie to those declarations, Iraq would simply amend \n     the records. For example, Iraq revised its nuclear \n     declarations 4 times within just 14 months, and it has \n     submitted 6 different biological warfare declarations, each \n     of which has been rejected by UNSCOM.\n       In 1995, Hussein Kamel, Saddam's son-in-law and the chief \n     organizer of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program, \n     defected to Jordan. He revealed that Iraq was continuing to \n     conceal weapons and missiles and the capacity to build many \n     more. Then and only then did Iraq admit to developing numbers \n     of weapons in significant quantities and weapons stocks. \n     Previously, it had vehemently denied the very thing it just \n     simply admitted once Saddam Hussein's son-in-law defected to \n     Jordan and told the truth.\n       Now, listen to this. What did it admit? It admitted, among \n     other things, an offensive biological warfare capability, \n     notably 5,000 gallons of botulinum, which causes botulism; \n     2,000 gallons of anthrax; 25 biological-filled Scud warheads; \n     and 157 aerial bombs. And I might say, UNSCOM inspectors \n     believe that Iraq had actually greatly understated its \n     production. As if we needed further confirmation, you all \n     know what happened to his son-in-law when he made the \n     untimely decision to go back to Iraq.\n\n  He was killed, Madam President.\n\n       Next, throughout this entire process, Iraqi agents have \n     undermined and undercut UNSCOM. They've harassed the \n     inspectors, lied to them, disabled monitoring cameras, \n     literally spirited evidence out of the back doors of suspect \n     facilities as inspectors walked through the front door, and \n     our people were there observing it and have the pictures to \n     prove it.\n       Despite Iraq's deceptions, UNSCOM has, nevertheless, done a \n     remarkable job. Its inspectors, the eyes and ears of the \n     civilized world, have uncovered and destroyed more weapons of \n     mass destruction capacity than was destroyed during the Gulf \n     war. This includes nearly 40,000 chemical weapons, more than \n     100,000 gallons of chemical weapons agents, 48 operational \n     missiles, 30 warheads specifically fitted for chemical and \n     biological weapons, and a massive biological weapons \n     facility at Al Hakam equipped to produce anthrax and other \n     deadly agents. . . .\n       That is all we want. And if we can find a diplomatic way to \n     do what has to be done, to do what he promised to do at the \n     end of the Gulf war, to do what should have been done within \n     15 days--within 15 days of the agreement at the end of the \n     Gulf war--if we can find a diplomatic way to do that, that is \n     by far our preference. But to be a genuine solution and not \n     simply one that glosses over the remaining problem, a \n     diplomatic solution must include or meet a clear, immutable, \n     reasonable, simple standard: Iraq must agree, and soon, to \n     free, full, unfettered access to these sites, anywhere in the \n     country. There can be no dilution or diminishment of the \n     integrity of the inspection system that UNSCOM has put in \n     place.\n       Now, those terms are nothing more or less than the essence \n     of what he agreed to at the end of the Gulf war. The Security \n     Council many times since has reiterated this standard. If he \n     accepts them, force will not be necessary. If he refuses or \n     continues to evade his obligation through more tactics of \n     delay and deception, he, and he alone, will be to blame for \n     the consequences.\n       I ask all of you to remember the record here: what he \n     promised to do within 15 days at the end of the Gulf war, \n     what he repeatedly refused to do, what we found out in '95, \n     what the inspectors have done against all odds.\n       We have no business agreeing to any resolution of this that \n     does not include free, unfettered access to the remaining \n     sites by people who have integrity and proven competence in \n     the inspection business. That should be our standard. That's \n     what UNSCOM has done, and that's why I have been fighting for \n     it so hard. That's why the United States should insist upon \n     it.\n       Now, let's imagine the future. What if he fails to comply \n     and we fail to act, or we take some ambiguous third route \n     which gives him more opportunities to develop this program of \n     weapons of mass destruction and continue to press for the \n     release of sanctions and continue to ignore the solemn \n     commitments that he made? Well, he will conclude that the \n     international community has lost its will. He will then \n     conclude he can go right on and do more to rebuild an arsenal \n     of devastating destruction. And some day, some way, I \n     guarantee you, he'll use the arsenal. And I think every one \n     of you who has really worked on this for any length of time \n     believes that, too. . . .\n       If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our \n     purpose is clear: We want to seriously diminish the threat \n     posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program. We want \n     to seriously reduce his capacity to threaten his neighbors. I \n     am quite confident from the briefing I have just received \n     from our military leaders that we can achieve the objectives \n     and secure our vital strategic interests.\n       Let me be clear: A military operation cannot destroy all \n     the weapons of mass destruction capacity. But it can and will \n     leave him\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n\n     significantly worse off than he is now in terms of the \n     ability to threaten the world with these weapons or to attack \n     his neighbors. And he will know that the international \n     community continues to have the will to act if and when he \n     threatens again.\n       Following any strike, we will carefully monitor \n     Iraq's activities with all the means at our disposal. If \n     he seeks to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction, we \n     will be prepared to strike him again. The economic \n     sanctions will remain in place until Saddam complies fully \n     with all U.N. resolutions. . . .\n       Now, let me say to all of you here, as all of you know, the \n     weightiest decision any President ever has to make is to send \n     our troops into harm's way. And force can never be the first \n     answer. But sometimes it's the only answer.\n       You are the best prepared, best equipped, best trained \n     fighting force in the world. And should it prove necessary \n     for me to exercise the option of force, your commanders will \n     do everything they can to protect the safety of all the men \n     and women under their command. No military action, however, \n     is risk-free. I know that the people we may call upon in \n     uniform are ready. The American people have to be ready as \n     well.\n       Dealing with Saddam Hussein requires constant vigilance. We \n     have seen that constant vigilance pays off, but it requires \n     constant vigilance. Since the Gulf war we have pushed back \n     every time Saddam has posed a threat. When Baghdad plotted to \n     assassinate former President Bush, we struck hard at Iraq's \n     intelligence headquarters. When Saddam threatened another \n     invasion by massing his troops in Kuwait, along the Kuwaiti \n     border in 1994, we immediately deployed our troops, our \n     ships, our planes, and Saddam backed down. When Saddam \n     forcefully occupied Irbil in northern Iraq, we broadened our \n     control over Iraq's skies by extending the no-fly zone.\n       But there is no better example, again I say, than the U.N. \n     weapons inspections system itself. Yes, he has tried to \n     thwart it in every conceivable way. But the discipline, \n     determination, the year-in, year-out effort of these weapons \n     inspectors is doing the job. And we seek to finish the job.\n       Let there be no doubt, we are prepared to act. But Saddam \n     Hussein could end this crisis tomorrow, simply by letting the \n     weapons inspectors complete their mission. He made a solemn \n     commitment to the international community to do that and to \n     give up his weapons of mass destruction a long time ago, now. \n     One way or the other, we are determined to see that he makes \n     good on his own promise. . . .\n       That is the future I ask you all to imagine. That is the \n     future I ask our allies to imagine. If we look at the past \n     and imagine that future, we will act as one together. And we \n     still have, God willing, a chance to find a diplomatic \n     resolution to this and, if not, God willing, a chance to do \n     the right thing for our children and grandchildren.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n  That speech was made by President Clinton on February 17, 1998. I \nfind it very strange that my friends on the other side of the aisle--\nand they are my friends--are attacking President Bush for having made \nstatements weaker than these statements.\n  If one reads this statement in full, the President of the United \nStates, then speaking to the generals who command all our forces, told \nthem to be ready. He had just had the briefing. He had the briefing \nthat convinced him in 1998 that he might have to act as President to \ntake military action against Saddam Hussein.\n  Five years later, another President is saying the same thing, and he \nis attacked. We never attacked President Clinton. We never doubted his \nsincerity. But now my friends--and they are my friends--are saying that \nthis President does not know what he is doing. I believe the President \nknows what he is doing, and I think he made a masterful statement \nlast night of the position in which the United States finds itself. It \nis not different from the position President Clinton was in in 1998. \nShould he be in this position now? Should we have done something in the \ninterim? The answer is simply yes. We should have done something years \nago--gone to the U.N. and said: If you are going to have any meaning in \nthe world at all, you must insist that Saddam Hussein obey the mandates \nyou have issued.\n\n  I come from a State that has a great many of our military planes, and \nI talk to our military pilots wherever I travel in the world. One thing \nis clear: Our pilots, our Air Force pilots have been enforcing the no-\nfly zones since 1991. They have been flying every day in harm's way. \nThey have been shot at nearly every week. We retaliated, retaliated, \nretaliated, but young men and women are up there tonight flying planes \nover portions of Iraq, at the insistence of the United Nations that we \nprevent Saddam Hussein from having any aircraft in those zones in the \nnorth and south. We are following their request. We are carrying out \nthat operation at our expense and with our pilots, with our planes, and \nwe have been doing it now since 1991.\n  How long will this continue? How long do we have to fly to prevent \nSaddam Hussein from having weapons in the air that are really minuscule \ncompared to what is on the ground--weapons of mass destruction, that \nPresident Clinton described adequately and succinctly and honorably in \n1998.\n  Madam President, I think it is high time we came together. I am \nsincerely disappointed that we do not have a uniform force here, that \nwe do not have a uniform force right here on the floor of the Senate \nsaying: Mr. President, we understand that you--as did President \nClinton--have in front of you a horrendous decision to make. When do we \nhave to go in and destroy these weapons?\n  How many weapons has he created since 1998? How much more difficult \nwill it be to find those weapons than it would have been in 1998? I say \nin all sincerity, as one who has watched over the Defense Department's \nappropriations now since 1981, either I or my friend from Hawaii, the \ntwo of us jointly have done that job. We have been to this part of the \nworld of the Persian Gulf many times.\n  This is an awesome problem that faces the President of the United \nStates. We should help him, not challenge his decision and what he is \ndoing. He is asking the world to come together to demand that Saddam \nHussein do what he agreed to do in 1991, as President Clinton \nrepeatedly said in his statement, and as our President, President Bush, \nhas said before the U.N. in a masterful statement he made when he went \nbefore the U.N.\n  The time is now for us to come together and realize we are \napproaching decision time. I served in combat in World War II, and many \nof us know the awesome days we went through then. They were nothing \ncompared to what this world will be if Saddam Hussein ever uses those \nweapons of mass destruction. I think we have changed our way of life. \nWe have changed our lifestyles. We have already been affected by his \ncollusion with the al-Qaida force, and those people who are part of \nthat terrible force.\n  President Clinton called it the unholy axis. President Bush called it \nthe evil axis and has been criticized for saying so. President Clinton \nsaid we have to defend our future from these predators of the 21st \ncentury, and I say things are worse today than they were in 1998.\n  I am one of those who gets these intelligence briefings. I have told \nmy wife when I come home after those briefings I find it hard to think \nabout the work I have to do other than just think about these terrible \nintelligence reports. This is not a simple world we live in, but it is \na world in which I believe the freedom-loving people look to us for \nleadership. I say, thank God we have a leader who means what he says, \nand I am willing to follow him when he says it is necessary to use \nforce if that day ever comes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President, for your remarks \n     and your leadership. Thank you, Secretary Cohen, for the \n     superb job you have done here at the Pentagon and on this \n     most recent, very difficult problem. Thank you, General \n     Shelton, for being the right person at the right time. Thank \n     you, General Ralston, and the members of the Joint Chiefs, \n     General Zinni, Secretary Albright, Secretary Slater, DCI \n     Tenet, Mr. Bowles, Mr. Berger. Senator Robb, thank you for \n     being here, and Congressman Skelton, thank you very much, and \n     for your years of service to America and your passionate \n     patriotism, both of you, and to the members of our Armed \n     Forces and others who work here to protect our national \n     security.\n       I have just received a very fine briefing from our military \n     leadership on the status of our forces in the Persian Gulf. \n     Before I left the Pentagon I wanted to talk to you and all \n     those whom you represent, the men and women of our military. \n     You, your friends, and your colleagues are on the frontlines \n     of this crisis in Iraq. I want you and I want the American \n     people to hear directly from me what is at stake for America \n     in the Persian Gulf; what we are doing to protect the peace, \n     the security, the freedom we cherish; why we have taken the \n     position we have taken.\n       I was thinking, as I sat up here on the platform, of the \n     slogan that the First Lady gave me for her project on the \n     millennium, which was: Remembering the past and imagining the \n     future. Now, for that project, that means preserving the \n     Star-Spangled Banner and the Declaration of Independence and \n     the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and it means\n\n[[Page S1721]]\n\n     making an unprecedented commitment to medical research and to \n     get the best of the new technology. But that's not a bad \n     slogan for us when we deal with more sober, more difficult, \n     more dangerous matters.\n       Those who have questioned the United States in this moment, \n     I would argue, are living only in the moment. They have \n     neither remembered the past nor imagined the future. So, \n     first, let's just take a step back and consider why meeting \n     the threat posed by Saddam Hussein is important to our \n     security in the new era we are entering.\n       This is a time of tremendous promise for America. The \n     superpower confrontation has ended on every continent; \n     democracy is securing for more and more people the basic \n     freedoms we Americans have come to take for granted. Bit by \n     bit, the information age is chipping away at the barriers, \n     economic, political, and social, that once kept people locked \n     in and freedom and prosperity locked out.\n       But for all our promise, all our opportunity, people in \n     this room know very well that this is not a time free from \n     peril, especially as a result of reckless acts of outlaw \n     nations and an unholy axis of terrorists, drug traffickers, \n     and organized international criminals. We have to defend our \n     future from these predators of the 21st century. They feed on \n     the free flow of information and technology. They actually \n     take advantage of the freer movement of people, \n     information, and ideas. And they will be all the more \n     lethal if we allow them to build arsenals of nuclear, \n     chemical, and biological weapons and the missiles to \n     deliver them. We simply cannot allow that to happen.\n       There is no more clear example of this threat than Saddam \n     Hussein's Iraq. His regime threatens the safety of his \n     people, the stability of his region, and the security of all \n     the rest of us.\n       I want the American people to understand, first, the past: \n     How did this crisis come about? And I want them to understand \n     what we must do to protect the national interest and, indeed, \n     the interest of all freedom-loving people in the world.\n       Remember, as a condition of the cease-fire after the Gulf \n     war, the United Nations demanded--not the United States, the \n     United Nations demanded--and Saddam Hussein agreed to declare \n     within 15 days--this is way back in 1991--within 15 days his \n     nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and the missiles to \n     deliver them, to make a total declaration. That's what he \n     promised to do.\n       The United Nations set up a special commission of highly \n     trained international experts, called UNSCOM, to make sure \n     that Iraq made good on that commitment. We had every good \n     reason to insist that Iraq disarm. Saddam had built up a \n     terrible arsenal, and he had used it, not once but many \n     times. In a decade-long war with Iran, he used chemical \n     weapons against combatants, against civilians, against a \n     foreign adversary, and even against his own people. And \n     during the Gulf war, Saddam launched Scuds against Saudi \n     Arabia, Israel, and Bahrain.\n       Now, instead of playing by the very rules he agreed to at \n     the end of the Gulf war, Saddam has spent the better part of \n     the past decade trying to cheat on this solemn commitment. \n     Consider just some of the facts. Iraq repeatedly made false \n     declarations about the weapons that it had left in its \n     possession after the Gulf war. When UNSCOM would then uncover \n     evidence that gave lie to those declarations, Iraq would \n     simply amend the reports. For example, Iraq revised its \n     nuclear declarations 4 times with just 14 months, and it has \n     submitted six different biological warfare declarations, each \n     of which has been rejected by UNSCOM.\n       In 1995, Hussein Kamel, Saddam's son-in-law and the chief \n     organizer of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program, \n     defected to Jordan. He revealed that Iraq was continuing to \n     conceal weapons and missiles and the capacity to build many \n     more. Then and only then did Iraq admit to developing numbers \n     of weapons in significant quantities and weapons stocks. \n     Previously it had vehemently denied the very thing it just \n     simply admitted once Saddam Hussein's son-in-law defected to \n     Jordan and told the truth.\n       Now, listen to this. What did it admit? It admitted, among \n     other things, an offensive biological warfare capability, \n     notably 5,000 gallons of botulinum, which causes botulism; \n     2,000 gallons of anthrax; 25 biological-filled Scud warheads; \n     and 157 aerial bombs. And I might say, UNSCOM inspectors \n     believe that Iraq has actually greatly understated its \n     production. As if we needed further confirmation, you all \n     know what happened to his son-in-law when he made the \n     untimely decision to go back to Iraq.\n       Next, throughout this entire process, Iraqi agents have \n     undermined and undercut UNSCOM. They've harassed the \n     inspectors, lied to them, disabled monitoring cameras, \n     literally spirited evidence out of the back doors of suspect \n     facilities as inspectors walked through the front door, and \n     our people were there observing it and have the pictures to \n     prove it.\n       Despite Iraq's deceptions UNSCOM has, nevertheless, done a \n     remarkable job. Its inspectors, the eyes and ears of the \n     civilized world, have uncovered and destroyed more weapons of \n     mass destruction capacity than was destroyed during the Gulf \n     war. This includes nearly 40,000 chemical weapons, more than \n     100,000 gallons of chemical weapons agents, 48 operational \n     missiles, 30 warheads specifically fitted for chemical \n     biological weapons, and a massive biological weapons \n     facility at Al Hakam equipped to produce anthrax and other \n     deadly agents.\n       Over the past few months, as they have come closer and \n     closer to rooting out Iraq's remaining nuclear capacity, \n     Saddam has undertaken yet another gambit to thwart their \n     ambition by imposing debilitating conditions on the \n     inspectors and declaring key sites which have still not been \n     inspected off limits, including, I might add, one palace in \n     Baghdad more than 2,600 acres large. By comparison--when you \n     hear all this business about ``Presidential sites reflect our \n     sovereignty; why do you want to come into a residence?''--the \n     White House complex is 18 acres, so you'll have some feel for \n     this. One of these Presidential sites is about the size of \n     Washington, DC. That's about--how many acres did you tell me \n     it was--40,000 acres. We're not talking about a few rooms \n     here with delicate personal matters involved.\n       It is obvious that there is an attempt here, based on the \n     whole history of this operation since 1991, to protect \n     whatever remains of his capacity to produce weapons of mass \n     destruction, the missiles to deliver them, and the feedstocks \n     necessary to produce them. The UNSCOM inspectors believe that \n     Iraq still has stockpiles of chemical and biological \n     munitions, a small force of Scud-type missiles, and the \n     capacity to restart quickly its production program and build \n     many, many more weapons.\n       Now, against that background, let us remember the past, \n     here. It is against that background that we have repeatedly \n     and unambiguously made clear our preference for a diplomatic \n     solution. The inspection system works. The inspection system \n     has worked in the face of lies, stonewalling, obstacle after \n     obstacle after obstacle. The people who have done that work \n     deserve the thanks of civilized people throughout the world. \n     It has worked.\n       That is all we want. And if we can find a diplomatic way to \n     do what has to be done, to do what he promised to do at the \n     end of the Gulf War, to do what should have been done within \n     15 days--within 15 days of the agreement at the end of the \n     Gulf war--if we can find a diplomatic way to do that, that is \n     by far our preference. But to be a genuine solution and not \n     simply one that glosses over the remaining problem, a \n     diplomatic solution must include or meet a clear, immutable, \n     reasonable, simple standard: Iraq must agree, and soon, to \n     free, full, unfettered access to these sites, anywhere in the \n     country. There can be no dilution or diminishment of the \n     integrity of the inspection system that UNSCOM has put in \n     place.\n       Now, those terms are nothing more or less than the essence \n     of what he agreed to at the end of the Gulf war. The Security \n     Council many times since has reiterated this standard. If he \n     accepts them, force will not be necessary. If he refuses or \n     continues to evade his obligation through more tactics of \n     delay and deception, he, and he alone, will be to blame for \n     the consequences.\n       I ask all of you to remember the record here: what he \n     promised to do within 15 days of the end of the Gulf war, \n     what he repeatedly refused to do, what we found out in '95, \n     what the inspectors have done against all odds.\n       We have no business agreeing to any resolution of this that \n     does not include free, unfettered access to the remaining \n     sites by people who have integrity and proven competence in \n     the inspection business. That should be our standard. That's \n     what UNSCOM has done, and that's why I have been fighting for \n     it so hard. That's why the United States should insist upon \n     it.\n       Now let's imagine the future. What if he fails to comply \n     and we fail to act, or we take some ambiguous third route \n     which gives him yet more opportunities to develop this \n     program of weapons of mass destruction and continue to press \n     for the release of the sanctions and continue to ignore the \n     solemn commitments that he made? Well, he will conclude that \n     the international community has lost its will. He will then \n     conclude that he can go right on and do more to rebuild an \n     arsenal of devastating destruction. And some day, some way, I \n     guarantee you, he'll use the arsenal. And I think every one \n     of you who has really worked on this for any length of time \n     believes that, too.\n       Now, we have spent several weeks building up our forces in \n     the Gulf and building a coalition of like-minded nations. Our \n     force posture would not be possible without the support of \n     Saudi Arabia, of Kuwait, Bahrain, the GCC States, and Turkey. \n     Other friends and allies have agreed to provide forces, \n     bases, or logistical support, including the United Kingdom, \n     Germany, Spain and Portugal, Denmark and The Netherlands, \n     Hungary and Poland and the Czech Republic, Argentina, \n     Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, and our friends and \n     neighbors in Canada. That list is growing, not because anyone \n     wants military action but because there are people in this \n     world who believe the United Nations resolution should mean \n     something, because they understand what UNSCOM has achieved, \n     because they remember the past, and because they can imagine \n     what the future will be, depending on what we do now.\n       If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our \n     purpose is clear: We want to seriously diminish the threat \n     posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program. We want \n     to seriously reduce his capacity to threaten his neighbors. I \n     am quite confident from the briefing I have just received \n     from our military leaders that we can achieve the objectives \n     and secure our vital strategic interests.\n       Let me be clear: A military operation cannot destroy all \n     the weapons of mass destruction capacity. But it can and will \n     leave him\n\n[[Page S1722]]\n\n     significantly worse off than he is now in terms of the \n     ability to threaten the world with these weapons or to attack \n     his neighbors. And he will know that the international \n     community continues to have will to act if and when he \n     threatens again.\n       Following any strike, we will carefully monitor Iraq's \n     activities with all the means at our disposal. If he seeks to \n     rebuild his weapons of mass destruction we will be prepared \n     to strike him again. The economic sanctions will remain in \n     place until Saddam complies fully with all U.N. resolution.\n       Consider this: Already these sanctions have denied him $110 \n     billion. Imagine how much stronger his armed forces would be \n     today, how many more weapons of mass destruction operations \n     he would have hidden around the country if he had been able \n     to spend even a small fraction of that amount for a military \n     rebuilding.\n       We will continue to enforce a no-fly zone from the southern \n     suburbs of Baghdad to the Kuwait border and in northern Iraq, \n     making it more difficult for Iraq to walk over Kuwait again \n     and threaten the Kurds in the north.\n       Now, let me say to all of you here, as all of you know, the \n     weightiest decision any President ever has to make is to send \n     our troops into harm's way. And force can never be the first \n     answer. But sometimes it's the only answer.\n       You are the best prepared, best equipped, best trained \n     fighting force in the world. And should it prove necessary \n     for me to exercise the option of force, you commanders will \n     do everything they can to protect the safety of all the men \n     and women under their command. No military action, however, \n     is risk-free. I know that the people we may call upon in \n     uniform are ready. The American people have to be ready as \n     well.\n       Dealing with Saddam Hussein requires constant vigilance. We \n     have seen that constant vigilance pays off, but it requires \n     constant vigilance. Since the Gulf war we have pushed back \n     every time Saddam has posed a threat. When Baghdad plotted to \n     assassinate former President Bush, we struck hard at Iraq's \n     intelligence headquarters. When Saddam threatened another \n     invasion by massing his troops in Kuwait, along the Kuwaiti \n     border in 1994, we immediately deployed our troops, our \n     ships, our planes, and Saddam backed down. When Saddam \n     forcefully occupied Irbil in northern Iraq, we broadened our \n     control over Iraq's skies by extending the no-fly zone.\n       But there is no better example, again I say, than the U.N. \n     weapons inspections system itself, Yes, he has tried to \n     thwart it in every conceivable way. But the discipline, \n     determination, the year-in, year-out effort of these weapons \n     inspectors is doing the job. And we seek to finish the job.\n       Let there be no doubt, we are prepared to act. But Saddam \n     Hussein could end this crisis tomorrow, simply by letting the \n     weapons inspectors complete their mission. He made a solemn \n     commitment to the international community to do that and to \n     give up his weapons of mass destruction a long time ago, now. \n     One way or the other, we are determined to see that he makes \n     good on his own promise.\n       Saddam Hussein's Iraq reminds us of what we learned in the \n     20th century and warns us of what we must know about the \n     21st. In this century we learned through harsh experience \n     that the only answer to aggression and illegal behavior is \n     firmness, determination, and, when necessary, action. In the \n     next century, the community of nations may see more and more \n     the very kind of threat Iraq poses now: a rogue state with \n     weapons of mass destruction, ready to use them or provide \n     them to terrorists, drug traffickers, or organized criminals, \n     who travel the world among us unnoticed.\n       If we fail to respond today, Saddam and all those who would \n     follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow by the \n     knowledge that they can act with impunity, even in the face \n     of a clear message from the United Nations Security Council \n     and clear evidence of a weapons of mass destruction program. \n     But if we act as one, we can safeguard our interests and send \n     a clear message to every would-be tyrant and terrorist that \n     the international community does have the wisdom and the will \n     and the way to protect peace and security in a new era.\n       That is the future I ask you all to imagine. That is the \n     future I ask our allies to imagine. If we look at the past \n     and imagine that future, we will act as one together. And we \n     still have, God willing, a chance to find a diplomatic \n     resolution to this and, if not, God willing, a chance to do \n     the right thing for our children and grandchildren.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n       Note: The President spoke at 12:37 p.m. in the auditorium. \n     In his remarks, be referred to President Saddam Hussein of \n     Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I commend our distinguished senior colleague from Alaska. \nHe speaks with a corporate memory dating back to when at age 17 he went \ninto World War II and, as he said, flew those combat missions.\n  I am proud of what the President has shown by way of leadership, and \nI said the other night, yes, I feel I know most of the facts but he may \nknow a few more, and I repose trust in his judgment and his team to \nmake the right decision. I wish to associate myself with the remarks of \nmy distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, Senator Stevens is the senior \nRepublican in terms of time--I am sure many people do not know it, but \nI am second--and I want to say I am very proud that he has said what he \nsaid.\n  Many people speak all the time. The Senator from Alaska speaks when \nit is important. He does not come to the Chamber and engage himself in \nrhetoric. He is too busy doing tough work. He understands this issue.\n  Truly, many of the Democrats ought to be ashamed of themselves. We \ntry to support Presidents. We would have supported President Bill \nClinton if he had done what he was talking about in that statement the \nSenator read. I do not think there is any doubt about it. We would not \nhave questioned whether he had the right security briefing and whether \nhe knew what he was doing.\n  Our President has been warning us, he has been going back to the \ntable, letting the inspectors go in again, coming to the American \npeople, going to the U.N., and nothing happens. As a matter of fact, I \nbelieve it is correct, when the Senator cites the date that President \nClinton gave that speech, I do not believe anything of a positive \nnature has happened in Iraq at the hands of Saddam Hussein since that \ntime. It has gotten worse, if anything. He has not ameliorated or made \nanything better, to my knowledge, and look what it was like on the date \nthe Senator read in his statement.\n  I commend the Senator, and I do believe the resolution introduced \ntoday ought not deter anyone from what we are doing. It ought not \nchange minds in this Senate which voted overwhelmingly in support of \nour President. I thank the Senator for what he has said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I am delighted to join my colleagues \nin talking about the situation in Iraq and what the President has said \nand what some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nsaying, that we need to wait, and wait longer.\n  I will make a few simple points. I have served on the Middle East \nsubcommittee since I have been in the Senate. I have chaired it for a \ngood portion of the time. I have worked on the issue of Iraq since \n1996. I have worked with the Iraqi opposition. I have held hearings on \nthis topic. We have had meetings with the then UNSCOM inspectors. We \nhave really worked the full gamut of what is taking place in Iraq. My \ncolleagues on the other side want to wait longer. We have waited 12 \nyears. How much longer do we need to wait?\n  They want to allow the weapons inspectors to work longer. We had them \nin there for a number of years and then Saddam Hussein threw them out. \nThey have only been back for a short period of time. I remind my \ncolleagues that we were not finding anything when the weapons \ninspectors were there prior to 1998. We did not find anything until we \nhad some high level defections on the part of the Iraqis. That is when \nwe started finding things.\n  Iraq is a country the size of California. It has a dedicated leader \nwho is seeking to thwart the will of the international community to \ndisarm. He is trying to hide items that may be the size of a 5-gallon \nbucket. He is manufacturing biological weapons and moving them on \nmobile units the size of a van. He is trying to hide them in a place \nthe size of California, and there are only 120 inspectors in Iraq, as \nthe President suggested last night, in some sort of scavenger hunt. The \nidea was not that we would go into Iraq and have to find these items. \nIt was that Iraq would step forward and disarm and say we agree, we are \ngoing to disarm. That was what they were supposed to do, come forward \nand disarm. Instead, we have this hide-and-seek that Saddam continues. \nIt is what he did when we had weapons inspectors in Iraq previously. It \nis what he continues to do now.\n  What happens if we wait? Let's say we agree we are going to wait. \nMaybe we will find something, maybe not. What if we do find something \nelse? Is that going to be enough for us to move forward and say we need \nto completely disarm Saddam Hussein? I think we are\n\n[[Page S1723]]\n\nleft with a similar set of circumstances-plus, if we do not do \nanything.\n  Let's say we do not do anything, we let this go on for another couple \nof years because there is not an impetus now to really move. Saddam has \nbiological and chemical weapons. He has terrorists on his soil. At any \ntime, he can easily start distributing the chemical and biological \nweapons to terrorists, who know no bounds. I could easily see us in 2 \nyears with a special committee of the Senate, holding hearings as to \nhow did these biological weapons come in from Iraq, that were \ndistributed to terrorists, to be used against U.S. citizens. I think it \nis a clear possibility that it would occur.\n  Nobody wants to go to war. None of us want to do that. That is an \nabsolute last option. We have been working for 12 years with economic \nsanctions. We have been working for 12 years with no-fly zones. We have \nbeen working with the Iraqi opposition. We have been doing everything \nwe can, and yet now we are at this point in time where he has \nterrorists and weapons of mass destruction together on his soil, and \nmore people are saying, wait.\n\n  Wait for what? So they can distribute them further? So that he can \nattack us?\n  I realize we all have difficulty with moving forward to a war \nsituation. We do not want to do that. We want to respond if somebody \ncomes at us. The problem with this new war on terrorism is that the \nterrorists, when they attack, attack civilian targets. They want to try \nand kill as many people as possible. By our waiting, we actually invite \nthem to come forward.\n  Some might suggest if we act, we are going to further foment \ndifficulty in the region of the United States. I point out that even \nprior to September 11, we had 10 years where there were attacks on the \nUnited States, on our people, in foreign places by these terrorist \ngroups. We had two embassies in Africa that were attacked by terrorist \ngroups. We had the USS Cole attacked by terrorist groups. We had Khobar \nTowers. They have attacked us for a period of 10 years.\n\n  People are saying, show restraint or else they will act more. We have \nseen it for 10 years, showing restraint. Then we had September 11, and \nwe responded aggressively in Afghanistan. That was a fully appropriate \nway to respond. If we wait for the terrorists, they will continue to \ncome at us. If we sit and wait, it does not mean they will stop. They \nwill not stop. They have not stopped in the past. They are going to \ncontinue to come at the United States because they do not believe in \nwhat we believe. They are attacking our sets of values by attacking our \ncivilians, our civilian population.\n  No one wants to go to war. That is the last thing anyone wants. In \nthis situation, not to move forward is to invite more catastrophic \nevents to happen to our citizenry and to citizens around the world.\n  Remember, terrorists go at soft targets. They go at the twin towers. \nThey do not go at military targets. They did go at the Pentagon, but \nthey went at Bali most recently. They will continue to go at civilian \ntargets. They will go at the soft targets. If they have biological and \nchemical weapons, they will kill that many more people if we fail to \nact.\n  I was raised in Kansas. On Saturday night, we would watch \n``Gunsmoke.'' That was a great show and a favorite of mine. At the end \nof every ``Gunsmoke'' episode, Matt Dillon walks out on Main Street and \nthe bad guy walks out on Main Street. They face off. The bad guy pulls \nthe gun, Matt shoots, and the other guy goes down. That is the way \nevery show ended: Nice, clean, good versus evil. Evil at the last \nminute is allowed to walk away. He could walk away or he is going down. \nHe never does. He pulls his gun, and Matt Dillon always shoots him \ndown.\n  There is a sense of honor that we always let the other side, the bad \nside, go first. You get to pull the trigger because you always have a \nchance to walk away. What if we do that with terrorists? We have a \nsense of honor that we should let the other side go first. If you let \nterrorists go first, they do not walk out on Main Street of Dodge City \nand face Matt Dillon. They go around the back alleys. They are looking \nfor people who are sleeping. They are looking for families. They are \nnot looking for someone who is armed. They are looking for soft targets \nto hit, kill, and destroy. That is what they will continue to do.\n  Now, taking the other side of the argument, what if we do move? What \nif Saddam Hussein is moved out of power, as has been the stated policy \nof the United States since 1998 with the Iraq Liberation Act which \nPresident Bill Clinton signed into law? What if Saddam Hussein is \nremoved from power by a coalition of the willing--it will be an \ninternational coalition--what takes place then?\n  We have a group of people, Iraqi opposition and others, who have been \nworking on a democratic Iraq with opportunities for all people, for \nhuman rights, for people to be able to vote and to express their \ndesires for that country. We have a country that sits on 10 percent of \nthe world oil supplies and an ability to rebuild itself, an educated \npopulation that is willing to change. They want to change now. Iraqi \nopposition is united. We are hearing from people inside of Iraq who \nwant to see a change. People inside the Iraq Government, inside the \nIraq military, want to get out and into a different situation.\n  Look at the seeds of change sown within Iraq and that region, if you \nhave coming forward a democracy, with human rights, with religious \nfreedom, with freedom for women, with people able to vote and \nparticipate and a marketplace that allows people to participate. Look \nat the future for the people there in that region, in that country, if \nthat is what takes place. There is a substantial positive benefit.\n\n  It all is with risk. It all has risk. Whether you choose to act or \nwhether you choose not to act, they both have risk. After looking at \nthis matter for some period of time, the option of not acting has far \nmore risk--little, if any, upside potential--than the choice of acting. \nAnd the choice of acting has a downside potential. But it has \nsubstantial upside potential, and it does not have the downside that \nnot acting has.\n  Clearly, the President and his Cabinet and the people have thought \nthis through. It is an extraordinarily difficult choice. Saddam Hussein \nstill has the choice. He can still choose today to disarm and to engage \nin the international communities and comply with the 12 U.N. \nresolutions that have followed in the 12 years since he invaded Kuwait.\n  I point out, we need to remember: Saddam Hussein has attacked two \nadjacent countries. He has used chemical weapons against his own people \nand against the Iranians. He has used these weapons in the past. He has \nthreatened to attack, and has attacked, his neighbors in the past. This \nis not a good man. He is not good for the world. He is certainly not \ngood for the region. He does not get better with time, nor does the \nsituation get better with time. The obligations only get worse.\n  For all these reasons, I applaud what the President has done. I \napplaud that he came to the Congress in the first place asking for a \nresolution. He got it. He got broad bipartisan support. I applaud that \nhe went to the United Nations and got a resolution with broad \ninternational support. He has done the things we have asked. And now he \nis coming forward and saying: Look, Saddam Hussein, the time is running \nout. Either act now or actions will be taken.\n  The President has done most of the things we have asked him to do. He \nhas tried to engage the world and get an international coalition. A \nnumber of other countries will join. We should back the administration \nat this point and not try to do more second-guessing or buying of time \nfor Saddam Hussein to develop more weaponry, to develop more terrorist \nnetworks to supply and provide the things the terrorist networks want \nto be able to threaten and to kill our people.\n  For all these reasons, I hope we will not back a resolution calling \nfor allowing of more time and, instead, support the administration's \nefforts as they move forward, trying to find a peaceful solution but, \nif not, forcing Saddam Hussein to choose whether he is going to hold on \nto his weapons of mass destruction or whether he is going to hold on to \npower. It is a difficult choice the President has to make and we have \nto make. We have looked at this pretty thoroughly.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1724]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise tonight in strong support for the \nnomination of Secretary Gordon England to be the first Deputy Secretary \nof Homeland Security. I thank the majority leader, in cooperation with \nthe Democratic leader, for promptly scheduling the Senate's \nconsideration of this very important nomination.\n  President Bush nominated Secretary England on January 7. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which I am privileged to chair, held a \nhearing on his nomination last Friday, and today, I am pleased to \nreport, the committee unanimously voted to discharge the nominee from \nconsideration. The committee thoroughly considered the nomination at a \nhearing on Friday. In addition, Secretary England responded to \nextensive prehearing questions about a wide variety of issues.\n  I have no doubt, based on my review of the record, and my conducting \nof the hearing, that Secretary England is extraordinarily well \nqualified for this position. In fact, it is difficult for me to think \nof two more qualified Americans than Tom Ridge and Gordon England to \nhead up this vital new Department.\n  Secretary England currently serves as Secretary of the Navy. As a \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have gotten to know \nhim well in that capacity. I have enormous regard for his ability. He \nhas held that position since May of 2001.\n  Prior to becoming our Secretary of the Navy, Gordon England had an \nimpressive portfolio of management experience. He served as executive \nvice president of General Dynamics Corporation, and he previously \nserved in various executive positions at a number of General Dynamics \ndivisions. His experience in both the public and the private sectors \nwill provide him with exactly the experience and expertise needed to \noversee the merger of some 22 agencies and 170,000 Federal employees \nthat will be transferred into this new Department.\n  As preparation for being Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, it \nwould be difficult to beat a tour as Secretary of the Navy. The \nDepartment of the Navy has a budget of over $100 billion. It consists \nof 372,000 active duty and 90,000 Reserve sailors, 172,000 active duty \nand 40,000 Reserve marines.\n  In addition, as Secretary of the Navy, Gordon England has overseen a \ncivilian workforce of nearly 190,000 employees. That number, I note, \nexceeds the number in the workforce of the new Department. We often \ntalk about what a management challenge it is going to be to the leaders \nof this new Department to oversee 170,000 civilian employees. As \nSecretary of the Navy, Gordon England has overseen a civilian workforce \nthat exceeds that number, not to mention the sailors and marines under \nhis jurisdiction.\n  Secretary England's extensive experience in managing large, complex \noperations in both the public and private sectors will serve him well \nin his new position. I have been very fortunate to have had the \npleasure of working with him when he was Secretary of the Navy, and I \nlook forward to continuing our partnership in his new capacity.\n  I urge my colleagues to support confirmation of this important \nnomination. The new Department of Homeland Security opened its doors \nofficially last Friday, and it is critical that we get the top \nmanagement positions filled as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I do hope this nominee will be approved unanimously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to an \nalarming issue--the growing number of premature births. According to \ndata released by the National Center for Health Statistics, the \npercentage of babies born prematurely--birth at less than 37 completed \nweeks of gestation--has risen to nearly 12 percent, the highest level \never reported in the United States. In 2001 alone, more than 476,000 \nbabies were born prematurely in the U.S. Unfortunately, in my own State \nof Tennessee, 14 percent of births are preterm. There cannot be a \nclearer wake-up call for us.\n  Today, the March of Dimes is launching a national, five-year \nprematurity awareness, education, and research effort aimed at \npreventing prematurity, the leading cause of infant death in the first \nmonth of life. I cannot imagine a better organization to take on this \nserious problem. Over its 63-year history, the March of Dimes has \nconducted two highly successful national campaigns--the first focused \non preventing polio and the second involved educating the public and \nhealth providers on the role of folic acid in preventing neural tube \ndefects. My friend, former Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. \nLouis Sullivan, is the honorary chair of this campaign, and I salute \nhim for his continued commitment to the public's health.\n  I'm pleased to be able to salute and encourage this new campaign \nwhich holds the promise of significantly reducing the incidence of \npremature birth throughout the country. Babies born prematurely are \nmore likely to face serious multiple health problems following \ndelivery: a tragedy for families but one which may be preventable.\n  Since coming to the Senate, I have focused on disparities in \nhealthcare quality and access. Prematurity is one of the clearest \nindices of this problem. Rates of preterm birth vary significantly by \nrace and ethnicity. In 2001, rates for black women were highest among \nall racial and ethnic subgroups--17.5 percent for black as compared to \n11 percent for white Americans. We simply do not know why these numbers \nvary so dramatically. But without further research, our public policy \noptions are limited.\n  Our great health research institutions also have an important role. I \nhave fought for the five-year doubling of NIH's budget.

Mr. President, I rise to note an important victory in the \nfight to protect whistleblowers and to praise my good friend Senator \nChuck Grassley for his leadership in this fight.\n  The Washington Post reported yesterday that the Department of Labor \nhas reversed its view on how it will interpret an important provision \nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on corporate misconduct. The provision we \nenacted provides a Federal law protecting corporate whistleblowers from \nretaliation for the first time. The law was designed to protect people \nlike Sherron Watkins from Enron, who was recently named one of Time \nmagazine's ``People of the Year,'' from retaliation when they report \nfraud to Federal investigators, regulators, or to any Member of \nCongress. The law was intentionally written to sweep broadly, \nprotecting any employee of a publicly traded company who took such \nreasonable action to try to protect investors and the market.\n  The reason that Senator Grassley and I know so much about the \nlegislative intent behind this provision is that we crafted it together \nlast year in the Judiciary Committee and worked to make it part of the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act on the Senate floor. We had both seen enough cases \nwhere corporate employees who possessed the courage to stand up and `do \nthe right thing' found out the hard way that there is a severe penalty \nfor breaking the `corporate code of silence.' Indeed, in the Enron case \nitself we discovered an e-mail from outside counsel that noted that the \nTexas Supreme Court had twice refused to find a legal protection for \ncorporate whistleblowers and that implicitly gave Enron the go ahead to \nfire Ms. Watkins for reporting accounting irregularities.\n  Senator Grassley has always been a leader in protecting the rights of \nwhistleblowers, and I was proud to work with him in the area of \ncorporate reform to craft such a groundbreaking law.\n  Unfortunately, from the very day that President Bush signed the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act into law, Senator Grassley and I had to fight the \nadministration to make sure that the law would not be gutted. On the \nsame night that the law was signed, the White House issued an \ninterpretation that incorrectly and narrowly interpreted our provision. \nSpecifically, the White House stated that corporate whistleblower's \ndisclosure to Congress would not be protected unless the whistleblower \nmade the report to a congressional committee already conducting an \nauthorized investigation. This interpretation was at odds with the \nlegislative intent and the clear statutory language of the Act, which \nprotected reasonable reports of fraud to ``any Member of Congress.''\n  Senator Grassley and I had good reason to write the law with such \nbroad coverage. Most corporate whistleblowers do not know the ins and \nouts of the jurisdiction of Congress's various committees, nor should \nthey be expected to. Simply picking up the phone and calling your local \nSenator or Representative to report a case of securities fraud should \nbe protected. In addition, by definition most ``whistleblowers'' are \nreporting fraud that is not widely known. They are blowing the whistle. \nThus, their revelations do not come as part of already commenced \ninvestigations. They may lead to such investigations as well as \ncontribute to them. The White House interpretation would have excluded \namong the most important revelations of corporate fraud made to \nCongress.\n\n  The administration's interpretation was reinforced the next day when \nthe White House spokesman repeated that there were limits on the types \nof disclosures to Congress that would be protected. Finally, in \naddition to these White House interpretations, former Solicitor of \nLabor Eugene Scalia filed a troubling brief that adopted this narrow \ninterpretation not only in the context of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, but \nregarding the environmental whistleblower provisions, as well.\n  That is where Senator Grassley stepped in. As he has done so many \ntimes before, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, he \nwent to bat for the rights of the lone whistleblower against the huge \nbureaucracy. Once again, through his perseverance, he has proven that \nyou can fight not only city hall but the executive branch of the \nFederal Government.\n  Working together, we wrote a series of letters to the administration \nprotesting their narrow interpretations and making the legal case that \nthey were at odds with the legislative intent and clear language of the \nprovision that we wrote. Each and every time that the administration \nresponded by stonewalling or giving half answers, Senator Grassley was \nthere to protect the law we had worked so hard to write.\n  Finally, on January 24, 2003, almost a half year after our first \nletter, the administration gave in. In a letter from the new Acting \nSolicitor of Labor to Senator Grassley and to me he stated, ``It is the \nDepartment's view that under Sarbanes-Oxley, complaints to individual \nMembers of Congress are protected, even if such Member is not \nconducting an ongoing Committee investigation within the jurisdiction \nof a particular Congressional committee.. .'' The letter promised that \nnew rules and regulations effectuating this policy change would follow.\n  I am quite sure that when those regulations come out that Senator \nGrassley will once again be paying close attention, as will I. Where \nthe integrity of our financial markets and our Government are \nconcerned, we can do no less. I look forward to working with Senator \nGrassley to protect the rights of whistleblowers in the 108th Congress, \nas we did in the 107th Congress. It is an honor and a privilege to work \nwith Senator Grassley on these important matters.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters I have referenced above and \nthe Washington Post story, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 2002.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As coauthors of the recent corporate \n     whistleblower provision in the Corporate and Criminal Fraud \n     Accountability Act, section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we \n     are writing to express our shared concern about interpretive \n     statements made by the White House staff only hours after you \n     signed the Act into law.\n       According to media reports, the White House views this \n     bipartisan provision, which was approved unanimously both by \n     the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate, as protecting \n     employees only if they report fraud to Congress ``in the \n     course of an investigation.'' This narrow interpretation is \n     at odds with the plain language of the statute and risks \n     chilling corporate whistleblowers who wish to report \n     securities fraud to Members of Congress.\n       The provision in question, codified at 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1514A, states that it applies to disclosures of fraud \n     whenever ``the information or assistance is provided to or \n     the investigation is conducted by . . . any Member of \n     Congress or any committee of Congress.'' (emphasis added). By \n     its plain terms, there is no limitation either to ongoing \n     investigations of Congress or to matters within the \n     jurisdiction of any Congressional Committee.\n       The reason for this is obvious. Few whistleblowers know, \n     nor should they be expected to know, the jurisdiction of the \n     various Committees of Congress or the matters currently under \n     investigation. The most common situation, and one that the \n     recent Administration's statement excludes from protection, \n     is a citizen reporting misconduct to his or her own \n     Representative or Senator, regardless of their committee \n     assignments. Such disclosures are clearly covered by the \n     terms of the statute.\n       We request that you review and reconsider the \n     Administration's interpretation of section 806 of the \n     Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It embodies a flawed interpretation of \n     the clearly\n\n[[Page S1726]]\n\n     worded statute and threatens to create unnecessary confusion \n     and to discourage whistleblowers such as Sherron Watkins and \n     Coleen Rowley from reporting corporate fraud to Congress.\n       Sincerely,\n     Patrick Leahy,\n       Chairman.\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n       U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Alberto R. Gonzales,\n     Counsel to the President, The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Gonzales: We appreciate your letter received today \n     seeking to clarify the President's statement regarding the \n     corporate whistleblower provisions in the Corporate and \n     Criminal Fraud Accountability Act, section 806 of the \n     Sarbanes--Oxley Act.\n       While the President's earlier statement was: ``Given that \n     the legislative purpose of Section 1514A of title 18 of the \n     U.S. Code, enacted by section 806 of the Act, is to protect \n     against company retaliation for lawful cooperation with \n     investigations and not to define the scope of investigative \n     authority or to grant new investigative authority, the \n     executive branch shall construe section 1514(a)(1)(B) as \n     referring to investigations authorized by the rules of the \n     Senate or the House of Representatives and conducted for a \n     proper legislative purpose.''\n       Your letter now clarifies that contrary to the sweeping \n     language above, ``the President's statement provides guidance \n     to the executive branch in construing the provision only on a \n     single, very narrow point. . . .'' (Emphasis added). That \n     narrow point being what is defined as an ``investigation'' \n     for purpose of the Act, and not all of section 1514(a)(1)(B), \n     which you agree applies to more than merely investigations.\n       To ensure there is no confusion on this matter, and in \n     light of seemingly broader interpretations provided by \n     Whitehouse spokespersons, please respond to the following \n     scenario.\n       An employee who works at a publicly traded company provides \n     information to a Member of Congress (and assume for this \n     question the Member is not a chairman or ranking member of a \n     Committee and is not a member of a Committee with \n     jurisdiction) regarding a violation as enumerated under \n     Section 1514A(a)(1) of the Act. Finally, assume that there is \n     no investigation being conducted by the Member at the time \n     the information is provided. Do you believe that employee is \n     or is not afforded the protections of Section 1514A?\n       There is no question in our minds that the Congressional \n     intent (and the clear language of the statute) is that the \n     answer to the above scenario is yes--the employee is \n     protected, whether there is an investigation pending or not. \n     Our desire is to protect the well-intentioned employee who \n     contacts his elected representatives (or any representative \n     for that matter) and not require that employee to consult the \n     Congressional Directory and Congressional Record prior to \n     making his call to determine whether he/she will be afforded \n     the whistleblower protections of the Act.\n       The statute reflects this intent, protecting the actions of \n     an employee of a publicly traded company: ``(1) to provide \n     information, cause information to be provided, or otherwise \n     assist in an investigation regarding any conduct which the \n     employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of \n     section 1341, 1343, 1344, or 1348, any rule or regulation of \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any provision of \n     Federal law relating to fraud against shareholders, when the \n     information or assistance is provided to or the investigation \n     is conducted by--. . . (B) any Member of Congress or any \n     committee of Congress; . . .''\n       Section 1514A(a)(1). Emphasis added.\n       Thank you for your time and assistance. We look forward to \n     your response.\n           Cordially yours,\n     Patrick J. Leahy,\n       Chairman.\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n       Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 15, 2003.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     President of the United States of America, The White House, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: I am writing in response to a letter \n     of December 20, 2002, that the White House sent in response \n     to Senator Grassley's and my joint letters of August 1 and \n     October 31 expressing concerns regarding the Administration's \n     enforcement of the corporate whistleblower provisions that we \n     included in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. I am dismayed at the \n     Administration's overly narrow interpretation of these \n     important whistleblower protection provisions in the \n     corporate accountability legislation.\n       While I appreciate your response, it does little to clear \n     the ambiguity created by the prior statements by the \n     Administration, as set forth in our letters. It leaves \n     potential whistleblowers like Sherron Watkins of Enron (who \n     recently shared the honor of being selected Time Magazine's \n     ``Person of the Year'' with two other whistleblowers) to \n     guess at whether or not they can be fired for reporting an \n     allegation of corporate fraud to their Representatives or \n     Senators in Congress.\n       The unwillingness to clarify this matter is puzzling to me. \n     After having confused the matter with a series of misleading \n     and contradictory statements, the White House cannot simply \n     state the scope of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1514A ``will ultimately be \n     addressed by the courts.'' The ambiguity caused by the \n     Administrations's own statements has now been allowed to \n     persist for almost half a year, and it threatens effective \n     enforcement of these important corporate reforms. In fact, \n     White House spokesperson Ari Fleisher further fueled this \n     ambiguity on July 31, 2002 by stating:\n       ``What the action taken last night [the interpretive \n     statement] does is say that it's up to Congress to determine, \n     through its own rules and procedures, whether to grant \n     individual members of Congress investigative powers that \n     would trigger the statute.\n       ``Nothing in the statute or the signing statement prevents \n     Congress from granting that authority to whoever it chooses. \n     This is a congressional issue, and a congressional decision.\n       ``If Congress wants to allow individual members of the \n     Congress, individual senators, individual House members, \n     whether in the majority or the minority, no matter who they \n     are, to conduct investigations, then that individual, if \n     somebody was a whistleblower to that individual, the \n     whistleblower would have all protections. If Congress decides \n     that the only way to have an investigation is through the \n     committee-authorized process, then the whistleblower will go \n     through that committee. So this is a congressional matter and \n     a congressional determination.''\n       Thus, Mr. Fleisher's public statements on behalf of the \n     White House leave the impression that the White House would \n     require some type of additional Congressional rule-making \n     before affording the statute its full affect. Aside from \n     being legally incorrect (an act of Congress passed nearly \n     unanimously and signed into law by the President of the \n     United States requires no further action to be fully \n     enforced), such statements create a real risk. Corporate \n     whistleblowers will be chilled form making reports of fraud \n     unless they are assured that the law protects them from \n     retaliation. It is incumbent upon the Administration to clear \n     up the ambiguity which it has helped to create from an \n     unambiguous statute.\n       Nor am I persuaded that, as you write, it would not be \n     ``appropriate'' for the White House to provide a legal \n     interpretation to a Member of Congress regarding a statute \n     that the Administration is entrusted to enforce. The \n     Executive Branch, unlike the courts, provides such \n     interpretive guidance on a frequent basis both to Congress \n     and to its own employees. In fact, when questions are not \n     posed as policy-based hypotheticals, as Senator Grassley and \n     I took pains to do in our letters, the Adminsitration often \n     refuses to answer because the questions do relate to a real, \n     pending case. If the Executive Branch will not discuss policy \n     on a theoretical basis, and refuses to discuss its actions on \n     specific cases, then what remains?\n       Indeed, it would be nearly impossible to conduct effective \n     oversight or to craft legislation designed to cure problems \n     in the current law without a constructive dialogue between \n     the Executive Branch and the Congress on precisely such \n     issues. Understanding the Executive Branch's current \n     interpretation of the law is particularly important in \n     matters involving corporate reform. Our financial markets \n     depend upon the confidence of the American people that our \n     markets will be effectively policed, and creating uncertainty \n     about the scope of important corporate reforms can \n     destabilize such markets.\n       For these reasons, I urge you to answer all the questions \n     posed in Senator Grassley's and my previous letters. \n     Specifically, I request that you state definitively whether \n     or not you believe that 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1514A protects a \n     report of fraud or securities law violations by an employee \n     of a publicly traded company to ``any'' member of Congress \n     and whether the Department of Labor and the Department of \n     Justice have been instructed not to take any contrary \n     position in future litigation.\n       Thank you for your prompt response in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         U.S. Department of Labor,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Solicitor,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2003.\n     Hon.

Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Grassley and Leahy: It was a pleasure meeting \n     with your staff on January 7, 2003, to discuss issues \n     relating to the implementation of the whistleblower \n     provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The President \n     and Secretary Chao, who has responsibility to investigate and \n     adjudicate allegations of retaliation under this law, share \n     your view that these provisions are crucial to the federal \n     government's efforts to combat corporate corruption.\n       In connection with the Department of Labor's implementation \n     of the whistleblower protections of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, I \n     have reviewed a series of letters you exchanged with the \n     Counsel to the President concerning the President's signing \n     statement. In his December 20, 2002 letter, the\n\n[[Page S1727]]\n\n     Counsel to the President explained that ``the President's \n     statement took no position on whether there is whistleblower \n     protection for employees who lawfully report wrongdoing to \n     individual Members of Congress, nor did it address whether \n     whistleblower protection would be limited to those instances \n     where there was an ongoing investigation or the disclosure \n     related to a matter within the jurisdiction of a particular \n     Congressional committee.'' The letter also indicated that \n     representatives of the Department would be discussing the \n     issues with your staff.\n       It is the Department's view that under Sarbanes-Oxley, \n     complaints to individual Members of Congress are protected, \n     even if such Member is not conducting an ongoing Committee \n     investigation within the jurisdiction of a particular \n     Congressional committee, provided that the complaint relates \n     to conduct that the employee reasonably believes to be a \n     violation of one of the enumerated laws or regulations. The \n     Department currently is finalizing the draft of an Interim \n     Final Rule and accompanying Preamble implementing the \n     whistleblower provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Although \n     it would be inappropriate for me to provide you our draft \n     text at this time, the Department's current intention is to \n     clarify in the published document our view that complaints to \n     ``any Member of Congress or any committee of Congress'' are \n     covered by the whistleblower provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley \n     Act.\n       Thank you for your interest in this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Howard M.

Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) \n     and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Acting Solicitor Howard M. \n     Radzely reversed the department's contention that only \n     whistle-blower contacts with a ``duly authorized'' \n     investigative committee of Congress were protected, not those \n     with just any lawmaker. That initial department reading of \n     the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a corporate accountability law \n     enacted last summer, conflicted with what the two senators \n     said they intended when they wrote the whistle-blower \n     protections into the bill.\n       ``It is the department's view that . . . complaints to \n     individual members of Congress are protected, even if such \n     member is not conducting an ongoing committee \n     investigation,'' Radzely wrote.\n       Grassley said the reversal would ``make it easier for \n     corporate whistle-blowers to be protected when they speak out \n     on wrongdoing in the boardroom.''\n       ``It's a big victory,'' said Blythe McCormack, a \n     spokeswoman for Leahy.\n       Grassley and Leahy have sent several letters to White House \n     officials seeking assurances that the Bush administration \n     understood the intent of the law. In September, than-Labor \n     Department solicitor Eugene Scalia filed a friend-of-the-\n     court brief with an administrative review board seeking to \n     overturn a $200,000 punitive damages award won by Assistant \n     U.S. Attorney Gregory C. Sasse of Ohio in a whistle-blower \n     case against the Justice Department.\n       Scalia, who resigned his post this month to return to \n     private practice, had argued that Sasse did not enjoy \n     whistle-blower protection in his contacts with Rep. Dennis J. \n     Kucinich (D-Ohio), who was looking into reports of toxic \n     materials on federally owned land near the Cleveland airport. \n     Only contacts with investigative panel members are protected, \n     Scalia wrote.\n       Scalia also urged that a federal prosecutor could not sue \n     the Justice Department over workplace disagreements involving \n     priorities in government litigation.\n       Sasse, who still has his job, said his supervisors \n     downgraded his performance reviews, did not grant him \n     training opportunities and removed him from some cases in \n     retaliation for his contacts with Kucinich. An administrative \n     law judge ruled that the Justice Department had retaliated \n     against Sasse and found that his contacts with Kucinich were \n     protected.\n       The Justice Department appealed to the administrative \n     review board, which has not yet ruled on the case.\n       Whistle-blower advocates said Scalia was attempting to use \n     the case, which concerns whistle-blower provisions in \n     environmental protection laws, to establish a precedent that \n     would undermine whistle-blowers in cases against \n     corporations.\n       Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for \n     Environmental Responsibility, a group that defends federal \n     workers on environmental issues, said a central question of \n     the Sasse case--whether federal prosecutors can be whistle-\n     blowers--remains unresolved.\n       A Labor Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the \n     case because it is in litigation.\n       Steven Bell, Sasse's attorney, said the department's \n     reversal helps his client. ``The Labor Department is \n     acknowledging that the substance of the brief it filed is \n     legally inaccurate,'' he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1727-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1727-S1728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, last December I traveled to South \nKorea in my capacity as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nMilitary Construction, as well as a member of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. I was able to visit and talk with U.S. \ntroops and inspect facilities. I also toured the DMZ, a chilling legacy \nof a war many Americans have already forgotten.\n  My visit could not have been more timely. The combination of saber-\nrattling in the North and anti-American protests in the South has made \nKorea front page news once again, as it faces its most complicated, and \npotentially explosive, crisis since the Korean war, 1950-53.\n  The Korean peninsula is a land of stunning beauty and startling \ncontrasts. Divided at the end of World War Il, following a long \noccupation by Japan, Korea continues to be one of the few reminders of \nwhat the world was like during the cold war.\n  North Korea is a quasi-Stalinist state which, since its formal \ncreation in 1948, has been run by two men, Kim Il Sung, who died in \n1994, and his son, Kim Jong Il. Still almost entirely closed to the \nWestern World, North Korea is a stark and isolated country marked by \nrepression and poverty.\n  Then, on the other side of the demilitarized zone, DMZ, perhaps the \nmost tense border on Earth, is South Korea, a prosperous, Westernized \ndemocratic state. South Korea has been a staunch U.S. ally, and 37,000 \nU.S. troops have been stationed there for the past 40 years.\n  Waged from 1950 to 1953, the Korean war ended in a virtual stalemate, \nwith the peninsula still divided. Mr. President, 54,246 American men \nand women died during that war, and although there are no precise \nfigures for Korean casualties, conservative estimates put the figure at \napproximately 4 million, the majority of these being civilians.\n  On my trip to South Korea on the eve of the Presidential elections, I \nwas surprised at the widespread anti-Americanism. Indeed, it was this \nissue, a growing sense that the United States was an imperial power \nindifferent to the needs and desires of the Korean people, that led Roh \nMoo Hyun to victory.\n  It is difficult to appreciate the situation on the Korean peninsula \nwithout a visit to the demilitarized zone. I was taken there in a \nhelicopter by Gen. Leon LaPorte, our four-star general in command, who \npointed out North Korean troop concentrations. It is an alarming sight, \nand in many ways a step back in time.\n  I then paid a visit to Panmunjum, a small village frozen in time, \nunchanged for half a century, which straddles the line separating North \nand South Korea. It was here that the Armistice ending the war was \nsigned.\n  Seventy percent of the 1.2 million man North Korean army is deployed\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\nalong the DMZ, with enough heavy artillery to substantially damage \nSeoul and inflict casualties by the millions. And there are reports \nthat nerve agents may also be deployed along the DMZ.\n  Since my visit, the 800,000 forward-deployed North Korean troops have \nbeen placed on high alert and are prepared to move instantly.\n  I believe the blame for precipitating this crisis lies squarely with \nNorth Korea, which clearly violated the Agreed Framework by beginning \nthe surreptitious development of nuclear capacity.\n  North Korea has also expelled all international inspectors and \nequipment; withdrawn from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; \nrestarted its plutonium processing plants; moved thousands of plutonium \nrods out of locked safe storage back into the nuclear production line; \nand is enriching uranium for nuclear weapon purposes.\n  The government of Kim Jong Il has clearly placed its focus, not on \nfeeding its people, but in developing its military, its missiles and \nits nuclear capability, all in defiance of treaties it has signed.\n  Yet it also appears that our own handling of events on the Korean \npeninsula over the past 2 years, as well as our broader foreign policy \nrhetoric and statements have served, ironically, to fuel North Korea's \nparanoia and made the situation much more difficult to manage.\n  Part of the problem has been our reluctance to endorse outgoing \nPresident Kim Dae Jung's ``Sunshine Policy,'' a diplomatic and economic \neffort by the South Korean government to ease tensions with the North. \nPresident Kim was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for precisely \nthese initiatives.\n  This move was perceived as a major humiliation in South Korea, helped \nset the stage for the rising tide of anti-Americanism, and was seen as \na sign by the North that the administration was intent on a policy of \nisolation and confrontation.\n  The North Korean situation offers no easy solution. We should keep \nthe door open to the possibility of high level discussion.\n  This ongoing crisis has also led many to rethink America's military \npresence on the Korean peninsula. Such periodic reviews are a good \nidea, but at the same time, I strongly believe that we should not do \nanything hastily.\n  And although overshadowed by the crisis, much of my trip to South \nKorea focused on determining how to best finance the reconfiguration of \nU.S. military installations in South Korea.\n  In the past 2 years alone, Congress has appropriated more than $500 \nmillion for military construction in South Korea. Much of this money \nhas gone to improve barracks and to begin to implement a program known \nas the Korean Land Partnership Plan.\n  This joint U.S.-Republic of Korea plan is designed to reduce the U.S. \nmilitary ``footprint'' in Korea, while at the same time upgrade \nfacilities for U.S. soldiers. This latter effort is particularly \nimportant, seeing that the living and working conditions are among the \npoorest in the entire U.S. military.\n  Currently, the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are \nscattered among 41 troop installations and 54 small camps and support \nsites. Under the Land Partnership Plan, the number of troop \ninstallations would be reduced to 23, a move that I support.\n  When near the DMZ, I also visited Camp Casey, which is north of \nUijongBu and occupied by some 6300 military and 2500 civilians. More \nthan any other site I saw, Camp Casey clearly demonstrated the need for \nimproved living conditions at the soldier barracks. This is an issue \nthat deserves immediate attention in the 108th Congress.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I believe that the present crisis can be \nresolved. The United States should be more sensitive to our \nlongstanding ally, South Korea, just as we should ensure that North \nKorea not be allowed to bully or intimidate its neighbors.\n  Finally, I believe that my trip could not have been more timely. It \nhas given me a fresh and immediate perspective on a land and a people \nfor which I have great admiration. Since returning to Washington, I \nhave met with both the South Korean National Security Adviser and their \nAmbassador to the United States.\n  These talks, as well as those with my Senate colleagues and members \nof the Bush administration, give me confidence that we will be able to \nwork well with President Roh, and that our bilateral relationship is \nstrong enough to weather any short-term setbacks.\n  Lastly, I would once again like to thank Ambassador Thomas Hubbard \nand Gen. Leon LaPorte for all their assistance while I was in South \nKorea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1729-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1729-S1731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER'S ``AMERICAN UNILATERALISM''\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, In a December 2002 speech delivered by the \ncommentator, Charles Krauthammer, at the Hillsdale College Churchill \ndinner entitled ``American Unilateralism,'' Mr. Krauthammer superbly \narticulates the necessity of American action to confront today's \nchallenges in the international arena, most notably Iraq. He makes a \ncompelling case against the two kinds of multilateralist thinking that \nare common today: that of the liberal internationalists and that of the \npragmatic realists.\n  Liberal internationalists, Krauthammer shows, cling to \nmultilateralism as a shield for their real preference--in this case, \ninaction. He aptly points out that those most strenuously opposed to \nU.S. military action in Iraq are also the strongest supporters of \nrequiring U.N. backing. The reason, Krauthammer concludes, is that \n``they see the U.N. as a way to stop America in its tracks.'' The \nliberal internationalist fails to take into account that there is no \nlogical, or moral, basis for depending upon the member of the U.N. \nSecurity Council to confer legitimacy on U.S. actions.\n  Pragmatic realists, Krauthammer explains, understand the absurdity of \nthe liberal internationalist's arguments, but believe that, \nnonetheless, the U.S. needs from a practical standpoint, international \nsupport to act. They believe that shared decisionmaking will result in \ngood will, improved relations, and greater burdensharing. But, as \nKrauthammer demonstrates, our experiences in the gulf war prove \notherwise.\n  It is important to note that Krauthammer does not see unilateralism \nas a first choice. Rather, he advocates taking actions that are in the \nbest interest of the United States, bringing others along if possible. \nWhat he wisely cautions against is allowing ourselves ``to be held \nhostage'' by the objections of countries that don't have America's \ninterests at heart. He describes unilateralism as ``the high road to \nmultilateralism.'' This may sound paradoxical, but it makes sense. It \nis American leadership, asserting a firm position and committing to \ntake whatever actions are necessary to see if through, that enables a \nsolid coalition to be built.\n  Charles Krauthammer's remarks are both timely and insightful as the \nUnited States discusses Iraqi noncompliance with members of the U.N. \nSecurity Council and contemplates military action in Iraq. I highly \nrecommend them to my colleagues in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Krauthammer's December 2002 speech \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         American Unilateralism\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       American unilateralism has to do with the motives and the \n     methods of American behavior in the world, but any discussion \n     of it has to begin with a discussion of the structure of the \n     international system. The reason that we talk about \n     unilateralism today is that we live in a totally new world. \n     We live in a unipolar world of a sort that has not existed in \n     at least 1500 years.\n       At the end of the Cold War, the conventional wisdom was \n     that with the demise of the Soviet Empire, the bipolarity of \n     the second half of the 20th century would yield to a multi-\n     polar world. You might recall the school of thought led by \n     historian Paul Kennedy, who said that America was already in \n     decline, suffering from imperial overstretch. There was also \n     the Asian enthusiasm, popularized by James Fallows and \n     others, whose thinking was best captured by the late-1980s \n     witticism: ``The United States and Russia decided to hold a \n     Cold War: Who won? Japan.''\n       Well they were wrong, and ironically no one has put it \n     better than Paul Kennedy himself, in a classic recantation \n     emphasizing America's power: ``Nothing has ever existed like \n     this disparity of power, nothing. Charlemagne's empire was \n     merely Western\n\n[[Page S1730]]\n\n     European in its reach. The Roman Empire stretched farther \n     afield, but there was another great empire in Persia and a \n     larger one in China. There is, therefore, no comparison.''\n       We tend not to see or understand the historical uniqueness \n     of this situation. Even at its height, Britain could always \n     be seriously challenged by the next greatest powers. It had a \n     smaller army than the land powers of Europe, and its navy was \n     equaled by the next two navies combined. Today, the American \n     military exceeds in spending the next twenty countries \n     combined. Its Navy, Air Force and space power are unrivaled. \n     Its dominance extends as well to every other aspect of \n     international life--, not only military, but economic, \n     technological, diplomatic, cultural, even linguistic, with a \n     myriad of countries trying to fend off the inexorable march \n     of MTV English.\n       Ironically, September 11 accentuated and accelerated this \n     unipolarity. It did so in three ways. The first and most \n     obvious was the demonstration it brought forth of American \n     power. In Kosovo, we had seen the first war ever fought and \n     won exclusively from the air, which gave the world a hint of \n     the recent quantum leap in American military power. But it \n     took September 11 for the U.S. to unleash, with concentrated \n     fury, a fuller display of its power in Afghanistan. Being a \n     relatively pacific commercial republic, the U.S. does not go \n     around looking for demonstration wars. This one being thrust \n     upon it, it demonstrated that at a range of 7,000 miles, with \n     but a handful of losses and a sum total of 426 men on the \n     ground, it could destroy, within weeks, a hardened fanatical \n     regime favored by geography and climate in a land-locked \n     country that was already well known as the graveyard of \n     empires. Without September 11, the giant would surely have \n     slept longer. The world would have been aware of America's \n     size and potential, but not its ferocity and full capacities.\n       Secondly, September 11 demonstrated a new kind of American \n     strength. The center of our economy was struck, aviation was \n     shut down, the government was sent underground and the \n     country was rendered paralyzed and fearful. Yet within days, \n     the markets reopened, the economy began its recovery, the \n     president mobilized the nation and a unified Congress \n     immediately underwrote a huge worldwide war on terror. The \n     Pentagon, with its demolished western facade still \n     smoldering, began planning the war. The illusion of America's \n     invulnerability was shattered, but with the demonstration of \n     its recuperative powers, that sense of invulnerability \n     assumed a new character. It was transmuted from \n     impermeability to resilience--the product of unrivaled human, \n     technological and political reserves.\n       The third effect of September 11 was the realignment it \n     caused among the great powers. In 1990, our principal ally \n     was NATO. A decade later, the alliance had expanded to \n     include some of the former Warsaw Pact countries. But several \n     major powers remained uncommitted: Russia and China flirted \n     with the idea of an anti-hegemonic alliance, as they called \n     it. Some Russian leaders made ostentatious visits to little \n     outposts of the ex-Soviet Empire like North Korea and Cuba. \n     India and Pakistan sat on the sidelines.\n       Then came September 11, and the bystanders lined up. \n     Pakistan immediately made a strategic decision to join the \n     American camp. India enlisted with equal alacrity. Russia's \n     Putin, seeing a coincidence of interests with the U.S. in the \n     war on terror and an opportunity to develop a close relation \n     with the one remaining superpower, fell into line. Even \n     China, while remaining more distant, saw a coincidence of \n     interest with the U.S. in fighting Islamic radicalism, and so \n     has cooperated in the war on terror and has not pressed \n     competition with the U.S. in the Pacific.\n       This realignment accentuated a remarkable historical \n     anomaly. All of our historical experience with hegemony \n     suggests that it creates a countervailing coalition of weaker \n     powers. Think of Napoleonic France, or of Germany in the 20th \n     century. Nature abhors a vacuum and history abhors hegemony. \n     But in the first decade of post-Cold War unipolarity, not a \n     single great power, arose to challenge America. On the \n     contrary, they all aligned with the U.S. after September 11.\n       So we bestride the world like a colossus. The question is, \n     how do we act in this new world? What do we do with our \n     position?\n       Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld gave the classic formulation \n     of unilateralism when he said, regarding Afghanistan--but it \n     applies equally to the war on terror and to other conflicts--\n     that ``the mission determines the coalition.'' This means \n     that we take our friends where we find them, but only in \n     order to help us accomplish our mission. The mission comes \n     first and we define the mission.\n       This is in contrast with what I believe is a classic case \n     study in multilateralism: the American decision eleven years \n     ago to conclude the Gulf War. As the Iraqi Army was fleeing \n     the first Bush administration had to decide whether its goal \n     in the war was the liberation of Kuwait or the liberation of \n     Iraq. National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, who was \n     instrumental in making the decision to stop with Kuwait, has \n     explained that going further would have fractured the \n     coalition, gone against our promises to our allies, and \n     violated the U.N. resolutions under which we had gone to war. \n     ``Had we added occupation of Iraq and removal of Saddam \n     Hussein to those objectives,'' he wrote, ``our Arab allies, \n     refusing to countenance an invasion of an Arab colleague, \n     would have deserted us.'' Therefore we did not act. The \n     coalition defined the mission.\n\n\n                        liberal internationalism\n\n       There are two schools of committed multi-lateralists, and \n     it is important to distinguish between them. There are the \n     liberal internationalists who act from principle, and there \n     are the realists who act from pragmatism. The first was seen \n     in the run-up to the congressional debate on the war on Iraq. \n     The main argument from opposition Democrats was that we \n     should wait and hear what the U.N. was saying. Senator \n     Kennedy, in a speech before the vote in Congress, said, \n     ``I'm waiting for the final recommendation of the Security \n     Council before I'm going to say how I'm going to vote.'' \n     Senator Levin, who at the time was the Chairman of the \n     Senate Armed Services Committee, actually suggested giving \n     authority to the President to act in Iraq only upon the \n     approval of the U.N. Security Council.\n       The liberal internationalist position is a principled \n     position, but it makes no internal sense. It is based on a \n     moral vision of the world, but it is impossible to understand \n     the moral logic by which the approval of the Security Council \n     confers moral legitimacy on this or any other enterprise. How \n     does the blessing of the butchers of Tiananmen Square, who \n     hold the Chinese seat on the Council, lend moral authority to \n     anything, let alone the invasion of another country? On what \n     basis is moral legitimacy lent by the support of the Kremlin, \n     whose central interest in Iraq, as all of us knows, is oil \n     and the $8 billion that Iraq owes Russia in debt? Or of the \n     French, who did everything that they could to weaken the \n     resolution, then came on board at the last minute because \n     they saw that an Anglo-American train was possibly leaving \n     for Baghdad, and they didn't want to be left at the station?\n       My point is not to blame the French or the Russians or the \n     Chinese for acting in their own national interest. That's \n     what nations do. My point is to express wonder at Americans \n     who find it unseemly to act in the name of our own national \n     interest, and who cannot see the logical absurdity of \n     granting moral legitimacy to American action only if it earns \n     the prior approval of others which is granted or withheld on \n     the most cynical grounds of self-interest.\n\n\n                       Practical Multilateralism\n\n       So much for the moral argument that underlies \n     multilateralism. What are the practical arguments? There is a \n     school of realists who agree that liberal internationalism is \n     nonsense, but who argue plausibly that we need international \n     or allied support, regardless. One of their arguments is that \n     if a power consistency shares rule making with others, it is \n     more likely to get aid and assistance from them.\n       I have my doubts. The US. made an extraordinary effort \n     during the Gulf War to get U.N. support, share decision-\n     making and assemble a coalition. As I have pointed out, it \n     even denied itself the fruits of victory in order to honor \n     coalition goals. Did this diminish anti-Americanism in the \n     region? Did it garner support for subsequent Iraq policy--\n     policy dictated by the original acquiescence to that \n     coalition? The attacks of September 11 were planned during \n     the Clinton administration, an administration that made a \n     fetish of consultation and did its utmost to subordinate \n     American hegemony. Yet resentments were hardly assuaged, \n     because extremist rage against the U.S. is engendered by the \n     very structure of the international system, not by our \n     management of it.\n       Pragmatic realists value multilateralism in the interest of \n     sharing burdens, on the theory that if you share decision-\n     making, you enlist others in your own hegemonic enterprise. \n     As proponents of this school and argued recently in Foreign \n     Affairs, ``Straining relationships now will lead only to a \n     more challenging policy environment later on.'' This is a \n     pure cost-benefit analysis of multilateralism versus \n     unilateralism.\n       If the concern about unilateralism is that American \n     assertiveness be judiciously rationed and that one needs to \n     think long-term hardly anybody will disagree. One does not go \n     it alone or dictate terms on every issue. There's no need to. \n     On some issues, such as membership in the World Trade \n     Organization, where the long-term benefit both to the U.S. \n     and to the global interest is demonstrable, one willingly \n     constricts sovereignty. Trade agreements are easy calls, \n     however, free trade being perhaps the only mathematicaly \n     provable political good. Other agreements require great \n     skepticism. The Kyoto Protocol on climate change, for \n     example, would have had a disastrous effect on the American \n     economy, while doing nothing for the global environment. \n     Increased emissions from China, India and other third-\n     world countries which are exempt from its provisions \n     clearly would have overwhelmed and made up for what-ever \n     American cuts would have occurred. Kyoto was therefore \n     rightly rejected by the Bush administration. It failed on \n     its merits, but it was pushed very hard nonetheless, \n     because the rest of the world supported it.\n       The same case was made during the Clinton administration \n     for chemical and biological weapons treaties, which they \n     negotiated assiduously under the logic of, ``Sure, they're \n     useless of worse, but why not give in, in order to build good \n     will for future needs?'' The problem is that appeasing \n     multilateralism does not assuage it; appeasement only \n     legitimizes it. Repeated acquiescence on provisions that \n     America deems injurious reinforces the notion that legitimacy\n\n[[Page S1731]]\n\n     derives from international consensus. This is not only a \n     moral absurdity. It is injurious to the U.S., because it \n     undermines any future ability of the U.S. to act \n     unilaterally, if necessary.\n       The key point I want to make about the new unilateralism is \n     that we have to be guided by our own independent judgment, \n     both about our own interests and about global interests. This \n     is true especially on questions of national security, war \n     making, and freedom of action in the deployment of power. \n     America should neither defer nor contract out such decision-\n     making, particularly when the concessions involve permanent \n     structural constrictions, such as those imposed by the \n     International Criminal Court. Should we exercise prudence? \n     Yes. There is no need to act the superpower in East Timor or \n     Bosnia, as there is in Afghanistan or in Iraq. There is no \n     need to act the superpower on steel tariffs, as there is on \n     missile defense\n       The prudent exercise of power calls for occasional \n     concessions on non-vital issues, if only to maintain some \n     psychological goodwill. There's no need for gratuitous high-\n     handedness or arrogance. We shouldn't, however, delude \n     ourselves as to what psychological goodwill can buy. \n     Countries will cooperate with us first our of their own self-\n     interest, and second out of the need and desire to cultivate \n     good relations with the world's unipolar power. Warm feelings \n     are a distant third.\n       After the attack on the USS Cole, Yemen did everything it \n     could to stymie the American investigation. It lifted not a \n     finger to suppress terrorism at home, and this was under an \n     American administration that was obsessively multilateralist \n     and accommodating. Yet today, under the most unilateralist \n     American administration in memory, Yemen has decided to \n     assist in the war on terrorism. This was not the result of a \n     sudden attack of Yemeni goodwill, or of a quick re-reading of \n     the Federalist Papers. It was a result of the war in \n     Afghanistan, which concentrated the mind of recalcitrant \n     states on the price of non-cooperation.\n       Coalitions are not made by superpowers going begging hat in \n     hand; they are made by asserting a position and inviting \n     others to join. What even pragmatic realists fail to \n     understand is that unilateralism is the high road to \n     multilateralism. It was when the first President Bush said \n     that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait would not stand, and made \n     it clear that he was prepared to act alone if necessary, that \n     he created the Gulf War coalition.\n\n\n                         America's Special Role\n\n       Of course, unilateralism does not mean seeking to act \n     alone. One acts in concert with others when possible. It \n     simply means that one will not allow oneself to be held \n     hostage to others. No one would reject Security Council \n     support for war on Iraq or for any other action. The question \n     is what to do if, at the end of the day, the Security Council \n     or the international community refuses to back us? Do we \n     allow ourselves to be dictated to on issues of vital national \n     interest? The answer has to be ``no,'' not just because we \n     are being willful, but because we have a special role, a \n     special place in the world today, and therefore a special \n     responsibility.\n       Let me give you an interesting example of specialness that \n     attaches to another nation. During the 1997 negotiations in \n     Oslo over the land mine treaty, when just about the entire \n     Western world was campaigning for a land mine ban, one of the \n     holdouts was Finland. The Finnish prime minister found \n     himself scolded by his Scandinavian neighbors for stubbornly \n     refusing to sign on the ban. Finally, having had enough, he \n     noted tartly that being foursquare in favor of banning land \n     mines was a ``very convenient'' pose for those neighbors who \n     ``want Finland to be their land mine.''\n       In many parts of the world, a thin line of American GIs is \n     the land mine. The main reason that the U.S. opposed the land \n     mine treaty is that we need them in places like the DMZ in \n     Korea. Sweden and Canada and France do not have to worry \n     about an invasion from North Korea killing thousands of their \n     soldiers. We do. Therefore, as the unipolar power and as the \n     guarantor of peace in places where Swedes do not tread, we \n     need weapons that others do not. Being uniquely situated in \n     the world, we cannot afford the empty platitudes of allies \n     not quite candid enough to admit that they live under \n     the protection of American power. In the end, we have no \n     alternative but to be unilateralist. Multilateralism \n     becomes either an exercise in futility or a cover for \n     inaction.\n       The futility of it is important to understand. The entire \n     beginning of the unipolar age was a time when this country, \n     led by the Clinton administration, eschewed unilateralism and \n     pursued multilateralism with a vengeance. Indeed, the \n     principal diplomatic activity of the U.S. for eight years was \n     the pursuit of a dizzying array of universal treaties: the \n     comprehensive test ban treaty, the chemical weapons \n     convention, the biological weapons convention, Kyoto and, of \n     course, land mines.\n       In 1997, the Senate passed a chemical weapons convention \n     that even its proponents admitted was useless and \n     unenforceable. The argument for it was that everyone else had \n     signed it and that failure to ratify would leave us isolated. \n     To which we ought to say: So what? Isolation in the name of a \n     principle, in the name of our own security, in the name of \n     rationality is an honorable position.\n       Multilateralism is at root a cover for inaction. Ask \n     yourself why those who are so strenuously opposed to taking \n     action against Iraq are also so strenuously in favor of \n     requiring U.N. support. The reason is that they see the U.N. \n     as a way to stop America in its tracks. They know that for \n     ten years the Security Council did nothing about Iraq; \n     indeed, it worked assiduously to weaken sanctions and \n     inspections. It was only when President Bush threatened \n     unilateral action that the U.N. took any action and stirred \n     itself to pass a resolution. The virtue of unilateralism is \n     not just that it allows action. It forces action.\n       I return to the point I made earlier. The way to build a \n     coalition is to be prepared to act alone. The reason that \n     President Bush has been able and will continue to be able to \n     assemble a coalition on Iraq is that the Turks, the Kuwaitis \n     and others in the region will understand that we are prepared \n     to act alone if necessary. In the end, the real division \n     between unilateralists and multilateralists is not really \n     about partnerships or about means or about methods. It is \n     about ends.\n       We have never faced a greater threat than we do today, \n     living in a world of weapons of mass destruction of \n     unimaginable power. The divide before us, between \n     unilateralism and multilateralism, is at the end of the day a \n     divide between action and inaction. Now is the time for \n     action, unilaterally if necessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1731-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1731-S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING CINDY DWYER ON HER RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to call to attention of all \nSenators, the retirement of a dedicated public servant and an \nindividual who has given much to the operation of four Senate offices. \nCindy Dwyer, a member of my staff for the past 2\\1/2\\ years, will be \nending her career as a staff person in the Senate. As the scheduler in \nmy Washington, DC, Senate office, Cindy has been a model for other \ndedicated and talented staff members to emulate, and an invaluable \nasset to everyone who had the honor of working with her. It is with \ndeep regret I announce she will be leaving my office and the Senate in \nFebruary.\n  Before coming to Washington, Cindy worked as a kindergarten teacher \nin Wakonda, SD. In 1975, she began her congressional career in the \noffice of former South Dakota Senator James Abourezk. She worked as a \nstaff assistant in Senator Abourezk's office, and also a part-time \nemployee of the Senate's post office.\n  After Senator Abourezk's retirement in 1978, Cindy joined the staff \nof then-Congressman Tom Daschle, in his first term as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives serving South Dakota. It was during that time \nthat Cindy began her long and distinguished career as a scheduler for \nMembers of Congress.\n  Cindy worked as a consultant for several years before rejoining \nCongressman Daschle's staff in 1985. She went on to become Senator \nDaschle's first Senate press secretary when he was elected to the \nSenate in 1987. She worked for our South Dakota colleague for another \n1\\1/2\\ years, before leaving to work for another of our colleagues, \nSenator J. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska. For 12 years, from 1988-2000, she \nworked for Senator Kerrey, first on his campaign, and later as a senior \nmember of his staff and a very integral member of the Kerrey team. I \nhave been told that little occurred in Bob Kerrey's office that Cindy \nwasn't involved with. As one of Senator Kerrey's closest and trusted \nadvisers, she was responsible for helping to execute the very strong \nrecord of service that Senator Kerrey delivered for his Nebraska \nconstituents.\n  While I regretted Senator Kerrey's retirement from the Senate in \n2000, his departure turned out to be my good fortune, because it was at \nthat point in time that I had the fortune of working with Cindy. I \nneeded to hire an experienced scheduler, and Cindy Dwyer was that \nanswer. To show Cindy's dedication to the Senate and the Senators with \nwhom she has served, she undertook a herculean effort by working in \nboth offices. For a period of time in 2000, she continued to work with \nSenator Kerrey, helping to wind down his final few months of Senate \nservice, and began working in my office as my scheduler. Very few staff \nmembers could have undertaken the responsibilities that Cindy did, \nworking well beyond a normal workweek, even by Senate standards, to \nprovide service to two Senators.\n  During her 2\\1/2\\ years of service, Cindy helped to organize the day \nto day activities of my office and my schedule. The efficiency and \norganization of my\n\n[[Page S1732]]\n\noffice is a direct result of her hard work and preparation. She is not \nonly a valuable member of my staff, but a great friend. Her friendly \ndemeanor and willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty have \nmade her a popular figure in my office and throughout the Senate.\n  Some have suggested that Cindy gets her political roots from her \nfamily. Her father, Gene Dwyer, still works as a staff assistant in \nSenator Daschle's Sioux Falls office. Her sister and brother-in-law, \nPeter and Barbara Stavrianos, have distinguished careers working for \nSenators McGovern, Abourezk, and Daschle.\n  Cindy will be greatly missed, and Barbara and I wish her the very \nbest on all her future endeavors. It is an honor for me to share \nCindy's accomplishments with my colleagues and to publicly commend her \noutstanding service to my office and the people of South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1732-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ROWAN ANTON CRAIG\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

I join with many Idahoans in recognizing Colonel \nStrickfaden's career as a sterling example of dedication to public \nsafety and service to others.\n  Enormous is the debt owed by us to the men and women who work in law \nenforcement, who, every day put their lives on the line to defend the \nrights and liberties we enjoy. Colonel Strickfaden exemplifies the \nsacrifices made by these exceptional people. He is deserving of our \nrespect and honor as he concludes his distinguished career.\n  Edwin D. Strickfaden's career with the Idaho State Police began in \n1967 at the conclusion of 4 years of service to his country in the U.S. \nAir Force. He started with the Idaho State Police serving at the King \nHill Port-of-Entry facility in King Hill, ID. He was made officer-in-\ncharge of the facility in 1969. A year later, he was again promoted and \nassigned to the District Two office in Lewiston. In all, Colonel \nStrickfaden served in six offices of the Idaho State Police throughout \nIdaho, in three of them as commander. The year's many changes and \ntransfers afforded him vast experience in all aspects of Idaho law \nenforcement and many opportunities to serve the people of Idaho.\n  One of many salient moments that defined Mr. Strickfaden's \ndistinguished career is a time when he dove into the icy December \nwaters of the Clearwater River to rescue a woman from a submerged \nvehicle, an action given special recognition by then-Governor Cecil \nAndrus. This action typified the courage and dedication he was known \nfor throughout his 35-year career.\n  The invaluable knowledge and experience that Colonel Strickfaden \ngained through many years of service became critical in 1998 when he \nwas asked to serve as director of the Department of Law Enforcement. \nUnder Colonel Strickfaden's leadership, the former Department of Law \nEnforcement and State Police were combined into a single agency. The \nnew Idaho State Police has become an effective organization with \nnumerous successes in the war on drugs and other enforcement issues in \nIdaho. True to this mission, Idaho has experienced a decline in illegal \ndrug use since Colonel Strickfaden served as director of the Idaho \nState Police. Without the effective work of the Idaho State Police, our \nability to live in a safe and secure environment would be compromised. \nColonel Strickfaden's tireless efforts have helped reach the goal of \nmaking Idaho a safe and secure environment for all of its residents.\n  As he enters a new phase of his life, I know my Senate colleagues \nwill join me in thanking Colonel Strickfaden on his distinguished \ncareer as an Idaho State Police Officer and wish him every success in \nhis future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1732-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1732-4", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1732-5", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE WESTERN \n        BALKANS THAT WAS DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13219--PM 2\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nreport prepared by my Administration on the national emergency with \nrespect to the Western Balkans that was declared in Executive Order \n13219 of June 26, 2001.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to establish the Crossroads of the American Revolution \nNational Heritage Area in the State of New Jersey, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Lautenberg, I \nam introducing legislation, the Crossroads of the American Revolution \nNational Heritage Area Act, to establish the Crossroads of the American \nRevolution National Heritage Area in the State of New Jersey. I am \nproud to be joining my New Jersey colleagues, Representatives Rodney \nFrelinghuysen and Rush Holt, who are introducing this legislation in \nthe House of Representatives, with the support of the entire New Jersey \ndelegation.\n  This legislation recognizes the critical role that New Jersey played \nduring the American Revolution. In fact, New Jersey was the site of \nnearly 300 military engagements that helped determine the course of our \nhistory as a Nation. Many of these locations, like the site where \nGeorge Washington made his historic crossing of the Delaware River, are \nwell known and preserved. Others, such as the Monmouth Battlefield \nState Park in Manalapan and Freehold, and New Bridge Landing in River \nEdge, are less well known and are threatened by development or in \ncritical need of funding for rehabilitation.\n  To help preserve New Jersey's Revolutionary War sites, this \nlegislation would establish a Crossroads of the American Revolution \nNational Heritage Area, linking about 250 sites in 15 counties. This \ndesignation would authorize $10 million to assist preservation, \nrecreational and educational efforts by the State, county and local \ngovernments as well as private cultural and tourism groups. The program \nwould be managed by the non-profit Crossroads of the American \nRevolution Association.\n  Simply put, we are the Nation that we are today because of the \ncritical events that occurred in New Jersey during the American \nRevolution and the many who died fighting there. By enacting the \nCrossroads of the American Revolution National Heritage Area Act of \n2002, we will pay tribute to the patriots who fought and died in New \nJersey so that we might become a Nation free from tyranny.\n  In the 107th Congress, I was proud to see the Senate approve this \nlegislation as part of a bipartisan package of heritage area bills. \nUnfortunately, the bill was not approved in the House of \nRepresentatives. I will work even harder in the 108th Congress to see \nthat this important legislation passes both houses and goes to the \nPresident's desk for his signature. I hope my colleagues will support \nthis legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 230\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Crossroads of the American \n     Revolution National Heritage Area Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the State of New Jersey was critically important during \n     the American Revolution because of the strategic location of \n     the State between the British armies headquartered in New \n     York City, New York, and the Continental Congress in the city \n     of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;\n       (2) General George Washington spent almost half of the \n     period of the American Revolution personally commanding \n     troops of the Continental Army in the State of New Jersey, \n     including 2 severe winters spent in encampments in the area \n     that is now Morristown National Historical Park, a unit of \n     the National Park System;\n       (3) it was during the 10 crucial days of the American \n     Revolution between December 25, 1776, and January 3, 1777, \n     that General Washington, after retreating across the State of \n     New Jersey from the State of New York to the State of \n     Pennsylvania in the face of total defeat, recrossed the \n     Delaware River on the night of December 25, 1776, and went on \n     to win crucial battles at Trenton and Princeton in the State \n     of New Jersey;\n       (4) Thomas Paine, who accompanied the troops during the \n     retreat, described the events during those days as ``the \n     times that try men's souls'';\n       (5) the sites of 296 military engagements are located in \n     the State of New Jersey, including--\n       (A) several important battles of the American Revolution \n     that were significant to--\n       (i) the outcome of the American Revolution; and\n       (ii) the history of the United States; and\n       (B) several national historic landmarks, including \n     Washington's Crossing, the Old Trenton Barracks, and \n     Princeton, Monmouth, and Red Bank Battlefields;\n       (6) additional national historic landmarks in the State of \n     New Jersey include the homes of--\n       (A) Richard Stockton, Joseph Hewes, John Witherspoon, and \n     Francis Hopkinson, signers of the Declaration of \n     Independence;\n       (B) Elias Boudinout, President of the Continental Congress; \n     and\n       (C) William Livingston, patriot and Governor of the State \n     of New Jersey from 1776 to 1790;\n       (7) portions of the landscapes important to the strategies \n     of the British and Continental\n\n[[Page S1738]]\n\n     armies, including waterways, mountains, farms, wetlands, \n     villages, and roadways--\n       (A) retain the integrity of the period of the American \n     Revolution;

A bill to provide that members of the Armed Forces performing \nservices on the Island of Diego Garcia shall be entitled to tax \nbenefits in the same manner as if such services were performed in a \ncombat zone; and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 235. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe treatment of dependent care assistance programs sponsored by the \nDepartment of Defense for members of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce two bills \nthat I originally sponsored in the 107th Congress. As our Nation \nprepares to go to war with Iraq and continues the war against \nterrorism, my bills will give additional tax relief to military \nfamilies. One will give tax relief to a small group of men and women in \nour armed services stationed on the island of Diego Garcia in the \nIndian Ocean, supporting the war on terrorism in Afghanistan. The \nsecond bill will exclude from gross income child care benefits paid to \nmembers of our armed forces. These are small measures, but both will be \nof great benefit to the men and women serving our country.\n  Diego Garcia is a British Territory lying seven degrees South \nLatitude off the coast of India, in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The \nisland is 40 miles around and encompasses an area of 6,720 acres, most \nof it dominated by a large lagoon. The land mass is actually very \nsmall. It is home to a joint British--United States Naval Support \nFacility, and while there are only a small handful of British Royal \nNavy personnel on the island, there is a larger, tight-knit team of \nAmerican Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Army personnel there. These \nmen and women serving on Diego Garcia have been supporting B-52 bombing \nmissions and other operations over Afghanistan. They will be called \ninto service in the event of war with Iraq, they served this purpose in \nthe previous Gulf War.\n  As a Nation, we provide members of our armed forces with a variety of \nbenefits, all of them deserved. They receive hardship duty pay of $150 \nper month for serving in austere regions of the World. They get \nimminent danger pay of $150 per month as compensation for being in \nphysical danger. One of the most generous benefits for those serving in \nthe war on terrorism is the combat zone tax exclusion. Enlisted members \nof the armed services do not pay Federal taxes on their compensation \nfor any month of service inside a combat zone. Officers pay tax on any \namount of income over the highest salary for enlisted personnel. Both \nofficers and enlisted personnel have to serve one day in the combat \nzone to get this benefit for the entire month. The exclusion only \napplies to personnel who receive imminent danger pay.\n  On Diego Garcia, the pilots and flight crews who fly the missions \nover Afghanistan are eligible for the combat zone income tax exclusion \nbecause they receive imminent danger pay. Many of them are from the 2nd \nBomb Wing and the 917th Wing. Both units call Barksdale Air Force Base \nin Louisiana their home. But the men and women who load the bombers, \nfuel them, and maintain them are not eligible because they do not enter \nthe combat zone. Barksdale is also their home base. My office was \ncontacted by some of the Barksdale officers who fly the bombing \nmissions about this discrepancy. They asked me to help out their \nsupport crews, a gesture of selflessness that I seek to honor today.\n  I recognize that the support crews may not receive imminent danger \npay, but their situation is not too different from Naval personnel \nperforming the\n\n[[Page S1740]]\n\nsame tasks on ships in the Arabian Sea. Naval support crews receive \nimminent danger pay and are eligible for the tax exclusion, but they do \nnot enter Afghanistan.\n  Diego Garcia is a beautiful place, but is a long way from home. The \nleast we could do is treat everyone who has served on the island the \nsame. That is what my bill will do.\n  My second bill will correct an omission in the Tax Reform Act of \n1986. That Act contained a provision consolidating the laws regarding \nthe tax treatment of certain military benefits. The Conference Report \nto that Act contains a long list of benefits to be excluded from gross \nincome of military personnel. According to the report, this list was to \nbe exhaustive. The problem is that child care benefits are not on that \nlist.\n  I do not know if this omission was intentional. Perhaps at that time, \nchild care benefits were relatively unknown in the military. The \nConference Report gives the Treasury Secretary the authority to expand \nthe list of eligible benefits, but so far no Secretary has chosen to \nprovide any guidance to the Department of Defense as to how these \nbenefits should be treated for tax purposes. While military families \nare not currently being taxed for child care benefits, the Department \nof Defense has indicated that it would like Congress to clarify that \nchild care benefits are not subject to tax. My bill will give our \nmilitary families and the Department of Defense a greater degree of \ncertainty.\n  I am pleased that my dependent care provision has been included in S. \n19, the Veterans and Military Personnel Fairness Act of 2003. The same \nprovision had been included in a similar package in the last Congress. \nI urge the Finance Committee to consider this package very soon and to \ninclude my Diego Garcia bill in the final package.\n  Throughout our history, in time of war we have worked to make sure \nthat our armed forces have everything they need and we have spared no \nexpense in meeting that need. But the men and women on the ground often \nhave families back at home. We should make sure that we support them as \nwell. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Thomas, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 236. A bill to require background checks of alien flight school \napplicants without regard to the maximum certificated weight of the \naircraft for which they seek training, and to require a report on the \neffectiveness of the requirement; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to re-introduce \nlegislation that would close a serious loophole in the current law \nregulating background checks of alien flight school applicants. This \nlegislation was passed by the Senate last session but was not taken up \nby the House.\n  It is crucial that we close this loophole in the Aviation and \nTransportation Security Act that allows foreign flight school \napplicants to train on small planes without being subjected to a \nbackground check.\n  As we all know, in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, it \nwas discovered that many of the hijackers received flight training in \nthe United States. In addition, Zacarias Moussaoui, the alleged ``20th \nhijacker,'' was apprehended by investigators in Minnesota after \naccounts that he was only interested in learning to fly, not land, an \nairplane.\n  Section 113 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which \nwas enacted in the 107th Congress, requires background checks of all \nforeign flight school applicants seeking training to operate aircraft \nweighing 12,500 pounds or more. While this provision should help ensure \nthat events like the September 11 attacks are not performed by U.S.-\ntrained pilots using hijacked jets in the future, it does nothing to \nprevent different types of potential attacks against our domestic \nsecurity.\n  Last year, the FBI issued a terrorism warning indicating that small \nplanes might be used to carry out suicide attacks. Small aircraft can \nbe used by terrorists to attack nuclear facilities, carry explosives, \nor deliver biological or chemical agents. For example, if a crop duster \nfilled with a combination of fertilizers and explosives were crashed \ninto a filled sporting event stadium thousands of people could be \nseriously injured or killed. We cannot allow this to happen. We need to \nensure that we are not training terrorists to perform these activities. \nWe cannot allow critical warnings to go unheeded.\n  My legislation would close the loophole and answer the critical \nwarnings issued by the FBI.

A bill to reauthorize the Museum and Library Services Act, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce that Museum and \nLibrary Services Act of 2003. I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nKennedy, Cochran, Collins, Snowe, Smith, Daschle, Jeffords, Dodd, \nHarkin, Clinton, Sarbanes, Levin, Leahy, Corzine, Landrieu, and Baucus \nin introducing this legislature to strengthen museum and library \nservices.\n  The Federal Government has a long history of supporting our Nation's \nlibraries and museums, providing direct aid to public libraries since \nthe adoption of the Library Services and Construction Act, LSCA, in \n1956 and funding to museums since the enactment of the Museum Services \nAct in 1976. As a result of this support, our lives and culture have \nbeen enriched.\n  My predecessor, Senator Claiborne Pell, was instrumental in the \ncreation of the Museum Services Act, as well as the development and \nenactment of the Museum and Library Services Act in 1996. This law \nreauthorized Federal library and museum programs under a newly created \nindependent Federal agency called the Institute for Museum and Library \nServices, IMLS.\n  I am proud to continue Senator Pell's tradition of supporting \nlibraries and museums by introducing this legislation to day to extend \nthe authorization of museum and library services through fiscal year \n2009 and to make several important modifications to current law.\n  The bill ensures that library activities are coordinated with the \nschool library program I authored, which is now part of the No Child \nLeft Behind Act of 2001. It establishes a Museum and Library Services \nBoard to advise the Director of IMLS, and it authorizes IMLS to issue a \nNational Award for Library Service as well as a National Award for \nMuseum Service. The bill also ensures that a portion of administrative \nfunds is used to analyze annually the impact of museum and library \nservices to identify needs and trends of services provided under museum \nand library programs. Our bill also establishes a reservation of 1.75 \npercent of funds for museum services for Native Americans, a similar \nreservation is currently provided for library services under the \nLibrary Services and Technology subtitle. Lastly, the bill updates the \nuses of funds for library and museum programs and increases the \nauthorization under the Library Services and Technology Act, LSTA, from \n$150 million to $350 million and the Museum Services Act from $28.7 \nmillion to $65 million.\n  I want to specifically highlight one other provision in the \nlegislation. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 doubles the \nminimum State allotment under the LSTA to $680,000.\n  The minimum State allotment has remained flat at $340,000 since 1971, \nhampering the literacy and cultural efforts of our Nation's smaller \nStates. An analysis prepared by the staff of the Joint Economic \nCommittee shows that it would take approximately $1.5 million for our \nsmall States to keep pace with inflation. The library community has \ninstead suggested a modest, but essential doubling of the minimum state \nallotment to $680,000. This will enable every State to benefit and \nimplement the valuable services and programs that larger states have \nbeen able to put in place. We heard about the importance of this change \nfrom David Macksam, Director of the Cranston Public Library, during a \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing that I chaired \nlast April.\n  Last year, efforts to move this legislation were stymied over \nconcerns about certain IMLS grants and how much funding should be \nauthorized for library and museum programs. The President's forthcoming \nfiscal year 2004 budget will contain a modest, although record, \nincrease in funding for these programs, which I hope will alleviate \nthese concerns. As such, I hope we can move forward early in this \nsession of Congress on a bipartisan basis on a swift reauthorization of \nthe Museum and Library Services act.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work \nfor its passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 238\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Services Act to add \nrequirements regarding trauma care, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, each year, nearly one of every four \nAmericans are injured and require medical attention.\n  Among Americans younger than age 44, trauma is the leading killer. \nWhile injury prevention programs have greatly reduced death and \ndisability, severe injuries will continue. Given the events of \nSeptember 11, 2001 and our Nation's renewed focus on enhancing disaster \npreparedness, it is critical that the Federal Government increase its \ncommitment to strengthening programs governing trauma care system \nplanning and development.\n  The direct and indirect cost of injury is estimated to be about $260 \nbillion a year. The death rate from unintentional injury is more than \n50 percent higher in rural areas than in urban areas. It is essential \nthat all Americans\n\n[[Page S1745]]\n\nhave access to a trauma system that provides definitive care as quickly \nas possible.\n  In recent years, Congress has sought to address this issue through \nthe Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act, which provides \ngrants for the purpose of planning, implementing, and developing \nstatewide trauma care systems. However, this important program expired \nlast year before Congress could reauthorize it. Therefore, I am \nintroducing bipartisan legislation today, along with Senators Kennedy, \nEnzi, Murray, Roberts and Graham of South Carolina to reauthorize this \nimportant program.\n  Despite our past investments, one-half of the states in the country \nare still without a statewide trauma care system. Clearly we can do \nbetter. We must respond to the goals put forth by the Institute of \nMedicine in 1999 that Congress ``support a greater national commitment \nto, and support of, trauma care systems at the federal, state, and \nlocal levels.''\n  Today's bill, the ``Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act \nof 2003'', reauthorizes this program with several improvements: First, \nit improves the collection and analysis of trauma patient data with the \ngoal of improving the overall system of care for these patients; \nsecond, at this time of increasing pressure on state budgets, the bill \nreduces the amount of matching funds that states will have to provide \nto participate in the program so that we can extend quality trauma care \nsystems across the nation; third, the legislation provides a self-\nevaluation mechanism to assist states in assessing and improving their \ntrauma care systems; fourth, it authorizes an Institute of Medicine \nstudy on the state of trauma care and trauma research; and; finally, it \ndoubles the funding available for this program to allow additional \nstates to participate.\n  I appreciate the assistance of Senators Kennedy, Enzi, Murray, \nRoberts and Graham of South Carolina on this important legislation, and \nlook forward to working with them, and with Senator Gregg, the Chairman \nof the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, to see \nthis bill passed this year.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join Senator Frist in \nintroducing the Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act. Our \ngoal in this bipartisan legislation is to enable all States to develop \nmore effective trauma care systems.\n  Trauma is the No. 1 killer of Americans under age 44. Traumatic \ninjuries robs, devastate families and cost the Nation an estimated $60 \nbillion every year. In 1995 alone, injuries were responsible for \n148,000 deaths, 2.6 million hospitalizations, and over 36 million \nemergency room visits.\n  Despite this toll, we have done little in recent years to prevent \ntrauma or improve the chance of recovery from traumatic injury. Part of \nthe problem is the widespread view that trauma is an accident, an \nunfortunate and often unavoidable injury. But this is often not the \ncase.\n  Proven preventive measures could save up to 25,000 lives every year. \nBetter treatment systems can give victims a better chance of recovery, \nby delivering quality care as quickly as possible.\n  A trauma system is a coordinated effort to provide the full range of \ncare to all injured patients. Treatment begins at the site of injury, \nand continues from prehospital to hospital to rehabilitative services. \nResources, supporting equipment, and personnel are ready and trained to \ngo into action.\n  The skills and knowledge of health care experts are not enough. \nOptimal care is the result of advance planning, preparation, and \ncoordination to produce smooth transitions and the proper sequence of \ninterventions. Effective trauma systems accomplish all this, saves \nlives, and reduces costs.\n  Much of the progress in developing trauma systems has occurred as a \nresult of Federal funding and involvement. In 1973, Congress passed the \nEmergency Medical Services Act, providing $300 million to States and \ncommunities over an 8-year period. Without that funding, patients in \nhundreds of regions in the Nation might not have had prompt access to \nemergency care. Even today, there are parts of the Nation without 911 \naccess and immediate emergency transportation.\n  In 1990, Congress passed the Trauma Care Systems Planning and \nDevelopment Act, authorizing Federal grants to States to develop \nstatewide trauma care systems. Funding for this program has been \ninadequate. From 1995 to 2000, States received no funding at all. Last \nyear, only $3.5 million was appropriated for the entire country. As a \nresult, only half of all States today have fully functional statewide \ntrauma systems. Clearly, we must do better in providing needed trauma \ncare.\n  Our legislation reauthorizes and strengthens the trauma care program \nto establish effective trauma systems in all States. It asks the \nInstitutes of Medicine to investigate the quality of trauma care and \nidentify areas for improvement. Surprisingly, given the burden of \ntrauma on society, less than 1 percent of resources at the NIH are \ndevoted to trauma research.\n  Our legislation is supported by the Coalition for American Trauma \nCare, the American College of Surgeons, and the American Trauma \nSociety. Its enactment is important to public safety, and I urge the \nSenate to approve it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. \n        Harkin):\n  S. 240. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nallocation of small ethanol producer credit to patrons of cooperative, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would extend the 10-cents-per-gallon small ethanol producers' tax \ncredit to small farmer-owned cooperatives. The measure, if approved by \nCongress, could help boost ethanol production at a time when domestic \nenergy prices are on the rise and the United States is seeking to \nreduce its dependence on foreign oil.\n  Under current law, small ethanol producers, those who make less than \n30 million gallons of ethanol per year, are eligible for an additional \n10-cents-per-gallon-tax credit for up to 15 million gallons of ethanol \neach year. While the tax credit is intended to help maximize U.S. \nethanol production by aiding small producers that otherwise may not be \nable to compete with larger companies, an unintended glitch in the law \nbars small farm cooperatives from passing this credit on to their \nfarmers. Unfortunately, this glitch stifles production and penalizes \nfarmers who join cooperatives.\n  Farm cooperatives can be an efficient way for farmers to trim costs \nand maximize income. We must ensure that our tax code does not penalize \nfarmers for pooling their resources in cooperatives. With rising energy \nprices and a potentiality vast new market for ethanol in the Nation's \nclean air program, we should encourage, not discourage, greater \nproduction by ethanol cooperatives.\n  This legislation would revise existing tax law to permit farmer-owned \ncooperatives to pass the small producers' ethanol tax credit on to \ntheir members through dividends and allow these producers to treat this \nincome as if they had generated it directly.\n  The bill would also expand the number of producers eligible for the \ntax credit by doubling the production limit from 30 million gallons of \nethanol a year 60 million gallons. Like most businesses, ethanol \nproduction facilities must achieve economies of scale to be viable in a \ncompetitive marketplace. Doubling the limit to 60 million gallons \nsimply modernizes the tax credit to reflect current economic realities.\n  I believe we must approach the new millennium with a renewed \ncommitment to keep our environment clean and safe, and I also believes \nthis objective is consistent with building and maintaining a strong \neconomy. Renewable energy is central to our long-term goal of energy \nself-sufficiency. By expanding eligibility for the small producers' \nethanol tax credit, this bill could stimulate ethanol production and \nultimately help lessen our dependence on foreign sources of oil.\n  Realizing this important benefit, the Senate included this \nlegislation in the comprehensive energy legislation, H.R. 4, which \nunfortunately, failed to emerge from conference committee prior to the \nend of the 107th Congress. Additionally, this small ethanol producer \ntax credit legislation was incorporated into Senator Grassley's ``Tax\n\n[[Page S1746]]\n\nEmpowerment and Relief for Farmers and Fishermen, TERFF, Act,'' which \nwe also did not approve prior to adjournment of the last Congress. I \nlook forward to working with our new Finance Committee Chairman and my \nco-sponsor, Senators Johnson, Hagel, and Harkin, to get this \nlegislation signed into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 240\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Coastal Zone Management Act; read the \nfirst time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Coastal Zone \nEnhancement Reauthorization Act of 2003. I am pleased to have \nbipartisan support for this bill and to be joined by the chair and \nranking Democrats of the Commerce Committee and the Subcommittee on \nOceans and Fisheries. Senators McCain, Hollings, and Kerry have been \ninstrumental in developing the wide range of support for this bill, and \nI appreciate their interest in improving the way we manage our Nation's \nvaluable coastal and marine resources.\n  In 1972, Congress responded to concerns over the increasing demands \nbeing placed on our nation's coastal regions and resources by enacting \nof the Coastal Zone Management Act. These pressures have greatly \nincreased since the act was originally authorized.\n  Although the coastal zone only comprises 10 percent of the contiguous \nU.S. land area, nearly 53 percent of all Americans live in these \ncoastal regions, and more than 3,600 people are relocating there \nannually. This small portion of our country supports approximately 361 \nsea-ports, contains most of our largest cities, and serves as critical \nhabitat for a variety of plants and animals.\n  This bill reauthorizes and makes a number of important improvements \nto the Coastal Zone Management Act. Under the authorities in this act, \ncoastal States can choose to participate in the voluntary Federal \nCoastal Zone Management Program. States then design individual coastal \nzone management programs, taking their specific needs and problems into \naccount, and then receive federal matching funds to help carry out \ntheir program plans. State coastal zone programs manage issues ranging \nfrom public access to beaches, to protecting habitat, to coordinating \npermits for coastal development.\n  As voluntary program, the framework of the CZMA provides guidelines \nfor State plans to address multiple environmental, societal, cultural, \nand economic objectives.\n  The health of our coastal zone is vitally important not only to the \nmultitude of plants and animals that inhabit this area, but also to the \npeople and communities that are dependent on it for their livelihood. \nFor example, coastal areas provide habitat for more than 75 percent of \nthe U.S. commercial fisheries and 85 percent of the U.S. recreational \nfisheries. In turn, the commercial fishing industry, along with value-\nadded services included, contributes $40 billion to the U.S. economy \neach year. Recreational fishing adds another $25 billion to the \neconomy.\n  The Coastal Zone Management Program can be used to help balance the \nconservation of fish stocks with the demands that we place on coastal \nareas. In my State of Maine, a $150,000 study of the State's cargo \nneeds led to a $27 million bond issue for cargo port improvements. As a \nresult, Bath Iron Works built a new $45 million facility, creating \n1,000 new jobs. Similar work needs to be done with our fishing ports so \nthat when fisheries stock rebound, the fishermen will be able to \nrealize the returns.\n\n  Unfortunately our precious coastal resources are being threatened by \nenvironmental problems, including non-point source pollution. Although \nthe States are currently taking action to\n\n[[Page S1747]]\n\naddress this problem under existing authority, the Coastal Zone \nEnhancement Reauthorization Act of 2003 encourages, but does not \nrequire, them to take additional steps to combat these problems through \nthe Coastal Community Program.\n  This initiative provides States with the funding and flexibility \nneeded to deal with their specific nonpoint source pollution problems. \nThe States will have the ability to implement local solutions to a \nbroad array of local problems. Many States are actively engaged in \nnonpoint source pollution programs and all can benefit from this new \ntool I am proud to say that Maine has risen to the challenge and \nalready spends close to 30 percent of its funding on such activities. \nThis has led to the reopening of hundreds of acres of shellfish beds \nand the restoration of fish nursery areas. Even with these successes, \nMaine is looking forward to this new opportunity to do more.\n  The Coastal Community Program in this bill also aides States in \ndeveloping and implementing creative initiatives to deal with problems \nother than nonpoint source pollution. It increases Federal and State \nsupport of Local community-based programs that address coastal \nenvironmental issues, such as the impact of development and sprawl on \ncoastal uses and resources. This type of bottom-up management approach \nis critical.\n  The Coastal Zone Enhancement Reauthorization Act of 2003 \nsignificantly increases the authorization levels for the Coastal Zone \nManagement Program, allowing States to better address their coastal \nmanagement plan goals. The bill authorizes $135.5 million for fiscal \nyear 2004, $141 million for fiscal year 2005 and increases the \nauthorization levels by $5.5 million each year through fiscal year \n2008. This increase in funding is necessary to allow the coastal \nprograms to reach their full potential.\n  Additionally, the Coastal Zone Enhancement Reauthorization Act of \n2003 increases authorization for the National Estaurine Research \nReserve System, NERRS, to $13 million in fiscal year 2004 with an \nadditional $1 million increase each year through fiscal year 2008. \nNERRS is a network of reserves across the country that are operated as \na cooperative Federal-State partnership.\n  Currently, there are 25 reserves in 22 States. They provide an \nimportant opportunity for long-term research and education in these \necosystems. Additional funds will help strengthen this nationwide \nprogram which has not received increased funding commensurate with the \naddition of new reserves.\n  I wish to address a very serious problem facing the Coastal Zone \nManagement Program that we have tried to rectify in this bill. The \nAdministrative Grant Program, section 306, serves as the base funding \nmechanism for the States' coastal zone management programs. The amount \nof funding each State receives is determined by a formula that takes \ninto account both the length of the coastline and the population of \neach State.\n  However, sine 1992, the Appropriations Committee has imposed a $2 \nmillion dollar cap per State on administrative grants. This was an \nattempt to ensure equitable allocation to all the participating States. \nOver the past 8 years, appropriations for administrative grants have \nincreased by $19 million, yet the $2 million cap has remained. The \nresult has been an inequitable distribution of these new funds. By \nfiscal year 2000, 13 States had reached this arbitrary $2 million cap. \nThese 13 States account for 83 percent of our Nation's coastline and 76 \npercent of our coastal population.\n  It is not equitable to have the 13 States with the largest coastlines \nand populations stuck at a $2 million dollar cap, despite major overall \nfunding increases. While smaller States have enjoyed additional \nprogrammatic success due to an influx of funding, some of the larger \nStates have stagnated.\n  In an attempt to reassure members of the Appropriations Committee \nthat a fair distribution of funds can occur without this hard cap in \nplace, I have worked with Senator Hollings to develop language that has \nbeen included in this bill that directs the Secretary of Commerce to \nensure equitable increases or decreases between funding years for each \nState. It further requires that States should not experience a decrease \nin base program funds in any year when the overall appropriations \nincrease.\n  I thank Senator Hollings for his assistance in resolving this matter \nand his commitment over the years to ensuring that the states are \ntreated fairly.\n  The Coastal Zone Management Program enjoys wide support among all of \nthe coastal States due to its history of success. This support has been \nclearly demonstrated by the many members of the Commerce Committee who \nhave worked with me to strengthen this program over the past several \nyears.\n  I thank Senator Kerry, the ranking Democrat of the Oceans and \nFisheries Subcommittee, for his hard work and support of this bill. I \nwould also like to express my appreciation to Senator McCain, the \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator Hollings, the ranking \nDemocrat of the Committee, for their support of this measure and for \ntheir willingness to discharge this bill out of the committee so that \nwe may begin working with our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives to enact this critical piece of legislation.\n  This is a solid, reasonable, and a realistic bill that enjoys \nbipartisan support on the Commerce Committee. It is time that we now \nturn to legislation reauthorizing a program with a long track record of \npreserving our coastal environment while allowing sensible development.\n  I am pleased to support this legislation that will provide the States \nwith the necessary funding and framework to meet the challenges facing \nour coastal communities in the 21st Century. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 242. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthe same capital gains treatment for art and collectibles as for other \ninvestment property and to provide that a deduction equal to fair \nmarket value shall be allowed for charitable contributions of literary, \nmusical, artistic, or scholarly compositions created by the donor; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce again \nlegislation to eliminate one of the great inconsistencies in the \nInternal Revenue Code.\n  The bill I am introducing today with Senator Bennett is designed to \nrestore some internal consistency to the tax code as it applies to art \nand artists. No one has ever said that the tax code is fair even though \nit has always been a theoretical objective of the code to treat similar \ntaxpayers similarly.\n  The bill I am introducing today would address two areas where \nsimilarly situated taxpayers are not treated the same.\n  Internal inconsistency #1 deals with the long-term capital gains tax \ntreatment of investments in art and collectibles. If a person invests \nin stocks or bonds, holds the asset for the requisite period of time, \nand sells at a gain, the tax treatment is long term capital gains. The \ntop capital gains tax rate is 20 percent, 18 percent, if the asset is \nheld for five or more years. However, if the same person invests in art \nor collectibles the top rate is hiked up to 28 percent. Art for art's \nsake should not incur an additional 40 percent tax bill simply for \nrevenue's sake. That is a big impact on the pocketbook of the beholder.\n  Art and collectibles are alternatives to financial instruments as an \ninvestment choice. To create a tax disadvantage with respect to one \ninvestment compared to another creates an artificial market and may \nlead to poor investment allocations. It also adversely impacts those \nwho make their livelihood in the cultural sectors of the economy.\n  Santa Fe, NM, is the third largest art market in the country. We have \na diverse colony of artists, collectors and gallery owners. We have \nfabulous Native American rug weavers, potters, and carvers. Creative \ngiants like Georgia O'Keeffe, Maria Martinez, E.L. Blumenshein, Allan \nHouser, R.C. Gorman, and Glenna Goodacre have all chosen New Mexico as \ntheir home and as their artistic subject. John Nieto, Wilson Hurley, \nClark Hulings, Veryl Goodnight, Bill Acheff, Susan Rothenberg, Bruce \nNauman, Agnes Martin, Doug Hyde, Margaret Nez, Dan\n\n[[Page S1748]]\n\nOstermiller are additional examples of living artists creating art in \nNew Mexico.\n  Art, antiques, and collectibles are a $12 to $20 billion annual \nindustry nationwide. In New Mexico, it has been estimated that art and \ncollectible sales range between $500 million and $1 billion a year.\n  Economists have always been interested in the economics of the arts. \nAdam Smith is a well-known economist. He was also a serious, but \nlittle-known essayist on painting, dancing, and poetry. Keynes was a \npassionate devotee of painting.\n  Even the artistically inclined economists found it difficult to \ndefine art within the context of economic theory. When asked to define \njazz, Louis Armstrong replied: ``If you gotta ask, you ain't never \ngoing to know.''\n  A similar conundrum has challenged Galbraith and other economists who \nhave grappled with the definitional issues associated with bringing art \nwithin the economic calculus. Original art objects are, as a commodity \ngroup, characterized by a set of attributes: every unit of output is \ndifferentiated from every other unit of output; art works can be copied \nbut not reproduced; the cultural capital of the Nation has significant \nelements of public good.\n  Because art works can be resold, and their prices may rise over time, \nthey have the characteristics of financial assets, and as such may be \nsought as a hedge against inflation, as a store of wealth, or as a \nsource of speculative capital gain. A study by Keishiro Matsumoto, \nSamuel Andoh and James P. Hoban, Jr. assessed the risk-adjusted rates \nof return on art sold at Sotheby's during the 14-year period ending \nSeptember 30, 1989. They concluded that art was a good investment in \nterms of average real rates of return. Several studies found that rates \nof return from the price appreciation on paintings, comic books, \ncollectibles and modern prints usually made them very attractive long-\nterm investments.\n  William Goetzmann when he was at the Columbia Business School \nconstructed an art index and concluded that painting price movements \nand stock market fluctuations are correlated.\n  I conclude that with art, as well as stocks, past performance is no \nguarantee of future returns but the gains should be taxed the same.\n  In 1990, the editor of Art and Auction asked the question: ``Is there \nan `efficient' art market?'' A well-known art dealer answered \n``Definitely not. That's one of the things that makes the market so \ninteresting.'' For everyone who has been watching world financial \nmarkets lately, the art market may be a welcome distraction.\n  Why do people invest in art and collectibles? Art and collectibles \nare something you can appreciate even if the investment doesn't \nappreciate. Art is less volatile. If buoyant and not so buoyant bond \nprices drive you berserk and spiraling stock prices scare you, art may \nbe the appropriate investment. Because art and collectibles are \ninvestments, the long-term capital gains tax treatment should be the \nsame as for stocks and bonds. This bill would accomplish that.\n  Artists will benefit. Gallery owners will benefit. Collectors will \nbenefit. And museums benefit from collectors. About 90 percent of what \nwinds up in museums like the New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art \ncomes from collectors.\n\n  Collecting isn't just for the hoyty toity. It seems that everyone \ncollects something. Some collections are better investments than \nothers. Some collections are just bizarre. The internet makes \ncollecting big business.\n  The flea market fanatics are also avid collectors. In fact, people \ncollect the darndest things. Books, duck decoys, chia pets, snowglobes, \nthimbles, handcuffs, spectacles, baseball cards, and guns.\n  For most of these collections, capital gains isn't really an issue, \nbut you never know. You may find that your collecting passion has \ncreated a tax predicament, to phrase it politely. Art and collectibles \nare tangible assets. When you sell them, capital gains tax is due on \nany appreciation over your purchase price.\n  The bill provides capital gains tax parity because it lowers the top \ncapital gains rate from 28 percent to 20 percent, 18 percent if the \nasset has been held for five or more years.\n  Internal inconsistency #2 deals with the charitable deduction for \nartists donating their work to a museum or other charitable cause. When \nsomeone is asked to make a charitable contribution to a museum or to a \nfund raising auction it shouldn't matter whether you are an artist or \nnot. Under current law, however, it makes a big difference. As the law \nstands now, an artist/creator can only take a deduction equal to the \ncost of the art supplies. The bill I am introducing will allow a fair \nmarket deduction for the artist.\n  It's important to note that this bill includes certain safeguards to \nkeep the artist from ``painting himself a tax deduction.'' This bill \napplies to literary, musical, artistic, and scholarly compositions if \nthe work was created at least 18 months before the donation was made, \nhas been appraised, and is related to the purpose or function of the \ncharitable organization receiving the donation. As with other \ncharitable contributions, it is limited to 50 percent of adjusted gross \nincome, AGI. If it is also a capital gain, there is a 30 percent of AGI \nlimit. I believe these safeguards bring fairness back into the code and \nprotect the Treasury against my potential abuse.\n  When I introduced this legislation in the last Congress, the \nCommittee on Joint Tax estimated that revenue for the capital gains \nprovision was $2.3 billion over ten years and for the charitable \ndeduction was approximately $48 million over ten years.\n  I hope my colleagues will help me put the internally consistent into \nthe Internal Revenue Code for art's sake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 242\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide that certain Bureau of Land Management land \nshall be held in trust for the Pueblo of Santa Clara and the Pueblo of \nSan Ildefonso in the State of New Mexico; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nBingaman in introducing legislation that declares the United States \nholds certain public domain lands in trust for the Pueblos of San \nIldefonso and Santa Clara in New Mexico. This body, in the 107th \nCongress, passed this legislation by unanimous consent. The House did \nnot act on it's companion and so we are here today to reintroduce the \nlegislation.\n  In 1988 the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, pursuant to the Federal \nLands Policy and Management Act, declared approximately 4,484 acres \nlocated in the eastern foothills of the Jemez Mountains in north \ncentral New Mexico, including portions of Garcia and Chupadero Canyons, \nto be ``disposal property.'' The Garcia Canyon surplus lands qualify \nfor disposal partially because the track is an isolated tract of land \nalmost inaccessible to the general public. It is bordered on three \nsides by the reservations of Santa Clara Pueblo and the Pueblo of San \nIldefonso, and by U.S. Forest Service land on the remaining side. The \nonly road access consists of unimproved roads through the two Pueblo's \nreservations. These factors have resulted in minimal or no public usage \nof the Garcia Canyon surplus lands in recent decades.\n  I understand that currently there are no resource permits, leases, \npatents or claims affecting these lands; nor is it likely that any \nsignificant minerals exist with the Garcia Canyon transfer lands. The \nGarcia Canyon transfer lands contain a limited amount of lesser quality \nforage for livestock and have not been actively grazed for over a \ndecade. However, the Garcia Canyon surplus lands constitute an \nimportant part of the ancestral homelands of the Pueblos of Santa Clara \nand San Ildefonso.\n  Santa Clara and San Ildefonso are two of the Tewa-speaking federally-\nrecognized Indian Pueblos of New Mexico. Both Pueblos have occupied and \ncontrolled the areas where they are presently located many centuries \nbefore the arrival of the first Europeans in the area in the late 16th \ncentury. Their homelands are defined by geographical landmarks, \ncultural sites, and other distinct places whose traditional Tewa names \nand locations have been known and passed down in each Pueblo through \nthe generations. Based upon these boundaries, about 2,000 acres of the \nGarcia Canyon surplus lands is within the aboriginal domain of the \nPueblo of San Ildefonso. The remaining approximately 2,484 acres are in \nSanta Clara's aboriginal lands.\n  The Bureau of Land Management currently seeks to dispose of the \nGarcia Canyon surplus lands and the Pueblos of Santa Clara and San \nIldefonso seek to obtain these lands. In addition, the BLM and Interior \nDepartment for years have supported the transfer of the land to the two \nPueblos, provided the Pueblos agree upon a division of the Garcia \nCanyon surplus lands. In response, the two Pueblos signed a formal \nagreement affirming the boundary between the respective parcels on \nDecember 20, 2000.\n  The Pueblos of Santa Clara and San Ildefonso have worked diligently \nin arriving at this agreement. They have also worked collaboratively in \nseeking community support and garnering supporting resolutions from Los \nAlamos, Rio Arriba and Santa Fe Counties, the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians and supporting letters from the National Audubon \nSociety's New Mexico State Office, the Quivira Coalition and the Santa \nFe Group of the Sierra Club.\n  This unique situation presents a win-win opportunity to support more \nefficient management of public resources while restoring to tribal \ncontrol isolated tracts of federal disposal property. Upon transfer, \nthe Pueblos of Santa Clara and San Ildefonso intend to maintain these \nlands in their natural state and use them for sustainable traditional \npurposes including cultural resource gathering, hunting and possible \nlivestock grazing. Where appropriate, both tribes are interested in \nperforming work to restore and improve ecosystem health, particularly \nto support habitat for culturally significant animal and plant species. \nBoth Pueblos have experience Natural Resource Management and \nEnvironmental Protection programs and are capable of managing these \nlands for both ecologic health and community benefits.\n  We want to secure Congressional authorization to transfer control of \nthese lands to the two Pueblos, with legal title being held in trust by \nthe Secretary of the Interior for each of the Pueblos for their \nrespective portions of the property. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation as they did last term. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia \nResearch and Control Act of 1998, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Harmful Algal \nBloom and Hypoxia Amendments Act of 2003. This bill continues and \nbuilds upon the research efforts established in 1998 by the Harmful \nAlgal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act.\n  I am very pleased to continue working with my friend and co-sponsor \nSenator Breaux on this important issue. He and I represent coastal \nStates that are directly affected by harmful algal bloom outbreaks and \nhypoxia, and we see the ecological and economic damage, as well as the \nrisks to human health, that are caused by these events.\n  In Maine, for example, harmful algal blooms lead to paralytic \nshellfish poisoning, a potentially fatal neurological disorder. When \nhumans eat shellfish that have fed on algae in the genus Alexandrium, \nthey are exposed to the toxins that have accumulated in the fish as a \nresult of the algae. Along with human, fish and marine mammals suffer \nand die from this exposure. This phenomenon, which occurs along \nthousands of miles of U.S. coastline, has increased dramatically in the \nGulf of Maine in the last 20 years.\n  Although we have learned a great deal about harmful algal blooms and \nhypoxia in recent years, we still have a long way to go in \nunderstanding, predicting, and mitigating these events. Massive fish \nkills still occur along our coastlines on almost a regular basis, \nleading to extensive impacts on fish and shellfish populations and \nfishing industries. Beach-goers and anglers are still being warned of \n``no swimming'' and ``no fishing'' alerts when conditions pose a threat \nto human health. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in a 2000 \nstudy, estimated the annual economic impact from harmful algae to be \n$49 million, in lost tourism, fishing, and health costs. According to \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in the U.S. \napproximately $1 billion could be lost in the next decade due to \nharmful algae.\n  Harmful algal blooms and hypoxia present enormous challenges to \nmarine resource managers. For example, consider what happens in the \nGulf of Mexico. Thirty-one States drain into the Mississippi River, and \nthe runoff from this massive watershed is carried into the gulf. When \nthe waters heat up in the summer, the heavy loads of nutrients in this \nrunoff likely contribute to massive algal blooms. When these algae die \nand decompose they are consumed by bacteria, which depletes oxygen from \nthe water. If the algal blooms are extensive enough, they will \nessentially remove all oxygen from the water. No sea life can live \nunder these conditions, which creates a massive area in the water \ncolumn known as the\n\n[[Page S1751]]\n\n``dead zone.'' At that point, all we can really do is wait it out. \nClearly, we need to equip our coastal and ocean managers with better \ntools for predicting, minimizing, and mitigating these outbreaks.\n  Harmful algal blooms and hypoxia are just as much of a problem now as \nthey were in 1998, when we passed the original bill. It is clear that \nthese problems have not gone away. Algal blooms are still prevalent \naround the country, the dead zone still occurs each summer in the Gulf \nof Mexico, and the management and mitigation measures we set the \nframework for in our 1998 bill still need to be realized.\n\n  Our 1998 bill authorized a cross-section of research and monitoring \nactivities on harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. These activities were \nto encompass basic and applied sciences, looking at the distribution \nand frequency of outbreaks, as well as how they may be better mitigated \nand managed. This research, however, was never fully funded at the \nauthorized amounts for research and monitoring, so many of these \nresearch activities still need to occur, and many on-going projects \nneed to continue. These amendments would authorize the funding that \nwill reignite these scientific activities.\n  Our 1998 bill also codified an Interagency Task Force, chaired by the \nDepartment of Commerce. Through this group, experts from the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, the \nDepartment of the Interior, the Department of Health and Human \nServices, and numerous other appropriate Federal agencies were able to \nstart the long process of collectively understanding and seeking \nsolutions to many aspects of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. This \nTask Force spearheaded a technical assessment of the causes and \nconsequences of the northern Gulf of Mexico dead zone, an action plan \nto eliminate this dead zone, a national assessment of harmful algal \nblooms, and a national assessment of hypoxia. I would like to express \nmy appreciation for the hard work and accomplishments of this group, \nyet I realize--as do they--that much more needs to be done.\n  The 1998 bill allowed the President to disestablish the Task Force \nafter submission of their reports. Considering the great challenges \nthat lay before us and this Task Force, we need to keep this group \nintact so that they can follow through on their previous \nrecommendations and continue much of their ongoing collaborative \nefforts. This bill would repeal the Task Force disestablishment clause \nin the 1998 bill.\n  This reauthorization continues to seek the valuable contributions of \nTask Force members on a response and prediction action plan to protect \nenvironmental and public health from impacts of harmful algal blooms. \nThis plan would review prediction techniques, develop innovative \nresponse measures, and include incentive-based partnership approaches. \nThe Task Force would contribute to this plan, as would coastal zone \nmanagement experts from State and local governments, Indian tribes, \nindustries, universities, and non-governmental organizations. In \ndeveloping this process, we mirrored the process used for the dead zone \naction plan, one of the products of the Task Force from the 1998 bill, \nto ensure widespread public participation and involvement of the \ncoastal governors.\n  The dead zone action plan recommended a national framework for \nreducing nutrients entering the Mississippi River as well as regional \nplans to implement any needed measures. While a national framework is \nessential for facilitating the widespread changes that are needed, it \nis at the local and regional level that solutions must be developed and \nimplemented. The regional plans will help avoid a one-size-fits-all \napproach, since local and regional variations in the types of land use, \nlandscape geology, and community input should be taken into account \nwhen carrying out nutrient reduction and outbreak mitigation measures \nof this magnitude. By tailoring mitigation and management measures to \neach location, the overall approach can be more effective.\n  Local and regional assessments are a key component of this \nreauthorization as well. Coastal states, Indian tribes, and local \ngovernments would be able to request these local and regional \nassessments of hypoxia and harmful algal blooms, so they can better \nunderstand the causes, impacts, and mitigation alternatives for these \noutbreaks. By having the Commerce Department and the Task Force provide \nand assist in these assessments, local and regional communities can be \nmore empowered to take action on reducing the magnitude and impacts of \nthese outbreaks.\n  This bill would authorize $26 million in FY04, and $26.5 million in \nFY05, and $27 million in FY06. These funding levels reflect modest \nincreases in some of the research and monitoring programs authorized in \nthe 1998 bill and provide funding for the new assessments and \nimplementation of their recommendations.\n  This reauthorization enables collaborative, science-based research \nefforts that can help us to better understand how to predict and \nmitigate harmful algal blooms and hypoxia events. It facilitates action \nat the local and regional levels, which is a key element for \neffectively addressing and minimizing the adverse ecological, economic, \nand health impacts of these outbreaks. I wish to thank Senator Breaux \nfor his continued vigilance and important contributions on this matter, \nand I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 247\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to join Senator \nSnowe as an original cosponsor of the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia \nAmendments Act of 2003.\n  The Gulf of Mexico has a serious hypoxia condition. The water flowing \nout of the Mississippi River Delta is loaded with nutrients, nutrients \nthat help things grow. In the gulf, the nutrients fuel accelerated \ngrowth of algae and other plankton-like organisms. As the organisms die \nand descent through the water, they decompose and rob the water of \ndissolved oxygen. This lack of oxygen, below a level which can sustain \nmarine life, is hypoxia and creates what we call ``the Dead Zone.'' In \n1998, the ``Dead Zone'' exceeded 7,000 square miles, equivalent to the \ncombined areas of the States of Rhode Island and Connecticut.\n  As a Senator from the State that is on the receiving end of this \nunprecedented problem and as a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, \nSubcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, I was very pleased to have worked \nwith Senator Snowe on legislation that first drew national attention to \nhypoxia and harmful algal blooms, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia \nControl Act of 1998.\n  Among important issues, the enacted legislation required an \ninteragency task force to develop an assessment of hypoxia in the \nnorthern Gulf of Mexico. It also required the task force to submit to \nCongress a plan based on the assessment for reducing, mitigating, and \ncontrolling hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico.\n  The Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force \nwas given a large job, to come up with a national strategy to reduce \nthe size and growth of the ``Dead Zone'' in the Gulf of Mexico off of \nthe coast of Louisiana. They were charged by the Harmful Algal Bloom \nand Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998 to put this strategy in \nthe form of an action plan that could be undertaken by the States and \npartner agencies at the Federal and State level that make up the task \nforce. They succeeded on both fronts, not only delivering an action \nplan, but doing so by reaching consensus after a process of strenuous \ndebate and discussion involving many stakeholders and interests. That \nplan was delivered to Congress in January of 2001 but has yet to be \nfully funded. Even so, it has been providing some significant benefits \nto the Mississippi River Basin and the country.\n  As the action plan states ``the work of the Task Force has provided a \nbasin-wide context for the continued pursuit of both incentive-based, \nvoluntary efforts for non-point sources and existing regulatory \ncontrols for point sources.''\n  The task force made it clear in the action plan that efforts to \nreduce hypoxia in the Gulf involve cleaning up waters upstream and \nthroughout the Mississippi River Basin, and that the benefits, \neconomic, as well as environmental, can be achieved across the entire \nbasin as well. Their work is providing us with a way to unify the \nMississippi River Basin in terms of our common interests and resources, \nprimary of which is the Mississippi River, probably the most important \npiece of infrastructure in the country.\n  In Louisiana, we value all of the resources of that vast system, not \nonly our productive coastal fisheries which are endangered by hypoxia, \nbut the corn, grain, and other food sources that are shipped out \nthrough our port system.\n  Solving the problem of the ``Dead Zone'' will require an \nunprecedented degree of cooperation among many States, agencies, and \nstakeholders. The task force is continuing to provide us with a forum \nand a means for expanding that cooperation.\n  One of the prime research facilities on the hypoxia problem is taking \nplace at the Louisiana University Marine Consortium, LUMON, in \nCocodrie, LA. LUMCON has been studying the hypoxia problem in the Gulf \nof Mexico since 1985 under grants from the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration's Coastal Ocean Program.\n  The combined efforts of the task force has become even more apparent \nover the past year, as the ``Dead Zone'' reached a new record size in \nthe summer of 2002, exceeding 8,000 square miles and extending from the \nmouth of the Mississippi River well into the coastal waters of Texas.\n  I believe that the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Amendments Act of \n2003 that Senator Snowe and I are introducing today will provide much \nneeded funding and direction to continue the effort to mitigate and \neventually eliminate the hypoxic problem in the Gulf of Mexico and \nharmful algal blooms in our Nation's waters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1752-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1752-S1756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 27--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE SELECT COMMITTEE \n                            ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. Roberts. submitted the following resolution; from the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence; which was referred to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration:\n\n                               S.

Res. 28\n\n       Whereas on November 8, 2002, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 1441, stating that Iraq is in \n     ``material breach'' of its obligations under previous United \n     Nations resolutions, and giving Iraq ``a final opportunity to \n     comply with its disarmament obligations'' and to accept ``an \n     enhanced inspection regime'';\n       Whereas Iraq formally accepted the return of weapons \n     inspectors under the terms of United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1441 on November 13, 2002, and according to a \n     joint statement issued January 20, 2003, by the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations Monitoring \n     and Verification Commission (UNMOVIC), and Iraq, the \n     Government of Iraq has provided the weapons inspectors with \n     access to all sites;\n       Whereas on December 7, 2002, Iraq provided a 12,000-page \n     declaration of past chemical, biological, and nuclear \n     programs to the Security Council, which declaration, after \n     preliminary review, was described by Mohamed ElBaradei, the \n     Director General of the IAEA, as incomplete and inconclusive, \n     but which produced no ``smoking gun'';\n       Whereas, according to the joint statement made by UNMOVIC, \n     IAEA, and Iraq on January 20, 2003, Iraq pledged to offer \n     United Nations inspectors more help in their search for \n     evidence of weapons of mass destruction and expressed a \n     readiness to respond to questions raised in connection with \n     the December 7, 2002 declaration;\n       Whereas Hans Blix, Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC, reported \n     to the United Nations Security Council on January 27, 2003, \n     that Iraq has been cooperating with the weapons inspectors on \n     process but has failed to demonstrate active cooperation on \n     matters of substance;\n       Whereas Dr. Blix earlier characterized the January 27, \n     2003, report to the Security Council as an interim update \n     intended to mark ``the beginning of the inspection and \n     monitoring process, not the end of it'';\n       Whereas IAEA Director General ElBaradei reported to the \n     Security Council on January 27, 2003, that his agency has \n     found no evidence that Iraq has revived its nuclear weapons \n     program;\n       Whereas Dr. ElBaradei urged the Security Council on January \n     27, 2003, to allow the inspection process to ``run its \n     natural course'' over the next few months;\n       Whereas the United Nations weapons inspectors have failed \n     to obtain evidence that would prove that Iraq is in material \n     breach of the terms of the United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1441 (2002);\n       Whereas European and Arab officials are reportedly trying \n     to persuade Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq voluntarily, and \n     senior officials in the executive branch of the United States \n     Government have said that they would welcome exile for \n     Hussein;\n       Whereas the emergence of a nuclear crisis in North Korea, \n     and the contradictory responses by the United States to the \n     situations in North Korea and Iraq, have cast doubts on the \n     consistency and propriety of the United States doctrine of \n     preemption, especially in the international community;\n       Whereas war with Iraq to enforce United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1441 (2002) should not be a unilateral \n     decision as it is likely to have international ramifications \n     on the worldwide supply of oil, including the possibility of \n     widespread economic destabilization if Middle East oil \n     supplies are interrupted;\n       Whereas key members of the United Nations Security Council, \n     including Great Britain, Germany, the Russian Federation, \n     France, and China, have expressed their belief that the \n     weapons inspectors need more time to continue their work and \n     have urged the United States not to rush to a decision to \n     invade Iraq without seeking the support of the Security \n     Council;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Resolution 1441 (2002) does \n     not authorize the use of force but instead stipulates that \n     the Security Council will convene immediately to consider any \n     failure on the part of Iraq to comply with the Resolution;\n       Whereas the President, in his September 12, 2002, address \n     to the United Nations regarding Iraq's failure to comply with \n     previous United Nations Security Council resolutions, pledged \n     to work with the Security Council for the ``necessary \n     resolutions'' and has stated repeatedly since that time that \n     he has made no decision on whether to invade Iraq;\n       Whereas no evidence has been presented to the Senate or the \n     American people to link Iraq with the September 11, 2001, \n     terrorist attacks on the United States;\n       Whereas there is growing concern that war with Iraq would \n     greatly heighten the threat of terrorist attacks on United \n     States citizens at home, including the possibility of \n     chemical, biological, or nuclear weapon attacks;\n       Whereas the terrible cost of war--in lives lost in Iraq and \n     potentially the United States, Israel, and other nations in \n     the Middle East and elsewhere, and in the massive drain on \n     America's treasure--is a cost that the United States and its \n     allies should strive to avoid if at all possible; and\n       Whereas a United States-initiated war with Iraq is likely \n     to inflame passions in the Middle East and could precipitate \n     further conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians as \n     well as a surge in regional terrorism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United Nations weapons inspectors should be given \n     sufficient time to carry out the inspections, and collect the \n     data, that are necessary for a thorough assessment of the \n     level of compliance by the Government of Iraq with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 (2002);\n       (2) the United States and other member nations of the \n     United Nations Security Council should work together to \n     exhaust all peaceful and diplomatic means for disarming Iraq \n     before launching an invasion of Iraq;\n       (3) international emissaries, including European and Arab \n     leaders, should be given adequate time to pursue strategies \n     to persuade Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq voluntarily and \n     avert war;\n       (4) before initiating any offensive military operation in \n     Iraq to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1441 (2002), the United States should seek a specific \n     authorization for the use of force from the United Nations \n     Security Council;\n       (5) the United States should re-engage in the Middle East \n     peace process in an effort to end the violence between the \n     State of Israel and the Palestinians; and\n       (6) the United States should redouble its efforts to secure \n     the United States homeland in light of the growing number of \n     intelligence assessments highlighting the vulverability of \n     the United States for further terrorist attacks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 29--DEMANDING THE RETURN OF THE USS PUEBLO TO THE \n                           UNITED STATES NAVY\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n       Whereas the USS Pueblo, which was attacked and captured by \n     the North Korean Navy on January 23, 1968, was the first \n     United States Navy ship to be hijacked on the high seas by a \n     foreign military force in over 150 years;\n       Whereas 1 member of the USS Pueblo crew, Duane Hodges, was \n     killed in the assault while the other 82 crew members were \n     held in captivity, often under inhumane conditions, for 11 \n     months;\n       Whereas the USS Pueblo, an intelligence collection \n     auxiliary vessel, was operating in international waters at \n     the time of the capture, and therefore did not violate North \n     Korean territorial waters;\n       Whereas the capture of the USS Pueblo resulted in no \n     reprisals against the Government or people of North Korea and \n     no military action at any time; and\n       Whereas the USS Pueblo, though still the property of the \n     United States Navy, has been retained by North Korea for more \n     than 30 years, was subjected to exhibition in the North \n     Korean cities of Wonsan and Hungham, and is now on display in \n     Pyongyang, the capital city of North Korea: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved,That the Senate--\n       (1) demands the return of the USS Pueblo to the United \n     States Navy; and\n       (2) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President, the Secretary of \n     Defense, and the Secretary of State.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a Senate \nResolution calling on North Korea to return the USS Pueblo to the \nUnited States Navy. The legislation I am reintroducing today is based \non a resolution I introduced last year during the 107th Congress, \nSenate Resolution 246.\n  On January 23, 1968, the USS Pueblo was unjustly attacked and \ncaptured by\n\n[[Page S1754]]\n\nthe North Korean Navy, becoming the first United States Navy ship to be \nhijacked on the high seas by a foreign military force in over 150 \nyears. At the time of its capture, the USS Pueblo was operating as an \nintelligence collection auxiliary vessel, and did not pose a threat.\n  This act of aggression resulted in the USS Pueblo's 82 crew members \nbeing held in captivity for eleven months, often in inhumane \nconditions. Another brave crew member, Duane Hodges, was killed during \nthe initial attack and several more crew members were wounded. On \nDecember 23, 1968, after nearly a year of being unjustly detained the \nsurviving USS Pueblo crew members were finally released and allowed to \nreturn home.\n  It is interesting to note that the USS Pueblo I am calling on the \nNorth Koreans to return today is in fact the third ship of the fleet to \nbe named in honor of the city and county of Pueblo, located in my home \nState of Colorado. The first ship of the fleet to be named in honor of \nPueblo was an armored cruiser which had previously been named the \nColorado. In 1916, the USS Colorado was renamed as the USS Pueblo when \na new battleship named USS Colorado was authorized. The first USS \nPueblo served until 1927. The second USS Pueblo was a city class \nfrigate which served from 1944 to 1946. She was later sold to the \nDominican Republic where she serves today.\n  The third USS Pueblo is the ship now wrongly held by the North \nKoreans. Built by the Kewaunee Shipbuilding and Engineering \nCorporation, Kewaunee, WI, the ship originally served as a general \npurpose supply vessel FP-344 for service in the U.S. Army \nTransportation Corps when she was launched on April 16, 1944. During \n1966 and 1967 the ship was converted, redesignated as the USS Pueblo \nand commissioned as an environmental research vessel, AGER-2.\n  It is important to note that even to this day the capture of the USS \nPueblo has resulted in no reprisal against North Korea, demonstrating \nremarkable restraint by the United States. Even though the USS Pueblo \nstill clearly remains the legal property of the United States Navy, the \nNorth Korean Government has kept it on display as a sort of traveling \npropaganda museum.\n  Recent events have made it clear that many unresolved issues remain \nregarding our Nation's relationship with North Korea. For example, \nNorth Korea's recent high-profile resumption of nuclear saber-rattling \npresents a serious resurgent challenge that we, our allies in Northeast \nAsia and the rest of the world community must take seriously.\n  While I certainly agree that successfully resolving this situation is \nfirst and foremost, I also believe that there are other positive \nrestorative steps that the North Koreans should take in order to help \nimprove our bilateral relationship. One such action would be to return \nthe USS Pueblo to its rightful owners, the United States Navy and the \nAmerican people they serve and protect.\n  While returning the USS Pueblo may not necessarily remove the 35 \nyear-old scars inflicted by the attack of January 23, 1968, and \nespecially those suffered by the crew of the USS Pueblo and by their \nfamilies and loved ones, it would serve as a good will gesture, a salve \nif you will, signaling hope for a brighter future between our two \nnation's peoples.\n  I stand with my colleagues back home in the Colorado State General \nAssembly in demanding the return of the USS Pueblo to the United States \nNavy.\n  I urge my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate to join me in supporting \npassage of this important resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 30--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n PRESIDENT SHOULD DESIGNATE THE WEEK BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 14, 2003, AS \n     ``NATIONAL HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WEEK''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 30\n\n       Whereas there are 105 historically black colleges and \n     universities in the United States;\n       Whereas historically black colleges and universities \n     provide the quality education so essential to full \n     participation in a complex, highly technological society;\n       Whereas historically black colleges and universities have a \n     rich heritage and have played a prominent role in American \n     history;\n       Whereas historically black colleges and universities have \n     allowed many underprivileged students to attain their full \n     potential through higher education; and\n       Whereas the achievements and goals of historically black \n     colleges and universities are deserving of national \n     recognition: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 31\n\n       Whereas the United States embarks on this new millennium as \n     the world's model of democratic ideals, economic enterprise, \n     and technological innovation and discovery;\n       Whereas our Nation's preeminence is a tribute to our great \n     2-century-old experiment in representative government that \n     nurtures those ideals, fosters economic vitality, and \n     encourages innovation and discovery;\n       Whereas representative government is dependent on the \n     exercise of the privileges and responsibilities of its \n     citizens, and that has been in decline in recent years in \n     both civic and political participation;\n       Whereas Alexis de Tocqueville, the 19th century French \n     chronicler of our Nation's political behavior, observed that \n     the people of the United States had successfully resisted \n     democratic apathy and mild despotism by using what he called \n     ``schools of freedom''--local institutions and associations \n     where citizens learn to listen and trust each other;\n       Whereas civic and political participation remains the \n     school in which citizens engage in the free, diverse, and \n     positive political dialogue that guides our Nation toward \n     common interests, consensus, and good governance;\n       Whereas it is in the public interest for our Nation's \n     leaders to foster civic discourse, education, and \n     participation in Federal, State, and local affairs;\n       Whereas the advent of revolutionary Internet technology \n     offers new mechanisms for empowering our citizens and \n     fostering greater civic engagement than at any time in our \n     peacetime history; and\n       Whereas the use of new technologies can bring people \n     together in civic forums, educate citizens on their roles and \n     responsibilities, and promote citizen participation in the \n     political process through volunteerism, voting, and the \n     elevation of voices in public discourse: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CIVIC PARTICIPATION WEEK.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 11 through September \n     17, 2003, as ``National Civic Participation Week'';\n       (2) proclaims National Civic Participation Week as a week \n     of inauguration of programs and activities that will lead to \n     greater participation in elections and the political process; \n     and\n       (3) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon interested organizations and the people of the \n     United States to promote programs and activities that take \n     full advantage of the technological resources available in \n     fostering civic participation through the dissemination of \n     information.\n\n[[Page S1755]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 32--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \n  TO THE ACTIONS THE PRESIDENT SHOULD TAKE BEFORE ANY USE OF MILITARY \n   FORCE AGAINST IRAQ WITHOUT THE BROAD SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL \n                               COMMUNITY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Byrd) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 32\n\n       Whereas more than three months have passed, and \n     circumstances have significantly changed, since Congress \n     acted in October 2002 to authorize the use of military force \n     against Iraq;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council unanimously \n     approved Security Council Resolution 1441 (2002) requiring \n     Iraq to cooperate with strict weapons inspections and give \n     United Nations weapons inspectors ``immediate, unimpeded, \n     unconditional, and unrestricted access'' to all suspected \n     sites involving such weapons;\n       Whereas United Nations weapons inspectors arrived in Iraq \n     on November 18, 2002, submitted their 60-day report to the \n     Security Council about Iraq's cooperation with weapons \n     inspections on January 27, 2003, and will report again on \n     their activities on February 14, 2003;\n       Whereas the President has not yet made a compelling case to \n     Congress, the American people, or the international community \n     that the use of armed force is the only alternative to disarm \n     Iraq; and\n       Whereas Congress and the American people are increasingly \n     concerned that the President is prepared to use armed force \n     against Iraq without broad support by the international \n     community, and without making a compelling case that Iraq \n     presents such an imminent threat to the national security of \n     the United States that unilateral action is justified: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that, before \n     the President uses military force against Iraq without the \n     broad support of the international community, the President \n     should--\n       (1) provide full support to the United Nations weapons \n     inspectors to facilitate their ongoing disarmament work; and\n       (2) obtain approval by Congress of new legislation \n     authorizing the President to use all necessary means, \n     including the use of military force, to disarm Iraq.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 33--EXPRESSING THE GRATITUDE OF THE UNITED STATES \n   SENATE FOR THE SERVICE OF ARTHUR J.

Res. 34\n\n       Whereas since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on \n     our country, first responders--the men and women who serve as \n     police officers, firefighters, and emergency services \n     personnel--and communities all across the United States have \n     found themselves on the front lines of homeland defense in \n     the war against terrorism on United States soil;\n       Whereas we recognize that the first responders and \n     communities have been forced to bear almost all of the \n     financial burden that accompanies this responsibility;\n       Whereas it is inappropriate for the first responders and \n     communities to bear that responsibility alone;\n       Whereas State and local fiscal crises have led to layoffs \n     of first responders and the closing of police and fire \n     stations all across America at a time when the homeland \n     security demands on our first responders and local \n     communities are greater than ever;\n       Whereas Congress has provided strong support for homeland \n     security through the appropriation of funds to help our first \n     responders and local communities improve homeland defense, \n     but the Senate recognizes that not all of these resources \n     have yet reached our first responders and local communities;\n       Whereas in addition to the homeland security funding that \n     Congress has already appropriated, additional homeland \n     security resources are needed by our first responders and \n     local communities;\n       Whereas the strength of this Nation's homeland defense \n     depends upon the appropriation of homeland security resources \n     in addition to the full funding of traditional first \n     responder federal programs, such as the COPS program and the \n     grant program commonly known as the FIRE Act program, which \n     have greatly benefited the American people by helping first \n     responders reduce crime and prevent and respond to fires and \n     other emergencies; and\n       Whereas we recognize that homeland defense will only be as \n     strong as the weakest link at the State and local levels and \n     that the home front will be better prepared and the United \n     States will be stronger if the first responders and our \n     communities have the resources and tools that they need to \n     bolster emergency preparedness and response efforts: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that Congress \n     should fully fund all traditional first responder programs \n     and appropriate substantial additional resources to assist \n     local communities and first responders in making the homeland \n     defense of the United States as strong as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 3--RECOGNIZING, APPLAUDING, AND SUPPORTING \n   THE EFFORTS OF THE ARMY AVIATION HERITAGE FOUNDATION, A NONPROFIT \n ORGANIZATION INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA, TO UTILIZE VETERAN \n  AVIATIORS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND FORMER ARMY AVIATION AIRCRAFT TO \n INSPIRE AMERICANS AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR NATION'S MILITARY LEGACY AND \n                HERITAGE OF SERVICE ARE NEVER FORGOTTEN\n\n  Mr. MILLER submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 3\n\n       Whereas the Army Aviation Heritage Foundation, a nonprofit \n     organization incorporated in the State of Georgia in 1997, is \n     an all volunteer organization composed of veterans, their \n     families, and civilian supporters acting in concert to \n     connect the American soldier to the American public through \n     the use of the story of Army Aviation;\n       Whereas the Army Aviation Heritage Foundation is not a part \n     of the United States Army and receives no Federal funding;\n       Whereas funds for the activities of the Army Aviation \n     Heritage Foundation come entirely from donations made by \n     private individuals and corporations;\n       Whereas Army Aviation Heritage Foundation volunteers devote \n     a significant amount of their personal time and resources to \n     present the story of our Nation's Armed Forces and the legacy \n     of its veterans to the American people through extensive and \n     elaborate living history programs presented at major public \n     venues, such as air show events, and at numerous other \n     smaller community outreach initiatives;\n       Whereas these living history programs are designed and \n     presented to honor the Armed Forces and its veterans while \n     inspiring the public that ultimately supports the Armed \n     Forces and giving the public a glimpse of military life, \n     service, and devotion;\n       Whereas the Army Aviation Heritage Foundation has devoted \n     over 150,000 volunteer hours and over $5,300,000 in donated \n     funds, aircraft, and equipment in organizing,\n\n[[Page S1756]]\n\n     developing, and conducting 35 public presentations that have \n     helped to foster patriotism and present our Nation's military \n     stories to an audience of more than 5,500,000 people; and\n       Whereas the Army Aviation Heritage Foundation is acting to \n     provide America's veterans a voice with which to tell their \n     story and the tools with which to share with the American \n     public their legacy of service and devotion: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress recognizes, applauds, and supports \n     the efforts of the Army Aviation Heritage Foundation, a \n     nonprofit organization incorporated in the State of Georgia, \n     to pursue the following four primary purposes:\n       (1) To educate the American public regarding the military \n     heritage of the United States through the story of United \n     States Army Aviation's soldiers and machines.\n       (2) To connect the American serviceman and servicewoman to \n     the American public as an active and admired member of the \n     American family.\n       (3) To inspire patriotism and motivate Americans everywhere \n     toward service to their community and country by involving \n     them in our Nation's larger military legacy.\n       (4) To preserve authentic examples of Army aviation \n     aircraft and utilize them in educational living history \n     demonstrations and presentations so that the symbols of \n     America's military legacy may always remain in our skies for \n     future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/29/senate-section/article/S1756-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n               committee on environment and public works\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 33) expressing the gratitude of the \n     United States Senate for the service of Arthur J. Rynearson, \n     Deputy Legislative Counsel of the United States Senate.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise to commend Mr. Art Rynearson, the \nDeputy Legislative Counsel of the Senate, who retires on January 31, \n2003, after serving in the Senate for more than 26 years, including \nmore than 3 years as Deputy Legislative Counsel.\n  As President pro tempore of the Senate, it is my pleasure to oversee \nthe work of the Office of the Legislative Counsel. I appreciate the \ngreat dedication and professionalism Art Rynearson has displayed in his \nrole as an attorney in the Office and in his service as Deputy \nLegislative Counsel.\n  The Office of Legislative Counsel plays a very important role in the \nlegislative process. We all rely upon the attorneys in the office to \nprovide legislative drafts to effectively carry out our legislative \npolicy. Mr. Rynearson, in his role as Deputy Legislative Counsel, has \nhelped to see that we are all served well by a professional, career, \nand nonpartisan staff.\n  In addition to his service as Deputy Legislative Counsel, Art \nRynearson served for more than 26 years as the principal drafter in the \nSenate on virtually all matters relating to international relations, \ninternational security, immigration and the State Department, and all \nmatters relating to Senate consideration of international treaties. He \nserved the Senate well in that regard, with a commanding knowledge of \ninternational law and the dedication to put in long hours in service of \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor this resolution, and I am proud \nto have known and worked with Art Rynearson. He has served his Nation \nwell for over 28 years, including 2 years with the Library of Congress. \nI wish Art and his wife, Mary Linda, the very best for the future, \nespecially time spent enjoying their retirement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor with Senator Stevens \na resolution commending Mr. Art Rynearson who is retiring as Deputy \nLegislative Counsel of the Senate on January 31, 2003. I have had the \npleasure of working with Art on many laws relating to foreign policy \nmatters.\n  I wish to join with Senator Stevens, and with all Senators, in \nexpressing our deepest gratitude to Art Rynearson for his long years of \nservice to the United States Senate. He has been part of the Office of \nLegislative Counsel for more than 26 years, including the last 4 as \nDeputy Legislative Counsel; and during that time he has provided \nvaluable assistance to me and to my staff.\n  While overseeing the Office of Legislative Counsel as President pro \ntempore, I appreciated the great dedication and professionalism Art \nRynearson displayed in carrying out his duties and responsibilities. I \nknow that his departure will leave a void that is difficult to fill as \nhe is truly a part of the institutional memory of the Senate. In \npassing this resolution, the Senate recognizes his years of commitment \nto the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I wish Art Rynearson and his wife, Mary Linda, well in \nhis retirement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Brownback and \nmyself, we welcome this opportunity to honor the outstanding career and \ncontributions of a truly dedicated and gifted member of our Senate \nfamily, the Deputy Legislative Counsel of the Senate, Art Rynearson.\n  Many of us have been very grateful to Mr. Rynearson over the years \nfor his superb assistance in preparing legislation on foreign affairs. \nHis many accomplishments in this area include drafting, editing, and \norganizing the 2003 Foreign Relations Authorization Act, the Iran-Libya \nAct, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986; the Senate \nconditions to the Protocols for the Expansion of NATO, the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, the START Treaty, and the Panama Canal Treaties.\n  Senator Brownback and I, and all the members of the Immigration \nSubcommittee, are especially grateful to Mr. Rynearson for his skillful \nwork in legislation on immigration, naturalization, and refugee \naffairs. Mr. Rynearson's thoughtful insight, and his\n\n[[Page S1758]]\n\nmastery of these issues have resulted in articulate, well-drafted, and \nfar-reaching laws that have helped countless immigrants and refugees.\n  Art Rynearson's many contributions are well-known and greatly \nappreciated by all of us who know him and admire him, and millions of \nmen and women and children who may never know his name have benefited \nfrom his dedication and commitment. As he retires after 26 years of \nheart-felt service and high ability, he has the gratitude and respect \nof all of us in the Senate, and we wish him well in his retirement.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today the Senate expresses its appreciation \nand best wishes to one of the great unsung heroes who make this \ninstitution work.\n  Art Rynearson, the Senate's Deputy Legislative Counsel, is retiring \nafter over 26 years of exemplary service to this body. Art has been a \nbackstage participant in many historic foreign policy decisions of the \nSenate, assisting the Foreign Relations Committee to draft both \nlegislation and resolutions of advice and consent to ratification of \ntreaties. His actions were rarely recognized or noticed by the public, \nbut his contributions were essential. Art's job was to ensure that our \nlegislation clearly expressed the intent of the committee and that it \nmeshed properly with existing law. He accomplished that through \nmarvelous attention to detail and a complete absence of partisanship.\n  During the past 6 years, during which I have served as either the \nchairman or ranking member of the committee, Art has borne a heavy \nburden--working on such matters as the Chemical Weapons Convention, \nNATO enlargement, and major legislation to restructure America's \nforeign policy agencies. The committee owes him a great debt.\n  It is not overstatement to say that the Senate could not function \nwithout people like Art Rynearson. Every day--and many a night--he was \nthere, unfailingly courteous and professional, ready to assist the \ncommittee's members and staff to draft and refine legislation for \nconsideration by the committee and the Senate. His knowledge of foreign \nrelations and immigration law, gained through his many years of \nservice, will not be easily replaced.\n  I know that I speak for all of my colleagues on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in saying thank you to Art Rynearson. We wish him and his \nwife, Mary, every happiness as he begins his next stage in life.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table; and that any statements relating to the resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 33) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 33\n\n       Whereas Arthur J. ``Art'' Rynearson, the Deputy Legislative \n     Counsel of the Senate, became an employee of the Senate on \n     August 25, 1976, and since that date has ably and faithfully \n     upheld the high traditions and standards of the Office of the \n     Legislative Counsel of the United States Senate for more than \n     26 years;\n       Whereas Art Rynearson has served as Deputy Legislative \n     Counsel since October 20, 1999, and demonstrated great \n     dedication, professionalism, and integrity in faithfully \n     discharging the duties and responsibilities of his position;\n       Whereas Art Rynearson for more than 26 years was the \n     primary drafter in the Senate of virtually all legislation \n     relating to international relations, international security, \n     immigration, and the State Department, and all matters \n     relating to Senate consideration of international treaties;\n       Whereas Art Rynearson will retire on January 31, 2003, \n     after more than 28 years of service with the Congress, \n     including more than 2 years with the Congressional Research \n     Service of the Library of Congress; and\n       Whereas Art Rynearson has met the legislative drafting \n     needs of the United States with unfailing professionalism, \n     skill, and dedication: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate commends Arthur J. \n     Rynearson for his more than 26 years of faithful and \n     exemplary service to the United States Senate and the Nation, \n     including 4 years as the Deputy Legislative Counsel of the \n     Senate, and expresses its deep appreciation and gratitude for \n     his long, faithful, and outstanding service.\n       Sec. 2.
