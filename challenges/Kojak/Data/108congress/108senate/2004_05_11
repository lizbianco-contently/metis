Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business for up to 1 hour. The first half of that time will \nbe under the control of the minority leader or his designee, and the \nsecond half of the time will be under the control of the majority side \nof the aisle.\n  Following this period of morning business, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 1637, the FSC/ETI JOBS bill. Under the agreement \nreached last night, today the debate until noon will be equally divided \nbetween both sides.\n  At noon, the Senate will conduct a rollcall vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the FSC/ETI JOBS legislation. If cloture is invoked, \nwe will go immediately to a vote in relation to the pending Cantwell \namendment regarding unemployment insurance.\n  Senators can, therefore, expect up to two votes beginning at 12 noon \ntoday. Following those votes, the Senate will stand in recess until \n2:15 for the weekly policy luncheons to occur.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked, the time during \nthe recess count under the provisions of rule XXII.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank all Members who have allowed us to \nproceed in this fashion. We have worked on both sides to organize today \nso we can bring the FSC/ETI bill to closure. I believe we will invoke \ncloture and we will be able to bring the bill to conclusion, hopefully, \nlater this afternoon or early this evening.\n  As I stated yesterday, there will be germane amendments, and we will \ndebate them and vote on those; thus, we anticipate additional rollcall \nvotes over the course of the day.\n  I mentioned several weeks ago, and again yesterday, that we plan to \nbegin the IDEA legislation following the completion of the FSC/ETI JOBS \nbill and, thus, we have a lot of work to do. I want to encourage people \nto consider that as we bring the FSC/ETI bill to closure.\n  I also want to mention a concern that I have with the Executive \nCalendar. Last week, we were able to confirm some of the pending \nambassadorial nominations on the calendar. But still, as you look at \nthe calendar, there are 89 additional nominations that are available \nfor Senate consideration. As we all know, some of these are \ncontroversial and, therefore, delay is not unexpected. But the vast \nmajority of these nominations, including many of the judicial \nnominations, should be cleared unanimously.\n  I want to take this opportunity to remind my Senate colleagues of our \nresponsibility--the Senate's responsibility--to consider these \nnominations and to allow them to begin their very important work for \nthe United States of America.\n  In addition to the 33 judicial nominations, there are 8 additional \nambassadorships to countries such as Sweden, Brazil, South Africa, \nNorthern Ireland, and others. So, again, I want to take this moment to \nbring all of this to the Senate's attention. My colleagues may come to \nme and ask why we are not moving. It is time to move in that direction.\n  I have heard the comments of the Democratic leadership regarding \ntheir concern with the nominations, and I know there are underway a \nnumber of consultations and discussions regarding this process. As we \nmove forward, I urge my colleagues to allow us to consider some of the \nmany noncontroversial nominations that are available so that we can \nfill these positions.\n  Mr. President, I also want to comment on last night's action by \nthanking my colleagues for their unanimous support for S. 356. This \nSenate resolution, which passed last night, condemns the abuse of Iraqi \nprisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison and urges a full and complete \ninvestigation to make sure that justice is served, and served in a \nfully transparent way.\n  The resolution also expresses the Senate's support for all Americans \nwho\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\nare serving so nobly in Iraq to bring freedom, democracy, and the rule \nof law to that country.\n  The resolution expressed the sentiment and views of the Senate in a \nclear, firm, and bipartisan manner. In particular, it made clear our \nexpectation that the Senate be kept apprised of the ongoing \ninvestigations being conducted in the Department of Defense and of the \nactions being taken to ensure that these incidents never occur again.\n  The resolution also made clear that the appropriate committees of the \nSenate will be exercising their oversight responsibilities to ensure \nthese ends. This is not just the right thing to do; this is the \nSenate's duty and our obligation to the American people--indeed, to the \nvictims, to the families, and to the Iraqi people.\n  The Senate has already acted quickly and deliberately to address the \nheinous actions perpetrated by a few at the Abu Ghraib prison. Last \nweek, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held a closed-door \nsession to hear from representatives of the intelligence community \nregarding the CIA's role. The Senate Armed Services Committee held a \nfull hearing last Friday on this matter with the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and several other senior \nDefense Department officials appeared. Indeed, today, the Armed \nServices Committee is meeting again to receive testimony from Major \nGeneral Taguba, who investigated and reported on the Abu Ghraib prison \nabuses.\n  We are also working in a bipartisan manner to address the issue of \nappropriate access to further evidence of the atrocities at Abu Ghraib. \nAnd at the leadership level on both sides of the aisle, we are working \nwith the ranking member and chairman of the Armed Services Committee to \nestablish a process whereby materials can be viewed. As well, it is \nlikely that we will afford the Secretary of Defense another opportunity \nto answer questions from Senators in the near future.\n  I have also consulted with various committee chairmen about items \nthat might be in their committee's jurisdiction as this investigation \nunfolds, so that the appropriate Senate tools are applied judicially to \nbuttress the work of the executive branch in getting to the bottom of \nthis scandal, no matter where it leads.\n  In closing, I ensure my colleagues and the American people that the \nSenate will continue to hold hearings and briefings and take other \nsteps, as necessary, to ensure that justice is served, that preventive \naction is taken, that those responsible are held accountable, and that \nall of this is done in a very fair, deliberate, and open manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5172-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first, I express my support for the \nremarks just made by the majority leader with regard to the position of \nthe Senate on a bipartisan basis regarding the tragedy involving \nprisoner abuse. I hope the limited debate that was devoted to the \nresolution last night will not be seen by anyone as minimizing our \nstrong feelings and the unanimity with which we wanted to express those \nfeelings through that resolution.\n  I appreciate the effort made by many of our colleagues who \nparticipated in the drafting of the resolution, and I am grateful for \nthe strong show of support expressed through the resolution last night.\n  We condemn these acts. We apologize to the world community for the \ninvolvement of the United States in the humiliation and the \nextraordinary violation of human rights that we have witnessed with the \nphotographs themselves. We also wanted to say again that we recognize \nthis is the exception to U.S. military deportment, not the rule, and \nthat the vast majority of military men and women have served admirably, \nserved their country and the cause, have advanced the goal, and have \ndeserved our commendation and thanks. I think it is critical that we \nkeep that in balance. I hope that as we continue to conduct oversight \nproperly, we maintain not only the interest in holding those at the \nlower ends of the military echelon accountable, but I would hope we \nwould not allow anyone to use those directly involved, whose pictures \nare shown, as the scapegoats for everything else that happened. I still \nhave yet to see the degree of accountability up and down the chain of \ncommand that I would think would go without question.\n\n  We will have a lot more to say about accountability, responsibility, \nand those in the higher echelons of Government and the military who \nthemselves ought to be asked to account for their actions and their \ndecisions. In that regard, I would hope we could continue to press for \neven more oversight as the Armed Services Committee is doing today. \nSomeone proposed a select committee, a bipartisan, bicameral select \ncommittee to allow for a more thorough investigation in a collective \nway, rather than have the scores, I guess, of subcommittees and full \ncommittees on both sides of the Congress reviewing this material.\n  Perhaps one committee, which could be formed with the exclusive \npurpose of reviewing the facts and coming to some conclusion, may be of \nvalue. I am not proposing it today. I noted that others have made this \nsuggestion, and I think it merits our consideration.\n  I know the majority leader also talked about nominations. Last week, \nwe confirmed I believe it was 19 ambassadorial nominations and a number \nof other executive appointments. We will continue to work with our \nRepublican colleagues, but as many have heard me say on countless \noccasions, this has to be reciprocal. We cannot be confirming \nnominations and dealing with the judicial appointments and all of the \nother things expected of us if the Democratic nominees continue to \nlanguish on the calendar and in the administration itself. We have over \na dozen Democratic nominees who have not yet been given even vetting, \nmuch less the actual official nomination.\n  We will continue to work with our Republican colleagues and with the \nadministration, but we have to be given the confidence that there will \nbe reciprocity and some degree of appreciation for the need to move all \nnominees, regardless of political affiliation or of position.\n  There are two other issues I wish to talk about briefly. First of \nall, I wish to thank Judge Becker, who has been involved now for many \nmonths in helping the Senate find a resolution to the complicated, \ncontroversial, and complex array of challenges we face with regard to \nasbestos.\n  After the vote on asbestos a few weeks ago, Senator Frist and I asked \nJudge Becker if he would be willing to engage in mediation to see if we \ncan move forward on a number of the outstanding questions.\n  Judge Becker worked tirelessly for the last couple of weeks and met \nwith Senator Frist and me almost on a daily basis to provide us with \nhis progress reports. We focused on claims values, projections, and the \noverall amount of the fund. Unfortunately, we were not able to move \nnearly as far as many of us would have hoped on the issue of claims \nvalues. Some movement I think was made but little on projections. \nPerhaps the greatest movement was made on the overall amount. Business \ncame up a little bit, from 114, with a $10 billion contingency, to 116, \nwith a $12 billion contingency. Labor came down from 154 to 134, with a \n$15 billion contingency.\n  I am deeply troubled by the insurance industry. The insurance \nindustry again issued a statement in the form of a letter that said \nthey will not support a legislative response to asbestos. Their \nintransigence was a major problem in bringing any kind of resolution to \nthis matter.\n\n  I am not giving up. I am pleased that Senator Frist has agreed to \nmeet again this week to ensure that our discussions and perhaps our \nnegotiations can continue as well. This is too important an issue \nsimply to say we failed. We need to keep the pressure on. We need to \nfind a way with which to resolve these three outstanding issues in \nparticular: the overall funding level, the issue of claims values and \nappropriating the necessary values to circumstances, and then certainly \nour projections, how many people will definitely be affected, and how \ncan we then come to some conclusion about the other outstanding \nquestions involving existing cases as well as what happens if the fund \nruns out and is sunset.\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\n  Finally, let me just say later on today we will have a vote in \nrelation to the FSC bill. It is a cloture vote. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport cloture today. This has been a long and unnecessarily \ncomplicated struggle. All we have wanted from the beginning was an \nopportunity to vote on a number of key amendments. We have had the vote \nnow on overtime. We have had the vote on outsourcing. We intend to have \na vote today on unemployment compensation and a number of other issues \nwe felt were very important in the overall context of the creation of \ngood jobs.\n  We are not finished. There will be other amendments offered to other \nvehicles, but, in large measure, because we held our position on \ncloture, we are now at a point where we have been able to protect our \nMembers and offer the amendments we thought were most important. We \nwill certainly work with our Republican friends to bring the debate to \na close, deal with a number of still germane amendments that have to be \naddressed on FSC before we move on to other important legislative \nmatters, including IDEA.\n  We hope to complete our work on FSC today; if not today, certainly \ntomorrow. We will then move on to other matters.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5173-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the preamble to our Constitution makes it \nclear what our responsibilities shall be and puts in order that first \nwe provide for common defense and then promote the general welfare. A \nlot has been said on the floor of the Senate about our common defense, \nwhat is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan in our war on terrorism. It \nis an issue front and center for the American people, as it should be.\n  Considering that issue alone is to ignore our obvious requirement \nunder the Constitution to also promote the general welfare. We need to \nlook beyond the defense issue to the welfare of American citizens and \nlook to specific items that concern them. This I can tell you with some \ndegree of certainty.\n  Pick any State in this Union. Allow me or anyone to visit that State \nand meet with businesses large and small, and families, and ask them \nwhat they are worried about, what do they sit and talk about, what are \nthe issues that give them caution about the future.\n  What I have found in Illinois, which is a fairly typical State, being \nrural and urban south and north and midwestern, as well as showing \nsigns of big city with our city of Chicago, when I have visited with \nthese businesses for the is that last several years--small and large \nbusinesses alike--their concern is the cost of health insurance. Over \nand over they say to me: Senator, we are glad you are out there. We are \nglad you are serving in the Senate. When are you going to start talking \nabout issues that really count for us when it comes to our business and \nits costs?\n  This year we are going to make certain that we at least raise this \nissue in debate on the Senate floor, even if we will not raise a single \nbill to be considered in the Senate to deal with this issue and grapple \nwith it.\n  This is ``Cover the Uninsured Week'' across the United States. An \nimpressive coalition of individuals and groups have come forward. \nFormer President Jimmy Carter, former President Gerald Ford, the AFL-\nCIO, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, AARP, United Way, the Catholic \nHealth Association, and the American Medical Association have all come \nforward this week and said: Do not overlook the obvious. Too many \npeople in America do not have health insurance.\n  Mr. President, 44 million people in our country, 15.2 percent of our \npopulation, were uninsured in the year 2000--that was up from 14.6 \npercent the year before--the largest single-year increase in both \nnumber and rate of uninsured people in a decade.\n  When one wants to measure the strength of the economy and whether we \nare recovering, it is not enough to say a person has a job. Clearly the \nobvious question has to be asked: Does the job pay a decent wage? Is \nthere any health insurance coverage involved in it?\n  We are finding the raw statistics of employment do not tell the whole \nstory. Keep this in mind: More than 20 million working adults lacked \nhealth insurance in the year 2002 and the number is growing. These are \nnot lazy people, stretched out on the couch watching soap operas and \neating chocolate-covered cherries. These are people getting up every \nmorning, getting the kids off to school, getting a little bit of lunch \ntogether, heading off to work, knowing full well if they start feeling \nbad, if they need to go to a doctor or a hospital, they have to pay for \nthe whole thing out of their own pocket.\n  There are 20 million Americans without health insurance. Part of the \nreason is, of course, the cost of health insurance is outpacing \ninflation and workers' earnings. So if one is earning more money, it is \nnot enough because the cost of health insurance is going up \ndramatically. Look at these charts, which show from 1996 a 14-percent \nincrease in the cost of health insurance. I think that shows what we \nare faced with. Look on this chart at wages, which linger around 2 or 3 \npercent.\n  The cost of health insurance goes up dramatically. Premiums have \noutpaced inflation by 4\\1/2\\ times. For the last 6 years, health \ninsurance premiums have increased more than wages. If we go to \nvirtually any city in America and ask why workers are on strike, why \nthey are involved in a long contract dispute, we will find the \nunderlying cause is the cost of health insurance.\n  Over and over again, I cannot tell my colleagues how many times not \nonly business owners but members of labor unions have said to me: It is \nbreaking our back. We have a dollar more an hour for the next year and \nevery darn penny of it is going to health insurance and we have less \ncoverage.\n  This is the reality of what businesses and workers face across \nAmerica, but it is not the reality of what we debate on the Senate \nfloor.\n  I have had the honor to serve in this Chamber for almost 8 years and \nin that period of time there has been no--underline no--serious \ndiscussion of this issue. In that period of time since 1996, up go the \ncosts of health insurance premiums, down goes the conversation on the \nSenate floor and in Congress about what we can do about it as a nation.\n  Since President Bush took office, the number of uninsured Americans \nhas risen by almost 4 million people from 39.8 million in the year 2000 \nto 43.6 million in 2002, almost a 10-percent increase. Look at the \naverage premiums, from $2,426 on an annual basis to $3,060 in the year \n2002; a 26-percent increase in the health insurance premiums, and \nalmost 10-percent increase in the number of people.\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Bush called for high \nquality, affordable health care for all Americans and argued we must \nwork toward a system in which all Americans have a good insurance \npolicy. Take a look at his budget. Rhetoric in a State of the Union \nAddress is almost meaningless if the President's budget does not \naddress it. Frankly, this budget does not. The President calls for \na tax credit proposal but says before we can enact it we have to offset \nit with cuts in other areas.\n\n  I will tell my colleagues how impossible that is. As our defense \nbudget goes up dramatically at historically high levels, as spending \nfor homeland security goes up in our war on terror, as the national \nincrease in costs for Social Security and Medicare goes up, the amount \nof money left over for everything else in our Government, education, \nhealth care, infrastructure, corrections, all of those things have been \nshrinking.\n  We face the largest deficit in the history of the United States of \nAmerica under this administration, which has\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\ngiven us tax cuts in time of war, virtually unprecedented in American \nhistory, and the largest deficit in the history of the United States. \nSo when the President says we will deal with health insurance with a \ntax credit proposal and we will offset it by cutting spending in \ndomestic programs, frankly, it is an empty promise.\n  I will tell my colleagues what this means: A 55-year-old in America \ntoday buying health insurance as an individual is going to pay at least \nas high as $6,000 in annual premiums. If one is in an employer-based \ngroup, one might pay closer to $1,000 out of pocket. Now the President \nand many Republicans are coming forward with health savings accounts. \nQuite frankly, this is a very suspicious proposal. When one looks at \nthe company that is behind health savings accounts, it turns out to be \na very politically well-connected company. Originally, Golden Rule, \nwhich was out of Illinois and Indiana, became United Health Care and \ncame up with health savings accounts, which frankly are not going to \nprovide the relief America needs for our serious health insurance \nproblems.\n  Then the administration has suggested something called association \nhealth plans. What that means is the health insurance for groups, small \nbusinesses, for example, would be exempt from State regulation and \ncoverage requirements. What does that mean? Right now, insurance is a \nState responsibility. My State of Illinois, the State of Alaska, and \nthe State of Iowa, all of the States, have insurance commissioners to \nmake certain the companies selling health insurance are solvent.\n  If a company is going to sell health insurance in my State, they have \nto prove they have the money to back it up when the claims are filed.\n  The State association health plans that are now being suggested would \nbe exempt from State regulation, so people will not be certain of the \nsolvency of the companies involved. So what is that worth? A State \nhealth association plan with no guarantee of solvency could be worth \nnothing, and it has been worth nothing.\n  Secondly is coverage. In my State, we have requirements; if one wants \nto sell health insurance, here are the things they must cover. Let me \ngive one example because it is a provision in Illinois law I added as a \nstaff attorney many years ago. There was a time when one could sell a \nfamily health insurance policy in Illinois and exempt from coverage \nnewborn infants for 30 days after they were born--a pretty smart \nprovision from the insurance company point of view. The baby has a \nproblem at birth, it can be very expensive. They said, if that happens, \nthe family is on their own for 30 days.\n  We said, no way. If a company wants to sell health insurance in \nIllinois, they cover that baby from the moment of birth and everything \nthat might happen. We required it in law. When a person goes to these \nassociation health plans, it would exempt this coverage requirement for \nnewborn coverage, for mammograms, and for many of the things we \nconsider essential for real health insurance coverage.\n\n  We asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson \nwhat about the state of health care in America? Do you not think we \nneed to be concerned about uninsured people? Should we not move toward \nuniversal coverage? Here is what he said on February 3 of this year:\n\n       Even if you don't have health insurance in America, you get \n     taken care of. That could be defined as universal health \n     care.\n\n  What does he mean? He means if someone sick shows up in an emergency \nroom, they will not turn that person away. That is Secretary Thompson's \nview of universal health care and that is why this conversation is \ngoing nowhere in Washington, DC. This administration has no meaningful \nproposal to deal with the health insurance crisis in America. This \nCongress is afraid to act and has refused to address it. We have \nrefused to address the No. 1 business and labor issue in America today.\n  In 2003, nearly half of uninsured adults postponed seeking medical \ncare and over a third say they needed it but did not get it in the \nprevious year. More than a third of the uninsured had a serious problem \npaying medical bills in the last year. The list goes on.\n  Uninsured people still have to do their best to pay, though. If a \nperson shows up at a hospital and they are provided care, even if they \nhave a low-paying job, they may find themselves being hounded for the \npayment to the hospital. That is not unusual.\n  I might add as a postscript, many of my colleagues in the House are \nraising questions as to why the uninsured person is charged \ndramatically more at a hospital than someone who is under an HMO or \nunder a Medicaid plan. They are charged 600 to 700 percent above the \ncharge of the low plans. I am speaking about people who have no money \nto pay.\n  Bertha Hardiman, who is a 60-year-old laundry worker in Chicago, \nmakes $17,000 a year. She was sued by a Chicago hospital because of a \n$6,200 hospital bill. A law enforcement official showed up at her door \nwith a summons. She worked out a payment plan. This 60-year-old lady is \npaying $200 a month, 15 percent of her monthly take-home pay.\n  A hospital in Champaign-Urbana in my State filed a collections \nlawsuit against Kara Atteberry, a 26-year-old single mother of \ntwo. They said she failed to pay $1,678 after treatment for a \nmiscarriage. She is a waitress at a pizzeria. She was unable to get off \nwork to go to the court hearing and a arrest warrant was issued. She \nturned herself in to the authorities because she didn't want to be \nfacing the embarrassment of being arrested in front of her daughters. \nThat is what happens in America when you are working at a low-wage job \nand you have a hospital bill of even $1,600 that you can't pay.\n\n  There is a better way. We have to first look at the obvious. \nBusinesses are overwhelmingly looking for ways to save money on health \ncare. This shows the number of businesses that have been shopping for \nnew plans, the number of businesses that have changed health care \nplans, that are in a constant search to find affordable health \ninsurance because, frankly, it is outstripping their ability to be \nprofitable and to pay their workers.\n  How big an obstacle are health insurance costs in hiring? Take a look \nat this chart. When, you ask, is it not an obstacle for businesses in \nAmerica? An obstacle? Look at the numbers: 71 percent of the businesses \nin 2000 said health insurance costs were an obstacle to hiring \nemployees, 64 percent in the next year, 71 percent in the year 2002, \nand 78 percent in the year 2003.\n  I am glad my colleague Senator Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas \nhas come to the floor because she and I believe this conversation \nshould not stop with a lot of complaints.\n  We ought to be moving forward in a constructive way. What we suggest \nis very basic. We think American businesses and workers should be \nentitled to the same health insurance opportunity to which Senators and \nCongressmen and Federal workers are entitled.\n  The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is an amazing \nopportunity. We have the best health insurance in the world. Is it our \nown creation? No. We shop in the marketplace. Each year we have an open \nenrollment period for every Federal worker, to pick the best health \ninsurance plan for their family. My choice in Illinois is seven to nine \nplans each year from which to pick, for my wife and myself. How much do \nwe want to pay? What kind of coverage do we want? We go shopping as \npeople shop for a car.\n  What we are suggesting is creating a pool of health insurance \ncoverage for small businesses and groups around America, very similar \nto the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. It would basically \ngive these small businesses an opportunity to be part of a purchasing \npool that is very large, to shop with individual private insurance \ncompanies, and to get the benefits of lower costs. We think this is a \nfair way to approach it. Senator Lincoln will give more detail on that \nas she addresses the Senate this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. On my time, I ask a question of the Senator. I ask the \nSenator to comment through the Chair.\n  A lot of people think that doctors are getting fat in our modern \nsociety. The fact is, in Nevada--I am sure it is the same in Illinois \nand Arkansas--doctors are having a difficult time with the managed care \nprograms and the mass numbers of uninsured.\n\n[[Page S5175]]\n\n  So I ask, does my friend agree that we in this Congress are doing \nthings not to help the physician himself? For example, we come to this \nfloor often and talk about medical malpractice reform, setting caps. \nHalf the doctors you talk to recognize that is not going to help them. \nBut a program the Senator from Illinois has advocated, and I have \njoined with him, giving an incentive taxwise, a tax credit to a doctor \nfor insurance premiums, they would love that because it would give them \nimmediate help.\n  The point I am making is we have a health care crisis in this country \nand the physicians are part of it. They are not doing as well as I \npersonally would like. Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. In response to his question, let me \ntell you if I am sick or a member of my family is sick, and I look up \nfrom that gurney, I want to see the best and brightest physicians in \nAmerica looking down at me, and I want them to feel they are being \nrewarded for many years of study and hard work. They are facing \nfrustration today because HMOs are taking away their power to make \nmedical decisions.\n  Second, I believe there are costs of practice, which include \nmalpractice premiums. In my State, they are terrible. The increases in \nsome areas are unbearable and physicians are retiring from practice. I \ndo not believe putting a cap on the monetary recovery of innocent \nvictims of malpractice is the answer.\n  As the Senator from Nevada has alluded, I think the way to approach \nthis is to make sure we help these physicians pay for the malpractice \npremiums with a tax credit. Let us give them a helping hand. Let us \nrecognize we need to do something about it. I think it is incumbent \nupon us in the Senate, with a leader who is a medical doctor, Senator \nFrist, to come together on a bipartisan basis. We can do this. We can \nhave good, affordable health care in America. We can start expanding \ninsurance instead of reducing it. We are not going to have a jobless \neconomic recovery and we are not going to have an economic recovery \nwhere people don't have health insurance, and have this country believe \nwe are moving in the right direction.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Illinois and \nNevada for being here to talk about an issue critical to our country. I \nrise to speak about the same issue, the growing crisis of the uninsured \nhere in our great country. I have devoted a great deal of time and \nenergy during my career in public service to develop solutions to our \nhealth care crisis. I believe it is critical, as Senator Durbin has \nmentioned, that we begin by dealing with this problem of the uninsured \nand doing it now.\n  This is an issue on which we can come together and work through our \ndifferences and produce a product that actually is not only going to \nprovide a better quality of life for all Americans, but it is also \ngoing to be an enormous step in dealing with the economics and the \nbudgetary concerns that we have in our country today.\n  One of our No. 1 employers in most of our communities in rural \nAmerica are our health care providers. It is not just that the health \ncare providers provide us with the quality of life and the medical care \nwe need, but they are also a huge part of the economy in this country, \nif we can begin to work toward balancing that out and making sure we \ncan predict what people's needs are going to be and where that payment \nis going to exist.\n  The fact is, the number of uninsured in our country is alarming and \nit must become more of a national priority. One of the ways we have \nnoticed it tremendously in our State of Arkansas is the number of \nuninsured who serve in our Guard and Reserves. We have found they are \nuncovered until they are activated. It creates a huge national crisis \nin many instances because we can't call these individuals up until they \nmeet military health specifications. Most of them are employed by small \nbusinesses, so they are not getting the health care they need.\n  The consequences of not addressing this problem are enormous, in \nterms of our Nation's physical and economic well-being. Right now, as \nmany as 44 million Americans are uninsured. The vast majority, over 80 \npercent of the uninsured persons under the age of 65, are part of \nfamilies where at least one family member is working. Many times, these \nindividuals' jobs do not provide insurance or the coverage offered is \ntoo costly, given their limited incomes. Buying insurance on the \nindividual market is unthinkable for many because the costs can be even \nhigher in that marketplace.\n  In my home State of Arkansas and in other rural States, the health \ncare crisis has its own special character. In Arkansas, over 400,000 \nlack health insurance. Given the scope of this problem in Arkansas and \nnationwide, we need to develop innovative solutions to ensure people \nget the coverage they need.\n  Why is access to health insurance so critical? Many believe even if \npeople don't have access to insurance, that they still have their \nhealth care needs taken care of. I have no earthly idea where they come \nup with this misconception.\n  The truth is, without health insurance many Americans find themselves \nfaced with a barrier to health care. Uninsured families have less \naccess to important screenings, the state-of-the-art technology that we \nhave so meticulously developed, and prescription drugs. Uninsured \nadults have a 25-percent greater mortality risk than adults with health \ncare coverage. An estimated 18,000 deaths among people younger than 65 \nare attributed to the lack of health insurance coverage every year.\n  Uninsured adults with chronic conditions such as diabetes, \ncardiovascular disease, HIV infection, and mental illness have less \naccess to preventive care and have worse clinical outcomes than insured \npatients. Uninsured adults negatively affect our health care providers \nand local economies, too.\n  Senator Reid from Nevada brought up the issue of our health care \nproviders who are trying desperately to provide needed medical care. A \ncommunity's high rate of uninsurance can adversely affect the overall \nhealth status of the community, the financial stability of its health \ncare institutions and its providers, and access to emergency \ndepartments and trauma centers. I can assure you hospitals in Arkansas \nwill tell you how much uncompensated care jeopardizes the access to \nhealth care for the communities they serve.\n  The facts make it clear. People without health insurance don't have \ntheir health care needs taken care of. Those who lack health insurance \ndon't get access to timely and appropriate health care. For Americans \nwithout health insurance, children and adults suffer worse health and \ndie sooner than those who have health insurance.\n  It is clear the uninsured who have inadequate health care options \ntend to fend for themselves in the marketplace and with health care \nproviders. Working families need help with this problem and they need \nit today. The lack of insurance also creates tremendous financial \nobstacles for working families. If an uninsured family member has \nserious health problems such as cancer or a heart attack, the bills can \ndestroy the financial foundation of that entire family. Uninsured \nfamilies are more likely to pay a higher percentage of their income for \nmedical care, and often will have to borrow money from family members \nto cover medical expenses. The reality is debt from medical expenses \noften drives the uninsured into bankruptcy. In my home State of \nArkansas, the No. 1 cause of bankruptcy is high medical bills.\n  Recently, I, along with Senator Durbin, Senator Carper, and Senator \nReid, introduced legislation in the Senate to help more Americans get \naccess to health insurance coverage through their employers. We know \nthat is the most logical place for them to access it.\n  Small businesses are the No. 1 source for jobs in Arkansas. What \nbetter way to help our economy than to help these small businesses \noffer affordable health care options. More than half of workers in \nfirms under 100 people make less than $25,000 a year--$25,000 a year, \nand they don't even get the child tax credit when we don't make it \nrefundable. Can't we at least do something about providing them some \nhealth care? A\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\nhigh proportion of businesses with low-wage workers are much less \nlikely to offer insurance.\n  Our bill, The Small Employers Health Benefits Program Act, will \nprovide the self-employed and the small businesses with a variety of \nprivate insurance plans. This approach would give these employers \naccess to a larger purchasing pool and negotiated rates for health \ninsurance. They would get more choice at lower costs--exactly what we \nas Federal employees get. The purchasing pool will be similar in the \nstructure to the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program to which all \nGovernment employees across this great country have access.\n  This is a far cry from the associated health plans some folks here in \nWashington talk about. These other plans--AHPs--allow companies to \ncherry-pick only the healthiest workers, leaving a pool of the sickest \nand neediest without coverage. That is not a way to attack this \nproblem. It is only going to drive up costs in the long run.\n  Our plan would provide more comprehensive coverage to a far greater \nnumber of workers. We have seen its success in what it provides to us \nand to our workers in the Federal Employees plan, not to mention all of \nthe others who work in Federal Government across this land, from rural \nareas to urban areas.\n  We have seen the increase in our ability to offer them choice and \nbetter cost. If we can make health insurance more affordable for all of \nthese workers through their employers--all of these small-business \nworkers--we would not necessarily solve the problem of the uninsured, \nbut we would certainly make an enormous dent in it.\n  Our plan would go a long way toward making health care more \naccessible for millions of workers and their families. After all, more \nthan half of the private sector workers in the United States are \nemployed by small businesses, and many of these businesses struggle \nwith the cost of providing quality health coverage. That would go a \nlong way toward helping to ease some of the anxiety and concerns people \nin this country are feeling. In my home State, 76 percent of businesses \nhave fewer than 50 employees, so Arkansans would benefit greatly from \nthis program.\n  I have heard from many of our small-business owners in Arkansas who \nhave been forced to drop or reduce their employees' health coverage \nbecause of the high cost. But it is not just small businesses. Health \ncare and health care costs in this country are the first item of \nbusiness for anyone who comes into our offices to talk to us about \ntheir needs and concerns.\n  These small-business employers want to provide their employees with \nthe best coverage possible because they recognize how valuable health \ninsurance is as a tool for boosting recruitment, retention, and \nemployee morale, not to mention their production. They are so much more \nproductive when they have healthy people in their workforce.\n  Clearly, health insurance can play a vital role in the overall \nsuccess of a small business. Our plan would help our small-business \nowners provide employees with health coverage at a much lower cost--a \nwin-win situation for everyone.\n  With solutions such as this, health insurance plans for small \nbusinesses, we can ensure health coverage is a fundamental component of \nevery American worker's economic security.\n  We must make the growing number of uninsured in our country a \npriority. It must be a priority we all embrace in the Senate. It is \nclear working families are not getting the health care they need. Let \nus come together and do something good for the hard-working folks in \nthis country who can't afford health insurance today.\n  For those who can't get access to the most basic of preventive \nmedicine, Congress needs to address this issue. The high cost of health \ncare in the United States is giving other developed countries an \nadvantage in keeping and attracting jobs.\n  For each car they build, DaimlerChrysler AG pays about $1,300 in \nemployee health care costs. When they make a car in Canada, they pay \nhardly anything. That is why the Big Three automakers actually lobbied \nthe Canadian Government to maintain their national health care system.\n  At a time when jobs are leaving our country, at a time when health \ncare insurance premiums are rising by leaps and bounds and working \nfamilies are feeling insecure about their jobs and health care \ncoverage, Congress must do something, and we can do it now.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when we finish with morning business, we \nwill have about 15 minutes remaining to speak on the Cantwell \namendment. All Senators who wish to speak on the Cantwell amendment \nshould get over here at about 10 after 11. Time will be equally \ndivided. That is the only opportunity to speak on the Cantwell \namendment today prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 30 minutes of morning \nbusiness, and the time of the minority has expired.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will claim such portion of that time as \nI may consume up to the 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5176-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5176-S5179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, a recent poll within the last couple of \ndays had a fact I found truly extraordinary which I want to talk about. \nIt says a very large percentage--maybe even a majority--of the people \nof America believe we are still in a recession. I find that \nextraordinary because the evidence in every area is highly to the \ncontrary. The economy, if you will, is firing on all cylinders. Let me \nrepeat some of the statistics I have given here before.\n  In the first quarter of this year, the economy grew at a 4.2 percent \nannual rate. Added to the growth in the 2 previous quarters, this means \nit has grown over 5 percent in the last 3 quarters, which is the best \nperformance in 20 years.\n  Some say, Where are the jobs? We may have gross domestic product \ngrowth, but we don't have any jobs, so we are still in a recession.\n  How can we say that in view of the facts which are overwhelming? \nWithin the last 8 months, we have increased 1.1 million jobs according \nto the payroll survey, and 1.3 million jobs according to the household \nsurvey. Every indication is the jobs are coming back, and they are \ncoming back very strongly.\n  In a recession, you have layoffs. When you have layoffs, you have \npeople who apply for unemployment compensation. Those are jobless \nclaims. The level of jobless claims is at its lowest level in 20 years. \nHow can we be in a recession when the jobless claim level is so up? How \ncan people come to this conclusion?\n  We have a constant drumbeat in the media about how terrible things \nare.\n  I have inquired why certain media figures continue to ignore the \nactual figures, the facts. I am told with a shrug by some of the \nleaders in the media, it is all about ratings. They get better ratings \non television programs if they rant about American jobs going overseas \nand about the economy being in terrible shape. If they scare people, \nfor some reason, people seem to stay tuned in and they get higher \nratings and a bigger audience.\n  We have a responsibility in this Chamber not to scare people. We have \na responsibility to tell the truth. The truth about the economy is that \nit is doing well.\n  Let me review some charts I have presented before to reemphasize the \nfacts, not to make any new argument. Apparently, the arguments made \nbefore are being ignored. So let's make it again until people \nunderstand the facts. Here is the historical perspective of economic \ngrowth. On the chart, the green line above the line represents quarters \nof activity. Naturally, there are four quarters for each year. The red \nlines below the line represent quarters when the economy shrank. By \ndefinition, a recession is when there are two successive quarters in \nred.\n  If we look back over history--and this goes back into the years of \nJimmy Carter's Presidency--we see a lot of red in this period. There \nwas a recession at the end of Jimmy Carter's Presidency and then \nanother recession in the first years of Ronald Reagan's Presidency--the \ndreaded double dip that people talk about. We go into recession, we get\n\n[[Page S5177]]\n\nsome recovery, and we are right back into recession. That was one of \nthe most difficult economic periods of our history. We survived it, we \ncame through it, and we had a period following it of tremendous \neconomic growth.\n  During this period we added to the size of the U.S. economy the \nequivalent of Germany. If we were talking companies, it would be as if \nthe United States, a corporation, acquired Germany; all of it, and all \nof its profit and economic activity. We grew enough to add the total of \nGermany to the American economy in this period.\n  We cannot repeal the business cycle. Inevitably, no matter how well \nmanagers try to manage their affairs, something will happen, things \nwill taper off, and we will have a correction. That is what recessions \nare; recessions are corrections of the excesses that preceded them. \nPlus, there can always be a recession from an external problem such as \nthe oil shock that hit in the early 1970s. September 11 is something \nthat could cause a recession and other factors. One can never \nanticipate that the upward trend will continue without a correction \nsomewhere along the way. That hit in the middle of the Presidency of \nthe first President Bush. By comparison to the earlier recession, it \nwas mild. But it was not mild for people who lost their jobs. It was \nnot mild for people who lost their homes or who had difficulties. But \notherwise, by comparison, the amount of red below the line was nowhere \nnear the amount of red that preceded it in a decade.\n  When we recovered from that recession--and the recovery began in the \nPresidency of the first President Bush--we began another period of \nprosperity. Overall, it was probably not as big as the prosperity that \npreceded it, but why quibble about small amounts. It was a period of \ngood prosperity. We heard in the 2000 election it was the greatest \neconomy in history. In fact, the red had shown up in the third quarter \nof 2000. The signal that this period of prosperity was over, that \nanother recession was on its way, was already given before the election \ntook place. The signal was correct.\n\n  After the election, we slipped into a recession that occurred in the \nlast three quarters of 2001. However, we came out of it in the fourth \nquarter of 2001, and we have been in recovery ever since.\n  It is amazing to me that polls show that Americans think we are in a \nrecession, when we are in this green period. This green demonstrates \nthat we are going to do at least as well, if not better, than we did in \nthis period--maybe even as well as we did in this period following this \nrecession. This recession, by historic comparison, has been the \nshortest and the mildest that we have ever had in America.\n  For political reasons, it is being talked up as a disaster. I have \nheard in the Senate statements that this is the worst economy in 50 \nyears. I have heard in the Senate that unemployment is the worst it has \nbeen since the days of Herbert Hoover. That is almost laughable. \nUnemployment in the Great Depression went over 25 percent. Unemployment \nin this recession and recovery topped out at 6.3.\n  Let's put that in historic perspective for a minute. Let me show what \nthe unemployment rate has been in previous recessions. Here is the \ndreaded double dip we were talking about. Unemployment hit 10.8 \npercent, still less than half of what it was in the Great Depression, \nbut it was tremendously difficult. I remember how difficult that was. \nThen it came down. We got the next recession, and unemployment peaked \nat 7.8 percent. Now, the peak of unemployment occurred during the \nrecovery, not during the recession. The shaded period on the chart is \nthe period of recession. Here it peaks as the recession ended, and here \nit peaked during the recovery. Now we came down and we had this \nrecession once again; unemployment peaked during the recovery, but it \npeaked at 6.3 percent. If you put 6.3 percent across the chart and \ncompare it to where it was in the previous recession, you say: Not bad, \nnot bad at all.\n  But we are being told, again, this is the worst economy in 50 years \nbecause, where are the jobs? Now it is coming down. It is down to 5.6 \npercent. As I say, the jobs are coming back at the rate of a million in \nthe last 8 months. So project the next 8 months, there is another \nmillion jobs. If they come back faster, they come back at the same \nlevel as they have been coming, we will have another million jobs in \nless than 8 months. I don't know what will happen, but I am pretty \nconfident this will continue to come down.\n  The question is, Why does it take so long for the unemployment rate \nto come down once the recession is over? The answer is very clear. The \nbusiness man or woman wants to be absolutely sure his or her business \nis, in fact, in recovery before he or she goes out and starts to hire. \nThey are delaying hiring permanent workers until they are sure the \nrecovery is in place. They use temporary workers. They use overtime on \ntheir existing workers until they are absolutely sure the recovery is \nin place. Then they start a permanent hiring. That has happened and the \nstatistics are there and the facts are overwhelming. We are in \nrecovery; the recovery is strong. It is robust; it has traction.\n  I can only assume it is for political reasons that people stand in \nthe Senate and say: No, no, no, we are in the worst economy in 50 \nyears. That simply is not true. It cannot be sustained.\n  As I listened to the rest of the rhetoric--and I will not repeat all \nof the statistics I have used in previous speeches because I want to \ntalk about the philosophical basis, but let me make this point. There \nare those who believe the economy is a sum-zero game. By that I mean \nthey believe that in order for one person to win, the other person must \nlose an equal amount.\n  Now, marbles is a sum-zero game. If we play marbles, and you win \nthree, that means I will lose three; and we add your plus three to my \nminus three and we get zero. But in the economy, just because Adam gets \na job, does not mean Benjamin has to lose his. In the economy, just \nbecause Charles gets rich, does not mean that Daniel had to be made \npoor. In the economy, it is possible for both to grow simultaneously. \nIn the economy, just because jobs are growing in India does not mean \nthey are shrinking in America. They can be growing both places. Indeed, \nthat is what is going on.\n  I see my colleague from Texas wants to speak, and I will be happy to \nyield the floor and give her such time as she needs. But I want to \nleave with this one point, once again: In economic analysis, understand \nthat the economy is not static. It is not an either/or. It is not a \nsum-zero game, a plus and a minus. The economy is constantly fluid. \nPeople are moving up and down the income ladder all the time.\n  We hear statistics about all the people at the bottom and how rich \nthe people are at the top. If I may, in my own case, in my lifetime, I \nhave been at the bottom and I have been at the top and I have gone back \nto the bottom and struggled back to the top. Statistically, there is no \nway to reflect that fact. Statistically, they look how rich the people \nat the top are getting, and look how poor the people at the bottom are, \nas if they are going to stay there all their lives.\n  This economy is strong. This recovery is real. No amount of political \nrhetoric to the contrary can change those facts.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, but I plan to address \nthis overall question of the fact that the economy is not a sum-zero \ngame at some length in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I will yield 7\\1/2\\ minutes \nto the Senator from Mississippi. Before I do that, though, I do want to \nthank the Senator from Utah, the distinguished chairman of the Joint \nEconomic Committee. He has been looking at the economy every month and \nreally looking at that progress. I think you can see from his remarks \nthat the trend is up on all fronts. All of us knew when the recovery \nwas coming, it would not be a true recovery unless it had jobs with it. \nNow we are seeing the jobs coming online following the outstanding \nperformance of the stock market, and now consumer confidence is up.\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Utah was on this trend for a \nlong time before others were focusing on it. We certainly appreciate \nhis leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Texas in thanking \nthe Senator from Utah for the leadership and information he has been \nproviding about what is happening with the economy, and helping us to \nunderstand all the data. As chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, \nhe has been the most aggressive chairman I have seen in recent years. \nHe is doing a fantastic job.\n  I would describe this economic recovery we are going through now as \nthe ``just say it ain't so recovery.'' When I listen to many of the \nspeeches around Washington--and even out across the country in some \nareas--I sometimes get the feeling some people think that if you just \nkeep saying the economy is not good, maybe it won't be. Only in \nWashington do you have that sort of perverse thinking, that too much \ngood news about the economy is either not true or it is unhelpful.\n  Many people try to look at the stock market to assess whether the \neconomy is doing well. Well, in the long term this may be true, but at \nsome points in time, I think it is a reverse indicator of what is going \non in the economy. Sometimes, bad news in the stock market is really \ngood news. We saw that just yesterday. Because the economy is growing, \nbecause jobs are being created, because orders are going up, because \nmanufacturing is going up, the stock market said: Wait a minute now. \nMaybe the economy is beginning to get a little too hot, and maybe the \nFederal Reserve System is going to have to raise the historically low \ninterest rates a little bit. Oh, this must be bad news, so let's sell \nnow.\n  So when the stock market reacts like that, you can bet good things \nare happening in the economy. The list of good economic news is very \nlong and is growing.\n  I think a lot of credit should go to the Federal Reserve Chairman, \nAlan Greenspan. He has been careful in his language. Low interest rates \nhave been fantastic for automobile sales and housing starts. The \nAmerican dream is now available to more Americans than at any time in \nthe history of this country. Americans have access to a variety of \nchoices in homes. More and more people are owning their own home. Of \ncourse, a lot of the credit for this should go to the availability of \nquality housing, a good area of the economy. Home building is done by a \nlot of really good people who are very capable. But you have to \nacknowledge that low interest rates have really helped the housing \nsector.\n  I think credit should also go to the President for his leadership, \nand to the Congress. The President knew when he was sworn in that \nJanuary in 2001, that we were already in a recession. We were already \nin one, it did not start then. The President came to the Congress and \nsaid: We have to do some things to encourage the economy to grow. One \nof the best ways to do that is to carefully cut taxes. We needed tax \ncuts that put money in the pockets of working Americans, and incentives \nfor business and industry to create jobs. The Congress heard the \nPresident and passed tax cut legislation. We did it in 2001, 2002, and \n2003.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are getting the benefit--the tremendous \nbenefit--of those tax cuts because they boosted the economy when we \nneeded it most. Just look at the numbers. If you have doubts about what \nis happening in the economy, look at the numbers published by the \nexperts, not as cited by a Member of Congress.\n  For instance, with respect to jobs, the administration announced on \nMay 7 that 288,000 net new jobs were created in April; and 308,000 were \ncreated the month before--over a half million jobs in 2 months. Since \nlast August, an estimated 1.1 million jobs have been created. I think \nit is probably more like 1.3 million jobs when you take into account \nthe Household Survey. But either way, that is a significant increase.\n\n  The national unemployment rate has edged down to 5.6 percent. I \nremember years ago, when I first came to Washington--I admit that was a \nlong time ago, 30 or so years ago--6-percent unemployment was \nconsidered ``full employment.'' Well, my attitude is, any unemployment \nis unacceptably high. But it is now down to 5.6 percent, falling .7 \npercentage points, from a peak of 6.3 percent in June of 2003. I \nbelieve it is going to continue to go in that direction, partly because \nmanufacturing employment increased 21,000 jobs in April. The February \nand March job numbers were also corrected upward. So, manufacturing \nemployment has risen for 3 consecutive months.\n  One of the most interesting statistics I have come across is that we \nhave more Americans employed now than at any time in history. More \nAmericans are working today than at any time in history. Is it enough? \nNo. We want more, and we want better paying jobs with greater \nopportunities. But still, you have to say, the fact that more Americans \nare working than ever before is a very impressive statistic.\n  Weekly unemployment claims have fallen to their lowest level since \nthe year 2000. The economy grew at a strong annual pace of 4.2 percent \nduring the first quarter of 2004. I think, when the assessment is done, \nit will be adjusted upward to 4.5 percent. That is very strong growth. \nMost of the countries of the world would be delighted to have even half \nof that kind of growth.\n  Household spending continues to be strong. Retail sales are up. \nConsumer confidence is at the highest level in 3 months, and rising. In \nMarch, new housing construction surged to levels near those of December \n2003, when we had the highest levels in almost 20 years. American \ncompanies are, across the board, reporting historic levels of growth. \nProductivity levels are up.\n  So the administration's policies have been working, and we are making \ngreat progress. Every economic statistic now is moving in a positive \ndirection. Now, we also need to pay attention to making sure inflation \ndoes not creep in, while keeping interest rates as low as possible.\n  The downturn in the economy, our response to 9/11, the war in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, and additional expenditures for homeland security \nhave contributed to deficits, but even that projection has fallen. Last \nyear, we were told that the current fiscal year deficit would be more \nthan $500 billion. Now it looks like it will be down to $417 billion. I \nthink it may end up below that because the economy is growing. This is \ngood news, but we have to continue to address the budget deficit \nproblem. I think we are going to have to make some tough choices in the \nnext couple of years to get the deficit back down to where it can be \neliminated. I think deficits do matter. They will affect interest rates \nover a period of years if we ignore them.\n\n  One other thing. You might say, well, all right, that is good, but \nwhat have you done for me lately? What are you going to do to add to \nthe growth we are trying to achieve? The Senate is doing it today. \nAfter fits and starts, four different attempts, we are going to get an \ninternational tax bill today. Hallelujah, a bill; an important bill, \nfinally, after 3 years of ignoring the problem of increasing European \ntariffs on American exports.\n  Mr. President, this bill will create jobs and address the problem of \nthe WTO ruling. It includes incentives for manufacturing jobs and \nmanufacturing tax credits, and incentives to grow the energy sector of \nthe economy. This is a jobs growth bill. I am glad we are going to get \nit done. I commend all of those Senators who were involved, including \nFinance Committee Chairman Grassley and his ranking member, Senator \nBaucus from Montana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me pick up where the Senator from \nMississippi left off. What he has been saying about the economy and the \nfigures out there is certainly accurate. The gloom and doom story we \nhave heard over the last 6 months has all of a sudden gone quiet. The \nreason for that is the very reason the Senator from Mississippi spoke \nof: the tax incentives we put into place, the investments that are \nbeginning to work, and unprecedented levels of hiring and job creation \nare underway.\n  There is something I come to speak about that is of growing concern \nto me, and I think to thousands of American consumers, if not millions, \nand the impact it could have on a growing economy, and that is energy \nand the cost of energy.\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\n  Yesterday, I came to the floor to speak on that issue. The senior \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, came later to say I was unnecessarily, \nrighteously indignant about the Energy bill. You are darn right I am \nrighteous and sometimes indignant when the American consumer is paying \n$2 per gallon at the pump--and some more than that--and they should not \nhave to be. But they are, and the reason is because the Senate has not \nacted. No, passing the Energy bill tomorrow is not going to bring the \nprice of gas down at the pump. But if you are in a hole and it is \ngetting deeper and you are still digging, you ought to stop digging. \nBut we have not stopped digging. We have not put policy in place that \nwould begin to fill in the hole that will get us into production and \nthat won't be a major risk to this economy in pulling this growth down \nbecause the American consumer is going to have to rejuxtapose some of \ntheir budgets. If they are paying $400 or $500 a year more for gas at \nthe pump, let alone the cost of electricity and home heating fuel, they \nare going to be spending less in the market, and that is just the \nconsumer.\n\n  I get righteously indignant when the farmer in Idaho--or in Nevada \nfor that matter--goes to the bank and gives his budget or her budget \nfor the year, and they have not factored in a 30- or 40-percent cost of \nenergy because diesel fuel went through the roof. The bill--if we pass \nit tomorrow--won't make a difference. The bill will encourage \nproduction of domestic oil. It will encourage the development of more \nnatural gas. It will encourage and incentivize the building of \nnecessary infrastructure, such as the Alaskan natural gas pipeline. It \nwill encourage the use of renewable fuels such as ethanol. It will \nencourage more renewable energy. It will strengthen the future of the \nnuclear energy option. It will promote clean coal technology. It will \npromote hydrogen as a new technology for surface transportation. It \nwill promote energy efficiency. It will increase the R on a variety \nof technologies. It will establish mandatory reliable rules for our \nelectricity grid. It will promote investment and expansion of \nelectricity.\n  No, it is going to take a while for this country to get back into \nproduction. But we have not placed the tools in the tool box to allow \nus to get back into production. So we have become increasingly reliant \non foreign sources for our energy. On March 22 of this year, you were \npaying $1.74 at the pump. On April 4, you were paying $1.78. In May, \nyou paid $1.84, and now you are paying $1.94--in some instances nearly \n$2, and in other States more than $2.\n  Some are suggesting that we ought to quit filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, that we ought to cut that off. That would not make a \ndifference in the price of oil at this moment because we have lost the \ncapacity to produce. We have to reinvest if we are going to gain that \ncapacity.\n  Yes, the Saudis are being a bit duplicitous. They said here is our \nbaseline and what we want, and we only need to make $28 on our barrel \nto fund our country's needs. They are making well over $30 today. \nFinally, just yesterday, the Saudi oil minister said the OPEC producers \nought to increase the official output ceiling. Well, that statement \nalone knocked the price of crude oil off $1 and, slowly but surely, \nthat will be felt back at the pumps again. What that echoes is that we \nare not seeing the price of energy improve in our country or \ndetermining the future of energy. The Saudi oil minister, by his \nstatement alone, is making that decision and fixing the price, or \nimpacting the price at the pump.\n  Why do we need a national energy policy? Here is another reason. From \n1981 to 2003, we lost a huge chunk of our oil refining capacity. In \n1981, we had 324 refineries. Today we have 149 refineries, and they are \noperating at between 92 percent to 94 percent capacity. The Clean Air \nAct, the cost of retrofitting, the regulations, and the ability to \nfinance simply took us out of the market and brought down those \nrefineries.\n  My time is up. The reality is this Senate ought to vote on a national \nenergy bill, and it ought to vote now so we quit digging the hole \ndeeper. Put the tools in the tool box and get this country back into \nproduction. And you are darn right I am righteous about it because I \ndon't think our consumers ought to have to pay the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5179-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1637, which the clerk will report.\n  The journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1657) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     to comply with the World Trade Organization findings on the \n     FSC/ETI benefit in a manner that preserves jobs and \n     production activities in the United States, to reform and \n     simplify the international taxation rules of the United \n     States, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Cantwell/Voinovich Amendment No. 3114, to extend the \n     Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12 \np.m. shall be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I assume each side would approximately have \n25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 26.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will allocate that time with 10 minutes \nto the manager of the bill. There will be 5 minutes for Senator \nCantwell, 5 minutes for Senator Voinovich, and 5 minutes to Senator \nSarbanes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to briefly talk about the \nunderlying bill and the vote we are going to have on cloture, but \nmostly to discuss the Cantwell amendment related to the temporary \nextension of unemployment benefits.\n  Mr. President, we had a vote on a similar amendment earlier this \nyear, but the amendment before us today was redrafted to reflect \nchanges in high unemployment states. First I want to talk about whether \nwe should extend unemployment benefits--a temporary extension of the \nFederal program--based on the current unemployment situation. Then I \nwant to talk about some of the details of Senator Cantwell's amendment \nand the changes that are in her amendment.\n  The employment picture in this country is looking up by all measures. \nIn the past, employment was looking up according to the household \nsurvey, which is the survey that measures employment, including those \nwho are self-employed, people who contract with the Government, and \nthose on payrolls.\n  But, there are two surveys of employment. The payroll survey does not \ninclude people who are self-employed. It does not include small \ncontractors who contract with the Government, and there are a lot of \nthose people today. So the household survey is a more accurate survey \nof overall employment in this country.\n  In the past, the household survey and the payroll survey have \nparalleled each other. There really has not been a difference, so \npeople mainly paid attention to one survey, the payroll survey.\n  In the past couple of years, we had a recession that was followed by \na recovery. It has been called a jobless recovery. But, recessions \nalways have a peak of jobless claims during periods of higher \nunemployment after recessions.\n  This is a chart of the last several recessions, and we can see the \ngray areas are the recessions. These dark lines are a measure of the \nunemployment rate. We can see after the recessions, either right at the \nend of the recessions or just after the recessions, we can see the peak \nin unemployment. This indicates there is always a lag in people being \nhired after recessions have ended. As the economy starts growing, \npeople are still a bit unsettled in their businesses--Should we rehire \npeople?--and so that peak of unemployment lags after recessions.\n  We have passed that peak. We had the recession. The recession \noccurred at the end of the year 2000 and going into the year 2001. We \nhad this recession followed by a slow recovery. And then we had \nSeptember 11 hit, which just decimated the economy in many areas, \nespecially the tourist economy,\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\nas in my home State of Nevada. It was almost a double dip of a \nrecession. The first dip starting at the end of 2000 and the second dip \nafter September 11, 2001. So we did some things in the Senate to try to \novercome that situation. Working with the President, we passed two \ndifferent tax bills. Those tax bills have had a positive effect on the \neconomy. The economy is recovering. It is still in a growth phase, and \nit is now moving into the hiring phase of the recovery. As you can tell \nfrom recent job numbers people are starting to say: You know what, we \nreally do feel good about what is going on. And they are hiring \nadditional employees.\n  One of the criticisms has been in the decline of manufacturing jobs. \nIn the past these jobs were declining, and we were losing manufacturing \njobs in the United States.\n  This chart shows manufacturing activity. We can see it down in 1991, \nit is coming up in 2000, and then, going into 2001, it takes a \nnosedive. Then in 2001, it came back up a little bit and took another \nnosedive. We can see in the year 2003 manufacturing jobs have increased \nby a very nice rate. So the manufacturing activity in the United States \nis coming back. That is a good sign, and we all welcome that.\n  The Cantwell amendment would extend temporary unemployment benefits \nthrough November, but this is not just a clean extension. The amendment \nalso changes the ``high unemployment'' definition to make more States \nqualify for additional unemployment benefits. In other words, if her \noriginal amendment that we voted on a couple of months ago was enacted \ntoday, the only State that would qualify as a high unemployment State \nwould be Alaska.\n  She redrafted her amendment to where it eliminates what is called a \nlook-back provision, and that look-back provision is what helps \ndetermine whether States are high unemployment States. It compares \ntheir current unemployment rate to the rates in the previous 2 years.\n  The amazing thing about that look-back provision is that states with \nrelatively low unemployment could qualify as a high unemployment state \nunder this amendment. According to preliminary analyses of the Cantwell \namendment the State of Idaho qualified as a high unemployment state \nwith about a 4.5-percent unemployment rate. That is very low. My State \nis 4.4 percent, and it is hard to find employees. When the unemployment \nrate gets that low, it is hard to find employees. Under the Cantwell \namendment, the State of Idaho could potentially qualify as a high \nunemployment State.\n\n  Last Friday, the statistics were revealed for last month, the month \nof April. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.6 percent, and 288,000 \njobs, according to the payroll survey, were created. In March, 335,000 \njobs were created. Just since the beginning of 2004, almost 900,000 \njobs, according to the payroll survey--the one the other side has been \ntalking about--almost 900,000 jobs have been added to the payrolls in \nthe United States. It is the eighth consecutive month of job gains, \naccording to the payroll survey. In that 8-month period, we have had \n1.1 million jobs created.\n  The other thing we have to look at are jobless claims, in other words \nhow many people actually applying for unemployment compensation. The \ninitial jobless claims declined by 25,000 last week, and that was the \nlowest level since before the 2000 Presidential election.\n  Also, something that has been talked about on this floor is the \nnumber of long-term unemployed, people who have been on the \nunemployment rolls for a long time or have exhausted their benefits. \nThat number dropped by 200,000. Not only are the unemployment numbers \nimproving, but so is productivity.\n  I talked before about payroll versus household. I want to emphasize \nthat because the payroll survey is now showing jobs being created.\n  By the way, this chart shows the 1.1 million jobs by month, and this \nis the payroll survey. Comparing the payroll with the household survey, \nin the past we can see how these two surveys parallel each other. But \nin the years 2000, 2001 and beyond--this is the period we were in the \nlast couple of years--these actually diverge because there were more \njobs added to the household survey than the payroll survey. The payroll \nsurvey is now starting to catch up.\n  Why would this occur? Why would the household survey, which measures \nself-employed people, be different than the payroll survey? The \ndifference comes about because our economy is changing. During times of \nrecession--and this is not unusual for people who cannot find jobs--\nthey start their own companies. They become entrepreneurs, and \nsometimes it ends up being the best thing that ever happened to them \nbecause they start their own company and end up being more successful \nthan they could ever have been working for somebody else. Senator \nBennett referred to his successes in starting businesses earlier today \non the Senate floor.\n  In the last few years, more people than ever have started their own \ncompanies. As a matter of fact, 430,000 people now make their full-time \nliving on e-Bay. That is just within the last couple of years. Those \npeople are not measured in the payroll survey; they are only measured \nin the household survey.\n  The other side says those who are self-employed do not have jobs. As \na matter of fact, the other side says there have been 3 million jobs \nlost since President Bush took office. That number is according to the \npayroll survey. The household survey shows 2 million jobs have been \nadded because a lot of those people are now self-employed.\n  Before my tenure in the U.S. Senate, I was a veterinarian. I was \nself-employed. My job did not count, according to the other side of the \naisle. They say that the household survey does not count. If you are \nself-employed, you know you are working; you think you have a job; you \nthink that should count. It is an insult to those self-employed people \nnot to count them in a survey of jobs. If we are really talking about \njobs, we should have the most accurate reflection of jobs.\n  Even giving the other side of the aisle just the payroll survey, the \npayroll survey is improving. It is improving dramatically. Almost \n900,000 jobs since the beginning of the year have been added to the \npayrolls of the United States, which begs the question: why should we \nextend the temporary extension of unemployment benefits program again?\n  When the Democrats controlled the White House, the House and the \nSenate, after the early 1990s recession, the unemployment rate was at \n6.6 percent. At that time they said unemployment was low enough to end \nthe program. We have not heard the other side address that issue. I \nhave made this argument on the Senate floor many times this year, and \nwe have not heard the other side address that. They controlled all \nthree of those bodies and yet they saw the fact that 6.6 percent was \nlow enough to end the program.\n  Fast-forward to today, the Republicans control the White House, the \nSenate, and the House, and now the Democrats say that, even though the \nunemployment rate is almost a full percentage point lower than when the \nDemocrats ended the program, now the unemployment is too high and we \nneed to keep the temporary unemployment program going today.\n  I think that is disingenuous. It is saying while we were in control, \n6.6 percent was low enough to end the program, but now the Republicans \nare in control, 5.6 percent is too high and we ought to keep the \nprogram going. They put out the statement from Alan Greenspan, who said \nwe should keep the program going. Well, Alan Greenspan has also said \nthat the biggest threat to our economic long-term growth is the \ndeficit. The amendment that was offered by Senator Cantwell costs \nalmost a billion dollars a month. It is a 9-month extension, and it is \nan $9.5 billion price tag. That adds $9.5 billion to the deficit. We \nhave already spent $32 billion on this program the last couple of \nyears, which added $32 billion to the deficit. It comes right out of \ndeficit spending.\n  I believe it is time to end the program. The States have money we \ngave them. We gave them $8 billion to address the problem of high \nunemployment in their States. Many States, including the State of \nWashington, have not used this money. Out of the $144 million the State \nof Washington received out of the $8 billion, they have only used about \n$1 million. So if the State of Washington cared about their unemployed, \none would think they\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\nwould use that money, but they have chosen not to use it. So I think we \nhave fulfilled our obligation during the recession and post-recession \nwhen unemployment was high, but it is time to start worrying about the \ndeficit. For those who talk about being deficit hawks, it is time to \nvote against this program.\n  Now I do not know whether this was done purposely or not, but in \ndrafting this bill, the author of the amendment drafted it in such a \nway that it is retroactive to the first of the year. So that means if \none is working today, but they were unemployed at the beginning of the \nyear and would have qualified for TEUC at the beginning of the year, \nthey actually would get a check from the Federal Government. I do not \nthink that is the purpose of this program. The purpose of this program \nwas to help those who really could not get a job.\n  The other reason I do not believe this program should be extended is, \nduring times of economic growth, if one is having trouble getting a job \nit may mean that they have to move. Well, we are in times of economic \ngrowth, but the more comfortable we make it for people on unemployment \ninsurance--in other words, when they are getting these unemployment \nbenefits--the more comfortable we make it to stay on unemployment, the \nless incentive there is to go out and do what it takes to get a job. It \nis called personal responsibility.\n  I believe we are during that time of economic growth--I think all of \nthe statistics show that--and it is time that we end this program and \nwe vote down the Cantwell amendment. The Cantwell amendment violates \nthe budget. We know that. That is why there is a budget point of order \nthat is going to be raised against the Cantwell amendment. The vote we \nwill have will be to waive the Budget Act so that we will deficit \nspend.\n  If we want to make sure those jobs are out there for the people who \nare unemployed today, we have to have a strong economy. Alan Greenspan \nsays the biggest threat to our economy is the size of the deficit. Let \nus do something about the size of the deficit by voting down this $8 \nbillion program.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for the time I have \nunder the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The ancient Theban poet Pindar wrote: ``The test of any \nman lies in action.''\n  That was a very provocative, very prescient, and very wise statement. \nThe test of any man, or woman, lies in action.\n  Today that test will be for the Senate. Today we will test whether \nthe Senate can act to create and keep good manufacturing jobs in \nAmerica. Today we will test whether the Senate can act to end European \ntariffs that hobble American businesses, and today we will test whether \nthe Senate can act to extend vital benefits to the nearly 1.5 million \njobless Americans who have exhausted their unemployment benefits.\n  The coming cloture vote is the defining test for the JOBS bill. If \nthe Senate cannot vote today to complete action on this bill, then the \nmajority leader will move on to other business. Yes, in a perfect world \nevery Senator would have the opportunity to offer and debate every \namendment. In a perfect world, every amendment would get a vote. In a \nperfect world, every Senator would get home for family dinner at 6. But \nby the standards of the modern Senate, I believe the Senate has given \nthis bill fair consideration.\n  Over the course of 5 separate weeks, we have considered 28 amendments \nand adopted 17 of them. I think that is a respectable record. The \ncoming cloture vote is now the test of whether we can pass the JOBS \nbill. The coming cloture vote is also a test of whether Senators on \nthis side of the aisle can take yes for an answer. We on this side \ndemanded a vote on Senator Harkin's overtime amendment, and the Senate \ndid consider that amendment. The Senate adopted that amendment. We \ndemanded a vote on Senator Dodd's offshoring amendment, and the Senate \ndid consider that amendment and the Senate adopted that amendment as \nwell. We demanded a vote on Senator Wyden's trade adjustment assistance \namendment, and the Senate did consider that amendment but regrettably \ndid not adopt it. However, Senators Wyden, Coleman, and I intend to \nbring that effort back to the Senate on another day. And we demanded a \nvote on Senator Cantwell's unemployment insurance amendment. Under the \nunanimous consent agreement governing this bill, in order to get a vote \non the unemployment insurance amendment the Senate needs to invoke \ncloture.\n  If we invoke cloture, the Senate will consider that amendment, and I \nhope the Senate will also adopt it.\n  I believe that invoking cloture to get a vote on the Cantwell \namendment is now a fair deal for Democrats, and I think we should take \nit. We should say, yes, for an answer. We should vote to invoke cloture \nso that we may vote on unemployment benefits.\n  After the cloture vote, the vote to waive the budget for Senator \nCantwell's amendment will be a test for the entire Senate. Our vote on \nthe Cantwell amendment is a test as to whether we can respond to the \nrecord number of jobless workers who have exhausted their benefits. \nAmerica's free and open market economy has yielded unparalleled growth \nand vitality. Part of the genius of our economy is that we allow the \nprivate sector the freedom to adjust rapidly to changing circumstances. \nIt helps our country grow. That freedom and vitality comes also with \ndisruption and pain for workers who lose their jobs in hard economic \ntimes like those we have had in the last 4 years.\n  When, nearly 70 years ago, Congress created the unemployment \ninsurance program, our society struck a deal. American workers agreed \nto participate in open and volatile markets, and the Government agreed \nto cushion the blow when markets turned rough. Unemployment insurance \nis the result of a vital social compact.\n  In past recessions, Congress has acted to extend those benefits, and \nthe evidence is that in this recession more workers are remaining \nunemployed much longer than in previous recessions.\n  The share of the unemployed who have been unemployed for more than 6 \nmonths has hit its highest level in more than 20 years. Federal \nChairman Alan Greenspan said recently ``an exceptionally high number'' \nof unemployed are losing their unemployment benefits, and he supported \nresuming temporary Federal benefits, saying:\n\n       I think it's a good idea largely because of the size of the \n     degree of exhaustions.\n\n  Thus, the coming vote on the Cantwell amendment will test whether the \nSenate can respond to this human need, keep our social compact, and \nextend these needed unemployment benefits. Finally, this coming cloture \nvote will be a test of whether the Senate can work.\n  This bill began as a venture of Democrats and Republicans working \ntogether in the Finance Committee. Its major provision, the heart of \nthe provision--tax cuts for American manufacturing--is really a \nDemocratic priority. Democrats sought all along to create and keep good \nmanufacturing jobs here in America. This bill advanced in the Finance \nCommittee as a cooperative venture. The chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and I, working together, included many of the provisions of \nthe bill in response to the request of Senators on this side of the \naisle--on both sides of the aisle, but especially on this side of the \naisle. This bill reflects an open, democratic process.\n  Once we came to the Senate floor, we tried to ensure the Senate \nconsider the maximum number of amendments. Now the Senate has \nconsidered 28 amendments and adopted 17 amendments. Even after the \nSenate invokes cloture, the Senate may still consider germane \namendments and there are going to be several of them, and I believe the \nSenate will be able to take them up and deal with them postcloture.\n  The time for talk is coming to a close. Soon will be a time for \naction. The coming vote will be a test of whether the Senate can act. \nLet us act to advance this bill to create good manufacturing jobs here \nin America. Let us act to extend unemployment benefits to jobless \nworkers who need them. Let us act to show we can at least work together \nin the spirit of that great poet Pindar, again, who said, ``The test of \nany man lies in action.''\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation \nright now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \npending amendment offered by my very able colleague from Washington, \nSenator Cantwell, and by my able colleague from Ohio, Senator \nVoinovich. I commend both of them for their work on this issue. I \nparticularly want to underscore the determination and the perseverance \nSenator Cantwell of Washington has shown in pressing this issue \nforward.\n  This amendment, simply put, seeks to reinstate the Temporary Extended \nUnemployment Insurance Benefits Program which lapsed at the end of \n2003. Long-term unemployment, the very problem this program of \ntemporarily extending unemployment insurance benefits is intended to \ndeal with, is at near record levels. There are 1.8 million long-term \nunemployed workers in America today. That is, they have been unemployed \nfor more than 26 weeks, the period that is traditionally covered by \nunemployment insurance benefits.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued we do not need to pass this \namendment because jobs are beginning to pick up. They assert we have an \nunemployment rate lag, after the end of a recession.\n  We have not even recovered the jobs we have lost, as we now move out \nof this recession. This administration is the first administration \nsince the Hoover administration not to produce a net gain of jobs in \nthe course of its tenure. Long-term unemployed workers today constitute \n22 percent of all unemployed workers. That level is near a 20-year \nhigh. It has been above 20 percent for the last 19 months--in other \nwords, of the unemployed, this large a portion have been long-term \nunemployed. That is the longest such stretch since the Department of \nLabor began keeping such statistics in 1948.\n  It has been 37 months since the recession began. The economy has 1.6 \nmillion fewer jobs today than it did 37 months ago. In no other \nrecession since the Great Depression has the economy failed to recreate \nall the jobs it lost after 37 months. We are still down 1.6 million \nfewer jobs than when the recession began 37 months ago. In every other \nrecession other than the Great Depression, the economy had recreated \nall the jobs that had been lost within 31 months. I stress this to make \nthe point that the job market has not strengthened adequately in order \nto take care of these people. Job growth is far too slow.\n  It is not as though the level of benefits that is being sought is \nhistorically excessive. In previous recessions we have passed \nextensions beyond what is contained in this amendment. When we had a \nrecession from July of 1990 to March of 1991, we extended unemployment \nbenefits until April of 1994. At the program's peak, benefits were \navailable for 26 to 33 extra weeks. It was in the previous Bush \nadministration that this took place.\n  It is not as though providing these benefits is not supported by \nprominent economists. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan testified \nbefore the Joint Economic Committee on April 21, only a few weeks ago, \nthat re-instating the extended unemployment insurance program is ``a \ngood idea. I think it is a good idea, largely because of the size of \nthe degree of exhaustions.''\n  We built up this unemployment insurance trust fund to fund these \nbenefits. The money is in there, paid for, for this very purpose. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment from my able colleagues \nfrom Washington and Ohio.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, it \nwill be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Senator from Oklahoma if he wishes to speak. \nThere are several speakers on this side. As I understand it, on the \nother side of the aisle, the time is divided between 10 and 15. If the \nSenator from Oklahoma has 15 minutes, now will be an appropriate time \nfor him to speak.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We have 10.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. You have 9 minutes left. Now would be an appropriate \ntime. We have a lot of speakers here--not a lot, three more.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am happy to speak, but I don't believe \nthe Senator from Washington has made her speech. Usually I would \nrespond to her.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Maybe you can set a precedent here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I rise in opposition to the amendment of my friend \nSenator Cantwell for a lot of reasons. This is not a simple extension, \nas Senator Ensign earlier said. This is an expansion. Yet despite the \nfact we have good economic news, despite the fact we had a report last \nmonth, 288,000 new jobs, before that, 300,000--700,000 jobs in the last \n2 months--we want to not only extend temporary Federal unemployment \ncompensation, we want an expansion.\n  Change the definition. I started looking at the amendment. I thought \nit was not very well drafted. It does a number of things. It is \nretroactive back to January. It expands benefits, and then it goes \nretroactive.\n  Let us say somebody is unemployed in January and February, but they \nget a good job in March. They would qualify for 8 weeks or maybe 10 \nweeks of benefits. Are we going to write them a check even though they \nhave had a job for the last month or so? We have never done that.\n  What would that be if you were in the State of Massachusetts? It \nwould be as much as $760 a week. For 10 weeks, that is $7,600--a lump \nsum, even though you may have a job that is paying over $80,000 a year.\n  That doesn't make sense. But it would be legal. It would actually \nhappen, and it would cost Federal taxpayers probably in excess of $1 \nbillion if that happened. That makes no sense whatsoever. But that is \nin the amendment.\n  The amendment also, as Senator Ensign explained, basically says for \nthe high unemployment States we are going to change things so more \nStates will qualify for high unemployment benefits. In other words, we \nare going to expand this program. Why? Because most of the States don't \nqualify for it because States that do qualify for the high unemployment \nFederal benefit have to have increasing unemployment. And, frankly, we \ndon't have that. We have decreasing unemployment, including the State \nof Washington, in which I believe the unemployment rate is 6.1 percent. \nYou have declining unemployment in almost every State. The trend is \ndown. The trend is for more employment. We should be grateful for that.\n  Some people evidently want this program to be a permanent Federal \nprogram. But it is a Federal temporary program that has expired.\n  I am looking at the statistics we have used in the past. We \ndiscontinued this program for a couple of years when we had it in the \nearly 1990s. We discontinued that program when the unemployment rate \nwas 6.6 percent. Now the rate is down to 5.6 percent. We were well \nbelow the rates when we discontinued this program in 1994.\n  When we had a Federal temporary program in the early 1980s, we \ndiscontinued the program when the rate was 7.4 percent. In the mid-\n1970s--1975-1977--we discontinued the program when it was 6.8 percent. \nNow the rate is 5.6 percent, and we are saying let's discontinue it. \nSome people say let's continue it for everybody. It makes no sense \nlet's not only extend it, but let's expand it. That is in this \namendment.\n  Finally, this amendment is not paid for. I am amused by the number of \npeople who say, Yes, we want deficit reduction. We want pay-go, and 51 \nSenators voted for pay-go. Senator Feingold had an amendment to the \nBudget Resolution. I didn't support it. This is going to make it tough \non taxes and people do not pay enough attention to it on spending. I \nhear all these people: No, we want pay-go.\n  We had an amendment last week on trade adjustment assistance. Of the \n51 Members who supported the pay-go amendment to the Budget Resolution \non the floor, only 3 voted to sustain the pay-go point of order I made \non the floor--only 3--and 48 Members reversed themselves. In other \nwords, they said we don't want pay-go when it comes to creating or \nexpanding a new program like trade adjustment assistance.\n\n  Senator Grassley had a bill last week, the Family Opportunity Act. It\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\npassed. A pay-go point of order could have been applied to this. A pay-\ngo point of order will be applied, and I am going to make that pay-go \npoint of order on this amendment.\n  I have tried to get cost estimates on this amendment. OMB estimates \nSenator Cantwell's amendment costs $9.5 billion, and CBO estimates $9 \nbillion. I don't have a letter from them because it is hard to compute \nhow much this retroactive provision is going to cost. But I think it is \nfair to say it is a $9 billion program that is not paid for.\n  At the appropriate point, I will be making a budget pay-go point of \norder that this amendment, if it became law, would increase the deficit \nover the next 10 years by $9 billion. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst it.\n  The economic news is good news. There are almost 1 million new jobs \nthis year. I think there are almost 900,000 new jobs in 2004 alone. \nThere has been some positive, good news on the employment front. The \nunemployment rate is down.\n  When I was in the manufacturing business, if the unemployment rate \nwas around 5 percent, it was almost full employment. I could hardly \nfind people to work. Now the unemployment rate is 5.6 percent. It is \ngoing down. That is good news.\n  We don't need to reach back and extend the program that has already \nbeen going, I believe, for about 36 months at a cost of $32 billion. I \nthink it would be a mistake.\n  At the appropriate point, I will be making a budget point of order \nand urge my colleagues to vote to sustain that point of order.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me start off by correcting a few things my colleagues have said \non the floor. This is a debate about 1.5 million people who have lost \ntheir jobs and have not been able to find work and have been without \nbenefits.\n  To be clear, the unemployment program at the Federal level does not \nexist today. It was terminated as of the 31st of December. This isn't a \ncontinuation of a program that has been in place for the last several \nmonths. It has not been in place.\n  As it relates to the Clinton administration and the economic numbers, \nsay we cut the program off in better economic times and worse economic \ntimes, the whole point of this debate is the fact the economy and job \ncreation has not taken place at the level that would have employed the \nnumber of people who have lost their jobs starting with over 2.6 \nmillion people. While we have had some job growth, we have not totally \nrecovered. While the Clinton administration cut off the program at a \ntime of higher unemployment, they actually had net job growth. That is \nwhy they terminated the program. We are not in that same situation.\n  In fact, it is no wonder Alan Greenspan basically, before a House \ncommittee, came to the same conclusion and said if you have a large \nnumber of exhaustees it makes sense to go ahead and use the program to \ntake care of those exhaustees.\n  So here is one of our chief economists saying, Yes, the Clinton \nadministration did something different, and they did it differently \nbecause they had job creation and net job growth going on. We do not \nhave net job growth going on.\n  My colleague mentioned Alan Greenspan and the deficit and what we \nneed to do to take care of the deficit moving forward. Alan Greenspan, \nwho is also very concerned about the deficit, said exactly this. The \nnumber of exhaustees alone will tell you it is time for us to go ahead \nand take this program and take care of those 1.5 million exhaustees \nbecause of their large number.\n  Let us talk about where we are going to spend money. I think that is \nthe reason we are in this debate. Some of my colleagues said it is \nabout the deficit. Let us take this bill, for example. Let's take the \nunderlying bill and talk about what we are spending money on. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates the cost of my amendment at $5.8 \nbillion. If the Senator from Oklahoma can get a larger number----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I only have 5 minutes. I will be happy to yield after I \nfinish speaking, if I have time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I don't think the Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The issue is this underlying bill has a lot of tax \ncredits and programs to help corporate America. Many of them I support. \nBut I think it is important for my colleagues to realize what is in \nthis bill.\n  As opposed to the cost of taking care of the unemployment in America, \nthere is $9 billion in here for the oil and gas industry; $2.2 billion \nfor the clean coal industry; $2.8 billion for synthetic fuel. Actually, \nthis particular program is under investigation by two different \nagencies. There are $2 billion for green bonds, which I say and \nTaxpayers for Common Sense say could still inadvertently go to a \nHooters Restaurant. These two programs alone would pay for the \nunemployment benefit program.\n\n  We basically went ahead and authorized these in this legislation. I \ndon't know where we found the money for those programs. Yet, we are \ntaking money out of the unemployment insurance trust fund, a fund that \nis supposed to be paid into by employees, and somehow saying, out of \nthe $13 billion that is there, we do not have enough money for working \nfamilies who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, but, \nyes, we have money--$2.8 billion--for synthetic fuels, even though we \nare investigating whether the money should be spent there, and we have \n$2 billion for green bonds that could end up going to a Hooters \nRestaurant. Where are the priorities of my colleagues? Where are the \npriorities in passing this kind of legislation when we know that \nAmerican men and women need our help and support?\n  Like my colleagues, I know this economy will get better. I have \nactually helped create jobs in the private sector. It will recover. But \nthat is not the debate. The debate is, we have terminated a program in \nDecember and we now have data and information that shows the economy \nhas not picked up to the degree in the last several months to take care \nof that huge number of unemployed who have exhausted their benefits. \nWhile everyone is talking about whether the economy is better, \nexecutive salaries are up, corporate profits are up, but total jobs \nlost is the issue. We are in a better economic situation, but we are \nleaving the American worker behind.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 1 of my minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, take last month's number. Say we had an \naverage of 300,000 jobs created each month for the next 6 months. At \nthe end of this program in October we would still be at a deficit. Even \nwith 300,000 jobs created, we would still have over 112,000 people who \nhad not gotten a job.\n  So the question is, What are we going to do for a stimulus in the \nmeantime as we are going through this job creation exercise in America? \nAre we going to say these are the only programs we support, programs \nfor the oil and gas industry, for synthetic fuels, for green bonds, for \nbourbon distributors, for horse racing, for archery manufacturers? \nThose are the things we will support and we will not support the \nAmerican workers?\n  I ask my colleagues to think about our priorities and support the \nCantwell-Voinovich amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I clarify something for my colleague's amendment on \ncost. Her proposal in February was estimated by CBO to be $5.4 billion, \nbut that proposal expired in June. This one expires in November. This \none is retroactive. The one in February was not. So we have many more \nmonths, and we also have the retroactive provision. We have estimates \nthat this proposal will cost $9 billion. It is not paid for. I will \nmake a budget point of order.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes 45 seconds.\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Senator Voinovich is not here, so if the Senator from \nWashington wants to use the time, she may.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I am happy to respond to the issues raised.\n  One point is important to make. I am happy to modify my amendment if \nthis would help clarify. This is not retroactive for someone who has \ngotten a job. If you got a job in March and you would have qualified \nfor January and February unemployment, you do not get unemployment \nbenefits. This only takes care of individuals who have lost their job \nand have not found a job.\n  I am happy to modify the amendment. That is not the intent of the \namendment. The intent is only to take care of people who are still \nunemployed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The intention of the Senator from Washington may be that \nit is not retroactive, but your amendment is retroactive. With the \namendment before the Senate, an individual could be out of work in \nJanuary and February, get a job in March, and receive payments. Read \nthe amendment. It is there. It is retroactive. It may not have been the \nSenator's intention, but it is the fact.\n  The amendment is unnecessary even if it is prospective, but it is \nnot. As written, it is retroactive. This is the middle of May. By the \ntime this would get through conference, it would be in June, July, or \nlater. Yet this amendment says, let's go back to January. So if someone \ngets a job in between then, they would be entitled to receive payments. \nIt is grossly irresponsible and all the more reason our colleagues \nshould not support the amendment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. As I said, that is not the intent of the legislation. \nTo make the Senator from Oklahoma comfortable, I am happy to consider \nwhatever language he wants to clarify that point. This is not about \nsomeone who has gotten a job in the last 7 months; it is about the fact \nthat we terminated this program in December and the fact that there are \n1.5 million Americans who are without benefits. They are, basically, \ndefaulting on mortgages, going into bankruptcy, not being able to take \ncare of their own health insurance or the health care insurance of \ntheir family.\n  It is about giving them access to a fund that was created for these \nvery economic times and giving them support during these economic \ntimes. It is stimulus that, as I said, is just as worthy as the other \nprograms--I would say more worthy than a lot of the programs in the \nunderlying bill.\n  I am happy to correct this perception by the Senator from Oklahoma \nand clarify it in any way so we can get this particular issue off the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will not use all that time.\n  I compliment Senator Cantwell. She has been dogged in her effort to \nbring up this amendment. I remember it was not too long ago when we \nwere working, the chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, and \nothers in the leadership, to try to sequence amendments, to figure out \nhow we would process this bill.\n  The Senator from Washington said she wanted to offer her amendment \nand we told her, absolutely she could. We were trying to work out some \nother amendments and asked if she could delay in pressing her amendment \neven though she had the right to offer it, and she said she would. She \nhas been very good in, first, pushing to get her amendment passed and, \nsecond, working with Senators to try to figure out the very best \ncircumstances under which her amendment could be brought up and passed.\n  It has been somewhat difficult because Senators on this side of the \naisle have been standing up for her rights. This Senator, certainly, \nand the minority leader, Senator Daschle, are standing up very strongly \nfor her rights. Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts also assisted her \nand worked with her to help get this amendment up.\n  There have been some Senators on the other side of the aisle who did \nnot want to vote at all on Senator Cantwell's amendment, but she has \npersevered. She has done a great job representing people who are out of \nwork and unemployed, especially for her State of Washington. That is \nwhy we are here today. Were it not for the perseverance of the Senator \nfrom Washington, it is problematic whether we would be at this point. \nWe will have a vote first on cloture and then a vote on her amendment. \nI thank the Senator for that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Is all time used on the side of the majority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 48 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. If the majority yields back their time, we will yield back \nours.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield back.\n  Mr. REID. We yield back.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. 381, \n     S. 1637, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     comply with the World Trade Organization rulings on the FSC/\n     ETI benefit in a manner that preserves jobs and production \n     activities in the United States, to reform and simplify the \n     international taxation rules of the United States, and for \n     other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Charles E.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nCantwell-Voinovich amendment because it is the right thing to do for \nAmerica's workers and the right thing to do for our economy. Although I \nam pleased that we are finally voting on this critical amendment, it \nsaddens me that we are still talking about this issue. As many in this \nChamber may remember, I worked with my colleagues, Senator Fitzgerald \nand Senator Nickles, to craft an unemployment insurance extension as \nthe first legislation passed by the 108th Congress. That was back in \nJanuary of 2003. Now, I find myself feeling like its Groundhog Day.\n  A year and 5 months have gone by and times are still tough for the \n8.2 million Americans who are out of work. Little over a month ago, on \nMarch 30, tens of thousands of Americans lost their unemployment \nbenefits because the Government's temporary extension of unemployment \ninsurance expired. Every week, 85,000 workers have been running out of \nbenefits and 1.5 million have lost their benefits since January. Since \nPresident Bush took office, our country has lost over 2 million jobs.\n  I represent a State with one of the highest unemployment rates in the \ncountry. In March, New York State's unemployment rate was 6.5 percent. \nIn New York City alone, unemployment has hovered around 8 percent since \nSeptember 11, 2001. And, according to the Department of Labor, if New \nYork City were a State, it would have the highest unemployment rate in \nthe entire country. Almost 130,000 New Yorkers exhausted their \nunemployment insurance benefits between December of last year and \ntoday, none of whom qualified for Federal benefits.\n  Action to help New Yorkers--and all Americans--who are out of work is \nlong overdue. That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Cantwell-\nVoinovich amendment. This amendment is virtually identical to a bill \nthat I introduced with Senator Gordon Smith in November of last year. \nThe Cantwell-Voinovich legislation will do what my bill with Senator \nSmith would have done: it will reinstate the Federal unemployment \ninsurance program and probably every unemployed worker with an \nadditional 13 weeks of benefits.\n  Ignoring the unemployed will not make them go away. In fact, today, \ndespite Congress's inaction on this issue, long-term unemployment is at \nthe highest level in recorded history. More than 2 million Americans \nhave been our of work for 6 months or more, a higher percentage than \never before. According to the Children's Defense Fund, this represents \nan increase of 245 percent in the past 2 years alone. And if the past \nis any indication of the future, many of these jobs will never return. \nIn past recessions, 50 percent of job loss is temporary, the other half \nis permanent. Economists estimate that today nearly 80 percent of job \nloss is permanent.\n  Permanent job loss isn't just a theoretical term. It is a father with \na mortgage, a mother with car payments, and a young person with a \ncollege loan. We must never lose sight of that simple fact. While \neveryone wants to collect a paycheck, unemployment checks provide \ncertainty in an economy that is anything but certain.\n  For months, administration officials have claimed that their tax \npackage will grow the economy and create jobs. But the only thing it is \ncertain to grow is our Nation's mounting debt. The last time their \neconomic policies were enacted, Americans lost 2 million jobs. We \ncannot wait to see how this debate plays out while 10 million \nunemployed Americans struggle. They paid into this system--some for \ndecades--and now, when they need those benefits the most, we should \nprovide them.\n  It is long past time that we take care of unemployed workers in this \ncountry. We simply cannot keep repeating the past and let down American \nworkers in these vulnerable and uncertain times. After all, Groundhog \nDay was officially February 2. And like more than 600,000 unemployed \nNew Yorkers, I am ready to put it behind me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this next amendment is the Cantwell-\nVoinovich amendment which will say when it comes to our economy and \nproducing jobs, the priority of the Senate ought to be taking care of \nthose individuals who lost their jobs and lost their benefits.\n  This amendment is crystal clear. It only applies to people who have \nlost their benefits and are unemployed as of the enactment of this \nlegislation, which means it only covers people who have lost their jobs \nand are unemployed. It is about whether we are going to say 1.5 million \nAmericans are more a priority than simply passing this legislation with \nall the tax credits, all the incentives for various corporations in \nAmerica, but leaving American workers out in the cold.\n  Thirteen billion dollars of the unemployment insurance trust fund \nshould be enough security to give back to workers who have paid into \nthis account and through no fault of their own are unemployed. So while \nthis institution today is going to make decisions----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent that both sides have 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. So the question is whether we are going to continue to \nmake a priority these kinds of tax credits in this legislation and \nleave the American workers out in the cold. I urge my colleagues, let \nus do both. Let us help those who have been left behind and continue to \ntry to create a more positive economy.\n  I urge people to support the Cantwell-Voinovich amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will take 1 minute and then the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma will take 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, a couple of quick facts. First, when the Democrats \nwere in control in the early 1990s, following the recession, we had \nthis same program. They were in control of the White House, the House \nand the Senate. The unemployment rate was at 6.6 percent and they voted \nto stop the program, again, when the unemployment rate was at 6.6 \npercent. Today the unemployment rate is one point lower at 5.6 percent \nand, yet, now they want to extend the program. This, at the cost of $9 \nbillion. If one is a deficit hawk and they are worried about the \ndeficit, they should vote against the Cantwell amendment.\n\n  This amendment is also retroactive. In other words, if a person has a \njob now, qualified for TEUC after it expired, then this would apply to \nthem. They would get a check from the Government for the time after \nJanuary they were unemployed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this \nbudget point of order that I am going to raise because this amendment \nis retroactive. This amendment costs 67 percent more than the last \ntime. It costs $9 billion and it is not paid for. I am going to make a \npay-go point of order. We did this last week and most of the people who \nsay they support pay-go voted to waive pay-go. We are going to give \nthem another opportunity to sustain pay-go and make sure this amendment \ndoes not pass because it would increase the deficit by $9 billion.\n  The pending amendment offered by the Senator from Washington, Ms. \nCantwell, increases mandatory spending and if adopted would cause an \nincrease in the deficit in excess of levels permitted in the most \nrecently adopted budget resolution. Therefore, I raise a point of order \nagainst the amendment pursuant to section 505 of the H. Con. Res. 95, \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I move to waive the relevant section of \nthe Budget Act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 88 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kerry\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This has been cleared by both managers. I also ask unanimous \nconsent that no other amendments be in order prior to the vote.\n  I don't have the number of the amendments, but they have been filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3129\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Gregg, Mr. Sununu, and Mr. Graham of Florida, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3129.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike provisions relating to energy tax incentives)\n\n       Strike title VIII.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment is rather straightforward. \nIt strikes the energy tax provisions in this bill which are estimated \nto cost nearly $18 billion. I read from an April 19 article from the \nWashington Post:\n\n       Congress's task seemed simple enough: Repeal an illegal $5 \n     billion-a-year export subsidy and replace it with some modest \n     tax breaks to ease the pain on United States exporters.\n\n  This article is entitled ``Special-Interest Add-Ons Weigh Down Tax-\nCut Bill.''\n\n       But out of that imperative has emerged one of the most \n     complex, special-interest-riddled corporate tax bills in \n     years, lawmakers, Senate aides and lobbyists say. The 930-\n     page epic is packed with $170 billion in tax cuts aimed at \n     cruise-ship operators, NASCAR track owners, bow-and-arrow \n     makers, and Oldsmobile dealers, to name a few. There is even \n     a $94 million break for a single hotel in Sioux City, Iowa. \n     Even one of the tax lobbyists involved in drafting it \n     conceded the bill ``has risen to a new level of sleaze.''\n\n  I agree with that lobbyist. This has risen to a new level of sleaze.\n  The lobbyist goes on to say:\n\n       ``I said a few months ago, any lobbyist worth his salt has \n     something in this bill,'' said the lobbyist, who would only \n     speak on condition of anonymity. ``Now you see what I'm \n     talking about.''\n\n  The Wall Street Journal, Wednesday, May 5, in an article entitled \n``Export Tax Follies:''\n\n       But instead of solving the problem, congressmen are \n     engaging in one of their epic tax-bidding wars . . . \n     including a $482 million sop to the insurance company, $189 \n     million in ``transitional assistance'' for Oldsmobile \n     dealers, and an $8 million tax break for makers of children's \n     bow and arrows.\n       Not only that . . . $15 billion in energy tax breaks were \n     thrown in as an added sweetener. The Senate couldn't pass the \n     energy bill as a stand alone measure, so he's looking for any \n     shipwrecks that will sail this year. The measure includes an \n     overhaul of tax treatment for ethanol and subsidies for \n     ``clean'' fuels. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, there is an abundance of media coverage of this \nlegislation. It reaches, as the lobbyist said, in my view, a new level \nof sleaze.\n  We have to consider what we are doing. We had a $170 billion tax \nbreak, which really is $170 billion that will not go into the U.S. \nTreasury. So Alan Greenspan, last week, says the greatest threat to our \nNation's economy is the deficit, and that a free lunch you don't have \nto pay for hasn't been invented yet. Yet here we are with $170 billion \nworth of tax breaks, tacking on to it $18 billion in tax breaks on an \nenergy bill that this body could not pass.\n  It is remarkable, with a half trillion deficit, and we are enacting \nnew tax credits, for--guess who--the oil and gas industry in America \nwhich, the last time I checked, is doing pretty well.\n  The majority of my colleagues on this side of the aisle just voted \nagainst an extension of the unemployment benefits for Americans who \nremain unemployed and haven't profited by this reemerging and \nstrengthening economy. My God, we won't give them an extension of their \nunemployment benefits. But if the ethanol people of Archer Daniels \nMidland need it, by God, we will give it to them. Mr. President, $170 \nbillion in tax credits but no extension of unemployment benefits for \npeople who have been out of work, it is a remarkable commentary.\n\n  Out of all the provisions that have been added to this bill since it \nwas first brought to the floor of the Senate on March 3, I find the \nenergy tax title the most egregious. That is why I am offering this \namendment to strike it. What do these provisions have to do with the \nunderlying bill? Nothing. What do they have to do with ensuring that \ntariffs that have been placed on our Nation's manufacturers since March \n1 are lifted? The answer is nothing.\n  I understand how sweet this is--how sweet this is--for these \nlobbyists who are doing so well here in Washington. But if the Senate \nis to consider an energy tax incentive bill or an energy authorizing \nbill, we should be following regular order, bringing legislation to the \nSenate floor, and debating it in its own right. Instead, a 319-page \nenergy tax title was incorporated without a vote.\n  The proponents of this bill contend it is ``revenue neutral'' and \nthat all the tax cuts in the bill are paid for with offsets. How many \ntimes have we played that game? How many times have we used the same \nold offsets on the same old bills, and somehow, with all these offsets, \nwe now have a half-trillion-dollar deficit? It is hard to imagine. For \nexample, 66 provisions of offsets are identical to provisions that were \nincluded in the highway bill. So we are using the same offsets for the \nhighway bill, the same offsets for the energy bill. And as some more \npork\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\ncomes rolling in here--squealing in here--we will probably use those \nsame offsets again. I understand the duplicative offsets total about $5 \nbillion. Of course, if these bills ever get to conference and \nconference agreements are reached, only one measure could include these \noffsets.\n  Again, the amendment I am offering would strike title VIII of the \npending bill.\n  By the way, I have no illusion as to how this vote is going to turn \nout. The Senator from Michigan just came up to me and said: Well, don't \ntake away my tax break. I want to take away every tax break, I say to \nthe Senator from Michigan.\n  The oil and gas subsidies are estimated to cost about $5 billion and \nare illustrative of what TIME magazine referred to as the great energy \nscam on the American taxpayers. This graphic is from an investigative \nreport on synthetic fuel credits which appeared in the October 2003 \nissue of TIME magazine. While synthetic fuel credits are only one \nindefensible part of this energy tax title, the entire oil and gas \nsubtitle is a shameless scam that benefits the already enormously \nprofitable oil and gas industries with little or no benefit to the \nAmerican public.\n  I would like to highlight a few provisions that defy both fiscal and \ncommon sense. First, there is about $835 million provided to wealthy \noil and gas corporations to write off the cost of looking for domestic \noil and gas reserves. As if the oil and gas companies do not have \nsufficient incentives or resources of their own, we are going to make \nthe taxpayers pay for the basic cost of doing business. This provision \nsweetens the already generous tax treatment and would allow businesses \nto recoup their costs for both successful and unsuccessful projects. So \nfailure will be as financially sweet as success.\n\n  I suppose some of my colleagues may maintain that providing this \nopportunity for greater riches to oil and gas corporations could result \nin more supply for the American public. Well, the Energy Information \nAdministration reports that such claims are not backed by the facts. \nAccording to a February 2004 EIA report, these subsidies do not impact \nsupply. The EIA report states:\n\n       The tax provision is expected to have a negligible impact \n     on oil and gas production because . . . year-to-year cash \n     flow can be at least 35 times larger than the tax value and \n     consequently the provision is unlikely to appreciably sway \n     drilling decisions.\n\n  In other words, these companies are too rich to pay attention to a \npaltry $835 million.\n  Another provision of this bill, which is perhaps even more egregious \nthan picking up the tab for oil and gas exploration, would provide \nnearly $2 billion for the extension and modification of tax credits for \nproducing fuel from a nonconventional source. ``Nonconventional'' is \nthe operative word when we talk about synthetic fuels. There is nothing \nconventional about this so-called fuel, a creation of Congress in 1980. \nNow that this tax credit scam has been exposed by not only TIME but by \nour own IRS, Congress has no excuse to perpetuate this expensive hoax, \nwhich has cost the taxpayers $4 billion since 1999.\n  If there is anyone who does not know how synthetic fuel is made, the \nprocess conjures up images of Rumplestiltskin turning straw into gold, \nexcept in this case it is not turning something into anything \ndifferent. But this is not a fairytale.\n  Here is how the process goes. First, you start with coal, and then, \nsince IRS rules require a chemical change to occur, you must spray the \ncoal with something other than water--usually it is diesel fuel or pine \ntar--and, magically, you now have a ``synthetic fuel,'' which sounds \nbetter than ``sprinkled'' coal, I guess. The company then sells the \ncoal to a user, such as a powerplant, for a slightly lower cost than \nuntreated--or unsprinkled--coal and claims a huge tax credit for \n``manufacturing a synthetic fuel.'' If anyone missed a step of this \nmiraculous process, it is coal, to sprayed coal, to gold.\n  I would like to show you how golden this tax credit can be. This \ngraphic shows the reduced tax rate of one multinational hotel \ncorporation that also produces synthetic fuel. This corporation is not \nthe biggest beneficiary of the synthetic shelter, but it is \nillustrative of the point that one does not need to be in the oil or \ngas business to strike it rich with synthetic fuels.\n  The IRS has struggled mightily with this tax shelter that grows ever \nmore expansive and expensive. It has undertaken two formal reviews of \nsynthetic fuel production and testing facilities and concluded that \nthere is not any synthetic fuel being produced. This remarkable finding \nis presented in a November 2003 IRS bulletin, and I quote:\n\n       The Service believes that the processes approved under its \n     long-standing ruling (that a synthetic fuel must differ \n     significantly in chemical composition from the substance used \n     to produce it) do not produce the level of chemical change \n     required.\n\n  Incredibly it goes on to say:\n\n       Nevertheless, the Service continues to recognize that many \n     taxpayers and their investors have relied on its long-\n     standing ruling to make investments.\n\n  So basically the IRS is going to give this lucrative hoax a ``wink \nand a nod'' while it waits for Congress to end this sham, which is very \nunlikely.\n  Another objectional provision would provide subsidies for the highly \nprofitable gas production method called coalbed methane. According to \nthe Department of Energy, coalbed methane accounted for 57 percent of \nthe growth in U.S. natural gas production between 1990 and 1999. \nCoalbed methane wells are proliferating in western coalfields and \nwherever else coalbeds exist, without a tax incentive.\n  As you can see from these tables, the number of wells drilled in the \nPowder River Basin in Wyoming has skyrocketed. The tremendous growth in \nproduction from 1993 to 2002, with 10,718 wells in this Wyoming field, \noccurred without a tax credit, and the BLM expects that another 40,000 \nnew wells will be drilled in this area over the next decade. So I think \nit is clear that this industry has not been waiting around for taxpayer \ndollars.\n  If any of my colleagues believe that by making a very profitable \nindustry even more profitable, these tax breaks will help increase gas \nsupply and bring down prices, they are wrong. According to the \nCongressional Research Service:\n\n       [V]irtually all of the added gas output (from coalbed \n     methane) has substituted for domestic conventional gas rather \n     than imported petroleum, meaning that the credit has \n     basically not achieved its underlying policy objective of \n     enhancing energy security.\n\n  In other words, the gas industry has turned from conventional \nproduction to coalbed methane with its higher margin of profitability \nwithout an increase in total supply.\n  Additionally, the Congressional Research Service found:\n\n     that from an economic perspective, the Sec. 29 credits \n     compound distortions in the energy markets rather than \n     correcting for preexisting distortions due to pollution, oil \n     import dependence, ``excessive'' market risk, and other \n     factors.\n\n  Therefore, one must ask, what is the American public actually \nreceiving from these tax incentives? Economic distortions which \ntranslate into higher gas prices. I am certain my colleagues do not \nwant to perpetuate the perverse price effect of this tax credit.\n  In the Western U.S., most lands operate on the doctrine of ``split \nestates'' with different owners of the surface property rights and \nunderlying mineral rights. As the number of coalbed methane wells has \nskyrocketed, the conflicts with thousands of property owners has \nintensified. That is due to the extensive environmental damage caused \nby coalbed methane production, which involves pumping massive volumes \nof groundwater to release the methane held by hydraulic pressure.\n  Clean coal. The energy tax title would provide an estimated $1.6 \nbillion for the so-called clean coal program. Since 1984, the \nDepartment of Energy has already invested $1.8 billion in the clean \ncoal program to ``explore technologies,'' making it the largest \nenvironmental technology development effort the Federal Government has \never conducted. But we cannot stop there. This bill would provide an \nadditional $1.6 billion toward the development of still more clean coal \ntechnologies. Before we require the taxpayers to pay even more for this \nprogram, should we not first consider what we have received in return \nfor the first $1.8 billion?\n  According to the Department of Energy, the $1.8 billion worth of \ninvestments went to Bechtel, Westinghouse, General Electric, Texaco, \nand other companies that produced technology patents and products that \nhave been\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\nsold around the world, generating billions of dollars for these \ncompanies. Besides the enormous profits these companies made by using \ntaxpayer dollars for their research and development, serious \ndeficiencies in the program explain why a new project has not been \nadded in the last 5 years, and why this program should not be funded \nagain.\n  One of the primary goals of the clean coal program was to produce \ntechnologies that scrub emissions from powerplants that result in \ncleaner air. However, according to a 2001 GAO report, new technologies \nproduced from the $1.8 billion allocated for new clean air technologies \nhave ``limited potential for achieving nationwide emission reductions \nwhen used at existing coal-burning facilities.''\n  The clean coal program management shows more deficiencies. The GAO \nreports many of the clean coal technology demonstration programs have \nshown severe problems in meeting costs, schedule, and performance \ngoals.\n  Biomass. Nestled within the provisions of this bill is one of the \nmore ironic and bizarre U.S. policies to be considered. Under the false \nguise of exploring environmentally friendly alternative energy sources, \nthis bill extends and expands a subsidy offered to facilities that burn \nanimal droppings. I realize a handful of States are facing legitimate \nenvironmental challenges stemming from massive amounts of poultry \nmanure and need to find a way to manage the toxic substances that are a \nbyproduct of these droppings. I favor determining the most effective \nmethod of addressing this environmental concern within the proper land \nmanagement context. However, it would be ironic indeed if, in ordinary \nto satisfy the need for a clean, renewable energy source, the Senate \npasses legislation subsidizing the burning of animal droppings, a \nprocess which has been found to emit toxic heavy metals such as lead, \nmercury, and arsenic.\n  No less green an organization than Friends of the Earth opposes \nburning these droppings as an energy source because the process \n``cause[s] serious environment and community health problems.'' \nMoreover, EPA studies have suggested these facilities have the \npotential to cause more air pollution than a coal plant. On top of all \nthis, these facilities drive up prices on natural fertilizers used on \nAmerican farms, actually detracting from an environmentally friendly \nfarming process that requires no Government subsidy.\n  Why on earth are we wasting valuable money on such a ridiculous, \nirrational program, especially when such dire financial and energy \nneeds are facing this country today?\n  Another interesting provision concerns the proposed Alaska natural \ngas pipeline. There is a good deal of support for this new pipeline \nfrom Alaska to the lower 48 States, but to what extent are we willing \nto mortgage the Federal budget to help ensure its reality? The energy \ntax title would provide a huge subsidy to the natural gas companies \nproposing the construction of the Alaska natural gas pipeline. In the \ncase of a drop in the price of natural gas, the energy title \nestablishes a price floor--how many manufacturers in America would like \nto have a price floor for their product?--of $1.35 per thousand cubic \nfeet. If the market price falls below that amount, the Federal \nGovernment would have to pay the difference to the private companies \nfor a maximum benefit of 52 cents per thousand cubic feet. The credit \nwould be in effect for the next 25 years. Even the conferees on the \nenergy conference committee refused to include this provision in its \nfinal agreement on H.R. 6, which, considering the wasteful special \ninterest giveaways included, should make one wonder about the merits of \nthis provision.\n  I could go on and on about this bill. I could cite many examples, \nsuch as dog-track owners and all the other provisions. But this is \nprobably the most egregious we have and it is quite remarkable. It is a \nvery unfortunate way of doing business, because if we establish this \nprecedent of tacking on anything we want to legislation that is totally \nirrelevant, then I fear the process has broken down even more badly \nthan I first suspected.\n  Let me again put this in the context of the environment in which we \nexist today. This bill, which was designed to provide $5 billion in \norder to satisfy our European friends' concerns, has now grown into a \n$170 billion ``Christmas tree'' of goodies for every conceivable \nspecial interest. When we are running multitrillion-dollar surpluses, I \nguess you could argue it wasn't such a bad idea.\n  Last week Alan Greenspan said the greatest danger to America's \neconomy is these burgeoning multitrillion-dollar deficits. We have \nnever enacted tax cuts while we are in a war. If one thing has been \nmade abundantly clear, it is the cost of the Iraq war is going to be \nincredibly high--far higher than we ever anticipated. Around here, it \nis business as usual--well, it is not business as usual; this is \nprobably about the worst I have seen.\n  I won't say the worst because I probably could think of something. It \nis as bad as anything I have ever seen. We have no fiscal discipline in \nthis body, and our kids are going to pay a very high price for it. When \nthe bow-and-arrow manufacturers and all of the other things that are \nstuffed into this, such as horse and dog-track owners, and all of the \nothers--cars, automobiles, Oldsmobiles, all of these things are now \namassing. I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator McCain has filed a motion to \nstrike all of the Energy tax provisions from the JOBS bill. Senator \nMcCain has a right to his opinion, but I overwhelmingly disagree with \nhis opinion and I urge all of my fellow Senators to vote ``No'' on this \namendment.\n  In order to secure our country's economic and national security, we \nneed to have a balanced energy plan that protects the environment, \nsupports the needs of our growing economy, and reduces our dependence \non foreign sources of energy.\n  Every man, woman and child in the United States is a stakeholder when \nit comes to developing a responsible, balanced, stable, long-term \nenergy policy.\n  The events of September 11 have made very clear to Americans how \nimportant it is to enhance our energy independence. We can no longer \nafford to allow our dangerous reliance on foreign sources of oil to \ncontinue.\n  But ``wait'' we do, and we do it well. It has been over 10 years \nsince we have passed energy legislation.\n  And if we wait until we get that ``perfect'' bill, the wait will be \nforever.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to correct that because we have added \nall of the Energy Tax provisions to this JOBS bill. Our energy tax \nprovisions obviously are not perfect. And to those who complain about \nvarious provisions, I say, so what do we do? Do nothing? Wait for the \n``perfect'' bill?\n  These provisions may not be perfect but let me tell you what we do \nhave. We have energy tax provisions that were crafted from inception in \na bipartisan manner. From the beginning, both Democrat and Republican \nstaffs from both Finance and Energy Committees worked side by side to \ncraft a fair and balanced energy tax package.\n  I may not personally believe in every one of these provisions, but \nthe process has worked to craft an energy tax package that is good for \nall 50 States and all forms of energy production, both renewables and \ntraditional oil and gas and conservation and energy efficiency.\n  Some of the amendments pending on this bill suggest the energy tax \nprovisions will pick winners and losers. Is that true? Am I OK with \nthat?\n  The answer is a definite ``yes.'' Remember, the winners we pick in \nthis bill are all Americans, all of whom have a stake in reducing our \ndependence upon foreign energy. We do this by favoring domestic \nproducers over foreign producers.\n  It is well past time to get serious about implementing energy \nefficiency and conservation efforts, investing in alternative, \nrenewable fuels and improving domestic production of traditional \nresources.\n  As you know, Mr. President, I support a comprehensive energy policy \nconsisting of conservation efforts, development of renewable and \nalternative energy resources, and domestic production of traditional \nsources of energy.\n  And we will have an opportunity under Senator Domenici's leadership \nto address the energy policy issues at a later date, but for now we \nwill only be considering the energy tax provisions.\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\n  As my colleagues well know, I have long been a supporter of \nalternative and renewable sources of energy as a way of protecting our \nenvironment and increasing our energy independence.\n  I strongly support the production of renewable domestic fuels, \nparticularly ethanol and biodiesel. As domestic, renewable sources of \nenergy, ethanol and biodiesel can increase fuel supplies, reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, and increase our national and economic \nsecurity.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I continue to work \nclosely with the ranking member, Senator Baucus, to defend an energy \ntax title that strikes a good balance between conventional energy \nsources, alternative and renewable energy, and conservation.\n  Among others, it includes provisions for the development of renewable \nsources of energy such as wind and biomass, incentives for energy \nefficient appliances and homes, and incentives for the production of \nnon-conventional sources of traditional oil and gas.\n  I believe the energy tax provisions included in the JOBS bill does a \ngood job to address our Nation's energy security in a balanced and \ncomprehensive way.\n  I am also pleased that with the JOBS bill we have finally gotten to a \npoint to address this important issue that has such a direct impact on \nour national and economic security.\n  For the sake of our children and our grandchildren, we must implement \nconservation efforts, invest in alternative and renewable energy, and \nimprove development and production of domestic oil and natural gas \nresources. And we need all of the energy tax provisions to be included \nin the JOBS bill. I urge you to vote ``no'' on Senator McCain's effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have so many Members on this side who \nwant to speak in opposition to the amendment, as well as Senators on \nthe other side, but we are quite restricted as to the time to allocate. \nFirst, I will begin with Senator Bunning, 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the McCain \namendment. We need these energy tax provisions now more than ever. The \nprice of energy has risen sharply and is only expected to keep going up \nand up.\n  The average price of a gallon of unleaded gasoline now is $1.84 a \ngallon. Natural gas prices are 70 percent higher than they were a year \nago. Coal prices are up 30 percent since last year. These high prices \nare affecting Americans' pocketbooks at a time when our economy is on \nthe rise.\n  If Congress does nothing to encourage more production, Americans will \ncontinue to struggle financially and our economic recovery will \nevaporate.\n  The energy tax package in the JOBS bill will help our country meet \nits future energy needs and will help kick our economy into gear.\n  Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, we all know we need more \nproduction. Having a cheap, ready supply of energy is now more critical \nthan ever to our economy. These tax incentives in this bill are crafted \nto help this production supply. Striking them from the bill will only \nlead to higher prices and more energy inflation.\n  The energy tax incentives will also mean more jobs and more money in \nAmericans' wallets. I am certain every single Senator has talked to his \nor her constituents recently about the need for the economy to create \nmore jobs. It is a staple of the Presidential race. It is what the \nAmerican people are talking about. We know the energy incentives in \nthis bill will induce and boost industries like the coal community in \nmy State and put people to work.\n  There is nothing wrong with that. Passing this bill and these energy \namendments will give us all a chance to put our money where our mouth \nis.\n  Congress has been playing political football with an energy bill for \nyears now. I think it is time to end the game. Many of us would prefer \nto pass a stand-alone energy bill. We have been trying and trying, with \nno effect. But for one reason or another, this bill has not passed, and \nthis is probably our last and best shot to pass changes that will make \na difference right away to our Nation and to our economy.\n  Finally, and most importantly, this is a national security issue. We \nall talk the talk when it comes to promoting America's energy \nindependence and reducing our reliance on foreign oil and sources of \nenergy. Here is a chance to actually do something about that. By \nbeating this amendment and passing the base bill, we will provide a \nsignificant boost to domestic energy production.\n  We have a lot of problems in Iraq, but we cannot bury our head in the \nsand. We have to recognize that continuing to rely on energy supplies \nfrom that part of the world is a threat to our national security. We \ncannot change that overnight. We can start taking the first steps now \nby passing the energy tax provisions and stepping up domestic \nproduction.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the McCain amendment. As a member of both the \nEnergy Committee and the Finance Committee, I helped write the energy \nincentives in this bill. The incentives are good legislation and will \nhelp our economy. Our workers and our country need this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan, Ms. Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I also rise to oppose this amendment. I \nfirst wish to thank those involved in the underlying bill and the tax \nbill for focusing on major provisions for manufacturing. I thank both \nthe Senator from Iowa, the chairman, and the Senator from Montana, for \ntheir leadership on this bill.\n  These tax credits in this bill relate directly to support for \nmanufacturing. It is very important that the energy tax credits for \nconsumers that are in this bill be passed so that we can lower purchase \nprices for vehicles and energy-efficient appliances and be able to help \nbuild market demand for more efficient, environmentally beneficial \ncars, appliances, and other products.\n  Many of these credits are for consumers to help lower the prices \nbecause we know until there is a large demand and large production, the \nprices initially will be high. That is the reason for the hybrid \nvehicle tax credit for consumers, alternative fuel vehicle credits for \nconsumers, and fuel cell credits.\n  The Federal Government must partner with American businesses and \nconsumers to encourage the development, purchase, and use of energy-\nefficient technologies, and that is what is done through these energy \ntax credits.\n  All of us want our automobiles to be more fuel efficient--and \ncertainly, as we look at the skyrocketing gas prices, this has never \nbeen more clear--so we can be less reliant on foreign sources of energy \nas well, but we need to be doing those things that will encourage the \nproduction of alternative fuel vehicles to move us away from that \ndependency on foreign sources of energy.\n\n  U.S. automakers have already invested hundreds of millions of dollars \nin developing better, cleaner technologies. For example, a hybrid \nversion of the Ford Escape SUV, which has a fuel economy of 40 miles \nper gallon, will be available to consumers the end of this summer. It \nis very important that we put this in place as part of supporting that \nnew effort. A hybrid electric version of the GM Sierra full-size pickup \ntruck will also be available to consumers this year. And \nDaimlerChrysler will be producing a hybrid version of the Dodge Ram \npickup truck starting this year as well.\n  These moves into alternative fuel vehicles are part of the way we \nmove away from foreign oil dependence. We need to partner to help \ncreate that market and help give consumers the ability to purchase \nthese vehicles in order to make them available. Developing fuel cells \nand other more fuel-efficient technologies really does require a \npartnership with the Federal Government and with industry. In order to \nachieve maximum fuel efficiency, the Federal Government must take the \nrole as partner, along with our companies, engineers, and workers, to \nmake this happen. That is what the energy tax credits for fuel-\nefficient vehicles in this bill do.\n  I should also indicate that it is necessary to invest in \ninfrastructure, such\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\nas hydrogen refueling stations, to support the development of fuel cell \ntechnology. Again, there are tax credits in this bill that allow that \nto happen.\n  There are other important provisions, of course, for ethanol, of \nwhich I am very supportive, as well as the efforts to address energy-\nefficient appliances. Again, we have consumer tax credits in this bill \nto help encourage the purchase and the development of energy-efficient \nappliances as well as items related to the home.\n  Mr. President, I will strongly oppose this amendment, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join in a bipartisan way to defeat it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana. As \nalways, he is generous in yielding to other Members on these issues. I \nalso join the previous two speakers in opposing the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The energy tax incentives that are part of this bill is a package of \nincentives that we reported out of the Finance Committee and added to \nthe Energy bill essentially in the same form we have in the 107th \nCongress, and we have done it again in the 108th Congress. It is my \nstrong belief that there is broad bipartisan support in the Senate for \nthis set of energy tax provisions.\n  I cannot tell you that every single one of them is exactly as I would \nwant it to be, but there are incentives to encourage more use of \nrenewable energy, to encourage continued production of oil and gas and \nincrease production in some cases, to provide incentives for a shift \ntoward more use of hybrid cars and advance vehicles. All of those items \nare positive.\n  As far as renewable energy is concerned, one very important provision \ncontained in this bill that relates to my State and many States is the \nextension of the tax credit--1.8 cents per kilowatt hour tax credit--\nfor wind energy and other types of renewable energy. There are many \nwind energy projects that are ready to go around this country; people \nare waiting to see whether Congress will go ahead and extend this \nproduction tax credit for renewable energy that covers them. I think \nthis is a good policy. We need to do that as part of this bill.\n  There are other provisions that provide incentives for energy-\nefficient homes, energy-efficient commercial buildings. They provide \nincentives for efficient appliances, smart meters which consumers can \nuse to reduce their use of energy. There are a great many provisions in \nthis bill that I believe would be useful and would move us in the right \ndirection.\n  This is not a silver bullet. This does not solve our energy problems. \nI do not want to represent that to anyone. These are, on balance, very \npositive actions that we can take, and this clearly, in my mind, is \nsome of the most useful language that we are proposing to enact as part \nof this overall bill.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to speak. I appreciate my \ncolleagues allowing me to go ahead of them, particularly the Senator \nfrom Idaho, who yielded time to me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona, in his amendment, suggests \nto those of us listening and to those who might be observing us on C-\nSPAN that the oil industry is the most profitable industry in the \ncountry and somehow we are subsidizing them beyond reality or respect.\n  Let me tell you what the oil industry did this last quarter.\n  Their net earnings went up .6 percent to 6.9 percent. That was their \nnet earnings. It is much more profitable owning a Starbucks on the \nstreet corner than it is to own a major oil company in America today. \nHe did not say that the profit margins of the banking industry are 19.6 \npercent return on investment. So let us get real and, most importantly, \nlet us be honest.\n  Let's talk about section 29, the synthetic fuels. What was just \nrepresented by the Senator from Arizona is not in this bill. What is in \nthis bill, if one deals with synthetics, is there has to be a reduction \nin the stocks and the NOX by 20 percent or there has to be a \nreduction in mercury by 20 percent to qualify for the tax credits in \nthis provision. That is the reality of what we are talking about.\n  If we want to get America producing again, if we want to satisfy the \nconsumer who in anger paid over $2 at the pump today, then we have to \nincentivize an investment community to get back into the business of \nproducing.\n  Fifteen years ago, there were 325 refineries in America. Today, there \nare less than 125. Why? Too much regulation, too much cost, going \noffshore. How do we get them back? Incentivize them to come home; \nincentivize them to begin to produce in this country. Because of \nGovernment regulations and costs, they either go offshore to produce or \nthey quit producing.\n  America's refineries today are at 94-percent capacity. What this tax \nincentive does is incentivizes our country to get back into the \nbusiness of producing.\n  Want to incentivize offshore deep oil drilling? When we did that for \nthe gulf a decade ago, production went up 500 percent. Why? Because it \nwas terribly expensive to drill out there, and so we said if they drill \nout there and if they find oil, they can write this off.\n  Our country relies on almost 30 percent of our capacity now in the \ngulf and in the deep waters. It worked for America and it worked for \nAmerica's consumers.\n  So to suggest we are doing something wrong is not representing the \nreality of the energy sector of this country today as a piece of our \neconomy and our willingness to incentivize it. That is why we are here. \nThat is why this provision is in the FSC bill and that is why the \nMcCain amendment ought to be rejected.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5190-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5190-S5191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nVISIT TO THE SENATE BY MEMBERS OF SUMMIT OF NATIONAL CONGRESSES OF THE \n                    AMERICAS ON FREEDOM OF THE PRESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 5 minutes to the senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for \ntheir kindness and generosity as we work on this bill. I am speaking \nnow of the energy tax parts of this bill. The rest of it is the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee, and they essentially have done \nthat. We have helped with the energy provisions because we were trying \nto put together a comprehensive energy package.\n  It is good that in the Senate, after one Senator talks and states his \nposition, there is an opportunity for somebody else to state their \nposition, and I want to do that because actually earlier today the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona talked about a bill that I do not \neven recognize, talked about things wrong with this bill that I am not \neven sure are in this bill, but certainly failed to mention anything \nthat is good about it. So I would like to talk about some of the good \nparts.\n  It is estimated that this part of the bill will create 650,000 jobs. \nThose jobs will be in construction and the operation of infrastructure \nvital to the energy security of this country. Tax provisions will allow \nus to build an Alaska pipeline, which is supported by the Senate and \nwill bring us American-owned gas all the way from Alaska. It will not \ndo any environmental damage, and in the next 5 years we will add \nsubstantially to our inventory of natural gas.\n  The package provides incentives for electricity produced from clean \ncoal. If there is anything that we need in America, it is a vital, \ngrowing, prospering energy grid in the United States. We have to have a \nstronger energy grid if we are going to have a stronger America. \nEverybody says that. This bill provides for incentives so that will \nhappen.\n  Third, this package puts incentives in for biomass, geothermal, and \nsolar.\n  Last, but not least, we have the renewables. We have wind energy that \nis to break and come through in large quantity. It is all stopped now \nuntil this bill passes and the incentives in this bill are adopted.\n  If you have a major solar energy facility, construction is stopped \nuntil this bill is produced. Then that will grow faster than any \nrenewable we have ever had. In addition, clean coal technology is \napplied so that we can have other alternatives for the production of \nelectricity. If there is anything we need, it is alternatives. Clean \ncoal will be an alternative.\n  If we tell the world we are producing alternatives, they will believe \nwe are worried and they will believe we can do something for ourselves, \ninstead of continuing to put our hands out and rely upon foreign \nsources of energy.\n  There are tax provisions related to the restructuring of the \nelectricity industry that are being imposed by the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission. It is absolutely imperative that if the \nGovernment forces utilities to sell assets as part of deregulation, it \nwill not also turn around and punish utilities for those sales through \nthe Tax Code.\n  Some of the critical incentives in this package that will encourage \ndomestic oil and gas production are in this bill. We know it. Everybody \nwho has studied it knows it. There may be some provisions that Senators \ndo not like because when you put a package together you just cannot \nhave everybody liking everything. But I submit, to come here with a \nTime magazine that was talking about a different bill and a different \ntime--there are things that are alluded to that are not in this bill--\nis truly not something the Senate should bank on with reference to \nwhether they vote for this. They ought to vote for this. It is half an \nenergy package and it is better than none.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are dealing with an issue that is \nprobably the most important that we have before us, in terms of jobs, \nin terms of meeting the needs in this country. We are dealing with an \nissue we have talked about for 2 years or more. We have finally come up \nwith some solutions. This is an issue that has already been on the \nfloor that passed with 58 positive votes. The Senator from Arizona \nindicated it hasn't been discussed or talked about or voted on. That is \nabsolutely not the case. It has been, and that is where we are.\n  There are two major issues involved. I am not going to get into the \ndetails. We are creating a policy for our future energy needs. As we \nlook around at our families and our businesses and everything we do, \nthere is nothing that affects our lives all day long more than energy. \nWhether it is lights, whether it is air-conditioning, whether it is \nheat, whether it is cars, whether it is receiving goods in your \ncommunity, that all takes energy. So we are developing a policy, not \nnecessarily for what is going to happen next week or next year, but \ndown the road, where are we going to be?\n  The second portion deals with some of the issues that are troublesome \nnow: The price of fuel, and the idea we are going to run short on some \nof the kinds of fuel we are using. All those things are there. This was \npart of an energy bill. It is not all of it, but it is a good part of \nit that we have worked on for a very long time. It is backed up by the \nfacts. Unfortunately, to say we talked about no facts, here that is not \ntrue. This is a broad policy, for one thing, that deals with \nalternative sources of energy. It deals with renewables, the \ncleanliness of coal, with pipelines. It deals with all those things \nthat are so important to do this job.\n\n  One thing that always strikes me, probably because we in Wyoming are \nthe largest coal producer in the country, is that coal is the largest \nfossil fuel resource that we have available to us. At the same time, \nsome other things have been easier. All the electric-generating plants \nover the last 15 years use natural gas. Natural gas can be used for \nmany things where coal really is only available for this purpose, coal \nand nuclear. But we want to make coal energy clean so the air will be \nclean. This is what this bill does. It allows us to use that fuel most \navailable to us and have it for the future.\n  We have been taking a look at energy usage, and what strikes us is \nthat consumption continues to go up at a rather fast rate. We are using \nmore in our cars; we have bigger homes; we are doing things so that \nconsumption of energy goes up. But the production level is going down. \nIf that doesn't create some kind of crisis in the future, I don't know \nwhat possibly could.\n  It was mentioned, and it should be mentioned again, that this is a \njobs bill. That is really what we are trying to do. We can create more \njobs in this particular provision, not only immediate jobs for the \ndevelopment of nuclear powerplants or power lines or coal mines or \nwhatever, but the jobs created for other industries, of course, have to \nhave energy available for them.\n  The amendment proposed here certainly would do away with one of the \nmost important things we have done for a good long time, something we \nhave worked on for a good long time,\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\nsomething that not only deals immediately with problems but addresses \nthe future of our families, yours and ours, and jobs. So we ought not \npass this amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the press and some in this body have \nunfairly defined this legislation as a ``porky'' tax bill. There have \nbeen articles in all the major papers following that line of attack.\n  One Member of the leadership on the other side said on April 20 he is \nworried that the sheer amount of tax breaks in the bill could end up \nimpeding its progress. ``They've loaded this truck up and the tires are \nabout to explode,'' he said, calling the efforts to pile sweeteners \nonto the bill ``haphazard.''\n  That Member went on and cautioned, ``any time you load it up as \nvigorously as they have, you create as many problems as you solve.''\n  Well, let's talk about the so-called ``porky'' provisions in this \nbill. It is a bit irritating that the complaints come from folks who \nsay they support the bill. Every provision in the bill is the result of \na joint recommendation of myself and Senator Baucus. We responded to \nrequests from every Senator, including those who are critical of the \nbill.\n  I guess I would ask anyone, including the critics a question. That \nquestion would be, ``Are you willing to throw aside the provision you \nasked us to put in the bill?'' Are you willing to go back to your \nconstituents and tell them you don't think their interest has merit?\n  I don't think I will hear any of the critics respond yes. I haven't \nhad any takers yet and don't think I will by the time the bill's done.\n  Let's look at the bigger picture.\n  This bill has about $60 billion dedicated to the replacement of the \nFSC/ETI benefit. This bill has another $40 billion dedicated to \ninternational tax reforms to make our domestic manufacturers more \ncompetitive overseas.\n  There is another roughly $20 billion in domestic manufacturing \nincentives, including the research and development tax credit.\n  Some of that package deals with issues such as the unfair tax on bows \nand arrows which has a domestic job impact. There's another $8 billion \ndealing with the extenders, including a permanent tax credit directed \nat hiring hard-to-place workers. There's another $10 billion dealing \nwith housing, rural areas, hard hit urban areas, Indian tribes, and \nother sectors of our economy. We're directing resources at economic \ndevelopment, plain and simple.\n  Finally, there's another almost $20 billion for the bipartisan \nFinance Committee energy incentives package which has passed the Senate \ntwice.\n  All of this is offset with corporate loophole closers and measures \naimed at curtailing tax shelters. The dollars involved in the much-\ncriticized provisions are very small--perhaps less than 3 percent of \nthe total cost of the bill. Members and the ``big city'' press need to \nkeep their eyes on the ball: ending the euro tax and helping domestic \nmanufacturers.\n  Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan responded to the New York Times \nregarding the 1997 bipartisan tax relief bill. The press had made much \nof a few narrow provisions, such as a provision to provide tax relief \nfor parachuter trainees. There is an excise tax on air travel. The tax \nis meant to apply to commercial travel. Read literally, the tax applied \nto parachute training flights even though those flights are not \ncommercial transportation.\n   Senator Moynihan described the Finance Committee provisions that \nwere designed to deal with these inequities this way: ``You will never \nsee representative government more specific than in the Senate Finance \nCommittee . . . It's a form of accommodation, and in between you think \nabout the national interest, because there are things we all share.''\n   Like the 1997 tax relief bill, the bill before us includes a number \nof provisions that, at face value, may seem to be trivial. It is \nimportant to keep in mind, however, that each of these provisions was \nadded in response to specific requests from fellow Senators who are \nlooking out for the vital interests of their constituents. That is what \nrepresentative government is all about.\n   The Federal tax system is vast. It touches virtually every aspect of \nlife. From birth to grave. There are excise taxes to fund our airports \nand highways. There is a corporate and individual income tax to fund \ndefense and general welfare. There are payroll taxes to fund Social \nSecurity and Medicare benefits. There is an unemployment payroll tax to \nfund unemployment benefits.\n   Now, when you go through this bill, you can find some provisions \nthat involve animal manure or windmills. If you don't look beyond the \nsuperficial humor of the subject matter, you can have a lot of fun. Of \ncourse, big city papers like to make fun of these rural provisions. I \nalways have to remind these folks that food doesn't grow in \nsupermarkets. It grows on farms. The byproducts of those farms can give \nus clean energy. What's so bad about that?\n   Part of what we hear out in the heartland is get us some insurance \nthat jobs are coming back. Especially, they say, in the area of \nmanufacturing. The economy is coming back. The U.S. economy, the \nmightiest in the history of the planet, is adding jobs at a healthy \nrate. The people want an insurance policy.\n   Growing jobs in our diverse economy is not a cookie cutter exercise. \nThis bill has general policies for the most part. Some are proactive, \nlike the manufacturing deduction. Others are reactive, like responding \nto the Euro tax. Still others are particular. They may relate to small \nisolated communities or a single industry. When you take a look you'll \nfind a common thread through nearly all of them: job creation.\n   That is what this bill is all about. Creating jobs, plain and \nsimple.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 6 minutes 44 seconds, and \nthe proponents have 8 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 3 minutes 22 seconds to the Senator from \nDelaware, and 3 minutes 22 seconds to the Senator from Alaska following \nthe Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 3 \nminutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator for yielding me 3 minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. President, as we gather for this debate, about 60 percent of the \noil we use in this country comes from other places. We are importing \nall that oil. It adds to a huge trade deficit, about $500 billion and \ngrowing. About a third of that trade deficit is related to the \nimportation of oil.\n  We have the opportunity with the energy provisions that are part of \nthis bill to do some good things with respect to energy independence in \nthis country. We have the opportunity to urge people to buy more \nenergy-efficient cars, trucks, and vans. We have the opportunity to \nnurture an automotive industry which will provide fuel-cell-powered \nvehicles that will provide for vehicles that are powered by a \ncombination of electric and internal combustion--maybe a combination of \ndiesel and electric. We have the opportunity to provide incentives for \npeople to use solar energy more frequently and more effectively, to use \ngeothermal energy more effectively, more broadly. We have the \nopportunity to encourage people to use wind power as a source of \nelectricity, and other forms of energy, through this bill.\n  Some would say we ought to have a comprehensive energy bill, and \nthese elements ought to be part of the comprehensive energy bill. I \nwill tell you I don't know if we are going to have a chance to debate a \ncomprehensive energy bill. We do have the opportunity today to \nencourage solar energy, wind power, fuel cells, hybrid vehicles, and we \nhave a chance to do this today.\n  About 100 miles from here there are fields on the Delmarva \nPeninsula--in Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia--where we are growing \nsoybeans. We use soybeans in my part of America to feed the chickens. \nWe take the hull and we feed the chickens and raise more chickens in \nDelaware, I think, than anyplace in the country. We use the corn we \nraise to feed the chickens. We have a lot of soybean oil we don't know \nwhat to do with, and one of the things we figured out to do is take \nsoybean oil and mix it with diesel fuel--80-percent\n\n[[Page S5193]]\n\ndiesel, 20-percent soybean oil--and we use it to power our DelDOT \nvehicles in the State of Delaware. We use it to power more farm \nequipment in the State of Delaware that is diesel power.\n  It works, it is energy efficient, and it is environmentally friendly. \nPeople tell me it smells like french fries.\n  That is one of the things we are more likely do with this bill. The \nintent and encouragement of this bill is to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil and move to biofuels, including soy diesel. Good results \ncome out of using soybeans for this purpose. It reduces our reliance on \nforeign oil, it is environmentally friendly, and it gives the folks who \nare raising soybeans--whether it is Delaware, Idaho, or any other \nplace--the opportunity to have another market for their commodity. That \nis good for farmers, actually paying them to grow a commodity rather \nthan paying them not to do that. This makes a whole lot of sense.\n  I wish the Senator from Arizona in offering his amendment had focused \non section 29. That is a more narrowly crafted amendment. My hope is \nthis will be defeated and we may reconsider it and come back to address \nthat.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we talk about energy all the time. \nThere is a certain, not confusion but a real consternation about what \nis going on in the Senate right now and why we can't get specific \nprovisions of the Energy bill through the Senate.\n  We understand energy in Alaska, whether it is gas or whether it is \noil, whether it is renewable energy or thermal. What we have before us \nis an opportunity to make some of the energy policy a reality in the \ncountry.\n  Last week I had the opportunity to testify before the House \nSubcommittee on Energy and Air Quality about the proposed Alaskan \nnatural gas pipeline. I talked about the role which this pipeline can \nplay in meeting the needs of some very critical areas in the country--\nspecifically, our national security, the health of our economy, job \ncreation, and achieving and maintaining a healthy environment for \nourselves and our families.\n  Whether we are talking about the creation of hundreds of thousands of \njobs across the Nation from this project or providing a secure and \nstable domestic supply of energy, whether it is providing the critical \nfeedstock we have heard about on the floor here today at a reasonable \nprice for the chemical, agricultural, and other important sectors of \nthe economy or providing an abundance of clean-burning, environmentally \nfriendly fuel, there is no doubt about it, this project is not only in \nthe best interests of Alaska, my State, but across the entire country.\n  As we talk about the project in Alaska, it has been suggested with \nthe price of natural gas as it is, we don't need to have the incentives \nthat are included in this legislation before us right now. With the \nspecific proposals which are pending, why do we need the incentive? \nYes, in fact, the proposals are out there, but they will tell you we \nneed the assistance. They have stressed the necessity of Congress \nenacting the fiscal incentives contained in this bill in order for \nconstruction of the pipeline to go forward.\n\n  We need these provisions to achieve all of the positives a gas \npipeline has to offer. It is essentially a futures contract with the \nAmerican people. We provide the incentive to build the pipeline and you \nwill receive all the benefits the gas pipeline has to offer. The Alaska \nnatural gas pipeline is one of those rare examples of a project that is \na win from every perspective. It helps us achieve our environmental \ngoals, it helps the economy by creating a great number of good-paying \njobs, and it enhances our national security. But if the McCain \namendment is adopted and the energy tax provisions are stripped from \nthis bill, the relief Alaska's natural gas can provide remains stuck in \nthe ground.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the McCain amendment and retain the \nfinancial incentives needed to construct the Alaska natural gas \npipeline.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time \nis yielded.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The results was announced--yeas 13, nays 85, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 89 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--13\n\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Corzine\n     Dodd\n     Feingold\n     Graham (FL)\n     Gregg\n     Hollings\n     Kennedy\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     McCain\n     Sununu\n\n                                NAYS--85\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n       \n  The amendment (No. 3129) was rejected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe disposition of the Hollings amendment, the next amendments to be \noffered are the following in the order provided: Senator Kyl, No. 3127, \n60 minutes equally divided; Senator Landrieu, 60 minutes equally \ndivided; Senator Levin, 20 minutes equally divided; further, that there \nbe no second-degree amendments in order to the amendments prior to the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as has been ordered, after the Hollings \namendment, there are three more. I am not sure any votes are needed on \nthe three amendments the chairman just mentioned, by Senators Kyl, \nLandrieu, and Levin. We have times, but we are trying to work with the \nSenators. For example, it is my understanding that the Kyl amendment \nwill be offered and withdrawn. We may be able to work out the others as \nwell. Nevertheless, that is the order.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenators from Pennsylvania, the senior and the junior Senators, have 5 \nminutes apiece to discuss something very personal to their State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, is recognized.\n\n\n                             Murder in Iraq\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a death in \nIraq. There has been a lot of death in Iraq. We can all come to the \nfloor and give a story about a brave man or woman who sacrificed their \nlife for freedom in that country. Today I rise to talk about not a \nsoldier who has bravely fought in battle over there but a civilian who \nwas brutally murdered by a group of al-Qaida terrorists. We are now \nseeing this displayed on our television screens across America.\n  This civilian's name is Berg, Nicholas Berg. He is 26 years old, from \nWest\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\nChester, PA, outside of Philadelphia. As described by an AP article \nthat came across my desk, a group of five al-Qaida terrorists, one of \nthem purporting to be Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the No. 2 man of the \nIslamic terrorist group, wearing ski masks and scarfs, standing over \nMr. Berg, who had just given a statement as to who he was and where he \nwas from. They read a statement and then proceeded to push this man on \nhis side and to cut off his head with a large knife, and then they held \nthe head out before the camera.\n  If anybody wants to know what we are fighting and why we are fighting \nthis war on terror, this is a very good example of it. Those who have \nseen the tape on television have described it as revolting and \nsickening, and I will describe it as an outrage to the civilized world, \nand one to which we must strongly condemn and respond. We must continue \nto respond as aggressively as possible in rooting out these terrorist \ncells and going after them where they are. Where they are, in this \ncase, is in Iraq. This occurred in Iraq. He was a civilian contractor \nworking in Iraq. His body was found a couple of days ago on a bridge in \nIraq.\n  First and foremost, I express my sympathy to his parents, Michael and \nSuzanne, who I know have gone through a very harrowing experience over \nthe past couple of months when they didn't know where their son was on \nmore than one occasion. They did not know his whereabouts for the past \nmonth. And to find out about this tragedy, the loss of their son, in \nsuch a violent and horrific way and to not know until, I am sure, \nseeing it on television and hearing it described, is a nightmare for \nany parent.\n  The Bergs certainly have my prayers and I know all in this Chamber \nshare the sorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Santorum, in \nexpressing sympathy for the parents and family of Mr. Nick Berg, who \nwas the victim of a brutal assassination. Actually, it was a \ndecapitation.\n  It is hard to express the shock of this kind of barbaric conduct. It \nis subhuman what they did--taking a video of this man, who identifies \nhimself, identifies his mother, his father, his siblings, and then, in \nview of the video, they decapitate him, with the anguish of a man being \nbrutally murdered. It is just subhuman conduct.\n  We ought to put on notice these murderers, assassins, that whatever \nit takes, the civilized world will bring them to justice. The news \nreports are that they were wearing masks and hoods to conceal their \nidentities. I have seen investigations succeed even where people were \nwearing masks and hoods. They will talk about it, or someone will talk \nabout it. In a cruel, barbaric world, this conduct descends to new \nlevels.\n  This incident will unleash as intensive a manhunt as has ever been \nwitnessed, with the United States leading the way--obviously, because \nit is an American citizen from a Philadelphia suburban town. We will be \njoined by all of the civilized world in bringing these malefactors, \nthese perpetrators to justice. Just because they are wearing hoods, \nbecause their identities are disguised, doesn't mean they cannot be \nidentified and apprehended. I know every last thing will be done to \nbring them to justice.\n  And then, beyond the identification of these specific assassins, \nthese specific terrorists will renew our determination, which is \nalready at the 100-percent level, to bring the terrorists to justice. \nThey already murdered thousands of Americans on September 11, 2001, and \nIraq is a magnet for terrorists from all over the area.\n  This underscores the necessity to confront the terrorists in Iraq. If \nwe don't confront them there, we will be doing it again in the United \nStates.\n  This is an incident which will receive enormous attention to try to \ndetermine the perpetrators and to bring them to justice.\n  There are some other matters which have been suggested as to Mr. Nick \nBerg's being in custody, one report taken into custody by the Iraqis \nand held by U.S. military personnel. I am advised a lawsuit was \nstarted, and then Mr. Berg was released. We are now making an effort to \nidentify the attorneys in the matter to try to get some background \nbefore we talk to the parents and the relatives of the victim of this \natrocious conduct.\n  There is also a question of bringing back the remains of Mr. Berg. We \nshall do our best to facilitate that and to help the family.\n  This atrocity is obviously going to receive widespread attention. In \na cruel, brutal world, this descends to new depths.\n  Again, our sympathy to the parents. We will pursue the matter to \nbring these specific perpetrators to justice and to bring the \nterrorists to justice, generally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3134\n\n(Purpose: To strike the international tax provisions that are unrelated \n to the FSC/ETI repeal and eliminate the phase-in of the deduction for \n                qualified production activities income)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3134 and ask \nthe clerk to report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3134.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 40 minutes to each side.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, the underlying bill gives a 5-percent domestic \nmanufacturing deduction to the manufacturing industry. Of course, that \nis woefully insufficient. My amendment would provide a full 9-percent \ndomestic manufacturing deduction.\n  The underlying bill slowly phases in the domestic manufacturing \nprovision over a 5-year period, but instantly it gets the full effect \nof the overseas industry, the outsourcing. They immediately get some \ntax breaks over the period of the bill covering some 39, almost 40 \nbillion bucks.\n  Can you imagine that? Here is a bill entitled--this is the committee \nreport--the Jump-Start Our Business Strength, JOBS, Act. It jump-starts \nthe jobs in Shanghai and Guadalajara and not in Philadelphia, PA, I can \ntell you that right now.\n  What my amendment does is provide the right incentives. It eliminates \nthe tax breaks for corporations that have moved American jobs offshore \nand gives those tax breaks to the employers of jobs in America today.\n  I wish to thank, first, the distinguished ranking member, Senator \nBaucus, of our Finance Committee and his outstanding staff. They have \nbeen very helpful in trying to make this amendment not only relevant \nbut budget neutral. I am not sure about its budget neutrality, but I am \ntold now we do have a relevant amendment. If we have to get into the \narcane discussion with respect to budget neutrality, I will be glad to \njoin it.\n  I want to get to the point. We are still in a post-World War II \nculture, what they call up here an environment or pedigree. What \nhappened was, after World War II, we had our finest hour with the \nMarshall plan. We sent money overseas. We sent expertise overseas. We \nsent equipment overseas. In the cold war, capitalism defeated \ncommunism. It worked. All during that almost 50-year period since World \nWar II, we all enjoyed it because we fudged when it came to trade. We \ntreated fair trade more or less as foreign aid, but we knew what we \nwere doing. We had to sacrifice a certain amount of our industry, our \njobs, our economic strength to prevail in this cold war.\n  Now what has occurred is the competition has regeared, they have \nrebuilt, they have industrialized, and they have become outlandishly \ncompetitive. And here amidst a trade war, we hear those in the national \nCongress running around and saying: Woo, we might start a trade war; \nfree trade, free trade, I am for free trade, when they know free trade \nis like dry water. There is no such thing. If you trade, you are \ntrading something, you are\n\n[[Page S5195]]\n\nswapping an article with various countries, free trade, but we know \nthat is not going to come to pass.\n  The example we set of a capitalistic free market and our endeavor in \nthe last 50 years, the Japanese did not follow suit. They have the \nfinancing, they have the subsidies, they have the nontariff barriers, \nand we have yet to get into downtown Tokyo with American sales. Come \non, quit kidding each other. It worked that way for Japan. Korea \nfollowed. And now China is following the same Japanese pattern of \nrestricted and competitive trade, not free trade.\n  Today we are in real trouble. We are losing jobs like gangbusters \noverseas. We have lost 68,000 jobs in the little State of South \nCarolina in the last 3 years, over 3 million jobs nationally. I can \ntell you, 58,000 of those jobs are our textile jobs, and they are not \ngoing to be replaced. You can put all this statistical information from \nthe Federal Reserve and Greenspan about how we are creating jobs, but \nthey are not coming to South Carolina.\n  As Abraham Lincoln said some years ago: The dogmas of the quiet path \nare inadequate to the stormy present. As our case is new, we must think \nanew, we must act anew, we must disenthrall ourselves, and then working \ntogether we can save our Nation. That is the reason for this amendment.\n  One does not put up an amendment to this finance bill with hope. The \nchairman of the Finance Committee knows there are not going to be any \namendments. But we might be able to disenthrall our colleagues because \nthe country has to develop a competitive trade policy in order to \nsubsist and survive.\n  I can point out survival in the very beginning of this Nation started \nwith Alexander Hamilton. Of course, I will not read the book--Ron \nChernow's ``Alexander Hamilton.'' They will not give me that much time, \nbut I recommend to everyone this particular edition. You will find the \nmother country, England, prevented manufacture in the Colonies, later \nthe United States of America. In fact, they arrested and jailed anyone \nwith any manufacturing talent who would move from England to the \nColonies.\n  We had a veritable struggle in the earliest days, and we had just \nbarely 1 hour of freedom when the mother country said: Under this David \nRicardo doctrine of comparative advantage, we will trade with you what \nyou produce best and you trade back with us what we produce best.\n  As a result, Alexander Hamilton wrote his famous treatise, ``Report \non Manufacturers.'' I will not read that and put it in the Record, but \nI will say in a phrase exactly what Hamilton told the Brits: Bug off. \nHe told the Brits, we are not going to remain your colony, shipping you \nour timber, iron ore, rice, cotton, indigo, and natural resources, and \nimporting the manufactured articles and remaining a banana republic; we \nare going to build up our own manufacturing.\n  It caused me to listen to our friend Akio Morita, the former head of \nSony. Some 20 years ago in Chicago, while lecturing third world \ncountries, he said you have to develop a strong manufacturing sector in \norder to become a nation state. Then he pointed to me and said: \nSenator, that world power that loses its manufacturing capacity will \ncease to be a world power.\n  It is economic strength that counts in this terrorism war. It is \ndiplomacy. It is negotiation. It is not military strength. We have to \ndisenthrall ourselves and realize when we are going around talking \nabout we might start a trade war, it was Hamilton himself and the \nUnited States of America some 228 years ago that started the trade war.\n  The very first bill--well, Pat Moynihan used to correct me on that. \nHe said the first was a resolution for the United States Seal. So let's \nsay the second bill that passed this Congress in its history on July 4, \n1789, was a tariff bill, protectionism, a 50-percent tariff on 60 \ndifferent articles. We started a trade war.\n  When Abraham Lincoln was President, they were going to build a \ntranscontinental railroad. They said, we are going to get the steel \nfrom England. President Lincoln said, we are going to build our own \nsteel plants, and he put import restrictions on that British steel and \nwe built the steel plants.\n  When Franklin Roosevelt was President in the darkest days of the \nDepression, we did not practice any comparative advantage. He put on \nthe most successful initiative ever with import quotas and subsidies \nfor America's agriculture. That farm crowd that is now heading up our \nFinance Committee gets $180 billion worth of all kinds of subsidies. \nThen they run around here and tell this poor little textile Senator, \nprotectionism, protectionism, you are going to start a trade war.\n  We do not get a subsidy. We do not have those things the farmers \nhave. I favor what the farmers have, I say in the same breath. I vote \nfor it because I think it is a very successful program.\n  President Eisenhower, in the mid-1950s, put on oil import quotas. \nYes, John F. Kennedy--I sat there with Andy Hatcher and we would grind \nout the mimeograph machine--and we got the seven-point Kennedy textile \nprogram of restrictions on textile imports in 1961.\n  Who else other than Ronald Reagan, the best of the best, he put \nimport quotas on steel, machine tools, semiconductors, motorcycles. \nLast night, I was near Myrtle Beach and they told me there were 100,000 \nmotorcyclists--I think I ran into 99,000 of them out on the highway--\nbut do my colleagues remember what old Ronnie Reagan did? He started a \ntrade war of motorcycles. He put a 50-percent import tariff on \nmotorcycles. Harley Davidson now has recovered its health and we have \nthem all running up and down the beach at Myrtle Beach, SC. So do not \ncome now and tell me about starting a trade war.\n  We have had that trade war and we know simply and clearly what \nhappens. I want to read starting on page 20 of ``Theodore Rex'' by \nEdmund Morris, because this is so interesting. I will read what \nprotectionism did at the turn of the century, this is under Teddy \nRoosevelt, when we did not have an income tax. For the first 100 and \nsome years, we financed this great United States of America with \nprotectionism. I am trying to get that through so this crowd will wake \nup and quit pulling off this charade of the multinationals, because \nthat is who we are facing. We are facing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nthe Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nConference Board, the United Federation of Independent Businesses. The \nnewspapers make a majority of their money on retail advertising and \ngrind out this free trade, free trade, do not let us start a trade war.\n\n  Well, here is what the trade war gave us:\n\n       This first year of the new century found her worth twenty-\n     five billion dollars more than her nearest rival, Great \n     Britain, with a gross national product more than twice that \n     of Germany and Russia. The United States was already so rich \n     in goods and services that she was more self-sustaining than \n     any industrial power in history. . . .\n       More than half of the world's cotton, corn, copper, and oil \n     flowed from the American cornucopia, and at least one-third \n     of all steel, iron, silver, and gold.\n\n  Here we are having trouble manufacturing steel. We were exporting \none-third of the world's steel.\n\n       Even if the United States were not so blessed with raw \n     materials, the excellence of her manufactured products \n     guaranteed her dominance of world markets. Current \n     advertisements in British magazines gave the impression that \n     the typical Englishman woke to the ring of an Ingersoll \n     alarm, shaved with a Gillette razor, combed his hair with \n     Vaseline tonic, buttoned his Arrow shirt, hurried downstairs \n     for Quaker Oats, California Figs and Maxwell House coffee, \n     commuted in a Westinghouse tram (body by Fisher), rose to his \n     office in an Otis elevator, and worked all day with his \n     Waterman pen under the efficient glare of Edison light bulbs. \n     ``It only remains,'' one Fleet Street wag suggested, ``for \n     [us] to take American coal to Newcastle.'' Behind the joke \n     lay real concern: the United States was already supplying \n     beer to Germany, pottery to Bohemia, and oranges to Valencia.\n       As a result of this billowing surge in productivity, Wall \n     Street was awash with foreign capital. Carnegie calculated \n     that America could afford to buy the entire United Kingdom, \n     and settle Britain's national debt in the bargain. For the \n     first time in history, transatlantic money currents were \n     thrusting more powerfully westward than east. Even the Bank \n     of England had begun to borrow money on Wall Street. New York \n     City seemed destined to replace London as the world's \n     financial center.\n\n  Well, in the year 2004, we are broke. We have come from the greatest \ncreditor nation to the greatest debtor nation. The Japanese are \nfinancing over $460 billion of my deficit. The Chinese are financing my \ndebt--not me financing any other country like we started\n\n[[Page S5196]]\n\nwith protectionism. The Chinese have over $200 billion of my deficit. \nWe will end up this year in September, in a few short months, with a \ndeficit that will approximate $700 billion.\n  We are spending around $2 billion a day more than we are taking in. \nCan you imagine that? In the early 1980s when I talked about budget \nmatters, I spoke about how it took us 200 years of our history to get \nto $1 trillion in debt. The cost of the Revolution, the Civil War, \nSpanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea War, Vietnam \nWar--it took us 200 years and the cost of all the wars to reach a $1 \ntrillion debt.\n  In the last 3\\1/2\\ years--because we don't want to pay for our war \nand want to give tax breaks instead--we have already piled up $2 \ntrillion in debt; $2 trillion in the last 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  This crowd has to sober up. We have to get hold of ourselves. We have \nto disenthrall ourselves and we have to start competing. Remember, it \nis our standard of living. That is the most frustrating thing around \nhere. Here we add on these requirements: the minimum wage, Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, plant closing notice, parental leave, \nsafe working place, safe machinery, the old age act, the discrimination \nact, and this act and that act--all of that goes into the cost of \nproduction. It is not just the minimum wage; it is our high standard of \nliving. Every Republican and every Democrat favors clean air and clean \nwater. So we are not going back on our standard of living. So \nfundamentally we have to protect, and that is the fundamental role of \nGovernment.\n  I will never forget when we swore in President Ronald Reagan for his \nsecond term. It was inclement weather and we did it in the Rotunda. He \nraised his hand to preserve, protect, and defend. We came back and we \nwere debating trade, and we said: Oh, we don't want to protect, we \ndon't want to protect. The fundamental oath that we take as public \nservants is to protect. We have the Army to protect us from enemies \nwithout, the FBI to protect us from enemies within. We have Social \nSecurity to protect us from old age, Medicare to protect us from ill-\nhealth; clean air, clean water--antitrust laws to protect the freedom \nof the market. We can go right on down the list. Are we going to pass a \nwonderful high standard of living and then run around like ninnies \nhollering: Wait a minute, wait a minute, free trade, free trade. We \ndon't want to start protectionism--they get that garbage from the \nBusiness Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  I talk as one having received all of their awards. In 1992, I was man \nof the year of the National Chamber of Commerce. By 1998 they were \nsending out leaflets against me. So I speak advisedly. That crowd is \nnot any longer interested in Main Street America. They are interested \nin Main Street Beijing. That is where you make the money, and the \ncountry can go to hell as far as they are concerned. So it is our duty \nto protect the economy and open up the markets and everything else like \nthat.\n  Don't tell us more about retrain, retrain, retrain. I continually \nhear that. Oh, we have to retrain. I went through another little town \nyesterday, Andrews, SC. It brings to mind Oneida. I brought that plant \nin. They make little T-shirts. They closed to go to Mexico. At the time \nof closure they had 487 employees. The average age was 47 years.\n  We have done it, Senator, your way. We have retrained them and we \nhave 487 highly skilled computer operators. Are you going to hire the \n47-year-old highly skilled computer operator or the 21-year-old highly \nskilled computer operator? You are not going to take on the retirement, \nthe pension cost of the 47-year-old. You are not going to take on the \nhealth cost of the 47-year-old. You are going to get the 21-year-old. \nSo don't tell me about retraining.\n  We have the most productive economy--that is what Alan Greenspan \nsays. He is sobering up himself. He came down here with this \nadministration saying we were paying down too much debt. ``We are \npaying down too much debt.'' He sanctioned all these tax cuts. Now he \nsays debt and deficits matter, and he is worried about interest rates \nnow and everything else of that kind, and paying bills.\n  It is time we speak out as much as we can, early on, so we will know \nexactly where we stand. Where we stand is that we have to reorganize--\nbegin to organize, I should say--our trade effort, not just the \nDepartment of Commerce, but a Department of Trade and Commerce. I have \nbeen serving for almost 38 years on what was originally the Committee \nof Foreign and Interstate Commerce because article I section 8 says \nthat Congress--not the President, not the Supreme Court--but the \nCongress of the United States shall regulate foreign commerce.\n  But, instead, it is over in the hands of a deep six group known as \nthe Finance Committee. What they do is they work out their little \ndeals. You might get a stadium, you might get a courthouse, you might \nget any kind of visions of sugarplums dancing in their head.\n  Forget about trade. They put on fast track. After they make their \ndeal, the vote is fixed. Then it comes to the floor of the most \ndeliberative body that cannot, under fast track, deliberate. And we \nenjoy it. We have tied our hands with fast track because we don't want \nto take the responsibility. That is what the polls will tell you: Don't \nsay you are for or against, just say you are concerned.\n  So we say we are concerned and we keep getting reelected and the \ncountry goes to hell in an economic hand pot. I can tell you right now \nwe are in real trouble, and we have to disenthrall.\n  What happens is that we need to organize a Department of Trade and \nCommerce, take that special Trade Representative, put it under that \nSecretary, do away with the International Trade Commission, which is a \nfix. You can find the damage done by the International Trade \nAdministration over in Commerce. Then you go over to the Commission and \nthey find out--oh, there is never any injury because you have growth. \nThe GNP now is 3 or 4 percent, so there is no injury. So we keep \nsending the jobs out of the country like gangbusters, and we ought to \ndo away with that particular fix of the Finance Committee. Then come in \nand get an Attorney General--an assistant, let's say, to enforce the \ntrade laws.\n  Many a trade lawyer in this city has gone all the way to the Supreme \nCourt and found out that, well, politically it is set aside. It was \nthat way in the Zenith case, when they were gathered around the Cabinet \ntable and President Reagan walked in and he said: I have to take care \nof Nakasone. We are going to have to reverse that decision, after 3 \nyears and millions of dollars of legal costs.\n  So we ought to put in, like we have for antitrust, like we have for \nequal employment--we have to put in an Assistant Attorney General to \nenforce those laws, get the Customs agents, and finally when we get \nright down to it, do like the others do, play their game. If you are \ngoing to sell it here, you have to make it here. Isn't that wonderful? \nThat is exactly what China really controls.\n  They said, if you want to sell it here you have to make it here. I \nhaven't gotten them that far along, I am just trying to flex their \nminds so we will get away from this trade war and protectionism \nnonsense, so we can put in a competitive trade policy and save our \nindustrial backbone.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining? My distinguished \ncolleague from Florida, Mr. Bob Graham, wants to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). There is 12 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me yield at this time to the proponents and the \ndistinguished leadership of our Finance Committee. I retain the \nremainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  Senator Hollings asks us to take $39 billion of international reforms \nand put it towards more domestic manufacturing relief.\n  I have told my colleagues so many times I shouldn't have to repeat \nit. But this bill is all about encouraging domestic manufacturing.\n  The level of spending in this bill is already over three to one in \nfavor of domestic issues. We dedicate over $75 billion to domestic \nmanufacturing relief.\n  FSC/ETI currently benefits manufacturing by $50 billion. Obviously, \nyou can see this bill is a much stronger\n\n[[Page S5197]]\n\ncommitment to manufacturing than the old FSC/ETI bill we are replacing. \nWe have already accelerated the phase-in of the manufacturing tax rate. \nThat is thanks to a bipartisan amendment by Senator Bunning and Senator \nStabenow. We have modified the transition rules to provide stronger \nrelief in transition for manufacturing companies which presently get \nthe old FSC/ETI benefits this bill replaces.\n  I hope it is easy for my colleagues to conclude that there is very \nlittle to be gained by the amendment proposed by the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  It is time we had our rational discussion of the international \nreforms in this JOBS bill because we have been spending so much time on \nnongermane amendments. The amendment before us is not one of those \nnongermane amendments but it has kept us from discussing so much which \nis very basic with this legislation. Maybe people think there is no \nreason to discuss it because this bill was built from the ground up in \na bipartisan way, coming out of our committee on a very overwhelming \nvote of 9 to 2.\n  I think Members will be surprised to learn that some of our \ninternational tax rules actually harm the domestic operations of U.S. \ncompanies. When foreign income is brought home, the United States \nallows an offset against U.S. tax for any foreign taxes paid on that \nincome. That is why it is called the foreign tax credit. Foreign tax \ncredits ensure that we do not double tax foreign earnings. Accordingly, \nthe foreign tax credit plays a vital role in preserving the \ninternational competitiveness of our companies.\n  In the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress enacted a provision that \ncauses foreign tax credits to expire every 5 years. That was done for a \nreason that is not very well justified because it is often used around \nhere--to make that 1986 tax bill revenue neutral.\n  Some claim this is a good rule because it forces foreign earnings to \nbe repatriated within 5 years. But that conclusion does not comport \nwith reality. The reason companies don't bring back foreign earnings is \nbecause of double taxation. That is what occurs with foreign tax \ncredits expiring.\n  I will give you an example. A U.S. company sets up new operations in \nPoland to serve Eastern Europe at this time when Eastern Europe is \nbeing integrated with the European Union. That happened last week. For \nthe next 8 years in this hypothetical--quite reasonably--it takes all \nof the capital generated by the Polish subsidiary to expand the \ncompany's presence in Eastern Europe. At the end of 8 years, it finally \nhas some extra cash which it can send home.\n\n  What happens? It discovers the taxes it paid to Poland from years 1 \nthrough 3 are no longer eligible for the foreign tax credit because \nthey are more than 5 years old. The Polish tax rate is 28 percent. This \nmeans if a company repatriates those early earnings, it will pay \ncombined Polish and U.S. taxes of 63 percent. It is really almost \nconfiscatory. That means, of course, the money is not coming home for \nreinvestment in the United States. We lose the benefit.\n  If those early tax credits had not expired, the United States would \nactually pick up some tax revenues. The subsidiary would owe the \ndifference between the 28-percent Polish rate and the 35-percent U.S. \nrate. That happens to be a gain of 7 percentage points of taxation into \nour U.S. Treasury from that company.\n  To ensure that double taxation no longer occurs, our JOBS bill \nextends the carry-forward period for foreign tax credits from 5 years \nto 20 years. Twenty years is the amount of time companies have to \nutilize net operating losses. It is only appropriate, then, that the \nkey mechanism for avoiding double taxation should have the same shelf \nlife.\n  Our JOBS bill mostly fixes problems in the foreign tax credit area. \nThe only time a company benefits from a foreign tax credit is when it \nbrings that money home.\n  To repeat a very elementary point, foreign tax credits are a benefit \nto that company only when that company brings foreign earnings home for \nreinvestment. When the credit expires, this impedes capital mobility \nbecause of double taxation, and it blocks reinvestment of foreign \nearnings in the United States.\n  Another example of guaranteed double taxation is our rule that only \nallows 90 percent of a company's AMT to be offset with foreign tax \ncredits. This rule guarantees that the company will be double taxed on \n10 percent of the alternative minimum tax. The JOBS bill allows what is \ncommon sense--a 100-percent offset.\n  To give you a real-life example of how these two changes will help \nU.S. operations make investments in America and create jobs in America, \nthe largest American manufacturer in this example of a particular \nautomobile part is bringing dividends back from its profitable foreign \noperations to cover losses in its U.S. operations. Their U.S. losses, \nwhen combined with the foreign dividends to fund the U.S. operations, \nhas created huge unused foreign tax credits with a 5-year expiration \nperiod. Because of their ongoing U.S. losses, it is unlikely these \ncredits will be used within those 5 years.\n  This company also has a growing alternative minimum tax because their \nforeign tax credits can only be offset by 95 percent of their AMT \nliability.\n  The limit is creating an annual alternative minimum tax liability \nbecause the additional 10 percent of the AMT cannot be offset with the \nforeign taxes that have already been paid on that income. The company \nis guaranteed to incur double tax on foreign earnings brought back to \nsupport the U.S. operation. This may be unbelievable to anyone \nlistening, but this is actually happening under U.S. tax laws.\n\n  The company's foreign competitors in the United States are not \nequally hindered in the same way by the 90-percent alternative minimum \ntax, foreign tax credit limit. If a foreign competitor loses money, \nthey get a 20-year U.S. net operating loss compared to the 5-year \nforeign tax credit carryforward. Our Tax Code, then, is harming a \ncompany that has operations in all 50 States and employs 38,000 people \nin 16 different manufacturing facilities.\n  This example shows why the 20-year foreign tax credit carryforward \nand the repeal of the 90-percent AMT foreign tax credit limits are in \nthis very important jobs in manufacturing bill. The current rules harm \nU.S. operations and we need to fix it.\n  I also have some comments on another provision, the interest \nallocation provisions, to give another example of how our international \nrules harm U.S. operations. As I said earlier, foreign tax credits can \nonly offset foreign income; they cannot offset income from U.S. \nactivities. In determining the amount of foreign income, certain U.S. \nexpenses, such as interest expense, are partially allocated to foreign \nincome. This is used in calculating the amount of foreign tax credit a \nU.S. company is allowed to claim on its return. The United States \narbitrarily allocates U.S. interest expense to foreign earnings, but \nthe foreign government does not recognize that interest expense for its \ntax purposes. It is as if the interest expense somehow disappears into \nthe clear air.\n  The interest allocation rules artificially reduce the foreign tax \ncredits that can be used, and when the credits cannot be used the \ncredits expire. It may surprise many Senators to hear that our interest \nallocation rules create a competitive disadvantage for U.S. \nmultinationals that try to expand their operations into the United \nStates and maybe do not get expanded here.\n  A portion of the interest expense on debt incurred to invest in the \nUnited States is allocated to foreign source income. A foreign \ncorporation making the same U.S. investment is not impacted by these \ninterest allocation rules. It gets to fully deduct the interest costs \nwithin the United States and thereby has a lower cost of capital than a \nU.S. company making that same investment. Therefore, the interest \nallocation rules actually work against U.S. multinational companies \nthat invest in the United States. It has put some at a competitive \ndisadvantage with foreign companies operating in the United States. I \nhope this is very clear, that this is not the right thing for the U.S. \nTax Code to do to foreign manufacturers. Why should we encourage \ninternational competition in the United States against our own domestic \nmanufacturer?\n  We have Senators demonizing the JOBS bill international provisions. \nThis gives me an opportunity to emphasize once again how anything gets \ndone in the Senate--only in a bipartisan way. This is a bipartisan \nbill.\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\nDemocrats and Republicans agree to everything in this bill, and the \ninternational provisions we agreed to were provisions that actually \nhelp U.S. job creation and help our own economic growth.\n  I ask the Senate to support Senator Baucus and this Senator in this \nbipartisan bill. I hope Members will not buy the distortion. None of \nthe international changes caused jobs to go offshore. Just the \nopposite. These were selected to bring the foreign money back for real \ninvestment in the United States, creating jobs in the United States, \ncreating manufacturing jobs in the United States because this is a \nmanufacturing bill. These changes level the playing field between the \nUnited States and foreign companies operating inside the United States. \nThey were specifically selected because they tend to help U.S.-based \nmanufacturers more than other sectors of our economy.\n\n  The entire JOBS bill is geared towards creating jobs in \nmanufacturing--jobs in the United States, not overseas--because \nAmerican manufacturing overseas does not benefit from this bill.\n  It is quite simple. These are the only kinds of international \nprovisions we could ever get bipartisan agreement on because it is so \nobvious. It is so obvious, it came 19-2 out of our committee. We should \nnot allow international rules to remain in place if they harm U.S. \noperation. Once again, we are talking about commonsense international \ntax reform. In fact, if anyone wants to condemn this bill, it is that \nmaybe we do not do anything radical in this bill. We just fix problems. \nWe fix problems with current law. We fix problems with current law that \nhappens to be harming U.S. domestic interests.\n  So I ask Members to vote against the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, we are here for two fundamental \nreasons. One, we are here to remove from our Tax Code a provision that \nhas been declared illegal by the World Trade Organization, and certain \nindustries in America are now being sanctioned for that illegal \nprovision.\n  We would not be here debating an international tax law change but for \nthe fact that the WTO declared illegal our system of encouraging U.S. \nmanufacturers to export. I don't think any Member would challenge that \nstatement. These international tax changes are totally being carried by \nthe need to eliminate this WTO-offending sanctions-creating provision.\n  There is a second step we ought to be taking. We ought to remove the \nincentive for U.S. firms to take jobs from the United States overseas. \nThere are a lot of incentives that are already out there. There are \nincentives of lower labor costs, lower environmental standards, lower \nstandards in terms of human rights. All of those are already in place. \nHowever, we do not need to be giving a further economic incentive to \nmove jobs out of the United States.\n  Let me state briefly what I believe we ought to be thinking about as \nwe consider this matter. Just a couple of hours ago, as I was walking \nto the Capitol, I ran into a large group of folks. I stopped and asked \nthem who they were. They were machinists from Wichita, KS. Do you know \nwhat they told me? In Wichita, KS, machinists used to be 27,000 strong. \nDo you know how many they have in Wichita today? Only 16,000. Eleven \nthousand jobs have left Wichita from that one union. I asked, where did \nthe jobs go? Did they disappear? No longer producing airplanes? No, the \n11,000 jobs are still in place, but they just happen to be in places \nsuch as China, India, Brazil, and other countries which are now \nbuilding the airplanes that used to be built in Wichita.\n  When I told that group of Wichita machinists why, in part, those jobs \nhad left Wichita to go offshore, they were stunned. So let me tell the \nSenate what I told the Wichita machinists. We have a fancy provision in \nthe international tax law called ``deferral.'' In fact, this Senate \nvoted about 20 years ago to repeal this deferral. But that effort \nfailed.\n\n  ``Deferral'' basically means the income earned by the foreign \nsubsidiary of a U.S. multinational is not subject to tax. They do have \nto pay whatever their local taxes are to China or India, but they do \nnot pay any tax to the U.S. Government.\n  Do you know what that costs us every year in lost revenue for our \nGovernment? According to the Treasury Department, it costs us $11 \nbillion a year. That is the incentive we are giving. That $11 billion, \nincidentally, is about what it would take to do two things we debate a \nlot around here: fully fund the No Child Left Behind law and fully fund \nour veterans program.\n  Over the years, this benefit has produced substantial savings to \nAmerican corporations. Let me give you a few examples. Citigroup has \nsaved, on an accumulated basis, $6 billion as a result of this \nprovision; ExxonMobil, $22 billion; Hewlett-Packard, $14 billion; IBM, \n$18 billion.\n  Aside from taking advantage of this extremely generous tax break, \nwhich creates a positive incentive to move jobs from the United States \noverseas, every one of those firms appears on Lou Dobbs' ``Exporting \nAmerica'' list. Every one of the firms that is getting this tremendous \nbenefit is doing what the benefit is designed to do, which is to \nencourage the relocation of jobs outside the United States of America.\n  So in light of that, what are we doing in this bill to reduce or \neliminate the incentive for jobs to leave America? Do you know what we \nare doing? We are increasing it by $3.7 billion per year.\n  I respect greatly and consider Senator Grassley to be one of my \nfriends who I most respect and admire in the Senate, but I wish he were \nhere to answer this question. If this bill does not give greater \nincentives to American firms to leave America and move jobs offshore, \nwhy does it cost us $3.7 billion? Why are we going to have an \nadditional revenue loss of that magnitude other than the fact that we \nare encouraging jobs that would not otherwise have left America to do \nso and, therefore, create more of this deferral tax benefit?\n  But it does not end there, as with my friends from Wichita. There is \na second provision. It has the fancy name ``repatriation.'' What does \nthat mean? That means after a company has deferred paying U.S. taxes on \nthe $18 or $14 or $22 billion they have accumulated, and they finally \ndecide, ``Well, I want to move some of it back to the United States,'' \nfor whatever purpose, we are now going to say for 1 year they can do \nthat, not at the same tax rate they would have paid had they kept those \njobs in the United States--which is approximately 35 percent--they are \ngoing to be able to move that money back to the United States at 5.25 \npercent, which is approximately an 85-percent benefit, tax gift over \nwhat they would have paid had they kept those same jobs at home.\n  What is this going to cost us? What is the difference between a 35-\npercent and a 5.25-percent tax rate? Well, the cost to the Federal \nTreasury is going to be approximately $16 billion in the year this \nwindow is opened.\n  Now the proponents of this window are going to say: Oh, this is a \ntemporary window. We are going to shut that thing tight after 1 year. \nFriends, I would be willing to make a substantial wager of Florida \noranges that once this window gets in the tax law, it is going to be \nlike all those other tax practices that were supposed to be temporary.\n  I say to the Senator, do you remember when the President came down \nhere in 2001 and said: ``I want you to pass all these tax benefits, but \nthey are only going to be temporary so we can stimulate the economy''? \nNow what is the President's tax plan? To make all those temporary taxes \npermanent.\n  What do you think is going to be his tax plan when it gets to be \n2005, if he is still the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue? He will \nbe down here wanting to make this window a permanently open window.\n  I could not imagine, at a time when we are so concerned with the loss \nof jobs, we would pass legislation that would create even additional \nincentives for American jobs to pick up--maybe on aircraft made by \nAmericans in Wichita, KS--and fly away to other lands.\n  We should support Senator Hollings' amendment. And then we should \nvote no on final passage of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have to the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to support the amendment to \nstrike this section. I do that because the Senator from South Carolina \nis absolutely right. So is the Senator from Florida. The fact is, there \nare several provisions that incentivize the movement of U.S. jobs \noverseas. At a time when we are trying to create new jobs in this \ncountry, to say to companies--which, by the way, have moved their jobs \noverseas already--``Repatriate your income to this country now, and we \nwill give you a 5.25-percent tax rate,'' how about a 5.25-percent tax \nrate for every American? How about a 5.25-percent tax rate for those \nwho live in North Dakota or South Carolina or Florida?\n  Why should we provide incentives for companies that want to move \ntheir jobs overseas? I have talked at length about Huffy bicycles. They \nare gone. They are now made in China. They used to be made in the \nUnited States. Radio Flyer, the little red wagons, they are gone. They \nused to be made in the United States. Those little red wagons are now \nmade in China. The U.S. taxpayers provide an incentive for those \ncompanies to close their U.S. plants, fire their workers, and move \ntheir jobs overseas.\n  Now this bill comes to the floor of the Senate and says to those \ncompanies that moved their jobs overseas: We will give you a good deal. \nRepatriate some of that money, and we will lower your tax rate to 5.25 \npercent. Well, that sends a signal to everybody that when you decide \nnext to move your jobs overseas to access lower labor costs, at some \npoint in the future somebody will get behind a closed door and come up \nwith this goofy idea that they will reduce your tax rate again--maybe \nto 5.25 percent, maybe to 1.25 percent. How about zero?\n  My question is this: If it is good enough for these companies, why is \na 5.25-percent tax rate not good enough for every American? Why is it \nnot good enough for working families?\n  But the Senator from South Carolina has it right. We ought not, in \nany circumstance, provide any additional incentive to move more \nAmerican jobs overseas. They are moving overseas to access lower labor \ncosts and less restrictions with respect to safe plants and \nenvironmental restrictions. Why on Earth would we want to give them a \ntax benefit as they leave this country? This makes no sense to me.\n  There are some provisions in the international tax section which I \nthink are all right. But there are some that are, in my judgment, a \ncolossal waste of money and fundamentally the wrong incentive with \nrespect to American jobs. Because of that, because of this pernicious \nprovision that reduces the tax rate to 5.25 percent for the \nrepatriation of earnings for those that have already moved their jobs \noverseas, I am going to support the amendment that is offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina. He is right on track.\n  As you know, we had a vote a few days ago on my amendment that would \nhave done more than this amendment, essentially. My amendment was \ntaking out of existing law the provision that encourages companies to \nmove overseas. The Senator from South Carolina supported that. The \nSenator from South Carolina now says they are creating a new piece of \nlegislation that, in the long run, will have even more incentive to \nmove American jobs overseas. He says: Let's stop that. Let's not do \nthat. I agree with him completely. I think the Senator from South \nCarolina does a service to this Chamber by offering this amendment. I \nintend to support his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, if you do not have \nany more time, then I will yield back my time and we can then vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Good.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Is that OK?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back all time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3134.

Mr. President, this is an amendment that is a matter \nof fairness and equity. It is cosponsored by Senator Landrieu, Senator \nSmith, and myself. It is to put one sector that was in the original \nFSC/ETI coverage back into the bill. It is architects and engineers. We \nknow there has been a huge outsourcing of professional jobs overseas. \nThis is becoming more common. Our architectural and engineering firms \nare particularly vulnerable to foreign competition. This amendment is a \npared-down amendment that would give them some of the tax deduction \nback. It is the only sector that was originally covered that is not \ncovered in the bill before us.\n  My amendment would phase in the coverage over a 10-year period. It is \noffset, so there will be no cost. It is a matter of fairness. We should \nnot lose our engineering and architectural jobs in this country. They \nhave lost 31 percent of their margins in the last year.\n  I hope we will be able to agree to this amendment. It is a matter of \nsimple equity. I believe with this phased-in tax deduction we will have \nan incentive to do our designing and engineering in our country, for \nbuildings that are in our country. This is not applied to buildings \nbuilt overseas, only buildings built in our country.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment, but if it needs to be set aside \nfor further consideration----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment by \nthe Senator from Texas be temporarily set aside so the Senator from \nLouisiana may offer her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3123\n\n   (Purpose: To improve the credit for Ready Reserve-National Guard \n   employees, to provide a credit for replacement employees of Ready \n Reserve-National Guard employees called to active military duty, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \nfor just a few minutes on a very important amendment to this underlying \nbill, an amendment I offer on behalf of Senator Murray, Senator \nJohnson, Senator Cantwell, Senator Corzine, Senator Kerry, Senator \nDurbin, and Senator Dodd. They offer this amendment with me. It is an \namendment I understand the chairman and ranking member have looked at \nand both support. In just a moment, I want to ask each of them, if they \nwould, to make some comments about this amendment. We have to dispose \nof it one way or the other in the next few minutes. We may not need a \nrollcall vote. I understand their wishes to move through this bill, but \nI am anxious to hear from the chairman and the ranking member about the \nimportance of making sure this amendment is carried through the \nprocess.\n  This amendment has to do with the Guard and Reserve and the people \nwho employ them stateside. It has to do with our responsibility as a \ngovernment--or our obligation, if you will, our commitment to the \nconcept of a total force that relies, now, heavily on our Guard and \nReserve. This amendment provides some much-needed tax relief to \npatriotic employers who try to help fill the pay gap between what a man \nor a woman might earn when they are stateside at their regular job--and \nthen they put on the uniform to defend us and to fight this war that we \nare engaged with today.\n  There are maybe 1,000, maybe 2,000, good, compelling stories I could \nshare with you about our current situation. But let me begin by saying \nthe underlying bill moves around about $120 billion. The underlying \nbill doesn't cost the Treasury because we are raising some fees and \ntaxes and modifying others.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3123\n\n   (Purpose: To improve the credit for Ready Reserve-National Guard \n   employees, to provide a credit for replacement employees of Ready \n Reserve-National Guard employees called to active military duty, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3123.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself, \n     Mrs. Murray, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3123.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the underlying bill moves around about \n$120 billion in tax relief, tax increases, changes in our Tax Code to \nhopefully increase employment opportunities, increase and strengthen \nemployment across the board, and strengthen our economy here and \nabroad. That is the intention of the underlying bill.\n  This amendment moves around only $2 billion of that $120 billion. \nEvery Senator could come here and argue that section A is more \nimportant than section C or section D. But I can tell you that, to my \nknowledge, this is the only section of $120 billion that deals \nspecifically with tax credits for guys and gals who are putting on the \nuniforms, who are not working for the pay but are working because of \ntheir patriotism, and working in some of the most horrific and very \ndifficult situations. The least we can do while we are debating a tax \nbill is to provide some much needed relief.\n\n[[Page S5201]]\n\n  I could give you 2,000 stories. Because time is short, let me give \nyou 2.\n  This is a family from Louisiana. It is the subject of an article. \nThere were hundreds of articles written. This one happens to be from \nthe Washington Post. Kathy Kiely did a beautiful job of writing this \narticle. She starts off:\n\n       Drastic pay cuts. Bankruptcy. Foreclosed homes. They aren't \n     exactly the kind of challenges that members of America's \n     military reserves sign up for when they volunteered to serve \n     their country.\n       But for many, the biggest threat to the home front isn't \n     Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden. It's the bill collector.\n\n  Janet Wright is from Louisiana.\n  Kathy Kiely writes:\n\n       Janet Wright says she ``sat down and cried'' when she \n     realized how little money she and her children, Adelia, 5, \n     and Carolyn, 2, would have to live on when her husband was \n     sent to the Mideast. In his civilian job with \n     an environmental cleanup company, Russell Wright makes \n     $60,000 a year--twice what he'll be paid as a sergeant in \n     the Marine Forces Reserve. Back in Hammond, LA, his wife, \n     who doesn't have a paying job, is pouring the kids more \n     water and less milk. She is trying to accelerate Carolyn's \n     potty training schedule to save on diapers.\n\n  Let me ask: Could we do a little better for our Guard and Reserve \nmembers who have to take a cut in pay to serve in the military for us? \nThey knew the responsibilities when they signed on to the Guard and \nReserve. They understood their commitment to training. They understood \ntheir commitment to their monthly responsibilities. And, yes, they \nunderstood it wasn't going to be a ``paid vacation,'' but because our \npolicy in Congress is relying on their work and relying on them for \nlonger periods of time than either they or, I might add, at least \naccording to the generals who have testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee, we anticipated, the least we could do in a tax bill is to \ngive them some minimal relief.\n  This amendment helps families just like the Wright family in Hammond, \nLA, by allowing the employer to pay the difference between the $30,000 \nthat this Marine Reserve officer will earn when he is serving our \ncountry and putting himself in harm's way, and if they pay that gap up \nto $30,000--it is not mandatory; it is voluntary. Many of our \ncompanies, but not all, are doing it for obvious reasons. There is a \nstrain particularly on small businesses. But for those employers that--\nand I note Boeing is a good example of a very large employer with a \nwonderful policy, and much better, I might add, than our own Government \nwhich today has refused to adopt this policy. But at least there are \nsome employers out there that are doing more than hanging the flag and \nsaying the Pledge of Allegiance. They are actually taking out their \ncheckbook in a very patriotic manner and keeping their Guard and \nReserve families whole. The least we could do is give them a 50-percent \ntax credit, which is what our amendment does.\n  Let me read another example. I have 2,000; I am only going to read 2.\n  This is a firefighter from the Pacific coast. He earned a decent \nliving before being called up in 2002, but active duty meant a $700 or \na $1,000 a month pay cut and some very painful choices. He said:\n\n       My wife said ``We cannot live here anymore. It is too \n     expensive.''\n\n  He said he rented a 12,100 square foot home. He moved the whole \nfamily into a two-bedroom apartment where his wife has to sleep on a \ncouch.\n  I understand we all have to make sacrifices. Most certainly the men \nand women who sign up for our All-Volunteer Force don't sign up because \nthey think they are going on vacation or for the pay or the benefits. \nThey sign up because they are patriotic. They believe in the ideals of \nthis country.\n  When we are passing a $120 billion bill, if we can't take $2 billion \nor $3 billion or $4 billion and support the hundreds of thousands of \nmen and women who are away from their jobs stateside and away from \ntheir businesses--not 3 months, not 12 months but 18 months under very \ntough conditions--so their children don't have to drink more water in \ntheir cereal in the morning and the wives have to sleep on couches, I \nthink we can do better.\n\n  That is why I have waited for several months actually to offer this \namendment and to have support from both sides of the aisle.\n  There is a cap on the credit. So the cost is very reasonable. We have \ntaken the necessary precautions to make sure this amendment is \naffordable.\n  According to DOD, 98 percent of the reservists have a pay gap. \nSometimes it is only $1,000 a month. Sometimes it could be $500 a \nmonth. But in some cases it is more than that. But 98 percent have pay \ngaps under $30,000.\n  This amendment will cover almost the entire Guard and Reserve \npopulation. Our Guard and Reserve on deployment would not have to worry \nabout their bills being paid and could focus on the job before them, \nand do it well, as the vast majority of them do day in and day out, \nnight in and night out.\n  That basically is what amendment does.\n  There is also a replacement worker tax credit for small businesses, \nmany of which would be affected in the State of the Presiding Officer, \nwith 50 employees or less. It is not just helping to fill the pay gap \nfor employers that continue to pay the salaries, but it also gives some \nhelp to small business owners that in many instances take the brunt \nfrom their service, particularly when it is extended.\n  I will end my remarks. I see some of my colleagues on the floor who \nmay want to add some comments.\n  This affects thousands of people in all of our States. I am proud our \nGuard and Reserve are right there stepping up on the front lines.\n  We have an outstanding Guard and Reserve unit. In about a month, we \nwill have over 5,000, almost 6,000, men and women serving in Iraq; \nagain, some of them for much longer periods of time than they were \ninitially told.\n  I understand the chairman is prepared to accept the amendment. But \nbefore I waive my right to a recorded vote, I would like to have some \ncomments from the chairman, who has negotiated this bill beautifully \nthrough this process. If he could, I would like for him to comment \nabout the importance of this amendment and the outlook for keeping this \namendment in the conference report as we move this bill to the \nPresident's desk for his signature.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I can comment very positively about \nthe motivation behind the amendment, and the good policy of giving \nequity to people who are called away from jobs and away from family to \ngo to a far-off land to defend America in a war against terrorism and \ndoing it in a way that has never been done for guardsmen and reservists \nto this extent, I think going back to the Korean war. What we are doing \nnow has not been done for a long period of time.\n\n  The Senator from Louisiana needs to be complimented on her efforts to \nrecognize that and, particularly, to recognize that through employers \nwho show very patriotic fervor in cooperating in this whole program.\n  I can say that very positively about the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana. She is asking me to predict what might happen in \nconference. It is very difficult to do that. I have a reputation for \ndefending the position of the Senate and working as best I can to work \nthrough this. Obviously, I cannot make any promises to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I can appreciate that. I appreciate the comments of the \nchairman. He has shown himself to be a great leader, a man of his word. \nI know he will uphold and fight for our position.\n  I think it would be a real shame to move a $120 billion tax bill \nthrough this Congress at this time and have not a part of it \nspecifically directed to some of the men and women who are carrying the \ngreatest burden right now.\n  I know our businesspeople of all sizes and shapes are contributing to \nthe overall economy and creating jobs, but there would not be any \ncountry to create jobs for if it were not for the men and women in \nuniform who protect us here and abroad.\n  I appreciate the remarks of the chairman.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record three articles \ninvolving enlisted reservists of the National Guard, and a letter from \nthe National Guard Association that represents thousands of current and \nretired guardsmen and reservists.\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        National Guard Association\n\n\n                                         of The United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 2004.\n     Hon.

Today, there are more than 94,000 \n     National Guard personnel serving on active duty in support of \n     the global war on terrorism. These men and women, who are \n     serving in harm's way, contribute over 40% of our fighting \n     force in the Global War on Terrorism. This number also \n     reflects those personnel serving abroad and away from their \n     families, communities, and employers.\n       Members of the National Guard must take time off from their \n     civilian employment to perform military duties. Increased \n     operational tempo dictates that National Guard and Reserve \n     Component members must be placed on active duty ever more \n     frequently. This increased operational tempo places \n     additional financial burdens on employers, to a much greater \n     extent than in past years. We at NGAUS believe employers \n     should not be expected to bear the increased financial \n     burdens that increased Guard deployments place on them.\n       Assisting employers with a tax credit provides them the \n     ability to inject those funds back into their businesses in \n     order to offset the effects of the temporary loss of their \n     National Guard employees.\n       The National Guard Association of the United States urges \n     the Members of the United States Senate to support your \n     efforts to recognize the civic duty of those employers who, \n     in the face of financial constraint, continue to support \n     their National Guard employees.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Richard C. Alexander,\n\n                                        Major General (Ret.), AUS,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the San Mateo County Times, Dec. 18, 2003]\n\n    War Carries a Hidden Cost; Reservists' ``Pay Gap'' Often Forces \n                     Difficult Choices on Families\n\n                          (By Justin Jouvenal)\n\n       Pacifica.--Scott Hellesto endured snipers and artillery \n     fire, but one of the most difficult battles during the Navy \n     reservist's service in Iraq came on the homefront--losing his \n     three-bedroom home.\n       The Pacifica firefighter had earned a decent living before \n     being called up in January 2002, but active duty meant a \n     $700- to $1,000-a-month pay cut--and some painful choices. \n     ``My wife said, `We can't live here anymore, it's too \n     expensive,' '' Hellesto said of his rented 2,100-square-foot \n     home in Antioch. ``So we moved the whole family into a two-\n     bedroom apartment, where my wife had to sleep on the couch.''\n       This ``pay gap'' is a hidden cost of war that likely \n     affects thousands of the state's reservists and National \n     Guard troops as they transition from more lucrative civilian \n     jobs to active duty. It is an extra burden for families \n     already dealing with the pain of separation and the stress of \n     having a loved one in a combat zone.\n       ``There's fewer Christmas gifts and other cuts,'' said Lt. \n     Col. Terry Knight, a California National Guard spokesman. \n     ``Often you have a spouse left behind that ends up getting a \n     second job.''\n       The pay gap has become especially difficult for reservists \n     and National Guard troops since the 2001 terrorist attacks, \n     as more are serving and many are going for longer stints on \n     active duty.\n       About 10,000 California National Guard troops have been \n     deployed since 9/11--the largest mobilization since the \n     Korean War. About 4,000 are currently on active duty, \n     including 1,600 in Iraq. They earn between $1,700 and $2,800 \n     a month.\n       Hellesto, who served with the 23rd Marines Echo Company, \n     swept into Iraq with the first wave of troops last March. He \n     made it to Nasariyah and helped secure a Baghdad neighborhood \n     on April 9, the day the statue of Saddam Hussein fell in \n     Iraq's capital.\n       ``I saw the best and the worst of humanity,'' Hellesto \n     said.\n       He ran missions as a decoy to draw out Saddam's Fedayeen \n     soldiers and withstood SCUD missile alerts. Hellesto also \n     recalls with warmth the Iraqi soccer star who gave him his \n     gold medal from the Asian Games because Hellesto cared for \n     the man's son.\n       Hellesto said he doesn't want people to think he is bitter \n     about his service--he said he knew what he was getting into \n     and would do it again. Still, the financial strain was \n     difficult.\n       He said he could hear the edge in his wife Michelle's voice \n     when he would secretly call home on a satellite phone \n     supplied by a Fox News reporter.\n       ``Sometimes, I wondered what I got my family into,'' \n     Hellesto said.\n       Hellesto was able to get by with a little help from his \n     friends and family. He turned to fellow firefighters for help \n     when he was buying Christmas gifts for his three children \n     last year.\n       The apartment--he dubbed it the ``shoebox''--was in a rough \n     neighborhood, and someone slashed the tires and broke a \n     window on his truck last spring. Fortunately, a friend of \n     Hellesto's was able to pay to fix up the truck.\n       Scott Hellesto was called to active duty in January 2002. \n     He served at Camp Pendleton outside San Diego for a year, \n     before his tour of duty was extended and he was sent to Iraq.\n       Like many companies and local governments, the city of \n     Pacifica kept up Hellesto's regular salary and health \n     benefits for the first five months he was on active duty, but \n     after that, he was on his own.\n       Michelle Hellesto had to go on the Navy's health plan, \n     which meant giving up the family doctors. She also had to get \n     government assistance to pay for formula for her children.\n       ``It put a strain on us; it was like supporting two \n     households when he was done at Camp Pendleton,'' she said. \n     ``We couldn't have done it without the help of friends and \n     family.''\n       Hellesto estimated that about 30 to 40 percent of the \n     reserves he served with were in the same financial bind, but \n     the pay gap does not affect every soldier. Many earn more on \n     active duty than they do in their civilian jobs.\n       The National Guard Association estimates about a third of \n     the Guard earn less on active duty than in their civilian \n     jobs, while another third earn more.\n       Congressman Tom Lantos, D-San Mateo, introduced a bill in \n     March that would close the gap for some troops. Specifically, \n     the bill would entitle a reservist who is also a federal \n     employee and on active duty for more than 30 days to receive \n     the difference between his military and civilian pay.\n       The bill also would give state and local governments strong \n     incentives to make up the pay and give private companies tax \n     breaks if they continue to pay employees while they are on \n     active duty.\n       The bill is currently before the House Subcommittee on \n     Civil Service and Agency Organization. The U.S. Senate passed \n     a pay-gap provision for federal employees, but it was cut out \n     of the final version of a supplemental appropriations bill.\n       ``It is a heavy enough sacrifice to pick up and go to \n     Iraq,'' Lantos said. ``There is no reason to have a financial \n     hardship as well.''\n       Fortunately for Hellesto, his financial burden has eased. \n     After returning home in July, he was able to work overtime to \n     get his family's finances back on track. He recently bought a \n     home in Antioch and has a fourth child on the way.\n       But he knows things could change quickly again.\n       ``If they asked me to go back today, I would do it,'' \n     Hellesto said. ``But if I didn't get my per diem allowance, I \n     would have to sell my house.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n   [From the Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal, Apr. 26, 2004]\n\n        He Helped Rebuild Iraq, Now He Must Rebuild His Business\n\n                          (By Timothy Roberts)\n\n       When Army Reservist Michael Malone left his new bride and \n     his home in San Jose for Iraq 16 months ago, his computer \n     business had seven employees and an office on Taylor Street. \n     Today the employees of Star Technologies are gone, and his \n     business partner and he have the furniture from their vacated \n     office stacked in their garages.\n       He's still in business, but struggling.\n       ``The world came crashing down,'' says Mr. Malone, ``and he \n     (partner Erik Johnson) had to try to hold it up like Atlas.''\n       Says Mr. Johnson: ``First we had the tech bust, then the \n     impact from 9/11 and then Mike got call up. That was a whole \n     lot of blows one right after the other''.\n       Reservists know they may be called to action at any time, \n     but with military resources stretched thin in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan, the Pentagon is increasingly relying on the \n     reserves to make up for shortages in the regular, volunteer \n     forces. The 34-year-old Mr. Malone, who has served in the \n     reserves for 16 years and holds the rank of captain, \n     anticipated a short-term assignment.\n       ``It's one of the challenges of being a small-business \n     owner,'' he said of his Army Reserve commitment. ``You plan \n     for it--just not for 16 months.''\n       Naval Reservist Frank Jewett, a small business consultant \n     with Compass Consulting Group in San Jose, is expecting to \n     head overseas for training soon, but wonders if he won't also \n     be deployed for something more than training.\n       ``You have to have a plan,'' says Mr. Jewett, who is also \n     the vice president of the Board of Trustees of West Valley-\n     Mission College. ``You need to talk with your employer and \n     make sure they will support you.''\n       Some companies in the Valley have recently expanded their \n     support of reservists. Up until the war on terrorism, Intel \n     offered full salary to reservists for 30 days a year. Now it \n     offers 180 days a year of full pay. It also has expanded \n     child care benefits, says spokesman Mark Pettinger.\n       But the challenge to small businesses became apparent in \n     the late 1990s, when the military began to tap the reserves \n     for troop commitments in the Balkans. In 1999, Congress \n     created the Military Reservists Economic Injury Disaster Loan \n     to be offered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. \n     Business owners with essential employees returning from \n     active duty have 90 days from the reservist's discharge to \n     apply for up to $1.5 million offered at what is now 2.7 \n     percent interest.\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\n       The first loans were made in Aaugust 2001. When reserve \n     units were called up for the war in Afghanistan, the loan \n     program was expanded to include reservists from that and \n     subsequent wars.\n       Since then the SBA has made $114.5 million in such loans, \n     although according to the SBA's Western District office only \n     $1.2 million in loans has been made to Californians. Only 11 \n     loans have been issued to small businesses with California \n     addresses. The only address close to Silicon Valley is in \n     Watsonville.\n       ``We've had this program since 2001, and frankly that's not \n     a whole lot of loans for three years,'' says SBA spokesman \n     Karl Whittington in the Sacramento office, which handles \n     disaster loans for the Western states.\n       Mr. Malone went to the University of Washington to earn a \n     degree in mathematics on a ROTC scholarship. He was committed \n     to at least eight years of reserve service. Liking the \n     camaraderie of what he describes as the ``entrepreneurs and \n     go-getters'' among the troops, he stayed in for twice that \n     long. He serves in the 1397 Terminal Transport Brigade, which \n     is based in Mare Island, although he was assigned to the 368 \n     Engineer Battalion, based in Londenderry, N.H., in Iraq.\n       Mr. Malone started Star Technologies in 1995 with Mr. \n     Johnson. They began with tech support and later expanded to \n     include Web hosting, a move that helped give them a steady \n     source of revenue. In 2000, a client came to them and asked \n     them to solve a problem: keeping track of real estate \n     appraisals. With that inquiry, Star Technologies launched \n     into software development and created eAppraisal Flow.\n       Today, however, Mr. Malone is focused on just getting word \n     out that Star Technology is still around and looking for \n     customers. He just joined the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber \n     of Commerce and has been making visits to small businesses to \n     offer his Web hosting and tech support services.\n       ``You have to talk to people,'' he says. ``That's how you \n     get business.''\n       In his spare time he's giving thought to designing a \n     battle-ready lap-top computer that would allow officers to \n     connect to secure and standard networks at the same time and \n     provide position data with map overlays.\n       He still likes the Army, although with a new wife and three \n     children from a previous marriage and a business to rebuild, \n     he's not eager for any more overseas assignments.\n       ``If Uncle Sam calls again, I'll go,'' says Capt. Malone. \n     ``But it would be the last time--if it's any time soon--\n     because I have to rebuild my business.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Apr. 22, 2003]\n\n                     Reservists Under Economic Fire\n\n                            (By Kathy Kiely)\n\n       Washington.--Drastic pay cuts. Bankruptcy. Foreclosed \n     homes. They aren't exactly the kind of challenges that \n     members of America's military reserves signed up for when \n     they volunteered to serve their country.\n       But for many, the biggest threat to the home front isn't \n     Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden. It's the bill collector.\n       Four in 10 members of the National Guard or reserves lose \n     money when they leave their civilian jobs for active duty, \n     according to a Pentagon survey taken in 2000. Of 1.2 million \n     members, 223,000 are on active duty around the world.\n       Concern is growing in Congress, and several lawmakers in \n     both parties have introduced legislation to ease the \n     families' burden.\n       Janet Wright says she ``sat down and cried'' when she \n     realized how little money she and her children, Adelia, 5, \n     and Carolyn, 2, would have to live on when her husband was \n     sent to the Middle East. In his civilian job with an \n     environmental cleanup company, Russell Wright makes $60,000 a \n     year--twice what he'll be paid as a sergeant in the Marine \n     Forces Reserve. Back in Hammond, LA, his wife, who doesn't \n     have a paying job, is pouring the kids more water and less \n     milk. She is trying to accelerate Carolyn's potty training \n     schedule to save on diapers.\n       She doesn't know how long she'll have to pinch pennies. \n     Like his fellow reservists, Russell Wright has been called up \n     for one year. he could be sent home sooner, or the military \n     could exercise its option to extend his tour of duty for a \n     second year. Even so, Janet Wright considers her family \n     lucky: She can still pay the mortgage, and the children's \n     pediatrician accepts Tricare, the military health plan.\n       Ray Korizon, a 23-year veteran with the Air Force Reserve \n     and an employee of the Federal Aviation Administration, says \n     his income will also be cut in half if his unit ships out. \n     Korizon, who lives in Schaumburg, IL, knows the financial \n     costs of doing his patriotic duty from bitter experience. \n     Before the Persian Gulf War in 1991, he owned a Chicago \n     construction company with 26 employees. He was sent overseas \n     for six months and lost the business.\n       Still, he never considered leaving the reserve. Korizon \n     says he enjoys the work and the camaraderie. But he worries \n     about whether his two kids can continue to see the same \n     doctor when he shifts to military health coverage. ``It's \n     hard to go out and do the job you want to do when you're \n     worried about things back home,'' he says.\n       Once regarded as ``weekend warriors,'' they have become an \n     integral part of U.S. battle plans. Call-ups have been longer \n     and more frequent.\n       ``The last time you'd see this type of mobilization \n     activity was during World War II,'' says Maj. Charles Kohler \n     of the Maryland National Guard. Of the Maryland Guard's 8,000 \n     members, 3,500 are on active duty. Kohler knows several who \n     are in serious financial trouble. One had to file for \n     bankruptcy after a yearlong deployment, during which his \n     take-home pay fell by two-thirds.\n       Stories like that are the result of a shift in military \n     policy. Since the end of the Cold War, the ranks of the full-\n     time military have been reduced by one-third. The Pentagon \n     has increasingly relied on the nation's part-time soldiers. \n     More than 525,000 members of the Guard and reserves have been \n     mobilized in the 12 years since the Persian Gulf War. For the \n     previous 36 years, the figure was 199,877.\n       The end of fighting in Iraq isn't likely to lessen the \n     pressure on the Guard and reserves. They'll stay on with the \n     regular military in a peacekeeping role. Nobody knows how \n     long, but in Bosnia, Guard members and reservists are on duty \n     seven years after the mission began.\n       Korizon, who maintains avionics systems on C-130 cargo \n     planes, has been told his Milwaukee-based reserve unit may be \n     called up for humanitarian missions.\n       Some of the specialists who are in the greatest demand--\n     physicians and experts in biological and chemical agents--\n     command six-figure salaries in civilian life. The average pay \n     for a midlevel officer is $50,000 to $55,000.\n       ``They were prepared to be called up. They were prepared to \n     serve their country,'' Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., says. \n     ``They were not prepared to be part of a regular force and be \n     away from home 200 to 300 days a year.''\n       Concerns are growing on Capitol Hill. As the nation's \n     reliance on the Guard and reserves has increased, ``funding \n     for training and benefits simply have not kept up,'' says \n     Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, a member of the \n     Armed Services Committee.\n       The General Accounting Office, Congress' auditing arm, is \n     studying pay and benefits for Guard members and reservists. A \n     report is due in September. Meanwhile, members of Congress \n     are pushing several bills to ease the burden:\n       Closing the pay gap. Some employers make up the difference \n     in salary for reservists on active duty. But many, including \n     the federal government do not. A bill sponsored by Democratic \n     Sens. Mikulski, Dick Durbin of Illinois and Mary Landrieu of \n     Louisiana would require the federal government to make up \n     lost pay. Landrieu is doing that for one legislative aide who \n     has been called up for active duty.\n       She has also introduced a bill to give private employers a \n     50% tax credit if they subsidize reservists' salaries.\n       Closing the health gap. Once on active duty, reservists, \n     Guard members and their families are covered by Tricare.\n       But for the 75% of reserve and guard families living more \n     than 50 miles from military treatment facilities, finding \n     physicians who participate in Tricare can be difficult.\n       A measure sponsored by Sen. Mike DeWine, a Republican from \n     Ohio, would give reservists and Guard members the option of \n     making Tricare their regular insurer or having the federal \n     government pay premiums for their civilian health insurance \n     while they are on active duty. Several senior Democrats, \n     including Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota \n     and Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, support the idea.\n       Keeping creditors at bay. The Soldiers and Sailors Relief \n     Act caps interest rates on mortgages, car payments and other \n     debts owed by military personnel at 6% while they are on \n     active duty. But Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina \n     Republican who is the Senate's only reservist, says the act \n     doesn't apply to debts that are held in the name of a spouse \n     who is not a member of the military. He plans to introduce \n     legislation to cover spouses.\n       Despite a groundswell of support for troops, none of the \n     bills is assured of passage. There's concern among some \n     administration officials about the cost of some of the \n     proposals. In addition, some at the Pentagon think morale \n     would be hurt if some reservists end up with higher incomes \n     than their counterparts in the regular ranks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I compliment the Senator from Louisiana. \nThis is a very important amendment. The reservists clearly, \nparticularly under the current circumstances, deserve at least the \nprovision suggested by the Senator from Louisiana. The Senator can be \nassured this Senator will fight vigorously for her amendment in \nconference. It is a very important amendment.\n  Madam President, I believe there is no more debate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the parties yield back all time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. All time is yielded back.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.\n   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the continuing activation of \nmilitary reservists to serve in Iraq and the war on\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\nterror has imposed a tremendous burden on many of our country's \nbusinesses, especially our small businesses. Too many small businesses, \nwhen their employees are asked to leave their jobs and serve the \nNation, are unable to continue operating successfully and face severe \nfinancial difficulties, even bankruptcy. That is why I am pleased to \njoin Senator Landrieu to provide all American businesses with a tax \ncredit to help them continue to pay their employees who are called to \nactive duty and to help small businesses temporarily replace reservists \nwho are called up.\n  This amendment expands upon the Small Business Military Reservist Tax \nCredit Act that I introduced last year which provides help to small \nbusinesses in paying the difference in salary for their reservist \nemployees called up to active duty. My legislation, S. 1595, also \nprovided a tax credit to help small businesses cover the cost of \ntemporarily replacing that employee while he or she is serving our \nNation.\n  I worked with Senator Landrieu to develop this amendment which honors \nall patriotic employers who continue to pay the salaries of their \nemployees who are members of the National Guard and Reserve and are \ncalled up to active duty in the war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq and \nelsewhere. I believe this amendment will encourage all employers, \nespecially small businesses, to pay their reservist employees when they \nface a reduction in salary due to their activation. Employers who \ncontinue to pay their reservists will be eligible to receive a tax \ncredit up to $15,000 of the wages they pay to members of the Guard and \nReserve for as long as the reservist is on active duty status. The JOBS \nAct, which we seek to amend, only provides a tax credit for reservists \non active duty status for 1 year and does not provide any assistance \nfor small businesses to help temporarily replace their reservists. I \nbelieve this approach is insufficient and that our amendment is needed \nto help reservists for each day of their service to our Nation and to \nprovide important assistance to small businesses.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Landrieu has included provision of my \nbill to help small businesses cover the cost of temporarily replacing \nthe reservist employee while he or she is serving our Nation. Today, \nmany small employers are currently having a difficult time hiring \ntemporary workers to replace their employees who have been called up to \nactive duty in the national Guard or Reserve. The United Sates Chamber \nof Commerce estimates that 70 percent of military reservists called to \nactive duty work in small- or medium-size companies. The Landrieu-Kerry \namendment will provide a tax credit of 50 percent up to $6,000 to help \nsmall employers defray the costs of hiring a worker to replace a \nguardsman or reservist who has been called up to active duty. Small \nmanufacturers will be eligible for a tax credit of 50 percent up to \n$10,000 to assist in hiring a temporary worker.\n  To fight our wars and meet our military responsibilities, the United \nStates supplements its regular, standing military with reservists, \ncitizen soldiers who serve nobly. Not since World War II have so many \nNational Guard members been called to serve abroad. President Bush \nauthorized the activation of up to 1 million military reservists for up \nto 2 years of active duty. Today, there are about 170,000 reserves on \nactive duty in the war against terrorism--nearly half of the more than \n350,000 called to duty since the attacks of September 11, 2001. Many \nare serving admirably around the world, performing critical wartime \nfunctions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Our Nation does not go \ninto battle without members of the National Guard and Reserve, and we \nare all grateful for their service.\n  Just this week, the Bush administration authorized the activation of \nan additional 47,000 reservists. The extension will cause significant \neconomic difficulties for the reservists, their families and their \nemployers that are left behind. Beyond the hardship of leaving their \nfamilies, their homes and their regular employment, more than 41 \npercent of military reservists and National Guard members face a pay \ncut when they are called for active duty in our Armed Forces. Many if \nthese reservists have families who depend upon that paycheck to survive \nand can least afford a substantial reduction in pay.\n  The large number of reservists being called up to active duty has \nhurt many small businesses across the Nation and may impact the number \nwho are willing to re-enlist in the National Guard and Reserve in the \nfuture. In January, the Commission of the Army Reserve, Lt. General \nJames R. Helmly, warned of a recruiting-retention crisis in the future \nfor the National Guard and Reserve. A recent U.S. military \nquestionnaire of returning Army National Guard soldiers projected a \nresignation rate of double what it was back in November 2001. From \nOctober to December 2003, almost one-quarter of the Guard members who \nhave had the opportunity to re-enlist have opted not to do so. \nRecently, the U.S. Army developed a plan to pay reservists up to \n$10,000 to re-enlist to stop a developing problem.\n  That is why the Federal Government must take action to help \nbusinesses weather the loss of an employee to active duty and protect \nemployees and their families from suffering a pay cut to serve our \nNation. It is imperative that we help families of reservists maintain \ntheir standard of living while their loved one serves our Nation. We \nmust also ensure that the cost of that service does not force \nbusinesses into financial ruin. We must ensure that our great tradition \nof citizen soldiers does not fade or cease because of the effect that \nservice has on work and family. The Landrieu-Kerry amendment will help \nachieve their important goals and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we continue to be increasingly reliant on \nthe men and women of our Reserve forces and National Guard. In fact, 40 \npercent of all the ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are composed \nof National Guard and Reserve forces as well as nearly all of the \nground forces in Kosovo, Bosnia, and the Sinai. Many of these soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines leave behind friends, families, and \ncareers to defend our Nation. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of \npolicy makers to ensure we look after the needs of our patriots.\n  Many reservists that are called to active duty end up making less \nmoney with the military than they did in their civilian job. This drop \nin pay has placed a hardship on many of the men and women serving in \nthe Reserve components who are called to active duty. When the military \ncalls reservists and guardsmen to active duty, the last thing our \nNation wants is to hurt the reservist's families as a result. This \namendment is designed to address this problem by allowing private \ncompanies to pay the difference between the servicemember's Reserve pay \nand his civilian pay. If the employer chooses to pay this benefit, the \nFederal Government will give the company a tax credit of 50 percent of \nthe difference in pay, up to $3,000.\n  Our Nation's reservists and guardsmen are an amazing resource of \nexperience, knowledge and dedication. If we are going to continue to \nrely on our citizen soldiers, we must make sure that they receive their \nfair share of benefits and that their families are provided for in \ntheir absence. I will always support responsible legislation that \naccomplishes this important goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Landrieu \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3123) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3138\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I call for regular order with regard to the Hutchison \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the regular order. Is there further \ndebate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I believe there is no further debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Hutchison \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3138) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent Senators Hatch and Pryor be \nadded as cosponsors to the Hutchison amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote on the \nprevious two amendments en bloc.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay the motions on the table en bloc.\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\n  The motions to lay on the table en bloc were agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I promised the Senator from South Carolina we would \nhave a little colloquy on an issue he was concerned about. Could we do \nthat right now?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Sure.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask the Senator from South Carolina be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I thank Senator Grassley.\n\n\n                            chinese currency\n\n  I rise today to express my deep concern about the Chinese \ngovernment's continued manipulation of its currency. In my mind, the \nChinese government's adherence to a currency valuation system that does \nnot rest on market-based principles is wrong and constitutes an unfair \ncompetitive advantage. It is time for the unfair valuation of the yuan \nto stop. I understand the administration has taken steps to address the \nproblem and some progress has been made. But this is a serious problem. \nClearly more needs to be done.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I join my \ncolleague from South Carolina in expressing concern about the way in \nwhich the Chinese currency is valued. I certainly agree that it is a \nserious problem that needs to be taken seriously. A fairly valued \ncurrency is in China's own long-term interests, and is key for moving \nto a market driven economy. I was pleased to hear that Secretary Snow \nwas assured that interim steps are being taken and that progress in \nthis area will continue.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate the fact that the Chairman recognizes the \nserious nature of this problem. Unfair manipulation of currency cannot \nbe tolerated. I would like to see additional progress on this issue in \nthe next 60 to 90 days. If progress is not forthcoming, I hope the \nChairman would join me in supporting Senate hearings. However, these \nhearings should only be the first step. Should China fail to make \nsubstantial progress and the Senate fail to address this issue \nsubstantively, appropriate and responsible legislation may then be \nnecessary, and I reserve the right to attach our China currency \namendment to any available legislation that comes before the Senate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I do appreciate the importance of this issue. If we do \nnot see substantial progress toward adoption of a market-based currency \nvaluation system, I would support Senate hearings at the appropriate \ntime.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Iowa, and look forward to \nworking with him to continue to pressure the Chinese government to \nadopt a market-based currency valuation system.\n\n\n                               section 29\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, my amendment, cosponsored by Senators \nVoinovich and DeWine, extends the Section 29 credit to new coke \nfacilities to encourage the construction of new facilities. This \nprovision is important because the U.S. currently produces below the \ndomestic demand for coke, and the situation will likely worsen in the \nfuture. Much of the country's coke capacity is over 20 years old, and \nmost existing ovens are near the end of their useful lives. I \nunderstand that the Finance Committee chairman, Senator Grassley, \nprefers to address this issue during conference and not at this time. I \nthank the chairman for his commitment to this provision and urge his \nstrong support for extending the Section 29 credit to new coke \nfacilities in conference.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania for his commitment to the Section 29 extension to new coke \nfacilities. Although I am supportive of the provision, the most \nappropriate time to address it is during the conference. I look forward \nto working with Senator Santorum and the two Senators from Ohio to \ninclude this amendment in the conference report.\n\n\n                                privacy\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, my colleague from New York and my \ncolleague from Minnesota have filed a noteworthy amendment to the \nJumpstart Our Business Strength Act, S. 1637. The amendment raises the \nvery important issue of how in this global economy we can protect the \nprivacy of personally identifiable information that is transmitted \nabroad. Senator Clinton and her staff have worked diligently with me \nand my staff to find a way for the Senate to address these issues. The \namendment raises significant issues that I believe will benefit from \nbeing made part of any appropriate hearing this session in the Finance \nCommittee. They have graciously recognized the importance of moving \nforward on the JOBS bill. That is why I have agreed to invite Senators \nClinton and Dayton to testify on this issue during the Senate Finance \nCommittee's hearing on offshoring. My hope is that we will schedule \nthat hearing soon.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Montana \nfor his legislative skill and determination in managing the JOBS bill \non this side of the aisle. I also thank him for the patience and \nconsideration he and his staff have shown in working with me on the \nClinton-Dayton privacy amendment. I and my colleague Senator Dayton \nlook forward to testifying on this issue in front of the Finance \nCommittee because it is vitally important to maintain the privacy of \nour constituents and Americans throughout the Nation.\n\n\n         New Markets Tax Credit and Economic Substance Doctrine\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy \nwith my good friend, Senator Baucus, regarding the economic substance \nprovision of the Jumpstart Our Business Strength, JOBS Act, S. 1637.\n  I ask my colleague to explain what, if any, impact the codification \nof economic substance doctrine would have on the new markets tax \ncredit.\n  As my colleague knows, the new markets tax credit, NMTC, was signed \ninto law in 2000 and is the largest Federal economic development \ninitiative to be authorized in 15 years. The credit promises to spur \nsome $15 billion in new private sector investment in economic \ndevelopment activity in poor communities throughout the country.\n  The idea behind the credit is that there are good viable business and \neconomic development opportunities in poor communities that lack access \nto capital. The NMTC is designed to address this capital gap by \nproviding the incentive of a Federal tax credit to individuals or \ncorporations that invest in Community Development Entities, CDEs, \nworking in these communities.\n  While many of the businesses that receive financing through the \ncredit will present good business opportunities, it is possible that \nsome projects, because of their market, will present only limited \neconomic return on top of the credit. In many cases, the investor's \nchief incentive will be the tax benefit available through the new \nmarkets tax credit.\n  There is some concern among investors and potential NMTC investors \nthat legislation crafted to codify the economic substance doctrine and \ncurtail transactions that are simply motivated by tax incentives would \napply to and have negative impact on the NMTC.\n  With $2.5 billion in new markets tax credits having been allocated to \nCDEs around the country and another $3.5 billion expected to be awarded \nwithin the next several months, it is critical that the investor \nmarkets get some clarification on this issue.\n  The NMTC holds great promise for communities throughout West Virginia \nwhere economic revitalization and business development are sorely \nneeded. It is my understanding that the economic substance doctrine \ncontained in S. 1637 does not apply and I would appreciate my \ncolleague's comments on this issue.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the comments of the Senator and share his \ncommitment to the new markets tax credit.\n  The Senator is correct. The intent of the economic substance \nprovision in the JOBS bill is clearly to uphold and protect \ncongressionally mandated tax benefits while curtailing unintended \nabuses of the tax code. I assure the Senator that the new markets tax \ncredit would not be adversely affected by this provision.\n  As the Senator knows, our intent in codifying the economic substance \ndoctrine is to curtail the use of abusive tax shelters that have no \neconomic substance or business purpose other than reducing the Federal \ntax liability of the taxpayer. This is clearly not the case of the new \nmarkets tax credit.\n\n[[Page S5206]]\n\n  We attempted to clarify the intent of this provision in the Finance \nCommittee report, 108-192, in a footnote that states:\n\n       If tax benefits are clearly contemplated and expected by \n     the language and purpose of the relevant authority it is not \n     intended that the tax benefit be disallowed if the only \n     reason for the disallowance is that the transaction fails to \n     meet the economic substance doctrine as defined in this \n     provision.\n\n  The report also specifically identifies the low income housing tax \ncredit and the historic rehabilitation credit as examples of tax \nbenefits that would not be taken into account in measuring potential \ntax benefits. These credits were noted as examples of the types of tax \nbenefits that would not be considered in applying the economic \nsubstance doctrine.\n  The new markets tax credit was authorized with the clear intent of \nusing a tax subsidy to attract private investors to business and \neconomic development opportunities in poor communities--investment \nopportunities that otherwise might not be able to secure such \ninvestment capital. It is our intent that the NMTC be treated like the \nLIHTC and the HRTC and protected as a congressionally mandated tax \nbenefit.\n\n\n                    canadian softwood lumber dispute\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I came to the floor today to introduce an amendment to the \nFSC/ETI bill relating to the U.S. approval of NAFTA panel decisions. \nThe handling of the current case before the NAFTA panel regarding \nCanadian softwood lumber imports gives me cause for concern. There are \nsubstantial allegations that one panelist judging the case is, at the \nsame time, appearing as a private lawyer in two other antidumping cases \nbefore the International Trade Commission which involve similar issues \nas the Canadian lumber case. This creates at the very least the \nappearance of impropriety and a conflict of interest. Indeed, the USTR \nhas taken the position that the panelist is in violation of the code \nestablished to prevent conflicts of interest involving panelists. \nHowever, it seems that Canada has been able to block any action to \nremove this panelist from the case.\n  This situation is unacceptable and indicates that fundamental reform \nof the NAFTA panel process is required. We cannot allow NAFTA panelists \nwith a conflict of interest to rule in these cases, especially since \ntheir rulings are equivalent to a Federal Court order. At the very \nleast, such panel decisions should be subject to Presidential review \nbefore being implemented. I have an amendment that would implement such \na review procedure. However, while this is an urgent matter that \naffects the outcome of the largest trade case in U.S. history, I \nrecognize that the Senate is close to completing the FSC/ETI bill. I do \nnot want to beleaguer that eventuality, so I am willing to withdraw \nthis amendment, and agree instead to work with my colleagues, \nparticularly on the Senate Finance Committee, to have this issue firmly \naddressed by the Senate in the near future.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I want to join my colleague from Oregon in support of \nthis amendment, which cannot be considered for inclusion in the \nlegislation at hand. I concur that action must be taken to ensure the \nintegrity of the Chapter 19 Panel Process. There is a clear breakdown \nof due process with respect to Chapter 19. The decision by the NAFTA \nPanel to reject the UTC's injury analysis in the softwood lumber \ndispute between the U.S. and Canada proves to me that the credibility \nof the NAFTA Panel process is in serious jeopardy. By imposing an \nimpossible standard for proving ``material injury'', this NAFTA Panel \nseems to be saying that it will reject any antidumping or \ncounterveiling duty in any circumstance. If the ANFTA dispute panel \nprocess wants to maintain its credibility, the panelists themselves \nmust respect the limits of their responsibility. No country will allow \nthe dispute panel process to undermine the integrity of perfectly valid \ntrade remedies. Action must be taken to address this situation, and I \ncan give my colleague my assurance that I will work to find an \nopportunity for the Senate to consider his amendment in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I want to echo the concerns my colleagues from Oregon and \nMontana have on this issue. Resolution of the Canadian softwood lumber \ndispute has gone on far too long. Meanwhile our domestic industry \ncontinues to suffer from subsidized and dumped Canadian lumber.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The forestry industry is important to the State of \nGeorgia. Let's take a look at the facts: Georgia's total land area \ncovers 36.8 million acres of which 66 percent of that is forested; my \nhome State has the sixth largest percentage of forested lands in the \ncountry which is twice the national average; and, commercial forest \nland in Georgia covers approximately 23.8 million acres, more than any \nother state. Georgia's forest industry generates 177,000 jobs where \nemployees directly or indirectly work in industries supporting forest \nproducts manufacturing.\n  This is why I sponsored a resolution in the House of Representatives \nin 2001 that highlighted the problems associated with the importation \nof unfairly subsidized Canadian lumber and urged the administration to \nvigorously enforce U.S. trade laws with regard to the importation of \nCanadian lumber. One of my highest priorities has been to see this \ntrade issue resolved and limit the injuries caused to the U.S. timber \nand lumber industries by the importation of unfairly traded lumber.\n  Today, Georgia's forestry industry is in serious jeopardy. That is \nwhy I echo the comments of my colleagues regarding the conflict of \ninterest involving a NAFTA Panelist who will be hearing the Canadian \nSoftwood Lumber case. This case is very important to the future of \nGeorgia's forestry industry. This issue and the need to reform the \nNAFTA panel process must be handled in an expedient manner. I urge my \ncolleagues to address this issue as soon as possible.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank my colleagues. This is a critical matter that the \nSenate needs to exercise its oversight responsibilities upon. If this \nissue cannot be addressed in the very near future, my colleagues and I \nwill have no choice but to bring this amendment back to the floor on \nanother bill to have an forthright discussion about ensuring the \nconstitutionally afforded due process U.S. citizens and interests must \nhave in NAFTA disputes. I also want to applaud the administration in \nparticular the U.S. Trade Representative, as well as the International \nTrade Commission, for acting steadfastly to enforce U.S. trade law. But \ntheir efforts are being thwarted by the current NAFTA Panel rules. This \nmust be changed.\n  Mr. SMITH. I would like to engage the Senator from Iowa in a colloquy \nregarding section 102 of the bill in order to clarify the Senator's \nintentions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. I want to thank you for your strong leadership on this \nvery important piece of legislation and call your attention to one \nspecific provision in S. 1637 known as the domestic production \nactivities deduction. As you know, your bill includes a provision that \nallows for a deduction for income from manufacturing done in the United \nStates. However, as I understand, the provisions phases in the \ndeduction much more slowly for companies that also manufacture abroad. \nAt a time when American manufacturing jobs are leaving our country in \nrecord numbers, we need to support all companies that employ Americans, \nnot penalize them. I know that we agree that multinational companies \nshould not be penalized merely because they also manufacture abroad. \nThus, I would like to clarify that it is your intent to urge your \ncolleagues during the Senate/House conference deliberations on this \nbill to eliminate this penalty in the final bill that is sent to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator is correct. It is my intent to urge my \ncolleagues to minimize this penalty in the final bill that is sent to \nthe President for his signature.\n\n\n                    income forecast method provision\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus, regarding a provision \nin the bill that provides needed clarification and helps to insure an \naccurate reflection of taxpayers' income.\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\n  The provision I refer to resolves certain uncertainties that have \narisen recently regarding the proper application of the income forecast \nmethod, which is the predominant cost recovery method for films, \nvideotapes, and sound recordings. The provision merely reinforces the \ncontinued efficacy of existing case law and longstanding industry \npractice. For example, the provision clarifies that, for purposes of \nthe income forecast method, the anticipated costs of participations and \nresiduals may be included in a property's cost basis at the beginning \nof the property's depreciable life. This was the holding of the Ninth \nCircuit in Transamerica Corporation v. U.S. (1993). The provision also \nclarifies that the Tax Court's holding in Associated Patentees v. \nComm., 4 TC 979 (1945), remains valid law. Thus, taxpayers may elect to \ndeduct participations and residuals as they are paid. Finally, the \nprovision clarifies that the income forecast formula is calculated \nusing gross income, without reduction for distribution costs.\n  I would like to confirm my understanding with Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus that by providing these clarifications and eliminating \nuncertainty the provision was intended to put to reset needless and \ncostly disputes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am happy to confirm the understanding of the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana. The provision was adopted to \nprovide needed clarifications in order to eliminate the uncertainties \nthat have arisen regarding the proper application of the income \nforecast method. I believe the disputes that have arisen regarding the \nmechanics of the income forecast formula are extremely unproductive and \nan inefficient use of both taxpayer and limited tax administration \nresources. By adopting these clarifications, I believe the committee \nintended to end any disputes and prevent any further waste of both \ntaxpayer and Government resources in resolving these disputes. Any \nexisting disputes should be resolved expeditiously in a manner \nconsistent with the clarifications included in the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley. The disputes resulting from any \nuncertainty regarding the proper application of the income forecast \nmethod are extremely unproductive and wasteful. To avoid further waste, \nresolution of any disputes must be resolved in a manner consistent with \nthe clarifications contained in the bill.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank both of my distinguished colleagues for this \nimportant clarification. I hope this puts to rest any uncertainty and \nwasteful disputes regarding the proper application of the income \nforecast method.\n\n\n                               kiddie tax\n\n  Mr. FRIST. In February of this year, a constituent wrote me to \nexpress his concerns about the negative impact expansion of the \n``kiddie tax'' would have upon his family, and more specifically his \nquadriplegic daughter. His daughter's assets are in a trust \nadministered by an independent third party trust department of an \ninvestment firm. The assets were awarded to his daughter by a court by \nlaw pursuant to a settlement agreement after she suffered from injuries \nat birth. The assets in his daughter's trust are to be used to provide \nher income after she should have been able to move into the work force. \nThe funds will help pay for medical care and personal caregiver \nservices.\n  The situation is described in more detail in a letter to me from my \nconstituent, Mr. Gary Domm. At this time, I ask unanimous consent this \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                            Gary W. Domm, CFP,\n\n                                Germantown, TN, February 10, 2004.\n\nSubject: The planned continuation of the U.S. ``Kiddie Tax'' laws until \n  age 18. How Tennessee Individual Income Tax is more fair. Enough is \n                                Enough!\n\n                     Attention: Legislative Staff.\n\n     Dr. Bill Frist, MD,\n     Memphis, TN\n       Dear Dr. Frist: As you are surely aware, the Internal \n     Revenue Code has a provision taxing unearned income of \n     children under age 14 at their parents upper tax rates. This \n     regulation is often referred to as the ``Kiddie Tax.'' \n     Obviously, the whole theory behind this law is to stop \n     investments from being transferred to the children at a lower \n     tax rate by the parents or maybe grandparents. Fair enough. \n     However, the law as interpreted in a court case in 1992, said \n     that it did not matter what the source or the purpose of \n     those assets were. This is a court ruling that needs to be \n     overturned by legislation. If the ``Kiddie Tax'' is suppose \n     to be a tax on assets transferred from relatives, then it \n     should be administered in that way but not applied to all \n     unearned income owned by children.\n       My quadriplegic daughter, who can not speak and will always \n     be dependent on full time care, is subject to the ``Kiddie \n     Tax'' law. My wife and I would be considered to have above \n     average income, both earned and unearned. Therefore my \n     daughter's unearned income is taxed at a much higher tax rate \n     than if she was the child of lower income parents. My \n     daughter's assets are in a trust administered by an \n     independent third party trust department of an investment \n     firm. These assets were awarded to my daughter by a court of \n     law. My daughter's assets were never mine or under the \n     control of relatives. I probably need not mention that the \n     federal trust tax rates are even higher so there is no \n     benefit to these assets being taxed instead in a trust tax \n     return.\n       In my case, the assets in my daughter's trust are to \n     provide her income after she should have been able to move \n     into the work force under normal circumstances. They will pay \n     for her medical care, personal caregiver services, and other \n     expenses that most people do not have to endure until late in \n     life but certainly not for their entire life. My wife and I \n     rarely request reimbursement of expenses from these assets \n     for the extra care that our daughter requires. Our plan is to \n     financially provide for our daughter until she is at least 21 \n     years old. Yet, my daughter's assets are not allowed to grow \n     based on their own tax level. They are instead subjected to \n     usurious tax rates rather than progressively higher tax rates \n     as the income increases.\n       The State of Tennessee has had an exemption to state income \n     tax since the mid 1990's on unearned income derived from \n     assets for a quadriplegic person. Apparently, the state \n     recognized that people that are disabled and incapable of \n     ever working, need a tax break in order not to be more \n     dependent on government and its agencies.\n       It is my understanding that Congress is now considering \n     extending the age for the ``Kiddie Tax Law'' until age 18. \n     Enough is enough. I have waited patiently for my daughter to \n     reach the age of 14. She will be 14 this year and will no \n     longer be subject to being taxed at a rate higher than her \n     income level. That is, unless Congress changes the laws.\n       In my case, leaving the ``Kiddie Tax'' regulations alone \n     would solve my problem, but that would avoid collecting the \n     extra tax dollars for four more years on families that have \n     transferred wealth to their children. My problem can also be \n     solved by removing the ``Kiddie Tax'' in the case of \n     quadriplegics and other people that will never be able to \n     work and support themselves. The federal tax laws need to \n     consider the Tennessee tax regulations and provide exemptions \n     where needed. I have no doubt that if my daughter could, she \n     would gladly give away her investments in exchange for a \n     normal life. Instead the government is subjecting her \n     investment income to highest taxes just because of her \n     parents.\n       Correcting this injustice will not gain many votes \n     politically, but I am sure you can see that it is the right \n     thing to do. I am more than willing to discuss this by \n     telephone with anyone who wishes more specific information. \n     Being a Tennessee resident and senator, I am sure you can \n     obtain copies of the exemption regulations for the state. It \n     is item 3, under the exemption section in the rules mailed \n     with the Tennessee tax forms. Also the exemption box is \n     clearly shown on the first page of the Tennessee Tax Return.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Gary Domm.\n  Mr. FRIST. According to Mr. Domm, current tax law permits taxation of \nthis unearned trust income in excess of $1,600 at the child's tax rate \nupon the child's 14th birthday. Up until the age of 14, the income was \ntaxed at the parent's rate of taxation. This year, Mr. Domm's daughter \nwill turn 14 and will no longer be subject to a tax rate higher than \nher income level.\n  Unfortunately, however, a proposed change in S. 1637 would call for \ntaxing any unearned income in excess of $1,600 at the parent's income \ntax rate until the age of 18 instead of 14. I ask my colleague from \nIowa, is that accurate?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you for confirming that, Mr. Chairman. I believe \nthat it would be good policy to provide some type of exemption to this \nso called ``kiddie tax'' for Mr. Domm's daughter and others like her. \nThat way, we encourage independence and self-sufficiency and do not \npenalize individuals who have already had to overcome tremendous \nobstacles. Based on that assumption, Mr. Chairman, would you be willing \nto work with me and my staff to create an exemption from this tax for \nMr. Domm's daughter and others similarly situated?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with the Senator from Tennessee that such an \nexception to the ``kiddie tax'' would be\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\ngood public policy. I commit to you that my staff will work with the \nTreasury Department, the Social Security Administration and your staff \nduring conference negotiations to craft language that addresses Mr. \nDomm's concerns but also contains solid anti-abuse language. My hope is \nthat we could place such language in the final version of S. 1637 or \nanother appropriate tax bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chairman for that commitment both personally \nand on behalf of my constituent.\n\n\n                       Brownfield Revitalization\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to engage several of my \ncolleagues in a colloquy regarding an important provision in the \nmanager's substitute amendment to S. 1637. Section 641 of the manager's \namendment was filed by me as an amendment to S. 1637, and it was co-\nsponsored by Senators Chafee, Dole and Lieberman.\n  The language of my amendment is based on S. 1936, the Brownfield \nRevitalization Act of 2003, a bipartisan bill that was introduced last \nyear by Senator Baucus and cosponsored by Senators Inhofe, Dole and \nRockefeller. However, the version of my amendment that is included in \nthe manager's substitute contains several modifications which improve \nit.\n  My amendment relieves tax-exempt entities that invest in, clean up, \nand then re-sell certain brownfield properties from an obscure but \nsignificant provision in the Internal Revenue Code.\n  First, what is a ``brownfield?'' There are various definitions of \nthis term. In the Federal Superfund law, a ``brownfield'' is defined as \n``real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be \ncomplicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous \nsubstance, pollutant, or contaminant.''\n  My own State of New Jersey uses a different definition. It defines a \n``brownfield'' as ``any former or current commercial or industrial site \nthat is currently vacant or underutilized and on which there has been, \nor there is suspected to have been, a discharge of a contaminant.''\n  Brownfields are not necessarily highly contaminated sites. Often, \nthey are moderately or lightly contaminated industrial and commercial \nsites that could be productively re-used if they were cleaned up. In \nfact, the perception of contamination might be the only thing holding \nback a brownfield site from redevelopment.\n  Reuse of a brownfield site is desirable because it preserves an open \n``greenfield'' and can provide an economic stimulus to an inner city or \nclose-in suburban area.\n  Our colleague, Senator Dole, is fully aware of how serious the \nproblem of brownfields is across the nation.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, the North Carolina Department of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources estimates that there are tens of \nthousands of potential brownfield sites in North Carolina. To date 44 \nof these sites have $600 million in committed private investment which \nwas raised with less than $500,000 in Federal funds. These 44 sites \nrepresent a good step forward to address this issue; however, there are \nmany more steps necessary before we can declare victory. The critical \ncomponent to this equation is the greater availability of private \ncapital. Currently, the State of North Carolina has 55 more brownfield \nsites in the pipeline for remediation and the availability of private \ncapital will be essential to this effort.\n  The Nation's mayors have estimated that there are half a million \nbrownfield sites in the United States. Others have said that there may \nbe as many as a million such sites. EPA, in an analysis conducted with \nGeorge Washington University, has estimated that remediation costs for \nall brownfield sites in the country exceed $650 billion. The Chamber of \nCommerce estimates that, at the current rate of cleanup, it could take \nten thousand years to clean up all these sites.\n  According to Environmental Defense, a leading environmental group, \nNew York City alone has over 4000 acres of vacant industrial lands, the \nequivalent of almost four Central Parks' worth of land lying unused in \nthe core of our largest metropolitan area.\n  That is why I am a strong supporter of legislation to make available \ngreater sums of private capital to brownfield remediation efforts. This \nis why I am proud to join with my colleagues, especially Senators \nLautenberg, Chafee, Lieberman and Jeffords to support this proposal to \nallow non-profits to invest in brownfield remediation efforts. I yield \nback to Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In fact, in my own State of New Jersey, the \nDepartment of Environmental Protection oversees ten thousand potential \nbrownfield sites, but admits that many more sites may exist in the \nState that have not yet been identified.\n  I ask Senator Lieberman if he is aware of any barriers in our Tax \nCode that may be hindering the remediation of brownfields sites.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. As my colleagues know, much has been done at both the \nnational and State levels, including our own States, to help clean up \ncontaminated brownfield properties. However, the Federal Tax Code \ncontains a potential roadblock.\n  Section 512 of the Internal Revenue Code establishes an unrelated \nbusiness income tax, or UBIT, on the income that a tax-exempt entity \nderives from a trade or business that is not substantially related to \nits exempt purpose.\n  The UBIT applies to gains from the sale or exchange of property held \nprimarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of such a trade \nor business. The UBIT also applies to gains from the sale or exchange \nof any debt-financed property.\n  These UBIT provisions have reduced the economic attractiveness of \ninvestments in remediation and redevelopment of the nation's brownfield \nsites by tax-exempt entities like university endowments and private \npension funds.\n  According to the Chamber of Commerce, tax-exempt entities hold about \n$7 trillion in financial assets. This is a very large pot of money that \ncould be tapped for brownfield cleanups.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. This large potential funding source for brownfields \nremediation is what my amendment will address by removing one barrier \nto brownfields redevelopment.\n\n  My amendment allows tax-exempt entities to invest in brownfield sites \nwithout the risk of incurring UBIT liability, provided that certain \nconditions are met.\n  First, the appropriate State environmental agency must certify that \nthe property is a brownfield site within the meaning of the Federal \nSuperfund definition.\n  The amendment does not set up a new certification procedure for this \npurpose, but rather piggybacks on a process already in place under \nsection 198 of the Tax Code to provide tax incentives for commercial \nbrownfield developers. In fact, another provision of the manager's \nsubstitute amendment extends section 198 through the end of 2005.\n  Second, the remediation effort must be a significant one. It must \ncost more than $550,000, or 12 percent of the fair market value of the \nsite, determined as if the site were not contaminated. By establishing \nrelatively high thresholds for eligibility, the amendment excludes \nincidentally contaminated property and focuses new capital investment \nat sites that are most in need of assistance.\n  Third, the site must be cleaned up to comply with all environmental \nlaws and regulations.\n  Finally, after the cleanup the state environmental agency or EPA must \ncertify that the property is no longer a brownfield site. In requesting \nsuch a certification, the tax-exempt entity must attest that the \nanticipated future uses of the property are more economically \nproductive or environmentally beneficial than the previous use of the \nproperty. The tax-exempt entity must also attest that it has given \npublic notice of its request for certification.\n  Senator Jeffords, the ranking member on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, has been very helpful in developing modifications to \nthis amendment. Could the Senator from Vermont describe the \nmodifications we have made that are designed to prevent abuse?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am happy to fully support this amendment, as \nmodified. There are three significant modifications:\n  First, a savings clause has been added to make clear that this \namendment to the Tax Code has no impact on anyone's liability under the \nSuperfund statute or any other Federal or State environmental law. Just \nbecause a tax-\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\nentity receives a tax certification signifying that it is not subject \nto the UBIT tax does not mean that it can avoid environmental \nliability.\n  Second, the amendment has been modified to include a definition of \n``substantially complete.'' An entity is eligible for a tax \ncertification if its remedial actions at a brownfield site are complete \nor substantially complete. As originally drafted, the amendment did not \ninclude a definition of the key term ``substantially complete.'' This \ncould have created a loophole that allowed entities to get a tax \nadvantage without fully cleaning up a property. The modification we \nhave made fixes this problem by borrowing EPA's definition of \n``construction complete'' from the Superfund program to define this \nterm.\n  The third modification expands the public notice provision that was \nalready in the amendment. It makes clear that not only must there be \npublic notice, there must also be a meaningful opportunity for public \ncomment. In addition, it makes clear the agency that makes the tax \ncertification, whether EPA or a State agency, must respond to any \nsignificant public comments.\n  In addition, the amendment has been carefully drafted to prevent \nabuse. For example, the taxpayer cannot be the party that caused the \npollution and cannot be otherwise related to the polluter. In addition, \nall transactions, such as purchase and sale of the property, must be \nmade at arms-length with parties unrelated to the taxpayer.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator for that explanation and for his \nhelp in crafting the amendment. As I mentioned earlier, my amendment is \nbased on S. 1936, a bipartisan bill introduced by Senator Baucus last \nyear. That legislation was endorsed by groups as diverse as the Chamber \nof Commerce, Environmental Defense, the National Taxpayers Union, and \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         energy tax incentives\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Chairman Grassley \nand Senator Baucus on their decision to include a package of energy tax \nincentives in this bill. These tax incentives will promote the future \ndevelopment and production of renewable fuels, which we hope one day \nwill lessen our dependency on foreign oil.\n  The package of energy tax incentives now before us was first reported \nby the Finance Committee last year as part of H.R. 6, the Energy Tax \nPolicy Act of 2003, and the Senate considered H.R. 6 in July of 2003. \nDuring floor debate of that legislation, I raised two concerns that I \nhoped would be addressed in the House-Senate conference of the energy \nbill. Chairman Grassley agreed with my points and assured me he would \nuse his best efforts to resolve these matters. True to his word, as \nalways, the chairman addressed my concerns in the conference version of \nH.R. 6. But as we all know, the conference version of H.R. 6 failed to \ngain enough votes to pass the Senate.\n  Now, the chairman has decided to move a text that is essentially the \nsame finance Committee package of energy tax incentives, not the \nconference version of the bill, as part of the FSC/ETI bill. One of my \nconcerns, relating to the definition of a landfill gas facility, has \nbeen resolved by virtue of the fact that the provision in the Finance \nCommittee package has been dropped. But the other concern remains. So \nnow again, I feel compelled to raise this concern, and once again, \nrequest the chairman's assistance to address it in a House-Senate \nconference. So please bear with me again while I explain my concerns \nfor the record.\n  On February 11 of 2003, I introduced S. 358, the Capturing Landfill \nGas for Energy Act of 2003. The bill is cosponsored by Senators \nSantorum and Hatch and would provide a credit under either Section 29 \nor 45 of the tax code for the production of energy from landfill gas, \nor LFG.\n  In the past, Congress recognized the importance of LFG for energy \ndiversity and national security by providing a Section 29 credit in \n1980 and extending it for nearly two decades. However, the Finance \nCommittee bill before us fails to recognize the importance of LFG in \nits creation of a new Section 45 credit. In contrast, the President \nproposed a generous Section 29 credit for LFG, and the House has passed \na Section 45 credit for LFG as part of its energy bill. Both of these \nproposals would provide meaningful tax incentives to encourage the \ncollection and use of LFG. Thus, this version of energy tax incentives \nfalls well short of recognizing the importance of dealing with LFG, and \nI urge the chairman to address this shortfall in the House-Senate \nconference by affording the same incentive for LFG that other renewable \nenergy sources are given under the final legislation.\n  The potential energy and environmental benefits of future LFG \nprojects are substantial, but they will be lost if we do not provide \nadequate provisions to support project development. I want to thank \nChairman Grassley and Senator Baucus for their past work and support in \naddressing these important concerns. Further, I hope and request that \nthey once again work with me to make sure Americans garner all of these \nimportant benefits.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to assure Senator Lincoln that I \nwill continue to work with her to make sure adequate incentives for LFG \nare included in any final package from the upcoming House-Senate \nconference. Her concerns are my concerns as well. She has stated them \nwell and I will devote my best efforts to resolving them as we move \nforward on discussions and deliberations with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n\n                             car provision\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I raise an issue with regard to the car \ndonation provision included in the JOBS bill. Under the provision \ndonors are limited to deducting the actual sale price of the vehicle \nthat is donated to charity, unless the charity uses the car, in which \ncase donors a get fair market value deduction. This is a good rule. It \nwill cut out abuse of this charitable giving device, and make it easier \nfor donors to comply with the tax law. However, I am also concerned \nabout the potential for charities that intentionally sell/transfer \ndonated vehicles at a low or no cost to low-income recipients as part \nof a charitable program to be unintentionally hampered from doing so. I \nbelieve the law is written in such a way that if the car is given by \nthe charity to a low income family, or used for parts to repair a \ndifferent car, there is no sale that triggers the sales proceeds limit, \nand the donor gets a fair market value deduction. I agree with some \nfolks' suggestions that the sales to needy families case does not fit \nwithin the ``use by the charity'' rules as presently drafted. But \ntrying to modify the proposal to move away from the sale bright line \nrule can be tricky, and I fear we would be opening up the proposal to \nabuse. I pledge to charities that do sell cars to low-income or needy \nindividuals at reduced prices as part of a charitable program, that we \nwill expand regulatory authority during conference or a preconference \nperiod with the House to permit Treasury to issue rules excepting \ncertain sales from the sales proceeds limit and certain reporting rules \nif the sale furthers a charitable purpose.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with your concerns, Senator Baucus, and I also \nam in favor of giving Treasury this expanded authority.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one small piece of \nthis legislation which will make a big difference in rural States such \nas Montana. I am talking about the broadband expensing provision, which \nwould encourage broadband providers to extend their networks to \nunderserved areas, and to upgrade their networks to ``next-generation'' \nspeeds so that they can deliver a full complement of voice, video and \ndata services. We have been working on this legislation since 2000--\nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator Clinton. \nThere are a lot of us who feel strongly about this issue. It has passed \nthe Senate twice now, but, unfortunately, we have been unable to \npersuade our friends on the other side of the Capitol to support it. So \nI want to thank the Finance Committee for including it again in this \nbill, and I am going to push my colleagues on the House side to get \nbehind it this time because it is very important. It is important for \nrural areas, for underserved inner city areas, for education, for \nhealth care, for energy savings, for a\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\nwhole list of reasons. And I want to say this. It is fitting for this \nbroadband incentive to be included in the FSC/ETI bill because this \nprovision will have a big effect on international competitiveness. We \nare hearing a lot about ``offshore outsourcing'' these days, and \nbroadband is a response to that. If we have a robust high-speed network \nall over this country, companies will not need to send jobs to India--\nwe can do them in Montana, and in Iowa, and in West Virginia, and in \ncommunities all across the nation where costs are lower. So this is \nabout providing an infrastructure that makes us more productive, just \nas the Interstate highway system, and rural electrification, and the \ntranscontinental railroad all made the Nation more productive. \nBroadband is a key infrastructure of the 21st century, and we need to \nconstruct it as quickly as possible. I believe this provision will help \ndo that, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure its \nenactment this year.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased at the \nprogress that the Senate has made this week on the legislation before \nus, known as the JOBS Act. Like most of my colleagues, I support this \nbill, because I believe that Congress must respond to the increasingly \ndifficult competitive position of our manufacturing industry. I urge my \ncolleagues to continue working on this bill, debate and vote on the \nrelatively few remaining amendments, and then pass this bill.\n  For generations, American manufacturing has been a tremendous source \nof pride and a ladder to the middle class. Unfortunately, over the last \n3 years, the manufacturing sector of our economy has suffered \ndisproportionately and millions of good jobs have been lost. Tomorrow \nthe Labor Department will announce new statistics on employment for the \nmonth of April. I understand that many experts expect tomorrow's news \nto be positive. And certainly, we were all very glad to hear that \n308,000 jobs had been created in March.\n  A couple months of strong job growth should not lull this Congress \ninto believing that the manufacturing sector is enjoying a healthy \nrecovery. Indeed, in March no new manufacturing jobs were created at \nall. Nationwide almost 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost \nsince January 2001. In my home State of West Virginia, more than 10,000 \nmanufacturing jobs have disappeared in that time.\n  Regardless of tomorrow's news, this Congress must stay focused on the \ntask at hand. We must eliminate the European tariffs that are currently \nimposed on many of our goods, and we must enact a fair tax policy that \nwill shore up our manufacturing base. The JOBS Act is accomplishes \nthese goals.\n  The JOBS Act repeals the foreign sales corporation/extraterritorial \nincome provisions in our current tax code in order to comply with the \nruling of the World Trade Organization. Regardless of whether I agree \nwith the obligations that the WTO has ascribed to the U.S., I believe \nthat Congress must act quickly to resolve this impasse and restore good \ntrade relations with Europe. Because repealing these provisions would \nimpose a new tax burden on American manufacturers just at a time when \nthey are already struggling to compete globally, the JOBS Act would \ncreate a new deduction for our manufacturers to reduce the cost of \ndoing business in the U.S. In that regard, this legislation is very \nsimilar to a bill I introduced last year, the Security America's \nFactory Employment Act. I know that many of the CEOs in my home state \nfind it difficult to offer good wages, provide health insurance and \nretirement benefits, pay taxes, and still make a reasonable profit. \nPassing the JOBS Act will dramatically reduce the tax burden these \nbusinesses face, helping them succeed and grow.\n  Indeed, while the name of this legislation is certainly awkward, the \nJumpstart Our Business Strengths Act, the acronym JOBS is fitting. \nThere are a number of very promising provisions in this bill that can \noffer hope to struggling businesses and the millions of Americans \nlooking for work. In addition to lowering the tax rate on domestic \nmanufacturing operations, this bill extends valuable tax provisions on \nwhich American companies depend.\n  For example, this legislation would improve and extend the research \nand development tax credit. By spurring investment in innovation this \ntax credit helps our companies stay competitive and helps keep \nexciting, well paid jobs in the U.S. The bill also extends tax \nincentives for the hiring of those who might otherwise depend on public \nassistance. The work opportunities tax credit and the welfare to work \ntax credit have been extraordinarily successful, and Congress should \nensure that businesses can continue to use them.\n  I am also very pleased to have worked with my colleagues to provide \nassistance to companies that are subject to alternative minimum tax \nobligations by enabling them to take advantage of the legitimate tax \nbenefits of bonus depreciation and general business credits even if \ntheir AMT liability would otherwise prevent such benefits. While I wish \nwe could have made this provision even more substantial, this \nassistance creates incentives for companies to invest in new projects \nand purchase new equipment in--other words, it helps those companies \ncontribute to our economic recovery.\n  Another key to our Nation's economic vitality is technological \ndevelopment and deployment. When the Senate Finance Committee \nconsidered the JOBS Act last fall, I was very pleased that the \ncommittee accepted my amendment to provide tax incentives for the \ndeployment of cutting edge broadband technology. The United States \ncurrently ranks eleventh in the world in broadband availability. \nMillions of Americans, especially in rural areas, do not have access to \nbroadband. We must remedy this situation so that everyone can benefit \nfrom activities such as telemedicine, telecommuting, and distance \nlearning. Widespread broadband technology is critical to increasing our \nproductivity and keeping America competitive with nations that offer \ntechnology-savvy workforces. I thank my colleagues who have worked with \nme to include the broadband tax incentives in this legislation, and I \nlook forward to getting these provisions enacted this year.\n  I am gratified also that the managers of this bill and the leaders on \nboth sides of the aisle have seen their way to including the energy tax \nprovisions that many of us in the Senate have been working to enact for \nmany years. In particular, I am happy to see the Senate working to \npass, once again, meaningful incentives to promote the development of \nclean coal technologies and the expanded development of oil and gas \nfrom nonconventional sources. These particular incentives are crucial \nto meeting our Nation's future energy needs, and I cannot emphasize \nadequately how important they are to my state of West Virginia.\n  As the high price of gasoline at the pump continues to set new \nrecords, the inclusion of new incentives for the use of alternative \nfuels and the vehicles that use them are especially timely. I am proud \nto have worked for many years with a bipartisan group of Senators on \nthese provisions, and I join them in hoping our action on the JOBS Act \nwill lead, finally, to their enactment.\n  I have been a long-time advocate for a responsible energy policy for \nthis nation. I am frustrated that the current political mindset of some \nin the House leadership prevents us from getting a final comprehensive \nbill that can pass the Senate. Still, I am pleased that the Senate has \nagain demonstrated with these tax provisions, including important \nincentives for energy efficiency and conservation, the genuine \nbipartisan consensus the country needs to secure our energy supply and \nlessen our dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  Because of the many important provisions I have described, I am \nlooking forward to supporting this bill. As can be said about almost \nall legislation, this bill is not perfect. Rather it is the result of \ncompromises. I was very disappointed that my colleagues did not agree \nto add Trade Adjustment Assistance for service workers or to improve \nthe health care tax credit available to workers who lose their job as a \nresult of our trade policies. In addition, I do not believe it is good \npolicy to allow companies who have deliberately avoided U.S. taxes by \nkeeping their profits overseas to now enjoy a tax break on repatriated \nincome. Yet, on balance, this legislation will be beneficial for our \nmanufacturing companies and our economy as a whole.\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\n  We have made substantial progress this week. I look forward to voting \non the few remaining amendments, including a very worthy proposal to \nextend unemployment benefits for those workers who have been hardest \nhit in this economy. I urge my colleagues to continue to make progress \non this legislation and work with our counterparts in the House of \nRepresentatives so that we can send this to the President.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, while I strongly supported a timely \nfinish to debate on this measure, I voted against the motion to invoke \ncloture on S. 1637. The debate over the past few days leading up to \nthis vote has made it clear that the total time needed to consider the \namendments remaining on this measure totaled less than 2 hours. So \nthere was no need to invoke cloture on this legislation. Unfortunately, \ncloture does mean that critical amendments, including my own amendment \nto strengthen our Buy American law, would no longer be in order.\n  To be clear, I do not support delaying consideration of the \nunderlying bill. As I indicated to both leaders, I was willing to enter \ninto a short time agreement for consideration of my amendment, and I \nunderstand that others who were offering amendments were also willing \nto limit the time on their amendments. But cloture not only limits the \ntime available to debate this bill, it also means that the Senate will \nnot be able to consider my amendment, as well as other worthy proposals \nthat relate directly to the loss of manufacturing jobs that has wracked \nso many communities in Wisconsin and across the country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us are pleased by Department of \nLabor reports showing that the economy has finally had two months of \ngood job growth. It is welcome news. However, that news must be viewed \nas part of the overall economic picture. Job growth is still far behind \nwhat President Bush predicted when his tax cuts were enacted last \nsummer--two million jobs behind. Employment in the manufacturing sector \nis still anemic. The pace at which American jobs are being shifted \noverseas is still accelerating.\n  Working men and women in America are facing an economic crisis which \nthreatens their job security and their families' well-being. Since the \nbeginning of 2001, there has been a net loss of nearly two and a half \nmillion private sector jobs. In prior economic downturns, most of the \njob loss was the result of temporary layoffs. As the economy picked up, \nworkers returned to their old jobs. Unfortunately, that is no longer \nthe case. Economists tell us that most of the millions of jobs lost in \nthe last three years are gone for good. With each job lost, a family is \nplaced in jeopardy. We must look behind the statistics to the people \nwho, through no fault of their own, are now facing hardship and \nuncertainty.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration's response to these people has \nbeen weak and ineffective. Huge tax cuts heavily skewed to the wealthy, \nand rosy predictions that have consistently proven false. Long term \nunemployment has nearly tripled under President Bush. Unemployed \nworkers remain without jobs longer than at any time in the last 20 \nyears. Nor is there any basis to conclude that the hemorrhaging of jobs \nin the manufacturing sector is at an end. And the relatively small \nnumber of new jobs that are being created pay, on average, 21 percent \nless than the jobs that have been lost. The Republican strategy of tax \nbreaks for the rich and platitudes for the public will not solve the \nongoing economic crisis. We need new leaders who will give us a new \neconomic plan.\n  The so-called JOBS bill which the Senate is finally considering does \nnot provide that new economic plan. Rather, it is a hodge-podge of \nunrelated and sometimes inconsistent provisions. Some of them--\nprincipally the new deduction for domestic manufacturing and the \nextension of the research and development tax credit--will help to \ncreate jobs. However, there are many other provisions in the bill which \ncould actually make the job loss worse.\n  This legislation is really schizophrenic. On the one hand, it creates \nover $65 billion in new tax benefits for domestic manufacturers to help \nthem maintain, and hopefully add, jobs here at home. On the other hand, \nit provides nearly $40 billion in new and expanded tax breaks for \ncompanies doing business abroad. Many of these international provisions \nwill actually make the exporting of American jobs more financially \nattractive to multinational corporations.\n  Providing assistance to domestic manufacturers is the right thing to \ndo. We have lost more manufacturing jobs in the last three years than \nin the preceding twenty years--a net loss of nearly 3 million jobs \nsince 2000. This is a genuine crisis for working families across \nAmerica. They are looking to us for help, and we owe them a strong, \nunambiguous response.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation as reported from the Finance Committee \ndoes not provide that strong, unambiguous response that American \nworkers are looking for. It contains deep internal contradictions which \nwill seriously hamper its effectiveness in preserving domestic \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Providing more tax breaks for multinational corporations is the wrong \nthing to do. It's more than the loss of $40 billion in tax revenue that \ncould be used for many better purposes that is troubling. What is most \ndisturbing is the fact that many of these international provisions will \nactually encourage companies to shift even more American jobs to low \nwage countries.\n  The international provisions should be removed from the bill, and the \ntax dollars saved should be used to increase the tax benefits for \ndomestic manufacturing.\n  It is outrageous that this bill proposes to expand the value of the \nforeign tax credits which multinational corporations receive. Under the \nlegislation, these companies would pay even less in U.S. taxes on the \nprofits they earn from their business abroad than they do today--$40 \nbillion less. This will create further incentives for them to move jobs \nabroad, undermining the intent of the legislation.\n  From the perspective of preserving American jobs, one of the worst \nfeatures of corporate tax law is a special tax subsidy for \nmultinationals known as ``deferral.'' If a U.S. company moves its \noperations abroad, it can defer paying U.S. taxes on the profits it \nmakes overseas until the company chooses to send those profits back to \nAmerica.\n  In essence, it allows the corporation to decide when it will pay the \ntaxes it owes to the U.S. Government. That is a luxury that companies \nmaking products and providing services here at home do not have. This \nis an enormous competitive advantage which the tax code gives to \ncompanies doing the wrong thing--eliminating American jobs--over \ncompanies doing the right thing--preserving jobs in the United States.\n  We should be eliminating this special tax break for multinationals. \nInstead, this bill proposes to expand it. It makes changes in the \ndeferral rules which will actually encourage companies to keep profits \nearned on foreign transactions abroad longer. As a result, the return \nof working capital to the U.S. will be delayed even further, and the \npayment of corporate taxes owed to the public Treasury will be \npostponed even longer.\n  This legislation would extend from 5 years to 20 years the amount of \ntime which a foreign tax credit can be carried forward. Often it is \nconcern about losing foreign tax credits which leads a corporation to \nreturn foreign earned profits to the United States. By extending the \ncarry forward period to 20 years, corporations will lose one of the \nstrongest incentives to bring the money home. The bill also narrows \nwhat is known as Subpart F, which currently prevents the deferral of \nAmerican taxation on the profits from certain types of passive \ninvestment income. It would change Subpart F to allow deferral of \nincome from investment activities, such as commodity hedging \ntransactions and aircraft and vessel leasing. The location of these \nactivities can be easily manipulated for tax avoidance purposes. The \nbill also removes limitations on the use of foreign tax credits against \nthe corporate alternative minimum tax, and allows companies to take \nadvantage of foreign interest payments to make their foreign tax \ncredits even larger. All of these provisions move the tax code further \nin the wrong direction, increasing the profitability of shifting jobs \nabroad.\n  If enacted, these provisions greatly enhancing the value of foreign \ntax credits will inevitably lead to the export of more American jobs. \nThat is\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\nnot just my opinion. Let me cite a statement from the Finance Committee \nDemocratic staff's analysis of the bill:\n\n       [A] dollar of taxes paid today is more costly than a dollar \n     paid next year. Thus, on a present value basis, deferral \n     represents significant tax savings--and the savings are \n     greater the longer taxes are deferred. Accordingly, as a \n     general matter, the tax burden on investment abroad is lower \n     than on identical investment in the United States in any case \n     where the tax rate imposed by the foreign host government is \n     lower than the U.S. tax rate on identical investment. As a \n     consequence, deferral poses an incentive for U.S. firms to \n     invest abroad in low-tax countries.\n\n  Creating ``an incentive for U.S. firms to invest abroad in low-tax \ncountries''--worth billions of dollars--just what we should not be \ndoing, making an already bad situation for American workers worse!\n  Not surprisingly, the proponents of this legislation all want to talk \nabout the tax benefits it will provide for domestic manufacturers, \nhelping them pressure American jobs. However, the multi-national tax \nbreaks in Title II will seriously undercut that goal. They will cost \njobs, reducing the net benefit that American workers receive from this \nbill. Our corporate tax laws should be rewritten to increase the cost \nof exporting jobs and decrease the cost of maintaining jobs in America. \nTitle II does the opposite. These international provisions should be \nremoved from the bill, and the tax dollars saved should be used to make \nthe tax benefits for domestic manufacturing more robust. That would \ntruly make this legislation a JOBS bill we could all be proud of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I wish to make a few comments regarding \nthe bill.\n  First, I compliment my colleagues, Senator Grassley and Senator \nBaucus. We will be successful in passing a bill today. I compliment \nthem for it. I believe we have been on this bill for about 14 days, \nmaybe 15 days. They have considered hundreds of amendments. In my \nopinion, this bill has gotten pretty expensive and I want to talk about \nit a little bit.\n  Senator Kyl and I voted against the bill reported out of the Finance \nCommittee primarily because the committee-reported bill had a \ndifferential rate for manufacturers than other corporations. It said \nmanufacturers should have a rate of 32 percent and other corporations \nhave a rate of 35 percent.\n  Prior to my coming to the Senate, I ran a manufacturing company. I \nshould be saying, Thank you very much. I may be going back to a \nmanufacturing company. So maybe I should say, Thank you very much. But \nthis is terrible tax policy. The Senate and the Congress, if it becomes \nlaw, will regret it.\n  Members might say, Why is that? First, who is a manufacturer? You \nwould think it would be very obvious who is a manufacturer but, \nfrankly, it is not. The only thing that is certain out of this bill, \nthere will be lots and lots of lobbyists lining up to be defined as \nmanufacturers because if you are defined as a manufacturer, you get a \n10-percent lower rate than all the other corporations. As a matter of \nfact, the bill defines manufacturers as, obviously, manufacturers, but \nalso agriculture. So I have a lot of wheat farmers in Oklahoma who will \nnow be manufacturers--software producers, movie producers. Now \narchitects and engineers are going to have a lot of people asking they \nbe defined as manufacturers.\n  Maybe manufacturing employment will rise as a result of people \nredefining themselves as manufacturing, but other than that, I am not \nsure it makes sense.\n  We also have a lot of large corporations that do a lot of things. \nThey may have a manufacturing division but they also have services or \nthey also have financials. Probably one of the biggest beneficiaries \ndollarwise in this bill, it is my guess, would be a company such as \nGeneral Electric or maybe it would be a company such as Boeing or a big \nmanufacturer. But General Electric, I would guess their financial \nservices are bigger than their manufacturing.\n  We will say for part of your corporation you get a corporate rate of \n32 percent, but the rest of your corporation gets 35 percent. Guess \nwhat. Where you allocate those expenses will make a difference in your \nbottom line. You could have an enormous amount of internal complexity \ntrying to decide, Should this be allocated to manufacturing? Should it \nbe allocated to our financial services? Should it be allocated to our \nmaintenance services? And if you make a mistake, you cannot only be \naudited, but you can be fined. But there is a great incentive to crowd \nas much income, as much profit into the manufacturing sector, and as \nmuch expenses into the nonmanufacturing sector.\n\n  With the complexity of it--albeit we are all trying to help \nmanufacturers, and I think maybe this is very well intended--I think it \nis faulty economic policy.\n  Canada tried a differential rate, a lower rate, for manufacturers \nthan other corporations, and they did it in 1982. They repealed it in \n2001. I will make a statement on the floor: If this becomes law, we \nwill repeal it. Congress will repeal it at some point, because our \ncolleagues are going to hear from people in the field that it does not \nwork, or that they have been audited and the complexity is too much.\n  The Treasury Department made these comments:\n\n       Taxpayers will be required to devote substantial additional \n     resources to meeting their tax responsibilities. . . .The \n     resulting costs will reduce significantly the benefits of the \n     proposal. . . .\n       It will be difficult, if not impossible, for the IRS to \n     craft simplified provisions tailored to small businesses. . . \n     .\n       Significant additional IRS resources will be needed to \n     administer the [manufacturing deduction] provision. . . .\n       By distinguishing ``production'' from other activities, the \n     provision places considerable tension on defining terms and \n     designing anti-abuse rules.\n\n  In other words, I have heard lots and lots of people say they are for \ntax simplicity. This is just the opposite, and we are going to regret \nit. I want people to know that. I would like for them to know it before \nit becomes law so we do not make a mistake, because I believe it will \nbe a mistake.\n  I asked the Congressional Budget Office for the economic analysis of \nthis. I would love for the sponsors of the amendment to know this. CBO \nestimates the efficiency gains to the economy are $4 to $7 billion per \nyear from an across-the-board rate cut. In other words, if we are going \nto cut corporate taxes, let's cut all corporate taxes the same. You \ncould probably do that to a rate of about 33 percent or maybe 33.5 \npercent or something. But all corporations would be taxed the same.\n  We have always taxed all corporations the same. To have a \ndifferential rate for manufacturing is a mistake. CBO says the cost--\nwell, I will finish that. They say: The gains to the economy are $4 to \n$7 billion per year from an across-the-board rate cut. That is $40 to \n$70 billion over the next 10 years. That is a significant amount, given \nthe fact the entire bill was $110 billion. Now that was $110 billion \nwhen we reported it out of committee. The bill now moves around not \n$110 billion, not $120 billion, but $170 billion. It is a big bill. It \nadds a lot of miscellaneous provisions. A lot of them, in this \nSenator's opinion, should not be in the bill.\n  I hope and expect to be a conferee, and I will tell our conferees, I \nwill always work with my colleague from Iowa because I have great \nrespect for him. I think the differential rate is a mistake. I also \nthink there are a lot of extraneous provisions that were put into the \nbill that should not be that are bad tax policy, and maybe they need to \nbe reviewed very closely before they become law.\n\n  I plan on being pretty active in the conference, to try to accept \namendments that make sense, to try to make us more competitive, to try \nto avoid the fines and the penalties and the tariffs that are being \nimposed by the EU. I very much agree with the objective of the bill. \nLet's avoid those penalties. Let's not get in a trade war. Let's not \nhave countervailing tariffs. But let's not add a bunch of junk to the \ntax policy.\n  The table of contents, when the bill passed the Finance Committee, \nwas about 5\\1/2\\ pages. The table of contents usually has about 15 or \nmaybe 20 amendments on a page. There are now about 11 or 12 pages on \nthe table of contents. In other words, this bill has hundreds of \nprovisions and a lot of them have nothing to do with manufacturing. A \nlot of them have nothing to do with being compliant with WTO,\n\n[[Page S5213]]\n\nbeing compliant with trying to eliminate trade tariffs that are imposed \non the United States.\n  So again, I regret I could not support the bill when it came out of \nthe Finance Committee. I know it is going to pass by a big margin \ntoday. I compliment the sponsors of the amendment, Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus. I compliment them for their work and patience and \ntenacity in getting us here. I look forward to working with them in \nconference to hopefully make a better bill, compliant with WTO, \nsomething we can afford, and something that will not add 1,000 pages to \nthe IRS Code.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, Senators Kyl and Nickles say that a \nlower rate just for manufacturing is ``bad tax policy and is virtually \nwithout precedent in our history.''\n  Well, this is just wrong and the evidence is staring them in the \nface. FSC/ETI itself is a tax cut for manufacturing. FSC/ETI keeps U.S. \nmanufacturing competitive by lowering tax rates on exports. \nManufacturers could lower their rates by 3 to 8 points.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation says that 89 percent of all FSC/ETI \nbenefits go to manufacturing companies. The Kyl-Nickles Treasury \nproposal would take money from FSC/ETI and spread it to other industry \nsectors.\n  Kyl-Nickles will be a $50 billion tax increase on manufacturing. It \nwill not send the FSC/ETI repeal money back to manufacturing. It is \nmathematically impossible for their proposal to work any other way.\n  We know that tax increases do not create jobs. So why would Senator \nKyl and Nickles increase manufacturing taxes by $50 billion?\n  There are other reasons why we did not go the route of the Kyl-\nNickles approach. First, their top-level rate cut would only go to the \nbiggest corporations in America. It would not go to family-held S \ncorporations, partnerships, or smaller corporations.\n  Under the Finance Committee bill, all manufacturers in America, \nregardless of size, get a 3-point rate cut, including S corporations \nand partnerships.\n  S corporations and partnerships benefit under current FSC/ETI law, so \nthe Kyl-Nickles bill takes a benefit away from them and gives it to \nlarge corporations.\n  Kyl-Nickles claim that a manufacturing tax cut ``penalizes all other \nU.S. businesses.'' I think just the opposite is true. The manufacturing \nsector should not be a revenue offset to give investment bankers a tax \ncut. Kyl-Nickles claim that our definition of manufacturing is too \ndifficult to understand. But the definition we use in the JOBS Act is \nthe same definition used for both FSC and ETI. It covers property that \nis manufactured, produced, grown or extracted within the United States.\n  This definition is 20 years old, but suddenly no one understands what \nit means. We did confirm that manufacturing includes computer software, \nfilms, and processed agricultural goods. Kyl-Nickles claim that these \nare special interest definitions of manufacturing. However, all of \nthese activities qualified as manufacturing under the FSC/ETI rules, \nwhich have been in place for 20 years.\n  We also ensured that farm co-ops get the same benefit that they do \nunder current law.\n  In response to our energy crisis, we provided that refining oil \npulled from American wells would qualify as manufacturing.\n  They claim it is too difficult to allocate income and expenses in \ndetermining the amount of manufacturing income. But for 20 years, \nTreasury has had administrative pricing rules on its books that tell \ntaxpayers how to allocate expenses in figuring FSCETI benefits. Our \nJOBS bill grants Treasury broad latitude to revise the cost allocation \nrules, based on existing tax principles.\n  Kyl-Nickles also claims that Canada recently gave up a similar \nmanufacturing rate cut because it did not work. This is not correct. \nFor many years, Canada had a special lower rate for their manufacturing \nsector. Canada created their manufacturing rate cut in reaction to the \nU.S. creating FSC back in 1982. They reduced their rate on \nmanufacturing so they could stay competitive with the U.S. Canada \nrecently repealed that provision because they reduced all their \ncorporate rates to the lower manufacturing rate.\n  Canada did not repeal their manufacturing rate cut because of its \ncomplications. Canada ended their manufacturing regime because it \nworked so well, that they extended it to all sectors. But when Canada \nreduced their overall tax rates, they did not do so at the expense of \ntheir manufacturing sector.\n  We put together a strong bipartisan bill, with a 19-to-2 vote out of \ncommittee, that will cut our manufacturing tax rate this very year. \nThere is no purpose in blocking such a strong bipartisan bill. These \ndays, is it rare that we can reach such strong agreement on anything.\n  Mr. President, the CBO report says the flat corporate rate cut would \nyield slightly more long-term growth than the JOBS bill. But the reason \nhas nothing to do with our manufacturing tax cut.\n  CBO says the antitax shelter provisions and Senator Smith's and \nSenator Ensign's homeland reinvestment provisions are the cause.\n  CBO says that because we shut down shelters, corporations' taxes \nwon't be as low and, therefore, their long-term growth is not as high.\n  CBO also concludes that Senators Smith's and Ensign's temporary 1-\nyear rate cut won't help in the long-term.\n  The CBO concludes that a flat rate cut could be more ``efficient'' \nthan a manufacturing rate cut. So what do they mean by ``efficient''? \nThey said it means that a manufacturing rate cut would cause more \ncapital to flow into the manufacturing sector.\n  So I have to ask, what is the problem?\n  I thought tax cuts were designed to increase capital investment. \nIsn't that what we want for manufacturing?\n  If we increase taxes on manufacturing, then capital should flow out \nof the manufacturing sector. Is that what we want?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3120, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that our \namendment No. 3120 at the desk be modified and called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the amendment being \nmodified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Coleman, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 3120, \n     as modified.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Madam President, I am offering this amendment along with \nour colleague, Senator Coleman. I understand the amendment has been \ncleared now on both sides of the aisle. I very much appreciate the \neffort that has been put into this matter by Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus. They have been battling abusive tax shelters for years \nnow, and it is a privilege to join them in this fight by providing the \nIRS with stronger enforcement tools.\n  Abusive tax shelters are undermining the integrity of our tax system, \nrobbing the Treasury of tens of billions of dollars each year, and \nshifting the tax burden from high income corporations and individuals \nonto the backs of the middle class.\n  The bill before us contains a host of important reforms to combat \nabusive tax shelters, including codifying and strengthening the \ndefinition of when a shelter has ``economic substance.'' But there is \nan area where the underlying bill falls short and unnecessarily so. \nThat's on the penalties for the people who design and sell the abusive \nshelters. The bill sets the penalty at 50 percent of the fees earned by \nthese promoters, meaning they get to keep half of their ill-gotten \ngains.\n  That is the provision that our amendment addresses, but we \nsignificantly toughen this provision in a way which I think this body \nwill totally approve.\n  The amendment I originally filed proposed raising the penalty on \nabusive tax shelter promoters and those who aid or abet tax evasion to \n150 percent. Today we have reached a compromise, agreeing to set the \npenalty at 100 percent, which will ensure that those who peddle abusive \ntax shelters will not get to keep a single penny of their ill-gotten \ngains.\n  The issue is whether when you have an abusive tax shelter, one which \nrobs the Treasury of millions of dollars, the people who cook up those \ntax shelters are going to be penalized in any significant way. Will the \naccountants or the lawyers or the investment bankers--the people who \ndesign these deceptive and sham tax shelters, which are abusive and \nhave no economic purpose, except to avoid taxes--will they be deterred \nfrom doing this? And if they do it, will they be penalized, at least to \nthe extent of having their ill-gotten gains being taken back from them? \nThat is the issue.\n  The current law is like a slap on the wrist. It is like a parking \nticket. These abusive tax shelters, which have been designed by the \nbanks and the accounting firms, and which have made them millions of \ndollars, result in a maximum fine of $1,000 under current law.\n  What our amendment does is say, if you design and promote an abusive \ntax shelter which has no economic substance and you are found \nresponsible for doing that, the IRS can get all of your fee that is \nill-gotten and wrongfully obtained for cooking up that tax shelter--not \n$1,000 of the fee, not half of the fee, as was originally proposed in \nthe bill, but the entire fee is going to be recoverable by the IRS.\n  We can take a quick look at one of these tax shelters. This is called \nFlagstaff. I am not going to try to explain what that tax shelter you \nare looking at does. It is obviously inexplicable. It has all of this \nmumbo jumbo, all of these boxes and arrows that were intended by JP \nMorgan Chase to create an impression of economic activity when there \nwas none. That is what this bowl of spaghetti is all about: to create a \nsham impression that there was some economic substance to these \ntransactions when, in fact, there was no economic substance. They were \ncooked up in order to create the appearance of economic substance and, \nthereby, obtain a tax deduction for them.\n  The question is, when that happens, whether we are going to say to \nthese firms that design these tax shelters for Enron, or for whoever: \nWe are not going to let you, the designers, the perpetrators--who are \ncalled aiders and abettors in the law, but are really the promoters of \nthe tax shelters--we are not going to let you keep those ill-gotten \nfees. We are going to recover those for the Treasury of the United \nStates.\n  That is the only real deterrent we have.\n  I want to quickly show how some of these firms analyze these fees \nthey get. Again, we are talking about millions of dollars in fees. \nThese are cookie-cutter tax shelters that are designed and sold by the \nhundreds to people who can use a tax deduction for, usually, their \ncapital gains, but are not engaged in economic activity which would \njustify the non-payment of tax on these capital gains.\n  This is what KPMG did when analyzing one of their phony tax shelters: \nFirst, they look at the financial exposure to the firm. It is minimal. \nSo what they are saying is: Hey, we can engage in this. We can get away \nwith it because there is no financial exposure.\n\n       . . . we conclude that the penalties would be no greater \n     than $14,000 per $100,000 in KPMG fees. . . . For example, \n     our average deal would result in KPMG fees of $360,000 with a \n     maximum penalty exposure of only $31,000.\n\n  They do a cost-benefit analysis.\n  They cook up and design an abusive tax shelter and then say: Now \nshould we really go with this? Shall we peddle this, promote it, look \nfor people who can benefit from it, sell it for hundreds of thousands \nof dollars and take the risk that we will be caught? Because what \nhappens if we are caught? We are going to be paying a few thousand \ndollars in penalties and making $100,000. Our maximum exposure, our \nfinancial exposure, is minimal.\n  That is what this amendment changes.\n  Last November, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which \nSenator Coleman is the chairman and I am the ranking member, held \nhearings that provided an inside look at how respected accounting \nfirms, banks, investment advisors, and lawyers have become high-powered \nengines behind the design and sale of abusive tax shelters.\n  These hearings were the culmination of a year-long investigation into \nabusive tax shelters, which first began by pulling the curtain away \nfrom one of Enron's sham tax transactions. At the November hearings, we \nreleased a report by my subcommittee staff on four case histories of \nabusive tax shelters developed and marketed by KPMG. At the hearings \nthemselves, we heard from a number of accounting firms, banks, \ninvestment firms, and others.\n  One of the key findings of the subcommittee investigation was that it \nwas not taxpayers visiting their tax advisors that provided the engine \nfor the\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\ncreation of abusive tax shelters, but rather hordes of tax advisors \ncooking up one complex scheme after another, and then peddling them to \npotential customers. There are legitimate tax shelters and abusive \nones. The abusive shelters are marked by one characteristic: there is \nno real economic or business rationale other than a tax reduction. We \nfound the abusive shelters being packaged up as generic ``tax \nproducts'' with boiler-plate legal and tax opinions, followed by \nelaborate marketing schemes to peddle these products to literally \nthousands of taxpayers across the country.\n  It is the insight gained during our close look at these shelters that \nled me and Senator Coleman to introduce the Tax Shelter and Tax Haven \nReform Act, S. 2210. While the Levin-Coleman bill addresses a wide \nrange of tax shelter issues, our amendment focuses on one key issue: \nthe woefully inadequate penalties that are now on the books for the tax \nshelter promoters who concoct and peddle abusive shelters.\n  Existing tax shelter penalties are a joke. They provide no deterrent \nat all. The story begins with Enron, and I think the Enron scandal has \nshown us one reason this amendment is so important. The Flagstaff \nexample I talked about earlier was designed to save Enron more than $60 \nmillion in taxes. The whole scam was built around a sham $1 billion \nloan that was issued to Enron but was repaid in nanoseconds, and then \nused to claim various tax benefits as well as creating a false \nimpression of profits on the balance sheet. JP Morgan Chase designed \nand sold this concoction to Enron for more than $5 million. After Enron \ncollapsed and this scam came to light, we learned that JP Morgan had \nsold the same abusive tax shelter to at least one other company as \nwell.\n  Under Section 6700 of the tax code prohibiting the promotion of \nabusive tax shelters, JP Morgan was subject to a whopping $1,000 \npenalty. Let me repeat: For one tax shelter which was abusive because \nit was a sham and a deception, JP Morgan Chase's ill-gotten gain from \none company, Enron, was $5 million. Its penalty exposure to the IRS \nunder current law was $1,000.\n  As IRS Commissioner Mark Everson said when he testified at our tax \nshelter hearings, the current tax shelter promoter penalty is ``chump \nchange.'' To continue quoting Commissioner Everson: ``We need \nsignificantly increased penalties to hit the promoters who don't get \nthe message where it counts, in their wallets.''\n  Our tax shelter investigation found some fascinating documents as \nwell, including one I have shown here today in the KPMG memo that shows \na particular tax shelter promoter performing a specific cost-benefit \nanalysis when deciding whether or not to take the risk of peddling an \nabusive shelter. The third paragraph of this KPMG memo says:\n\n       First, the financial exposure to the Firm is minimal. Based \n     upon our analysis of the applicable penalty sections, we \n     conclude that the penalties would be no greater than $14,000 \n     per $100,000 in KPMG fees. . . . For example, our average \n     deal would result in KPMG fees of $360,000 with a maximum \n     penalty exposure of only $31,000.\n\n  The fact that all KPMG could lose if caught was a small part of its \nfee was a driving consideration in KPMG's decision to take the risk. \nThis memo is proof that weak penalties encourage tax shelters and that \ntough penalties would deter them. Congress needs to enact meaningful, \ntough penalties to deter promoters from pocketing any gains from \ndesigning and peddling abusive tax shelters. We need to deter folks \nfrom making a cost-benefit analysis that encourages the promotion of a \ntax shelter they know is not likely to withstand scrutiny.\n  Our amendment would do just that by strengthening penalties for \npromoting abusive tax shelters.\n  Our amendment focuses on two key penalties. The first is the penalty \nfor promoting an abusive tax shelter under Tax Code section 6700. The \nsecond is the penalty for aiding and abetting tax evasion under Tax \nCode section 6701. It would increase the penalty for both types of \nmisconduct.\n  Currently, the penalty under section 6700 of the Tax Code is the \nlesser of $1,000 or 100 percent of the promoter's gross income derived \nfrom the prohibited tax shelter. That means in most cases, the maximum \nfine is $1,000. That figure is laughable, when many abusive tax \nshelters are selling for $100,000 or $250,000 apiece. Our investigation \nuncovered tax shelters that were sold for millions each. The Enron tax \navoidance scam sold for more than $5 million. We also saw instances in \nwhich the same so-called tax product was sold to more than 100 clients. \nA $1,000 fine is like a parking ticket for raking in millions \nillegally.\n  The bill before us is an improvement over the status quo, but an \nunnecessarily modest one. It would increase the penalty for promoting \nan abusive tax shelter to 50 percent of the promoters' gross income \nfrom the prohibited tax shelter. Why should anyone who pushes an \nabusive tax shelter--an illegal tax shelter that robs our Treasury of \nmuch needed revenues--get to keep half of his ill-gotten gains? And \nwhat deterrent effect is created by a penalty that allows promoters to \nkeep half of their fees if caught, and all of them if they are not? \nThat half-hearted penalty is not tough enough to do the job that needs \nto be done.\n  At the very least, a meaningful penalty for those who peddle abusive \ntax shelters must ensure that the tax shelter promoter does not profit \nfrom its wrongdoing. It must require the wrongdoer to disgorge every \npenny of the income obtained from selling the shelter. Our amendment \nwould do just that.\n  My original amendment would have gone further. It would have created \na maximum penalty equal to 150 percent of the promoter's gross income \nfrom the prohibited tax shelter. Under that penalty, the first 100 \npercent would have forced the disgorgement of the ill-begotten gains, \nand the remaining 50 percent would have imposed what I consider to be \nan actual penalty on top of that. But today, our amendment does not go \nthat far. It stops at 100 percent. While that is not as tough as called \nfor in the Levin-Coleman bill, it is a reasonable compromise and will \nensure that those who promote abusive tax shelters will lose 100 \npercent of their ill-gotten gains.\n  The underlying bill has the same problem in the way it addresses many \nprofessional firms the accountants, law firms, banks, and investment \nadvisors that aid and abet the use of abusive tax shelters and enable \ntaxpayers to carry out abusive tax schemes. The underlying bill takes \nthe same half-hearted approach of denying only 50 percent of the gross \nincome obtained by the aider and abettor, and allowing the wrongdoer to \nkeep half of its ill-gotten gains. Just as we do with tax shelter \npromoters, our amendment would raise the penalty under tax code section \n6701 to 100 percent of the aider or abettor's gross income, thereby \ndenying them 100 percent of their ill-gotten gains. In addition, our \namendment would make an important change to section 6701 itself by \neliminating a provision which limits the penalty to persons who prepare \ntax returns. Instead, our amendment would apply the penalty to all \nwrongdoers who knowingly aid and abet the understatement of tax \nliability, not just tax return preparers.\n  Finally, while I am pleased that today we have reached agreement to \naccept a 100 percent penalty, I would like to take this opportunity to \nobserve that penalties that cause wrongdoers to not only disgorge their \nill-gotten gains, but also pay a monetary fine on top of that are fair \nand provide a meaningful deterrent.\n  There is no reason why those who concoct and peddle these shenanigans \nshould get off any easier than the taxpayers who use them. Just last \nweek the IRS came out with an initiative to allow taxpayers who used a \ntax shelter known as ``Son of Boss'' to come clean. This tax shelter \nwas marketed beginning in the late 1990s and was one of the tax \nshelters we looked at during our investigation. Under the terms of the \nIRS initiative, taxpayers are required to come forward and pay 100 \npercent of the tax they tried to escape. On top of that, the IRS can \nimpose a penalty that ranges up to an additional 40 percent. That means \nthe taxpayer faces up to a 140 percent penalty.\n  Son of Boss is a hellaciously complicated tax shelter that was \ndreamed up and carried out by tax shelter promoters and other \nprofessionals. The taxpayers who bought this shelter have to cough up \n100 percent plus. It is only fair that the tax shelter promoters who \nmade so many millions of dollars in profit on these schemes should do \nno less.\n\n[[Page S5216]]\n\n  It is also important to realize that Congress has frequently set \npenalties for corporate misconduct and financial crimes that require \nwrongdoers to disgorge 100 percent of their ill-gotten gains plus pay a \npenalty on top of that, and courts have upheld those penalties as both \nconstitutional and enforceable. For example, under current law, \nviolation of the federal securities laws results in 100% disgorgement \nplus a civil fine of up to 100 percent, for a total civil penalty equal \nto 200 percent. In the special case of insider trading, violations \nresult in 100 percent disgorgement plus a civil fine of up to 300 \npercent, for a total civil penalty equal to 400 percent. Manipulation \nof commodity markets results in a civil fine of up to 300 percent. \nFalse claims submitted to the Federal Government result in a civil fine \nof up to 300 percent. Even the tax code has penalties of this \nmagnitude; for example, personally profiting from a charity results in \na civil fine of up to 200 percent.\n  Men and women in our military are putting their lives on the line \nevery day for our nation. To make sure we can provide them with the \nresources they need, all Americans need to contribute their fair share \nin taxes. While the bill before us improves the tax shelter penalties \nover current law, we can and should do much better. We need penalties \nthat truly deter those who make a profit from peddling abusive tax \nshelters and aiding and abetting tax evasion, not penalties that would \nallow the promoters to keep half of their ill-gotten gains.\n  It is long past time to stop in their tracks the shelter abusers and \nthe promoters who push them. This amendment would send the message to \npromoters that their tax schemes are unfair and unpatriotic. Again, I \nappreciate the bill managers accepting it into the bill.\n  I also thank Senator Coleman for being such a strong advocate of this \napproach, putting in the law a real deterrent to end these abusive tax \nshelters which have cost the Treasury and the average taxpayers of this \ncountry, who have to share the burden, so many tens of billions of \ndollars. That is now hopefully going to end.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee for the way they have worked with us to adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the balance of my time to my friend from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I commend my friend, the Senator from \nMichigan, for his leadership in protecting the interests of all \ntaxpayers by originally bringing to light the nature of these abusive \ntax shelters. I had the opportunity to work with him to make a \ndifference, to help shape this amendment.\n  I also thank Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus for accepting this \namendment and for their leadership on this issue. I am glad the Senator \nfrom Michigan didn't try to explain and walk through all the details of \nhis chart of these sham tax shelters. The bottom line is very clear: \nThe Government gets ripped off. The taxpayers get ripped off. These \nabusive tax shelters were established for the purpose of avoiding tax \nliability. Those who suffer are all the taxpayers. By this amendment, \nby substantially increasing the penalties, by putting some real \ndeterrent in place, I believe public trust in our laws will be \nrestored.\n  In November, as chairman of Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \nI held two hearings on abusive tax shelters. The permanent subcommittee \nspent one year investigating the tax shelter industry. It became clear \nto the subcommittee that some tax avoidance schemes are clearly \nabusive. These abusive shelters relied on sham transactions with no \nfinancial or economic utility other than to manufacture tax benefits.\n  According to GAO, abusive tax shelters robbed the Treasury of $85 \nbillion over 6 years. The use of these tax shelters exploded during the \nhigh flying 1990s, when many firms were awash in cash and more \nconcerned with generating fees than being compliant with the Code. The \nlure of millions of dollars in fees clearly played a role in \nthe decision on the part of tax professionals to drive a Brinks truck \nthrough any purported tax loophole.\n\n  Abusive tax shelters require accountants and financial advisors who \ndevelop and structure transactions to take advantage of loopholes in \nthe tax law. Lawyers provide the cookie-cutter tax opinions deeming the \ntransactions to be legal. Bankers provide loans with little or no risk. \nYet the amount of the loan creates a multimillion-dollar tax loss.\n  This became a game. Otherwise reputable professionals were able to \nearn huge profits by providing services that offered a veneer of \nlegitimacy to the transactions. The parties were careful to hide the \ntransaction from IRS detection by failing to register and failing to \nprovide lists of clients who used the transactions to the IRS.\n  It was clear to the subcommittee that the promoters of these tax \nshelters failed to register with the IRS partly because the penalties \nfor failing to register were so low compared to expected profits. As my \ncolleague from Michigan noted, with the risk-benefit ratio, it was \nworth avoiding the law because if you got caught it didn't matter; you \nmade so much money. The penalties were so little that you took the risk \nof avoiding the law. In fact, the benefits were great.\n  This amendment changes that. Current provisions of the JOBS bill \nprovide for increased penalties to address abusive tax shelters. \nHowever, I agree with Senator Levin that even stronger penalties are \nneeded. The provision to substantially increase penalties to promoters \nwho manufacture these sham transactions so they must give back all of \ntheir ill-gotten gains is vital to restoring the integrity of our tax \nlaws and deterring future avoidance.\n  This amendment also increases the amount of penalties for persons who \nknowingly aid and abet a taxpayer in understating their tax liability. \nCurrent law and the JOBS bill only apply this penalty to tax return \npreparers. We now get the aiders and abettors. However, the close \ncollaboration between the lawyers, accountants, financial advisors, and \nbanks requires us to apply penalties to all material aiders and \nabettors, not just those who prepare the tax returns.\n  This is not a victimless crime. It is not the Government that loses \nthe money. It is the people of America, average working families who \nwill bear the brunt of lost revenue so that a handful of lawyers and \naccountants and their clients can manipulate legitimate business \npractices to make a profit. Abusive transactions are used to avoid \ndetection by the IRS. This amendment sends a clear message that this \nCongress intends to put an end to abusive sham transactions.\n  With the passage of this amendment, the price to be paid for \nparticipating and for promoting abuse will be very steep indeed--all of \nyour profits.\n  I am appreciative that the managers have joined me in supporting this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I urge adoption of the Levin-Coleman modified \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 3120, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3120) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Ambassadorial Appointments\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was in the Chamber this morning when the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee, the majority leader, complained \nabout our holding up--the Democrats, the minority--appointments to our \nambassadorial corps. I thought that doesn't sound right, but I wanted \nto make sure I had my facts right, even though I had a tremendous \nimpulse to say: Mr. Leader, you are just wrong.\n\n[[Page S5217]]\n\n  After having looked at the facts, I can say now: Mr. Leader, you were \nwrong this morning.\n  This is an important issue. I have been fortunate to have started off \nin the House of Representatives, and being on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, one of my assignments was to travel. I have had the good \nfortune of being able to travel, in the more than two decades I have \nbeen in Congress, all over the world. I am tremendously impressed with \nthe places I go, where we have young men and women who serve, as \nSenator Dodd did. I think he went to the Dominican Republic. We have \nhad other examples, but that is the only one I know of people who \nserved in the Peace Corps. This is a wonderful organization. They do \nwonderful things for the country. I admire so much what they do.\n  But there is no one I admire as much as our career Foreign Service \nofficers, our diplomatic corps. They do such wonderful work, without \nany notoriety at all. So any time we talk about our State Department, \nour diplomatic corps, I want to defend them. So I know this is an \nimportant issue raised by the majority leader this morning. But I \nthought it would be important for me to respond to some of the current \nconcerns I have heard expressed this morning.\n  I was on the Senate floor last Thursday, and I was pleased that the \nSenate confirmed 20 Ambassadors that day, including the Ambassador to \nIraq, Ambassador Negroponte, whose assignment will begin after June 30 \nof this year. His nomination was completed with near record speed, \ngiven that he was confirmed 1 week after he was nominated by the \nPresident of the United States. The other 19 Ambassadors confirmed that \nday were confirmed less than a week after they were reported out of the \nForeign Relations Committee. That is remarkably good work.\n  By confirming these 19, the Senate filled 3 vacant U.S. Embassies. We \nhad hoped to confirm other career Foreign Service officers that day. \nFor example, Nepal--I have been there. There are very important events \ngoing on in that country now that we have an Ambassador there. As we \nknow, this has been a site of considerable violence.\n  Unfortunately, I have been advised that the objection to the \nconfirmation of James Frances Moriarity, of Virginia, a career Foreign \nService officer, doesn't come from us; it comes from the majority, \nmeaning this Embassy will continue to be vacant for the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  At the moment, I am told by the State Department that out of the \nnearly 170 Embassies we have around the world, 8 are vacant. So that \nmeans 162 of the 170 are filled. Eight are vacant, meaning they have no \nconfirmed Ambassador. The President has chosen not to fill two of them. \nSo now we are down to six. We have two that are too dangerous to \nfill, for reasons that are apparent--what is going on in the world. \nThat knocks us down to four. One is awaiting action in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. The Republicans objected to filling another. The \nlast two, Sweden and Finland, are vacant because President Bush's \npolitical appointees--not career Foreign Service officers, which I have \nno objection to because we need a mix--his political appointees decided \nthey could not stand being there much longer and they left.\n\n  So my dear friend, for whom I have so much respect, the majority \nleader, better have his staff give him better facts because he is \nabsolutely, totally wrong, for the reasons I have just indicated.\n  Last week, some of our friends on the majority side noted that the \nvacancies send a negative signal to these countries. Let the President \nmove with dispatch to fill them then.\n  I also hope the President will work out another problem. We have \nAmbassadors who have been confirmed by the Senate to posts around the \nworld, but they are not doing their work in the countries to which they \nwere sent. They have been sent to Iraq. Ambassadors assigned to the \nPhilippines, Kuwait, and Bahrain are in Iraq, not in the countries to \nwhich they were assigned. I know it is important that they help out in \nIraq, but that is not the way it should be. At least, it should not be \nthat people are complaining about these Ambassadors not having jobs and \nthe ambassadorial corps being empty and that we are holding it up.\n  I recognize the jobs these men are doing in Iraq are important. The \nthings they are performing in Iraq are obviously important or they \nwould not have been sent there. But don't complain about the minority \nholding up Ambassadors because we are not, for the simple math I have \ngiven you. So I hope we can consider the whole picture and not come to \nthe floor and complain and cry and whine about the Ambassadors not \nbeing confirmed because of us. It is simply not true.\n  If there is other business to come before the Senate, I will withhold \nsuggesting the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3133\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, now that this bill has finally passed \nthe Senate, I take the opportunity to thank several people.\n  First and foremost, I thank Senator Baucus. I am very certain we \nwould not be here without his good work and his cooperation. In fact, \nas I have said so many times in speeches, this whole effort started \nwhen Senator Baucus was chairman of the committee in the last Congress. \nHe held hearings and started this process going. He has not only \ncooperated and put in good work during this Congress, but it all \nstarted under his leadership.\n  I also need to thank all the other members of the Finance Committee \nfor their time and energy in making this bill a reality. I thank my \nstaff on the Finance Committee: Mark Prater, chief tax counsel, and the \nother tax counsels, Ed McClellan, Elizabeth Paris, Dean Zerbe, Christy \nMistr, and John O'Neill as well as John's predecessor, Diann Howland. \nThese individuals, along with Adam Freed, the staff assistant for the \ntax team, have been real workhorses for the committee, keeping the \nlights burning long into the night to make this bill possible.\n\n  For the record, as evidence of the work effort, this bill was \nintroduced on the day Hurricane Isabel blew into town. Because of hard \nwork, the markup of the bill occurred in a calm environment.\n  I also thank the trade staff, particularly Everett Eissenstat, chief \nTrade Counsel, and his team of David Johanson, Stephen Schaefer, Daniel \nShepherdson, and Zach Paulsen. I also thank Carrie Clark who recently \nleft our trade staff. Thanks also needs to be paid to our \nadministrative staff, including Carla Martin, Amber Williams, Geoff \nBurrell, and Mark Blair. From my personal staff, I thank Sherry Kuntz \nand Leah Shimp. Also helpful were our Finance Committee press team of \nJill Kozeny and Jill Gerber, known around the committee as the \n``Jills.'' Lastly, on my side, I thank Kolan Davis and Ted Totman, the \nCommittee's staff director and deputy staff director for riding herd on \nall this work.\n  In addition, this bipartisan bill would not have been possible \nwithout close work and cooperation at the staff level. I appreciate and \nthank the minority staff for their good work. I particularly note Russ \nSullivan, Democratic Staff Director, as well as Pat Heck, Democratic \nChief Tax Counsel, Matt Stokes, Matt Jones, Matt Genasci, Judy Miller, \nJon Selib, Liz Leibschutz, Matt Stanton, Dawn Levy, and Anita Horn \nRizek. In addition, I thank Tim Punke and his trade team, along with \nJohn Angell, Bill Dauster, and Mike Evans, former Deputy Staff \nDirector, for their time and energy.\n  I extend my thanks also to George Yin and his staff at the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation for providing their extensive knowledge and \nguidance to this effort. I particularly point out the good work of Ray \nBeeman, David Noren, and Brian Meighan. Brian recently left Joint Tax \nfor the private sector.\n  I also thank Acting Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, Gregory \nJenner, and his staff for their assistance on the so-called SILOs tax \nshelter provision of this bill.\n  I thank the majority leader, Senator Bill Frist, and his leadership \nstaff for all their assistance. The majority leader backed me and \nSenator Baucus all the way on this bill. We would not have the result \ntoday but for the majority leader's patience, determination, and \ndedication. It was tough going at times, but he and I knew we would get \nthe right result. From Senator Frist's staff, I thank Lee Rawls, Eric \nUeland, Rohit Kumar, and Libby Jarvis.\n  I also thank our Senate leadership team and their staffs, especially \nour able whip, Senator McConnell.\n  Finally, my thanks go to Jim Fransen, Mark Mathiesen, Mark McGunagle, \nand their capable staff at Legislative Counsel for taking our ideas and \ndrafting them into statutory language.\n  I would like to tell them all to go home and get a good night's rest \nbecause the bill has been a very long time working its way through the \nSenate.\n  Now, I urge our friends in the other body to pass a companion bill. \nHopefully, when that bill passes the House, our friends in the Senate \nDemocratic leadership will not resist our efforts to go to conference. \nEvery month of delay is another month where the Euro tax ratchets up \nanother percentage point on our products going to Europe.\n  I thank everyone for their cooperation in allowing us to get to this \npoint this evening. This, of course, is not the final step in the \nprocess. The House has\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\nnot passed their version of the FSC legislation. I anticipate the House \nwill send a bill to the Senate at some point. When that happens, I hope \nwe will be able to proceed to conference so that we are able to get a \nfinal product.\n  I appreciate the assistance of Senator Baucus throughout this process \nand hope we will be able to send a bill to committee.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. President, following Senator Baucus's remarks, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very proud of the Senate. The Senate \nworked its will through a very involved and complex tax bill. I might \nadd--I don't have the final figures here, but in the case of first \nimpression, this probably is one of the largest tax bills the Senate \nhas taken up and passed, outside of reconciliation--we don't know yet--\nin maybe a decade, or maybe close to two decades.\n  I say that because of the importance of protecting Senators' rights. \nI know this sounds like a little inside baseball, but when I say \n``outside reconciliation,'' all of us in the Senate know this means the \nbill was taken up under the usual Senate process, which means Senators \nhave the right to offer amendments, have the right to speak as long as \nthey can stand on their own two feet, and have the rights Senators \nusually have in taking up bills. Whereas, if this were to be taken up \nunder the process we call ``reconciliation,'' then amendments would \nhave to be passed very easily; that is, there is no right for extended \ndebate. Germaneness rules do not apply; that is, unless cloture is \ninvoked.\n  So the main point I want to make is that the Senate has done a good \njob. The Senate has taken up a very complicated, very large tax bill, \nand done it the way the Senate should ordinarily do business; that is, \noutside of reconciliation. We are responsible. We can do it. We did it.\n  I very much thank my good friend and colleague, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, who led us in a way to help make that happen. He \nbasically did it by being so gracious, by being so fair. He has a \nreputation, we all know, of being one of the most honest and fair \npersons you would ever have the privilege to meet, not only in the \nSenate but in life. His credibility is unquestioned. That is a \nsubstantial reason why we were able to pass such a messy bill outside \nreconciliation. I thank my friend for his leadership, for his \nfriendship, and for all he has done.\n  I also especially thank Senator Reid of Nevada. We all know Senator \nReid is probably one of the masters of the floor. He knows procedure, \nand his main goal is to get things done. He, too, is a man whose word \nis his bond. He is invaluable here. If not for the efforts of not only \nthe chairman but Senator Reid, I am not so sure we would be here today. \nHe has done a super job.\n  It is also very appropriate to thank a lot of my staff, and Senator \nGrassley's staff, and many others, which I will do. But before I do \nthat, I would like to do something a little bit differently and thank \nsome people who helped me with this bill; that is, the people I talked \nwith back home who provided ideas on how to structure the FSC/ETI \nreplacement bill in a way that made the most sense for our \nmanufacturers, not only throughout the country but in my home State of \nMontana.\n  This was a great chance for me to learn even more about manufacturing \nin my State, by going to manufacturers in my State and saying: What do \nwe need? What can we do to help make this happen?\n  Let me give you a few examples.\n  The timber industry, for example, has faced very tough economic times \nduring the last several years. In the years 2000 and before, many of \nthese businesses paid very high taxes on solid profits.\n  So a provision in this bill will permit businesses in industries with \ncyclical profits to smooth out their tax rates. This is accomplished by \npermitting a loss to be carried back for up to 5 years. That will help \na lot.\n  I thank Jim Hurst at Owens & Hurst, a small timber company located in \nEureka, MT, for helping us better understand the economics of the \ntimber business. The JOBS bill will help this company and many other \ncompanies that have very cyclical incomes.\n  I might add, too, that the people at Mountain Harvest Pizza Crust \nCompany, from Billings--that does not sound like a huge American \nmanufacturing company but they are extremely important to Montana, to \nBillings, and to me--helped educate me about the challenges of rising \ncosts facing small businesses, and about how the cost of health care \nwas getting to be too much to handle.\n  I might say, too, not all exporters are large corporations. We \nlearned this from Sun Mountain Sports in Missoula. They are an S \ncorporation. They export golf bags and other sports equipment. They are \njust the kind of company we want to stay strong so they can keep those \nmanufacturing jobs here in the U.S. and so they can continue to export \noverseas.\n  Because of discussions with many small businesses such as Mountain \nHarvest Pizza Crust and Sun Mountain Sports, I made sure that every \nmanufacturer would get this deduction. So we in the Finance Committee \nproduced a bill that gives a deduction not only to C corporations but \nto S corporations, to partnerships, and to sole proprietorships so they \nall could have help and not be left behind by this legislation. The tax \nrelief they are getting in this bill will help defray those and other \nrising costs.\n  Again, by consulting with the people at home, we were able to realize \nwhat the FSC/ETI replacement bill should be. It should not be just for \nbig C corporations--those are large, publicly held corporations--but, \nrather, for any organization that manufactures, including \nproprietorships, small businesses, et cetera.\n  I also thank the people at CHS--that is Central Harvest--who showed \nus the role that cooperatives play in rural America and helped us \nbetter understand the importance of making this tax deduction pass \nthrough to the members of cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives are a \ncrucial part of the economy of my State and a lot of the West, and, I \nmight add, a lot of other rural parts of America.\n  CHS helped to make sure their important contributions were not \noverlooked in this bill. I wanted, as I said, the bill to include all \nAmerican manufacturers, and I have made sure the bill includes the \nagricultural cooperatives that are so important to so many States.\n  Also, I thank Elvie Miller at Mountain Meadow Log Homes, who talked \nto us about how integral good research and design is to their business. \nFrankly, with the addition of the amendment by the Senator from Texas, \nwe were able to add that provision.\n  I also want to thank Leland Griffin and the good folks at Montana \nRefining Company in Great Falls. They pointed out that under the export \ncredit this bill will repeal, oil refining operations are not eligible \nfor tax benefits. But Montana Refining pointed out that if we are \nconverting the laws to a manufacturing deduction, then it should cover \noil and gas refining operations. Those operations are manufacturing. \nThey take raw material, crude oil, and convert it to a usable product--\ngasoline and other petroleum products. I offered an amendment in \ncommittee to include refining operations in the definition of \nmanufacturing.\n  All of these companies, and many more, were invaluable in passing \nsuch a strong bill in the Senate. I thank them. I thank them very much \nfor adding their part to this bill. Were it not for their very valuable \ncontributions, this legislation would not be as good.\n  I also thank a lot of people from my office. I don't have the whole \nlist. There are so many of them. If we turned the camera over, we could \nsee them lined up against the wall over there. Starting with Brian \nPomper on the far right, he does a very good job, handles a lot of \ntrade work. We have Pat Heck over there; Russ Sullivan; Matt Genasci; \nLiz Liebschutz, Matt Stokes, Jon Selib. We have Scott Landes there in \nthe corner, Simon Chabel, many others. Wendy Carrey is there; Mac \nCampbell. They are our folks. They do the work. My guess is\n\n[[Page S5220]]\n\nthat if I talk much longer, they are going to fall asleep, they are so \ntired. We all very much appreciate, deeply appreciate what they do.\n  I have often said that the most noble human endeavor is service--\nservice to church, to community, to mankind, service to whatever makes \nthe most sense to us as human beings. A lot of us who run for public \noffice get some of the psychic rewards of service. We see our names in \nnewspapers and on TV. Usually that is good, not always but usually.\n  However, the folks who work in the Senate, on Joint Tax and \nelsewhere, work harder. And they don't get public recognition for what \nthey do. They are the real servants. They are the ones who really \nprovide the most noble kind of service. I know I speak for everyone \nlistening, for everyone else who stops and thinks about these things if \nonly for a nanosecond, when I say how true that last statement is. They \nare the most wonderful folks. I take my hat off to all of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, congratulate Chairman Grassley \nand Senator Baucus for their great work in moving this JOBS bill to \ncompletion. I certainly express the hope that once the House acts, we \nwill be able to go to conference in the normal way that legislation is \nhandled and get this important piece of legislation on the President's \ndesk at the earliest possible time to prevent further penalties from \nbeing levied against our companies here in the United States.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3143, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding \nthe adoption of amendment No. 3143, that the modification which is at \nthe desk be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3143), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       ``(ii) there shall be disregarded any item of income or \n     gain from a transaction or series of transactions a principal \n     purpose of which is the qualification of a person as a person \n     described in this paragraph.\n       ``(C) Related person.--For purposes of this paragraph, the \n     term `related person' has the meaning given such term by \n     section 954(d)(3).''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       On page 335, strike lines 4 through 10, and insert the \n     following:\n       (2) Leases to foreign entities.--In the case of tax-exempt \n     use property leased to a tax-exempt entity which is a foreign \n     person or entity, the amendments made by this section shall \n     apply to taxable years beginning after January 31, 2004, with \n     respect to leases entered into on or before November 18, \n     2003.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the Senate for its \npassage of S. 1637, the Jumpstart Our Business Strength Act, which \nincludes my provision lowering the corporate tax rate on repatriated \nprofits. In one short year, this provision will bring $400 billion into \nour economy. This money is going to create over 650,000 new jobs and \nget our economy moving again. At the same time, it's going to help \nreduce the federal deficit.\n  I believe this is one of the most important provisions of the JOBS \nAct regarding job growth and strengthening our economy. This provision \nwould require that repatriated funds be reinvested in the United States \nfor hiring workers and worker training, infrastructure, R, capital \ninvestment, or financial stabilization for the purposes of job \nretention or creation. It is my understanding that the concept of \nfinancial stabilization, for this purpose, encompasses use of the \nrepatriated funds to repay debt of the U.S. parent corporation. Use of \nthese funds to pay down debt is a qualified use for purposes of the \nprovision. In fact, debt repayment will strengthen U.S. corporate \nbalance sheets, which will improve a company's ability to employ and \nhire workers.\n  I thank the chairman for his strong support of this repatriation \nprovision and look forward to swift action by the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5220-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CRAWFORD\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Richard C. \nCrawford who retires June 1 following a career devoted to public power, \nin the Tennessee Valley, that spans four decades. Mr. Crawford's \nretirement as president and chief executive officer of the Tennessee \nValley Public Power Association, and before that as a vice president \nfor the Tennessee Valley Authority, brings to a close a distinguished \ncareer of advocacy for public power.\n  Dick Crawford's contributions to public power are recognized not only \nin Tennessee and in the Tennessee Valley region, but across the entire \ncountry. While at TVA he was responsible for technological improvements \nto the utility's transmission system that resulted in enhanced electric \nreliability. He was also a leader in the development TVA's highly \nacclaimed energy conservation and efficiency programs, which were \nmodeled by other electric utilities around the Nation. He worked with \ndistributors of TVA power to overhaul the power contracts and helped \nintroduce innovative pricing and economic development products, \nincluding one of the first and largest real-time pricing programs, and \nincentive rates to help attract industry to the Tennessee Valley.\n  Mr. Crawford's contributions to public power continued when he joined \nthe staff of TVPPA in 1994. Initially, he served as director of power \nsupply services before becoming acting executive director, and later \npresident and chief executive officer. The knowledge he gained at TVA \nabout the Valley's unique power supply needs and the distributors who \ndeliver the power to the Valley's 8.3 million consumers made him a \nperfect choice to head TVPPA during a critical time in its history.\n\n[[Page S5221]]\n\n  With a strong belief in public power, Mr. Crawford worked tirelessly \nto re-establish critical relationships and re-open communication doors. \nUnder his leadership, TVPPA embarked on aggressive programs in \ngovernmental relations, communication, and education and training. In \naddition, he has spearheaded efforts to secure additional power supply \noptions for distributors. Working with his board of directors, he \nsuccessfully revamped TVPPA's dues structure and established additional \nlevels of membership that expand the reach of public power.\n  Throughout his career, he has received the support of his family, \nincluding wife, Lane, daughter, Angela, and grandson, Blake.\n  Honoring Dick Crawford in this way serves as a lasting tribute, just \nas his engineering and technical skills are a lasting gift to power \nconsumers in the Tennessee Valley. I thank him for his service, and I \nwish him all the best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5221-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE USS ``YF-415'' TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the official dedication of the world \nWar II Memorial approaches, I welcome this opportunity to honor the \nsacrifice of the courageous men who lost their lives close to home in a \ntragic accident in 1944, fourteen miles off the coast of Massachusetts \nduring the war.\n  Sixty years ago today, the 9-member crew of the Navy ship USS YF-415 \nand 21 men from the Hingham Ammunition Depot were disposing of \ncondemned ammunition and explosives off the coast. Tragically, while \nperforming their mission, the ordnance on the ship caught fire, setting \noff the ammunition for nearly 40 minutes. The ship and 17 lives were \nlost.\n  The vessel lay on the ocean floor until the summer of 2003, when \namateur divers discovered its remnants. They informed the Navy of the \nlocation, but too many years has passed, and the Navy salvage team was \nunable to find any trace of the missing men.\n  Now as the Nation prepares to honor all who served our country so \nbravely during World War II, it is fitting on this day to remember the \nmen who lost their lives in that tragedy 60 years ago. I express my \ndeepest condolences to the family members who have suffered so long \nbecause of that tragedy so close to home and to all of us in \nMassachusetts.\n   I would like to add the names of these men to the Record so that all \nmay recognize their sacrifice: William J. Bradley, Adell Braxton, \nJoseph F. Burke, Raymond N. Carr, Truman S. Chittick, George M. Cook, \nJames Cox, Jr., Freddie Edwards, Jr., F. E. Federle, James S. Griffin, \nCharles R.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In Montgomery County, MD, in 2001, Robert Lucas alleged that he \nkilled Monsignor Thomas Wells, a local priest, after the victim was \nsexually aggressive toward him. Lucas contends that his ``killing \nrage'' resulted from feelings of ``anger, shame and humiliation.'' The \nvictim bled to death as a result of stab wounds.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5221-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPLANATION OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mr. BAYH.

Mr. President, this morning, at Arlington National \nCemetery, I was honored to join Congressman Steve LaTourette, LTG \nRichard A. Cody, Superintendent of Arlington Cemetery John Metzler and \nstudents and faculty from Painesville High School for the dedication of \nthe Pyramid of Remembrance, a living memorial paying tribute to \nAmerican soldiers who have lost their lives during peacekeeping \noperations, humanitarian efforts, training, terrorist attacks, or \ncovert operations.\n  The unveiling of this historic memorial today came as a result of the \ndedication and hard work of motivated young people at Riverside High \nSchool in Painesville, OH and their teacher, Dr. Mary Porter. More than \none decade ago, in October 1993, these high school students watched in \nhorror as a U.S. soldier in Somalia was dragged through the streets of \nMogadishu. The students--concerned that there was not a memorial in our \nNation's Capital to honor members of the Armed Forces who lost their \nlives during peacekeeping missions such as the one in Somalia--felt \ncompelled to take action.\n  These students spearheaded a campaign to establish a Pyramid of \nRemembrance in Washington, DC. The students not only proposed the \nmemorial, they also created a private non-profit foundation to raise \nthe money to construct the memorial. The community in Painesville \npulled together, providing legal counsel for the students and private \ndonations to help fund the project. Due in part to the strong support \nof this Ohio community, the proposed national Pyramid of Remembrance \nhas been erected at no cost to U.S. taxpayers.\n  There has been considerable discussion regarding the Pyramid of \nRemembrance since it was first proposed by the students of Riverside \nHigh School and introduced in the House of Representatives in 1996.\n  On October 17, 2002, Senator Mike DeWine jonied me in introducing \nlegislation in the Senate for the first time to authorize the creation \nof the Pyramid of Remembrance. We re-introduced this legislation on \nJanuary 30, 2003, taking into account recommendations made by the \nNational Park Service, and the Senate Subcommittee on National Parks \nconducted a hearing to examine the legislation on June 3, 2003.\n  In addition to consideration in the United States Congress, the \nNational Capital Memorial Commission which is charged with overseeing \nmonument construction in Washington, DC, conducted hearings about the \nproposed Pyramid of Remembrance in April 2001. The Commission \nrecommended that the memorial be constructed on Defense Department \nland, possibly at Fort McNair. The commissioners also noted that such a \nmemorial would indeed fill a void in our Nation's military monuments.\n  I agree with the commissioners' findings. I, too, believe that this \nmemorial is a fitting addition to our Nation's Capital to honor those \nwho have lost their lives while serving in the United States military, \nand I am proud that it has now come to fruition.\n  On May 6, 1999, I spoke on the Senate floor in honor of two brave \nAmerican soldiers--CWO Kevin L. Reichert and CWO David A. Gibbs--who \nlost their lives when their Apache helicopter crashed into the Albanian \nmountains during a training exercise on May 5, 1999, as U.S. troops \njoined with our NATO allies in a military campaign against Slobodan \nMilosevic. As I remarked at the time, the United States owes Kevin, \nDavid and so many other service members a debt of gratitude that we \nwill never be able to repay, for they have paid the ultimate sacrifice. \nAs the Bible says in John, chapter 15:13:\n\n       Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his \n     own life for his friends.\n\n  The Pyramid of Remembrance honors individuals such as David Gibbs and \nKevin Reichert. It also honors the memory of the 17 service members who \nlost their lives when the USS Cole was attacked on October 12, 2000, \nand the American soldiers who lost their lives during the terrorist \nattacks against the Pentagon and the World Trade Center on September \n11, 2001.\n\n[[Page S5222]]\n\n  This memorial is dedicated to the brave men and women who have given \ntheir lives so that we may know freedom. I was deeply moved by words \nspoken this morning by Dr. Mary Porter, the teacher at Painesville High \nSchool who inspired these students to take action. She said:\n\n       And so this memorial is for you, SSG William Cleveland. \n     They dragged your body through the streets of Mogadishu, but \n     they could not destroy your spirit . . . for you and for all \n     those who have lost their lives in places like Somalia, \n     Bosnia and Iraq and in training accidents and acts of \n     terrorism: we celebrate your spirit. We recognize your \n     sacrifice. We honor your effort to establish peace. This \n     monument represents our eternal gratitude for your sacrifice, \n     but it also represents hope for a future where human beings \n     on this planet can live in peace and without fear.\n\n  The patriotism, dedication, and vision of the students at Riverside \nHigh School are commendable. Their action shows maturity, leadership \nand passion for their country that Americans of all ages should \nemulate. I support and applaud the work these students have done to \nestablish the Pyramid of Remembrance, as well as the efforts of \ncommunity members who have provided ongoing guidance and support to \nhelp the students turn their vision into reality.\n  I believe it is our duty to honor American men and women in uniform \nwho have lost their lives while serving their country, whether in \npeacetime or during war, and this memorial, which will remain and grow \nat Arlington National Cemetery, will ensure that the sacrifice made by \nso many is always remembered by our grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5222-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5222-S5223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THREATS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE SECTION 8 VOUCHER PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I express my extreme disappointment \nwith the administration's recent announcement on Fiscal Year 2004 \nSection 8 voucher renewals that threatens to end a long standing \ncommitment to fully fund all Section 8 vouchers in use. Coupled with \nits budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2005 that would slash funding for \nSection 8, the Bush administration has given the Nation's communities \nample reason to be concerned about the future of the Housing Choice \nVoucher Program.\n  The Section 8 voucher program has been the cornerstone of Federal \nhousing policy for nearly 30 years. The program provides the Nation's \nmost vulnerable families with vouchers to help them cover the cost of \nmodest apartments and homes in the private market. It serves more than \n2 million families nationwide who are trying to make ends meet. In my \nhome State of Vermont it helps nearly 6,000 households--more than 60 \npercent of them are elderly or disabled members and 24 percent of them \nare working families.\n  Unfortunately the administration has chosen to shortchange the \nprogram in a way that will almost guarantee that the poorest of \nfamilies lose their support. They recently announced the intention to \nmove from a funding formula based on the actual cost of vouchers to a \nmodel that calculates voucher costs based on last year's costs, pegged \nto a regional rent inflation index--which may or may not reflect local \nmarket conditions--and despite the fact that they may have access to \nmore recent and accurate data on voucher costs.\n  The new formula does not take into consideration potential changes in \npersonal incomes, and it does not provide definitive safeguards for \npublic housing authorities--PHAs--that have seen rising voucher costs \nover the last year or that will be unable to meet their obligations to \nvoucher holders once this policy is enacted. What I find even more \ntroubling is that HUD will apply this formula retroactively, leaving \nmany public housing authorities shortchanged by millions of anticipated \ndollars.\n  Without the necessary funds to support all vouchers they have issued, \nmany PHAs are either going to have to scale back subsidies or revoke \nvouchers completely. Already we are seeing the effects. PHAs are \nstarting to realize massive gaps in their budgets. They are considering \ncourse corrections to plug these holes and in some cases have stopped \naccepting additional applicants for the Section 8 waiting list. If the \nadministration's policy is carried out, it will be the first time since \n1974 that the Federal Government walks away from our commitment to \nhonor all authorized voucher contracts.\n  This new policy goes against the intent and will of Congress. We made \nit clear in the Fiscal Year 2004 Omnibus Appropriations Bill that the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development--HUD--should do everything \nin their power to ensure that all vouchers were fully funded, and we \ngave HUD the resources and tools they needed to do so. The \nAppropriations Committee added more than $1 billion dollars to the \nadministration's request for Section 8 vouchers, we gave HUD access to \na central reserve fund to supplement voucher payments in the event that \ncosts exceeded expectations, and the Senate passed sense of the Senate \nlanguage reaffirming our commitment to the voucher program and to those \nthat it serves. The intention of Congress could not have been clearer.\n\n  As a member of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee, I am not \nwithout concern for the rising cost of the Section 8 program, and I \nunderstand the need to look for creative solutions to contain those \ncosts. But this new funding formula is irresponsible and shortsighted. \nSimply serving fewer people, or people with higher incomes--the almost \ncertain outcome of this approach--is the wrong response to the rising \ncost of Section 8. Instead, we should be looking at measures to reduce \nthe cost of housing and to raise the average wage. We should look at \npolicies which will enable families to afford a place to live without \nFederal assistance.\n  This new ruling is contrary to the administration's own goal to \neliminate chronic homelessness in 10 years and will put a strain on \nother support services such as homeless care providers who are already \nstretched beyond their means. If it is not reevaluated, it will leave \nthousands of families nationwide at risk of losing their housing. It \nlacks specificity needed for PHAs to accurately predict how they are \ngoing to be affected and leaves considerable discretion to the \ndepartment of how to interpret renewals.\n  This announcement fell on a housing community already reeling from \nthe news that the administration wants to cut $1.6 billion dollars from \nthe program in the next Fiscal Year and convert Section 8 into a block \ngrant program. If this proposal goes through, an additional 250,000 \npeople could be faced with the loss of their housing assistance. My \nhome State of Vermont would lose more than $4 million in anticipated \nfunds and could be forced to cut nearly 740 low-income, elderly and \ndisabled families out of the program.\n  This is the wrong time to walk away from some of our Nation's most \nvulnerable populations. I find it outrageous that the President can \nstand behind policies that threaten the safety and wellbeing of \nthousands of American families while continuing to advocate for \ncorporate tax cuts and tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. There is \na fiscal crisis in this county, of that I am sure. Our Federal debt \ncontinues to rise and the Federal treasury continues to shrink, but it \nis not caused by the modest assistance we give families on Section 8.\n  This program has proven itself to be one of the most cost-effective \nhousing programs. This was confirmed by two separate reports in 2002--\none by the General Accounting Office, and reinforced by the Millennial \nHousing Commission. It has been shown to have positive effects on \nfamilies and children, many of whom are able to move out of high \npoverty areas to areas of lower poverty and lower crime rats and better \nschools. Studies have shown that it helps promote success in the \nworkplace performance--by providing reliable housing while families are \ntrying to get established, many of whom have moved off welfare.\n  We cannot expect low-income families to improve their situations, \nhold steady jobs and move out of poverty if they do not have access to \nreliable, safe and affordable housing. We cannot expect the elderly and \nthe disabled who are on meager fixed incomes to fend for themselves in \nrental markets that have spiraled out of the reach of even moderate-\nincome families. Section 8 provides temporary assistance to those who \nneed it. It helps families avoid the choice between a roof over their \nheads or food on the table.\n\n[[Page S5223]]\n\n  Congress gave the HUD the resources they needed to fully fund all \nvouchers under contract, and I would expect them to use those \nresources. This is not the place to try and reap meager savings to make \nup for a Federal deficit caused by questionable tax cuts and \nirresponsible fiscal policies.\n  I urge the administration to reevaluate this policy and to restore \nour commitment to the Section 8 program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5223-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEDICAL RESIDENCY PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I once again raise my concerns with \nSection 207 of the Pension Funding Equity Act that passed the Senate on \nApril 8 and was signed into law on April 10. This provision grants a \nretroactive antitrust exemption to the graduate medical education \nresidency matching program, a subject that is entirely unrelated to the \npension bill and never received a full consideration by the normal \nprocesses of this body.\n  My concerns about that provision are simple. First, I do not think \nthat exemptions from this nation's antitrust laws should be lightly \ngiven. Second, I think the process by which this exemption was given--\nwithout any opportunity for hearing before the appropriate committees \nor full and real consideration by this body--was improper. Finally, I \nam concerned about the correct interpretation of the language as to the \nscope of the immunity.\n  As I stated in the floor debate on the pension bill, I believe that \nthe language of subsection 207(b)(3) makes clear that the exemption \nfrom the antitrust laws granted by this legislation is limited; and \nthat if there is a claim of price-fixing--which is prohibited by \nsection one of the Sherman Act--then the provisions of subsection \n207(b)(2) do not apply.\n  Even though my right to file an amendment was reserved on this bill, \nI have now lost that right as my amendment is no longer in order now \nthat cloture has been invoked. Having lost this right, I will seek a \nfuture opportunity to raise this issue before this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5223-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCY DISEASES\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to focus \nattention on primary immune deficiency diseases, PIDD, a problem that \naffects thousands of people across our Nation. Primary immune \ndeficiency diseases are genetic disorders in which part of the body's \nimmune system is missing or does not function properly. The World \nHealth Organization recognizes more than 150 primary immune diseases \nthat affect as many as 50,000 people in the United States. Fortunately, \n70 percent of PIDD patients are able to maintain their health through \nregular infusions of a plasma product know as intravenuous \nimmunoglobulin. IGIV helps bolster the immune system and provides \ncritical protection against infection and disease.\n  I am familiar with primary immune deficiencies because one of my \nconstituents and long-time Shreveport, LA, residents, Gail Nelson, is a \nPIDD patient. Gail and her husband Syd Nelson have become tireless \nadvocates for the primary immune deficiency community as volunteers for \nthe Immune Deficiency Foundation. IDF is the Nation's leading \norganization dedicated to improving the quality of life for PIDD \npatients.\n  Recently, the foundation entered into a historic research partnership \nwith the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the \nNational Institutes of Health. The establishment of the US \nImmunodeficiency Network represents the most significant advancement in \nprimary immune deficiency research in our Nation's history. I was \npleased to work with the Nelsons, the foundation, and my colleagues in \nthe Senate to make this research consortium a reality.\n  Despite the recent progress in PIDD research, the average length of \ntime between the onset of symptoms in a patient and a definitive \ndiagnosis of PIDD is 9.2 years. In the interim, those afflicted may \nsuffer repeated and serious infections and possibly irreversible damage \nto internal organs. Thus, it is critical that we raise awareness about \nthese illnesses within the general public and the health care \ncommunity.\n  I commend the Immune Deficiency Foundation and Gail and Syd Nelson \nfor their leadership in this area, and I am proud to join them in \nraising awareness of these diseases. I encourage my colleagues to work \nwith us to help improve the quality of life for PIDD patients and their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5223-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              IOWA WOMEN AGAINST HEART DISEASE AND STROKE\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to acknowledge women \nin Iowa who are taking a stand against heart disease and stroke. Many \npeople assume that cardiovascular disease is a man's disease. The truth \nis, it has claimed more lives of women since 1984.\n  Nationwide, 8 million women are living with heart disease. Thirteen \npercent of women age 45 and over have had a heart attack.\n  As a survivor of breast cancer, my wife Barbara knows the fears of \nmany women. Heart disease, just like cancer, is scary and real. It is \nup to women around the world to educate their friends, mothers, and \nsisters about the disease. Women in Iowa are doing it this week.\n  I commend every woman in Iowa for being an advocate for a very good \ncause. The campaign to educate all women about the major risk factors \nof heart disease and about heart-healthy behavior will positively \nimpact the lives of many families. Women in Iowa should not \nunderestimate their personal risk, and they should know what they can \ndo to beat the disease.\n  In Congress, I have worked to increase funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health. The NIH is one of the world's foremost medical \nresearch centers, and the Federal focal point for medical research in \nthe United States.\n  I am keenly aware of the overall benefits of biomedical research to \nthe health care system, and to those with heart disease.\n  In fact, the NIH has set out to develop a national public awareness \nand outreach campaign to convey the message that heart disease is the \nnumber one killer of American women and that it can be successfully \nprevented and treated.\n  Six years ago, we set out to double the funding for the NIH. We \nfollowed through with our promise. As a result, the NIH now funds \nnearly 10,000 more research grants and can support the training of over \n1,500 more scientists each year.\n  This is good news for women everywhere. The increase in funding is a \nstep in the right direction, but we can't give up. It will take all of \nus to stop the leading cause of death in our state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5223-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OREGON HEALTH CARE HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \noutstanding Oregon leader who has been a health care hero for Oregon's \nseniors. Barbara Arazio has served on the Oregon Board of Nursing Home \nExaminers for 18 years, mentoring nursing home administrators and \nensuring quality care for vulnerable Oregon seniors.\n  When Oregonians find that one of their loved-ones is in need of \nskilled nursing care, they want assurances that the highest quality \ncare will be provided in a safe environment. Because of Barbara's \ndiligence and hard work, our families have that peace of mind. Barbara \nhas played a central role in helping nursing homes not only comply \nwith, but exceed the State standards for nursing facilities.\n  The level of service at each Oregon nursing facility is driven by its \nleadership. Barbara has trained nursing home administrators and \ncontinually worked with them to make sure that residents have access to \nthe best health care and facilities. In fact, the quality of life at \nOregon care centers, from the activities, to the meals, to the well-\ntrained staff, can be traced back to Barbara's caring hand.\n  As Barbara embarks on her well earned retirement, she will be greatly \nmissed by the administrators, staff and residents of Oregon's long term \ncare system. She has touched many lives and is truly a Health Care Hero \nfor Oregon.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5224-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5224]]\n               MR. BASEBALL, RICHARD A. SAUGET, TURNS 60\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Richard A. \nSauget, an outstanding citizen, community leader, business \nentrepreneur, husband, father, and grandfather. His distinguished \ncontributions and accomplishments have improved the economic \nprosperity, social welfare, and individual lives of so many people in \nSouthwestern Illinois and the St. Louis region.\n  Richard A. Sauget was born on April 21, 1944. He was raised by his \nparents, Vincent and Estelle Sauget, in the Village of Sauget, which \nwas founded by Rich's grandfather, Leo. Rich continues to reside in \nSauget with his wife, Judee. The Sauget family was one of the first to \nsettle in the area. Rich and Judee have five children, three \ngrandchildren, and one grandchild on the way. His Catholic faith and \nfamily have always been his priorities.\n  After graduating with a B.A. from the University of Notre Dame and a \nM.A. from St. Mary's University, Rich began a successful professional \nbaseball career. He played baseball with the Atlanta Braves and San \nFrancisco Giants. During his career, he served as a backup for Joe \nTorre and a catcher for the great Satchel Paige.\n  Rich Sauget continues to be involved in baseball. Starting with the \nSauget Wizards, a semi-professional team in the Mon-Clair Baseball \nLeague, Rich brought professional-level baseball to Southwestern \nIllinois. Today, his passion is the Gateway Grizzlies Baseball Team, a \nteam he founded. Rich, a managing partner of the Grizzlies, was the \ndriving force in designing and building the new Grizzlies GMC stadium \nin 2002. By the way, the Gateway Grizzlies won the Frontier League \nChampionship in 2003.\n  Rich serves on several prominent sports association boards, including \nthe St. Louis Sports Commission, Southwestern Illinois Officials \nOrganization, the St. Louis Professional Baseball Scouts Association, \nand is the current president of the Frontier Professional Baseball \nLeague.\n  In addition to his sports accomplishments, Rich has been a highly-\nsuccessful business entrepreneur. He is the founder and president of \nEast County Enterprises, Inc., a real estate management company that \nhas been in business for more than 35 years. East County Enterprises \nmanages various properties in several Southwestern Illinois \ncommunities. The company has provided job opportunities and generated \nbusiness growth in the region.\n  Rich Sauget is a dedicated community leader with a strong commitment \nto service. He has volunteered a great deal of time to the economic \ndevelopment of the St. Louis Metropolitan area by serving on many \nprominent boards, including the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth \nAssociation, the Leadership Council of Southwestern Illinois, the St. \nLouis Regional Business Council, the St. Louis Lambert Airport \nCommission, and the Missouri Historical Society Board. He is the \nChairman of the St. Clair County Building Commission which oversees the \ndevelopment of MidAmerica St. Louis Airport.\n  For years, Rich has emphasized the importance of bringing together \nand developing the entire St. Louis region as one united community, \nincluding a highly-integrated airport transportation system. His vision \nincludes the eventual formation of a Regional Airport Authority to \nprovide the St. Louis region with more efficient passenger, cargo, and \nmaintenance services.\n  As chairman of the board of Touchette Regional Hospital and a member \nof the board of Kenneth Hall Hospital, Rich has been instrumental in \nthe development and expansion of healthcare services to low income \nfamilies, specifically underprivileged women and children, in the \nSouthwestern Illinois region.\n  To further serve the Southwestern Illinois/St. Louis region, Rich has \nbeen working to develop a strong business leadership group, Archview \nCommunities Economic Development Corporation. Archview is designed to \nenhance economic, social, and business development opportunities by \nfacilitating partnerships between government programs, local \nmunicipalities, the area's healthcare network, the local education \nsystem, and many regional business owners.\n  It should also be noted that both Rich and Judee Sauget are involved \nin many charitable organizations in Illinois and Missouri.\n  Richard A. Sauget leads by example and sets a very high standard for \nall of us to follow. I congratulate him for his impressive \naccomplishments and heartfelt service to his community and look forward \nto many more years of working with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5224-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5224-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5224-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5224-S5225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOTIFICATION OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER BLOCKING THE PROPERTY OF CERTAIN \n  PERSONS AND PROHIBITING THE EXPORT OF CERTAIN GOODS TO SYRIA--PM 76\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with subsection 204(b) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) (IEEPA), and section 301 of the \nNational Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1631, I hereby report that I have \nissued an Executive Order (order) in which I declared a national \nemergency with respect to the threat constituted by certain actions of \nthe Government of Syria. Further, in accordance with subsection 5(b) of \nthe Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of \n2003 (SAA), Public Law 108-175, this message also constitutes the \nreport of my exercise of the waiver authority pursuant to that statute.\n  On December 12, 2003, I signed into law the SAA in order to \nstrengthen the ability of the United States to effectively confront the \nthreat to U.S. national security posed by Syria's support for \nterrorism, its military presence in Lebanon, its pursuit of weapons of \nmass destruction, and its actions to undermine U.S. and international \nefforts with respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq. \nThese policies by the Government of Syria directly threaten regional \nstability and undermine the U.S. goal of a comprehensive Middle East \npeace. Despite many months of diplomatic efforts to convince the \nGovernment of Syria to change its behavior, Syria has not taken \nsignificant, concrete steps to address the full range of U.S. concerns, \nwhich were clearly conveyed by Secretary of State Powell to Syrian \nPresident Asad in May 2003. I find the actions, policies, and \ncircumstances described above sufficiently grave to constitute a threat \nto the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \nStates, and thus have declared a national emergency to address that \nthreat.\n  In implementation of subsection 5(a) of the SAA, in the order I \ndirected that action be taken to prohibit the export to Syria of \nproducts of the United States other than food and medicine, including \nbut not limited to items on the United States Munitions List or \nCommerce Control List, and I prohibited commercial air services between \nSyria and the United States by aircraft of any air carrier owned or \ncontrolled by Syria, as well as certain non-traffic stops by such \naircraft.\n  It is important to the national security interests of the United \nStates, however, that certain discrete categories of exports continue \nin order to support activities of the United States Government and \nUnited Nations agencies, to facilitate travel by United States persons, \nfor certain humanitarian purposes, to help maintain aviation safety, \nand to promote the exchange of information. Also, it is important to \nU.S. national security interests that aviation-related sanctions\n\n[[Page S5225]]\n\ntake into account humanitarian and diplomatic concerns as well as the \ninternational obligations of the United States.\n  Accordingly, I have waived the application of subsections 5(a)(1) and \n5(a)(2)(A) of the SAA to permit the export and reexport of: products in \nsupport of activities of the United States Government to the extent \nthat such exports would not otherwise fall within my constitutional \nauthority to conduct the Nation's foreign affairs and protect national \nsecurity; medicines on the Commerce Control List and medical devices; \naircraft parts and components for purposes of flight safety; exports \nand reports consistent with the 5(a)(2)(D) waiver outlined below; \ninformation and informational materials, as well as telecommunications \nequipment and associated items to promote the free flow of information; \ncertain software and technology; products in support of United States \noperations; and, certain exports and reexports of a temporary nature. \nThese items are further identified in the Department of Commerce's \nGeneral Order No. 2, as issued consistent with my order. I have also \nwaived the application of subsection 5(a)(2)(D) to permit the following \nwith respect to aircraft of any air carrier owned or controlled by \nSyria: takeoffs or landings of such aircraft when chartered by the \nGovernment of Syria to transport Syrian government officials to the \nUnited States on official Syrian government business; takeoffs or \nlandings for non-traffic stops of such aircraft that are not engaged in \nscheduled international air services; takeoffs and landings associated \nwith an emergency; and overflights of U.S. territory.\n                                                    George W.

A bill to promote the reliability of the electric \ntransmission grid through the Cross-Sound Cable; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a legislation to \nrestore operation of the Cross Sound Cable.\n  I was dismayed to learn last Friday that the Secretary of Energy had \nissued an order that effectively shut down the Cross Sound Cable. The \ncable had been operating since Secretary Abraham issued an order \ndirecting that the cable be turned on almost immediately after the \nAugust 14, 2003 blackout.\n  I believe that last Friday's decision is shortsighted, and I am \nextremely concerned that it will put Long Island at immediate risk of \npower failures as we enter the summer peak demand months.\n  The Cross Sound Cable has provided proven reliability benefits at a \ntime when a shortage of generation and transmission facilities \ncontinues to exist on Long Island and in Southern New England. The \nCross Sound Cable transmitted 300 MW of power over the Blackout \nweekend, enough to turn on the power in about 300,000 homes on Long \nIsland. Since beginning full-time operation on September 1, 2003, the \nCross Sound Cable has transmitted nearly one-half million megawatt-\nhours of electricity to help provide sufficient power to prevent more \nblackouts or brownouts on the island.\n  Additionally, the extra power from the Cable makes more power \navailable on Long Island to export over another submarine cable into \nSouthwestern Connecticut when needed, thereby making the regional power \ngrid more resilient. The independent grid operators have successfully \ntested sending power over the Cross Sound Cable to Long Island and then \nsimultaneously sending power from Western Long Island over another \nsubmarine cable to Southwest Connecticut. During a severe cold spell in \nJanuary, Long Island\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\nPower Authority was prepared to send 200 mw of power over Cross Sound \nCable to help Connecticut if needed. Over the short- to long-term, the \nCable thus allows excess New York-generated power to be transmitted to \nConnecticut to help prevent blackouts and brownouts.\n  In addition, the vital role of the Cross Sound Cable was confirmed in \nthe final report of the U.S.-Canada Task Force on the Blackout. The \nblackout report concludes that ``[r]eactive power problems were a \nsignificant factor in the August 14 outage, and they were also \nimportant elements in several of the earlier outages . . .'' During the \nAugust 14 blackout, the Cross Sound Cable provided critical reactive \npower to Long Island and Connecticut to help stabilize the system. \nCross Sound has responded to and corrected 17 unanticipated reactive \npower problems such as lightning strikes and equipment failures. \nCONVEX, the Connecticut arm of the independent transmission system \noperator, ISO-New England, has relied on Cross Sound to provide \nreactive power for voltage support on a preventive basis 84 times. \nCross Sound Cable is currently the only operating cable system in \nConnecticut and Long Island capable of providing dynamic reactive power \nsupport during sensitive energy demand periods.\n  Nearly every day now, the Cable operates under the direction of \nCONVEX to provide voltage support to Connecticut.\n  In summary, the Cross Sound Cable has provided reliability benefits \nat a time when a transmission and generation shortage persists in the \nregion. I strongly believe that this critical energy link between New \nEngland and New York should remain operational until all reliability \nstudies required by the Blackout Task Force are completed and all of \nthe resulting recommendations are implemented to prevent further large-\nscale blackouts in this region. Until all of these steps occur, I \nbelieve that an emergency situation clearly continues to exist.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation today. In essence, the \nlegislation overrides the order issue by Secretary Abraham on May 7, \n2004, reinstates his order of August 28, 2003, and provides that that \nlater order shall remain in effect unless rescinded by an Act of \nCongress. This would turn the cable back on and leave it on until \nCongress determines it is appropriate to shut it down. That day may \nindeed come, but for now, we are facing the prospect of power outages \non Long Island as we head into the peak-demand months of the summer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2406\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1. CROSS-SOUND CABLE ORDER.\n\n       Notwithstanding Department of Energy Order No. 202-03-4, \n     issued by the Secretary of Energy on May 7, 2004, or any \n     other provision of law, Department of Energy Order No. 202-\n     03-2, issued by the Secretary of Energy on August 28, 2003, \n     is reinstated effective on the date of enactment of this Act \n     and shall remain in effect unless rescinded by Act of \n     Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2407. A bill to clarify the intellectual property rights of the \nUnited States Olympic Committee; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am introducing an amendment to the Ted \nStevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act that will serve to protect the \nlimited resources available to the United States Olympic Committee \n(``USOC'') to support America's Olympic athletes. This amendment would \nnot expand the protections afforded to the USOC under existing law, but \nwould clarify the broad scope of the existing statutory language that \nguarantees the USOC's exclusive right to commercial use of Olympic \nmarks and terminology in the United States. Congress originally granted \nthese rights to the USOC so that the USOC, through its licensing and \nsponsorship program, would have the ability to raise funds privately to \nsupport United States athletes and programs. Unauthorized use of \nOlympic marks and terminology by third parties dilutes the value of \nthese marks and terminology and diminishes the USOC's ability to \nfulfill the mission mandated by Congress. This amendment will help \nensure that the USOC can devote more of its resources to assisting \nathletes as opposed to funding legal actions necessary to prevent \nforeign or domestic entities from circumventing the broad statutory \nrights granted to the USOC.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2407\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Support Our Olympic Athletes \n     Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF \n                   UNITED STATES OLYMPIC COMMITTEE.\n\n       Chapter 2205 of title 36, United States Code (commonly \n     referred to as the ``Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports \n     Act''), is amended in section 220506(c)(3) by inserting ``the \n     words `Olympik', `Olympick', `Olympika', `Olympicka', \n     `Olympica', or `Olympikus','' after ``the words described in \n     subsection (a)(4) of this section,''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 2408. A bill to adjust the boundaries of the Helena, Lolo, and \nBeaverhead-Deerlodge National Forests in the State of Montana; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this bill adjusts the boundaries of the \nHelena, Lolo, and Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forests in Montana.\n  For the Helena and Lolo National Forests, these adjustments are \nnecessary to continue the community-based Blackfoot Community Project. \nThis community-driven project is a collaborative effort supported by \nlocal residents, elected officials, State and Federal agencies, and \nothers who care about the future of the Blackfoot River Valley.\n  The project will eventually result in the future ownership and \nmanagement of nearly 88,000 acres of land in the Blackfoot River \nwatershed. The project will protect the rural lifestyle of a large, \nintact landscape that supports agriculture, timber harvesting, \nrecreation, and natural resources that are important both locally and \nnationally.\n  The project will provide a model for forest management in the west, \nby creating a private-public partnership to manage a portion of the \nBlackfoot watershed as a community forest for sustainable timber \nproducts and other natural resources benefits. The local community has \nrequested Forest Service acquisition of certain parcels outside the \nexisting National Forest Boundary to ensure continued public uses of \nthese lands including public access for recreation, hunting, livestock \ngrazing, and watershed protection. The end result of this boundary \nadjustment Forest service will be consolidated ownership and improved \nforest management.\n  The boundary adjustment on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest \nreflects changes in the Forest as a result of the Watershed \nconservation project completed in 2003. About 11,000 acres of the \nWatershed Property that is currently adjacent to the proclaimed Forest \nwill be more accurately classified as existing within the Forest \nboundary. The Forest Service purchased the property in partnership with \nthe Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. The County Commissioners, local \npublic, and conservation and sportsman's groups supported the project.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2410. A bill to promote wildland firefighter safety; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Wildland \nFirefighter Safety Act of 2004, along with my colleague Senator Murray, \nthe senior Senator from Washington State. Earlier today, the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee on which I serve held a hearing \nregarding the outlook for the 2004 fire season. I join many of my \ncolleagues, who are very concerned about what appears to be yet another \nyear of devastating drought throughout the West, and the\n\n[[Page S5230]]\n\nhazards this could pose in terms of increased fire risk and threats to \npublic safety.\n  However, we in Washington State recognize the importance of an issue \nthat is often overlooked in discussions of fire preparedness. This is \nthe topic of wildland firefighter safety, and it's an issue that we \ncare deeply about because a horrible tragedy occurred in our state in \nJuly 2001, when four young Washington firefighters lost their lives at \nthe Thirtymile Fire. I come to the floor to introduce this legislation \ntoday, because we cannot forget the lives that were lost--and the \nfamilies that are still grieving--as a result of the Thirtymile \ntragedy. What's more, we cannot allow the Forest Service and our \nFederal firefighting agencies to repeat the mistakes that the agencies \nthemselves admit resulted in these avoidable deaths. Unfortunately, the \nrecently-issued findings of the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration (OSHA)--stemming from the Cramer Fire that killed two \nIdaho firefighters just last summer--indicate to me that the lessons of \nThirtymile are not being completely heeded. This is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Many of my colleagues, particularly those from the West, are probably \naware of the fact that every summer, we send thousands of our \nconstituents--many of them brave young men and women, college students \non summer break--into harm's way to protect our Nation's rural \ncommunities and public lands. These men and women serve our nation \nbravely. Since 1910, more than 900 wildland firefighters have lost \ntheir lives in the line of duty. According to the U.S. Forest Service, \na total of 30 firefighters across this Nation perished in the line of \nduty just last year, during the 2003 fire season.\n  These firefighters represented a mix of Federal and State employees, \nvolunteers and independent contractors. And they lost their lives for \nan array of reasons. We all realize that fighting fires on our nation's \npublic lands is an inherently dangerous business. But what we cannot \nand must not abide are the preventable deaths--losing firefighters \nbecause rules were broken, policies ignored and no one was held \naccountable.\n  I have already mentioned the Thirtymile tragedy that pushed this \nissue to the fore in the State of Washington. On July 10, 2001, near \nWinthrop in Okanogan County, in the midst of the second worst drought \nin the history of our State, the Thirtymile fire burned out of control.\n  Four courageous young firefighters were killed. Their names: Tom \nCraven, 30 years old; Karen FitzPatrick, 18; Jessica Johnson, 19; and \nDevin Weaver, 21.\n  Sadly, as subsequent investigations revealed, these young men and \nwomen did not have to die. In the words of the Forest Service's own \nreport on the Thirtymile fire, the tragedy ``could have been \nprevented.'' At that time, I said that I believe we in Congress and \nmanagement within the firefighting agencies have a responsibility to \nensure that no preventable tragedy like Thirtymile fire ever happened \nagain.\n  I'd like to thank my colleague Senator Bingaman, the distinguished \nRanking Member of the Senate Energy Committee, as well as Senator \nWyden, who was then chair of the Subcommittee on Public Lands and \nForests. In the wake of the Thirtymile Fire, they agreed to convene \nhearings on precisely what went wrong that tragic day. We heard from \nthe grief-stricken families.\n  In particular, the powerful testimony of Ken Weaver--the father of \none of the lost firefighters--put into focus precisely what's at stake \nwhen we send these men and women into harm's way.\n  I can think of no worse tragedy that a parent to confronting the loss \nof a child, especially when that loss could have been prevented by \nbetter practices on the part of federal agencies.\n  At that Senate Energy Committee hearing, we also discussed with \nexperts and the Forest Service itself ways in which we could improve \nthe agency's safety performance. And almost a year to the day after \nthose young people lost their lives, we passed a bill--ensuring an \nindependent review of tragic incidents such as Thirtymile that led to \nunnecessary fatalities.\n  Based on subsequent briefings by the Forest Service, revisions to the \nagency's training and safety protocols, and what I've heard when I have \nvisited with firefighters over the past two years, I do believe the \ncourage of the Thirtymile families to stand up and demand change has \nhad a positive impact on the safety of the young men and women who are \npreparing to battle blazes as wildland firefighters.\n  Yet, I'm deeply saddened by the fact that it's clear we haven't done \nnearly enough.\n  In July 2003--two years after Thirtymile--two more firefighters \nperished, this time at the Cramer Fire within Idaho's Salmon-Challis \nNational Forest. Jeff Allen and Shane Heath were killed when the fire \nburned over an area where they were attempting to construct a landing \nspot for firefighting helicopters. Certainly some 28 others lost their \nlives fighting wildfires last year, and we must recognize the sacrifice \nand grief befalling their families.\n  After the Thirtymile Fire, however, I told the Weavers and the \nCravens, the families of Karen FitzPatrick and Jessica Johnson that I \nbelieved we owed it to their children to identify the causes and learn \nfrom the mistakes that were made in the Okanogan, to make wildland \nfirefighting safer for those who would follow. That is why the findings \nassociated with the Cramer Fire simply boggle my mind.\n  We learned at Thirtymile that all ten of the agencies' Standing Fire \nOrders and many of the 18 Watch Out Situations--the most basic safety \nrules--were violated or disregarded. The same thing happened at Cramer, \nwhere Heath and Allen lost their lives two years later.\n  After the Thirtymile Fire, OSHA conducted an investigation and levied \nagainst the Forest Service fire citations for Serious and Willful \nviolations of safety rules. It was eerie, then, when just this March \nOSHA concluded its investigation of Cramer. The result: another five \nOSHA citations, for Serious, Willful and Repeat violations. Reading \nthrough the list of causal and contributing factors for Cramer and \nputting them next to those associated with the Thirtymile fire, my \ncolleagues would be struck by the many disturbing similarities. Even \nmore haunting are the parallels between these lists and the factors \ncited in the investigation of 1994's South Canyon Fire on Storm King \nMountain in Colorado. It's been 10 years since those 14 firefighters \nlost their lives on Storm King Mountain--and yet, the same mistakes are \nbeing made over and over again.\n  Let me repeat: This is not acceptable. The firefighters we send into \nharm's way this year--and the ones we've already lost--deserve better.\n  Training, leadership and management problems have been cited in all \nof the incidents I've discussed. Frankly, I have believed since the \nThirtymile tragedy that the Forest Service has on its hands a cultural \nproblem. What can we do, from the legislative branch, to provide this \nagency with enough motivation to change? I believe the first step we \ncan take is to equip ourselves with improved oversight tools, so these \nagencies know that Congress is paying attention. Today I'm introducing \nlegislation--the Wildland Firefighter Safety Act of 2004--that would do \njust that.\n  I believe this is a modest yet important proposal. It was already \npassed once by the Senate, as an amendment to last year's Healthy \nForests legislation. However, I was disappointed that it was not \nincluded in the conference version of the bill. But it is absolutely \nclear to me--particularly in light of OSHA's review of the Cramer \nFire--that these provisions are needed now more than ever.\n  First, the Wildland Firefighter Safety Act of 2004 will require the \nSecretaries of Agriculture and Interior to track the funds the agencies \nexpend for firefighter safety and training.\n  Today, these sums are lumped into the agencies' ``wildfire \npreparedness'' account. But as I have discussed with various officials \nin hearings before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nit is difficult for Congress to play its rightful oversight role--\nensuring that these programs are funded in times of wildfire emergency, \nand measuring the agencies' commitment to these programs over time--\nwithout a separate break-down of these funds.\n  Second, this legislation will require the Secretaries to report to \nCongress annually on the implementation and effectiveness of its safety \nand training programs.\n\n[[Page S5231]]\n\n  I assure my colleagues who have not spent time dwelling on this issue \nthat the maze of policy statements, management directives and curricula \nchanges associated with federal firefighter training is dizzying and \ncomplicated. The agencies have a responsibility to continually revise \ntheir policies in the face of new science and lessons learned on the \nfire line. Meanwhile, Congress has the responsibility to ensure needed \nreforms are implemented. As such, I believe that Congress and the \nagencies alike would benefit from an annual check-in on these programs. \nI would also hope that this would serve as a vehicle for an ongoing and \nhealthy dialogue between the Senate and agencies on these issues.\n  Third, my bill would stipulate that Federal contracts with private \nfirefighting crews require training consistent with the training of \nFederal wildland firefighters. It would also direct those agencies to \nmonitor compliance with this requirement. This is important not just \nfor the private contractor employees' themselves--but for the Federal, \nState and tribal employees who stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them on \nthe fire line.\n  This is actually quite a complex issue about which many of us are \njust beginning to learn. With the severity of fire seasons throughout \nthe country over the past two years--and notwithstanding the Clinton \nAdministration's efforts to hire a significant number of new \nfirefighters as part of the National Fire Plan--the number of private \ncontract crews hired by the agencies to help with fire suppression has \ntripled since 1998. According to Oregon Department of Forestry \nestimates, the number of contract crews at work has grown from 88 in \n1998 to 300 this year--with 95 percent based in the Pacific Northwest.\n  In general, these contract crews have grown up in former timber \ncommunities and provide important jobs--especially given the fact the \nagencies themselves do not at this juncture have the resources to fight \nthe fires entirely on their own. And many of these contractors have \nbeen in operation for a decade or more and boast stellar safety \nrecords.\n  Nevertheless, as the number of--and need for--contractors has grown, \nthere are more and more tales of unscrupulous employers that take \nadvantage of workers and skirt training and safety requirements. This \nis a growing concern for U.S. Forest Service employees and State \nofficials. Last summer, the Seattle Times wrote a detailed feature on \nthe issue, quoting internal Forest Service memos as well as evidence \nfrom the field.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  Among the contractor practices cited in the Seattle Times article: \nbreaking safety rules and failing to warn other crews on the fire line; \nfalsifying or forging firefighting credentials and ignoring training \nrequirements; hiring illegal immigrants that cannot understand fire \nline commands--and committing various labor abuses; and rotating a \nsingle crew from fire to fire for 50 straight days--while Federal \nfirefighters are not allowed to work more than 14 or 21 days in a row.\n  The article quoted from a November 2002 memo written by Joseph \nFerguson, a deputy incident commander for the Forest Service: ``If we \ndon't improve the quality and accountability of this program, we are \ngoing to kill a bunch of firefighters . . . Although there were two or \nthree good to excellent crews on each fire, that was offset by 20 to 30 \nthat were hardly worth having,'' Ferguson added. ``It was apparent that \ntraining for most of these crews had been done poorly or not at all.''\n  Paul Broyles, who heads a safety committee for the National \nInteragency Fire Center added that private crews he has seen have \nvaried from ``fantastic to a he[ck] of a lot less than good and some \nwere real safety concerns.'' He noted that while State government and \nfeds were trying to crack down on violations associated with \ndocumentation, ``the assumption is, where there's one problem, there's \nprobably more.''\n  The Wildland Firefighter Safety Act of 2004 is a modest beginning in \naddressing the challenges posed by integrating private and Federal \ncontract crews--and doing it in a manner that maximizes everyone's \nsafety on the fire line.\n  I understand that the Federal and State agencies are already \nattempting to push contractors in this direction--and this provision \nwill bolster that momentum.\n  And so, I hope my colleagues will support this simple legislation. \nUltimately, the safety of our Federal firefighters is a critical \ncomponent of how well prepared our agencies are to deal with the threat \nof catastrophic wildfire.\n  Congress owes it to the families of those brave firefighters we send \ninto harm's way to provide oversight of these safety and training \nprograms.\n  We owe it to our Federal wildland firefighters, their families and \ntheir State partners--and to future wildland firefighters.\n  The Wildland Firefighter Safety Act of 2004 will provide this body \nwith the additional tools it needs to do the job. Thank you.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Seattle Times, July 20, 1003]\n\nRisky business; Growth of Private Fire Crews Worries Forest Officials. \n  Some Fear Training and Safety Are Compromised by Burgeoning Use of \n                         Contract Firefighters\n\n                            (By Craig Welch)\n\n       Crewuch Valley, Okanogan County.--While the Forest Service \n     was retooling safety training after the deaths of four \n     firefighters in this rugged valley two years ago, a new \n     danger was quietly mushrooming in the woods.\n       Private businesses eager to get into the increasingly \n     lucrative wildfire-fighting industry were breaking rules, \n     skirting training and falsifying records to send \n     inexperienced men and women to battle blazes, according to \n     government records. Some churned out crews that fell asleep \n     on the fire line or couldn't understand commands in English. \n     Others arrived hours late to fires that then ballooned out of \n     control.\n       Private crews are now essential in the West's battle \n     against flames a war once fought primarily by government \n     employees. The number of private 20-person firefighting crews \n     sent by companies that contract with the government to fight \n     fires around the nation more than tripled since 1998, from 88 \n     to 301 this year. About 95 percent of those crews are based \n     in the Northwest.\n       But some federal officials worry the quality varies \n     dramatically from experienced, well-respected contractors to \n     crews that present significant safety concerns.\n       And government oversight has struggled to keep pace.\n       The problem grew so acute last year that Joseph Ferguson, a \n     deputy incident commander for the Forest Service, wrote in an \n     internal memo in November: ``If we don't improve the quality \n     and accountability of this program, we are going to kill a \n     bunch of firefighters.''\n       Last year's fire season was a record breaker, scorching 6.9 \n     million acres and costing $1.6 billion to fight.\n       With a new fire season under way, officials are still \n     working to week out contractors and private trainers who cut \n     corners and put employees or other firefighters in harm's \n     way. Several private crew operators are also urging the \n     government to crack down on problem contractors.\n       In May, in a first-of-a-kind action, a regional \n     firefighting group composed of federal and state agencies \n     suspended a Twisp-based contractor from training any more \n     pacific Northwest firefighters. Employees of Charles ``Bill'' \n     Hoskin, who has trained hundreds of private firefighters, \n     told investigators that Hoskin put firefighters through a \n     required 32-hour training course in 12 hours.\n       He was accused of teaching Spanish-speaking firefighters \n     with instructors who spoke only English, of selling red cards \n     the photo ID that shows carriers have met requirements to be \n     a firefighter to people he had not trained, and of giving \n     firefighters bogus fitness tests.\n       Hoskin, former chief of the Twisp rural volunteer fire \n     department, has denied all charges of improper action and \n     says he will be vindicated.\n       Last month, Rue Forest Contracting, of Mill City, Ore., \n     agreed to $25,000 in fines after 23 of its firefighters were \n     found with forged or phony training credentials. \n     Investigators believe some were sent to fires with no \n     training at all. Owner Larry Rue's attorney declined comment.\n       Last year, the Oregon Department of Forestry, which \n     oversees fire contractors for Oregon and Washington under an \n     interagency agreement, cited 45 private crews for various \n     violations and banned 13 from firefighting for up to a month.\n       The reason: Firefighters showed up late to fires, skipped \n     safety briefings, drank or used drugs at fire camp, engaged \n     in sexual harassment, had falsified training records or were \n     part of a crew with no English-speaking leaders, according to \n     the department.\n       Oregon labor officials, meanwhile, said they were \n     investigating 30 private firefighter-training or pay \n     violations at any one time last year.\n       Ferguson, the Forest Service incident commander who fought \n     fires in Oregon, Utah and Colorado, complained in his \n     November memo\n\n[[Page S5232]]\n\n     that Northwest private crews in 2002 were ``the worst we've \n     ever seen.''\n       ``Although there were two or three good to excellent crews \n     on each fire, that was offset by 20 to 30 that were hardly \n     worth having,'' Ferguson wrote. ``It was apparent that \n     training for most of these crews had been done poorly or not \n     at all.\n       Bill Lafferty, head of Oregon's fire program, oversees most \n     of the country's private 20-person ``hand crews.'' He's \n     beefing up enforcement but admitted that ``we really don't \n     know the magnitude of the cheaters in the system.''\n       ``We're struggling as best we can,'' he said. ``But we're \n     barely scratching the surface.''\n       On a recent 90-degree day, firefighter Dustin Washburn, 21, \n     rolled a boulder from the charred dirt and saw smoke rise \n     from smoldering embers. He attacked it with a pulaski, an \n     axlike firefighting tool, smothering the fire.\n       This 20-person private hand crew was trying to douse \n     hotspots on portions of a 34,000-acre blaze that still burns \n     in the Chewuch River high country in Okanogan County.\n       ``Who was working this area?'' asked Myron Old Elk, the \n     crew leader for a private unit of Oregon-based Ferguson \n     Management. ``Get over here. It's still hot.''\n       Private crews typically dig lines, knock down spot fires or \n     burn areas to reduce fuels. They're supposed to get the same \n     training as government crews.\n       Many, such as this Ferguson unit, are run by respected, \n     experienced hands. Old Elk has fought fires for a dozen \n     years. Private Ferguson Management crews have battled blazes \n     since 1981.\n       ``Myron's great,'' said Lonnie Click, a supervisor on this \n     roiling blaze. ``If he doesn't understand directions, he'll \n     ask, then double-ask, until he gets it exactly right.''\n       But the industry has grown so quickly that some new \n     companies supply firefighters however they can.\n       Contractors have hired illegal immigrants and paid them \n     under the table, or deducted so much for food and incidentals \n     that some earned only 50 cents in a two-week pay period, \n     according to Oregon's Bureau of Labor and Industries. \n     Underage firefighters ``borrowed'' Social Security numbers to \n     fake certification.\n\n\n                            feast or famine\n\n       Firefighters aren't allowed to work more than 14 or 21 days \n     in a row without a rest day, but some private firefighters \n     have rotated from fire to fire for 50 days straight, \n     according to Forest Service memos. A crew removed from one \n     Oregon fire for poor safety ratings last year showed up two \n     weeks later on a nearby fire.\n       ``There's a lot of money to be made here, and when there's \n     a lot of money at stake, people figure out angles,'' said \n     Scott Coleman, owner of Oregon's Skookum Reforestation, which \n     for decades has provided contract crews.\n       The nation's private wildfire firms have grown out of \n     Oregon's logging, tree-planting and forestry labor pool. As a \n     result, Oregon now manages the bulk of them.\n       For years, it was feast or famine. New contractors started \n     after busy fire years, then disbanded during slow ones.\n       But wildfires had grown increasingly unruly in the 1990s, \n     just as federal agencies had downsized their own crews. So \n     the government increasingly has turned to contractors.\n       After 2000, when firefighting help was enlisted from as far \n     away as New Zealand, more contractors, including several from \n     Washington, saw opportunity. Contractors typically charge the \n     government $22 to $36 an hour per worker. The contractor buys \n     vehicles, equipment and clothing, provides training and pays \n     firefighters from $9 to $18 per hour.\n\n\n                        new emphasis on training\n\n       Last year, 270 20-person private crews in the Northwest \n     were paid $91 million. Several companies grossed $1 million \n     apiece.\n       ``Overhead can be enormous, but if you have a good fire \n     season and get sent out a lot, you bet there's profit in \n     it,'' said Coleman, vice president of the National Wildfire \n     Association, which has pushed to weed out unscrupulous \n     contractors. ``But if you don't train someone well, you're \n     basically endangering his life.''\n       Five federal agencies the Forest Service, National Parks, \n     Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service and \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs fight fires.\n       The agencies renewed efforts to make safety the top \n     priority after 14 Forest Service firefighters were trapped by \n     flames during the July 2001 Thirty Mile fire in the Chewuch \n     Valley. Jessica Johnson, Karen FitzPatrick, Devin Weaver and \n     Tom Craven were asphyxiated by superheated gases after \n     deploying their shelters.\n       Investigators determined crew leaders violated all 10 \n     standard safety rules. The agency put new emphasis on \n     training, communication, spotting hazardous situations and \n     handling emergencies.\n       But among new private crews, training issues can be even \n     more basic. Firefighters have bought fire IDs from former \n     firefighters and spliced in their own photographs.\n       ``Just yesterday, I got a call from a woman who wanted to \n     verify that I'd trained these two guys who had '03 dates on \n     heir certification,'' said Harry Winston, who trains contract \n     firefighters through First Strike Environmental in Oregon. \n     ``I hadn't. They'd scratched out '02 on their red cards and \n     put in this year's date.''\n       Don Land, who worked for Hoskin, the suspended contract \n     trainer, was made an ``engine boss'' a person who operates a \n     wildland firetruck without any training, according to the \n     state Bureau of Labor and Industries.\n       Land was released from prison after a three-year sentence \n     in 2001. He said that Hoskin hired him for the fire season. \n     Land said he had not completed the required training and \n     lacked even a driver's license, but was given the job of an \n     engine boss.\n       The state accused Hoskin of giving his students answers to \n     written tests and allowing them to use a 5-pound weight in a \n     fitness test that requires hiking with a 45-pound pack.\n       Hispanic crews now make up half of the Northwest's private \n     firefighters, and contractors have been disciplined for \n     sending crews with no English speakers to fires a potential \n     hazard when communicating risk.\n       New rules require crew and squad leaders to speak both \n     English and the language of the crew. But an internal Forest \n     Service memo suggested that bilingual leaders on Oregon's \n     Tiller Complex fires last year appeared to be there mainly \n     for their language skills. Five crew bosses confessed to not \n     understanding their leadership responsibilities.\n       Paul Broyles, who heads a safety committee for the National \n     Interagency Fire Center, said the private crews he's seen \n     varied from ``fantastic to a hell of a lot less than good and \n     some were real safety concerns.''\n       A contract crew on an Oregon fire Broyles worked last year \n     was stationed to make sure a rolling inferno stayed behind a \n     fire line. Instead, the crew watched as flames crossed the \n     line, never informing a nearby elite ``hotshot'' crew of the \n     danger headed its way, he said.\n       The state and the federal government are strengthening \n     oversight and tightening controls on documentation, said \n     Broyles. Still, he said, ``the assumption is, where there's \n     one problem, there're probably more.''\n       This year, Oregon plans to investigate private crews more \n     heavily. The state now inspects training classes and expects \n     to hire new compliance officers.\n       But much of the training is designed to be self-policing.\n       Wildfire contractors form associations, which sign \n     agreements with federal and state agencies. The association \n     then guarantees that contractors meet regulations.\n       Of eight such associations, some are vastly more qualified \n     than others, said Ed Daniels, who oversees Oregon's \n     certification and training.\n       Qualifications to form an association: ``Thirty-five \n     dollars and a pen to sign a memorandum of understanding,'' he \n     said.\n       Hoskin was president of his association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Daschle, Mr. McCain, \n        Mr. Hollings, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, Ms. Collins, Mr. Sarbanes, \n        Mr. Specter, Mr. Biden, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Graham of \n        South Carolina, Mr. Rockfeller, Mr. Smith, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Gregg, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Baucus, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Reed, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 2411. A bill to amend the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act \nof 1974 to provide financial assistance for the improvement of the \nhealth and safety of firefighters, promote the use of life saving \ntechnologies achieve greater equity for departments serving large \njurisdictions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator DeWine and 34 co-\nsponsors to introduce the Assistance to Firefighters Act of 2004, which \nwill revitalize the FIRE Act grant program for an additional six years.\n  Senator DeWine and I authored the original FIRE Act four years ago. \nIt has been a tremendous success, helping fire departments throughout \nour Nation purchase firefighting equipment as well as train \nfirefighters. Nationwide, nearly $2 billion has been appropriated for \nFIRE Act grants throughout the country.\n  A report last year by the Federal Government found that 99 percent of \ngrant recipients were satisfied with the FIRE Act's ability to meet the \nneeds of their department. In addition, 97 percent of the participants \nreported that it had ``a positive impact on their ability to handle \nfire and fire-related incidents.'' The report concluded that ``overall, \nthe results of our survey and our analysis reflect that the Assistance \nto Firefighters Grant program was highly effective in improving the \nreadiness and capabilities of firefighters across the Nation.'' The \nFIRE Act grant initiative is truly a success story.\n\n[[Page S5233]]\n\n  It is important to remember that the defenders of our Nation are not \ndressed only in combat fatigues. They wear firefighter uniforms. They \nrisk their lives to keep us safe just like our troops overseas, and we \nall appreciate their efforts greatly.\n  The fire service has men and women who are willing to do whatever it \ntakes to get their jobs done. As a country, we are fortunate to have \nfirst-rate firefighters throughout the Nation, but they are \nunderfunded, understaffed, undertrained, and underequipped to deal with \nmany emergencies that may arise. According to a national Needs \nAssessment study of the U.S. Fire Service published in December 2002, \nmost fire departments lack the necessary resources and training to \nproperly handle terrorist attacks and large-scale emergencies. A June \n2003 Council of Foreign Relations report authored by former Senator \nWarren Rudman further underscored this issue when it concluded that \n``if the Nation does not take immediate steps to better identify and \naddress the urgent needs of emergency responders, the next terrorist \nincident could have an even more devastating impact than the September \n11 attacks.''\n  The responsibilities of America's firefighters have also changed. \nThey have certainly come a long way from the ``bucket brigades'' in \ncolonial America, where two rows of people would stretch form the town \nwell to the fire, passing buckets of water back and forth until the \nfire was extinguished.\n  Today, firefighters must do more. They still have their traditional \nresponsibilities of extinguishing fires, delivering emergency medical \nservices, and ensuring that fire codes are obeyed. Now the fire service \nhas new homeland security responsibilities, such as responding to \nbiological and chemical threats.\n  The reality, however, is that cash-strapped States and cities simply \ndo not have the resources needed to single-handedly safeguard their \npopulations. Nor do they have the fiscal reserves necessary to deal \nwith heightened warning levels for any extended period of time.\n  According to the aforementioned U.S. Fire Service's 2002 national \nNeeds Assessment study, most fire departments lack the necessary \nresources and training to properly handle terrorist attacks and large-\nscale emergencies. The study found that: Using local personnel, only 11 \npercent of fire departments can handle a rescue at a collapse of a \nbuilding with 50 occupants. Nearly half of all fire departments \nconsider such an incident beyond their scope.\n  Using local personnel, only 13 percent of fire departments can handle \na hazardous material incident involving chemical and/or biological \nagents with 10 injuries. Only 21 percent have a written agreement to \ndirect the use of non-local resources to handle the situation.\n  An estimated 40 percent of fire department personnel involved in \nhazardous material response lack formal training in those duties, most \nof them serving smaller communities.\n  Finally, an estimated 60 to 75 percent of fire departments do not \nhave enough fire stations to achieve widely used response time \nguidelines. Many fire departments often fail to respond to fires with \nsufficient personnel to safely initiate an interior attack on a \nstructural fire.\n  These statistics are startling. The threats to which firefighters are \nexpected to respond have far outgrown the ability of local governments \nto equip firefighters to do what these dangerous times require them to \ndo. This situation demands continued action by the Senate to address \nthese concerns, which is why Senator DeWine and I are introducing this \nlegislation to further strengthen the FIRE Act grant initiative for the \nfuture.\n  Our bill builds on the recommendations given to us last February by \nthe paid and volunteer fire services. First, we are authorizing $5.85 \nbillion over the next six years for FIRE Act grant assistance. This \namount represents a substantial increase over current law.\n\n  Second, we are both increasing the size of the awards and making the \ngrants more equitable. Presently, the maximum amount of an award is \n$750,000, regardless of the size and type of department. For a large \ndepartment, this cap has caused some difficulties because departments \nin smaller communities get a substantially larger share of the funds \nper capita. Our legislation will increase the size of the awards for \nlarge jurisdictions to $2.25 million, a threefold increase. For \njurisdictions between 500,000 and one million people, the cap will be \n$1.5 million. For jurisdictions less than 500,000, the maximum award \nwill be $1 million. The bill also empowers the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to waive these caps in instances of extraordinary need.\n  Third, we have restructured the matching requirements of current law. \nWe have heard from the fire services that the current matching \nrequirement imposed on local jurisdictions in many instances exceeds \nthe funds available in their budgets. Our bill will reduce the non-\nFederal matching requirement from 30 percent to 20 percent for \ndepartments serving populations of more than 50,000 people. It will \nalso cut the match by one-third for departments serving communities \nbetween 20,000 and 50,000 people, and by one-half for departments \nserving 20,000 or fewer residents.\n  Finally, we have enhanced the fire safety and fire prevention \nprograms under the FIRE Act, and we have made volunteer, non-profit \nemergency medical service (EMS) providers that serve municipalities \nwith separate fire and EMS departments eligible for FIRE Act grants. In \naddition, we tackle the leading cause of firefighter death in the line \nof duty--heart attacks--by creating an incentive for fire departments \nto acquire life-saving automated external defibrillator equipment for \nevery first-due emergency vehicle.\n  These are some of the provisions in the legislation that Senator \nDeWine and I are introducing. We look forward to working constructively \nwith the other body in the coming months to fashion legislation that \nthe entire fire service can support.\n  I am concerned, however, about a provision in the House bill that \nwould seem to disadvantage paid fire departments over volunteer fire \ndepartments. This provision would prohibit a paid fire department from \nreceiving FIRE Act assistance if it includes in its collective \nbargaining agreement a clause prohibiting its firefighters from serving \nas volunteer firefighters in another jurisdiction.\n  This provision would needlessly put Congress in the awkward position \nof dictating to local fire departments not only how to manage \nthemselves, but what issues they can and cannot bargain over in their \ncontract. The consequences of such a provision would be far-reaching. \nIn fact, I am unaware of any other Federal grant initiative that \nimposes a limitation of such as this on collective agreements.\n  Of course, there are larger issues also at stake--namely, the fact \nthat the Federal government does not provide for firefighters to \nbargain collectively. Where bargaining does occur, it exists because \nfirefighters have won the right at the state or local level. In fact, I \nhave strongly supported separate legislation currently pending before \nCongress that would grant each and every firefighter the right to \ndiscuss workplace issues with their employer. It would therefore be \ninconsistent if firefighters are told what issues over which they can \nor cannot bargain at the same time that it is the current policy of the \nFederal Government that it is up to the states whether they can bargain \nin the first place. How can collective bargaining rights be restricted \nwhen they are not even granted?\n  The legislation that Senator DeWine and I are introducing does not \ninclude the House provision, because we are committed to ensuring that \nall firefighters are treated fairly, and have an equal opportunity to \nobtain the assistance they need to do their jobs safely.\n  In closing, it is important to recall the vital role that \nfirefighters have played in American history since its earliest days. \nIn fact, firefighting can be linked to some of our Nation's most \nillustrious personages. Benjamin Franklin established the first \nvolunteer fire department in Philadelphia in 1735. George Washington \nhimself was a volunteer firefighter across the Potomac River in \nAlexandria, Virginia, and he imported the first fire engine from \nEngland in 1765.\n  Of course, on September 11, 2001, 343 members of the New York Fire \nDepartment made the ultimate sacrifice in their efforts to save \nthousands of lives trapped in the World Trade Center. The role played \nby those firefighters who\n\n[[Page S5234]]\n\ndied in the line of duty on that tragic day made our Nation proud. We \nwill never allow their noble sacrifice to be forgotten.\n  On that day and on every other day, they are the first ones in and \nthe last ones out. They risk their own lives to save the lives of \nothers. They stare danger in the face because they know they have a \nduty to fulfill.\n  The Congress has a duty to the fire service as well, and to the \ncitizens of our Nation who need the protection of the fire service. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the coming months to \nensure that this important bipartisan homeland security legislation is \nenacted into law.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, each day, we entrust our lives and the \nsafety of our families, friends, and neighbors to the capable hands of \nthe brave men and women in our local police departments. These \nindividuals are willing to risk their lives and safety out of a \ndedication to their citizens and their commitment to public service.\n  We ask local firefighters to risk no less than their lives, as well, \nevery time they respond to an emergency fire alarm, a chemical spill, \nor as we saw on September 11, terrorist attacks. We ask them to risk \ntheir lives responding to the nearly 2 million reports of fire that \nthey receive on an annual basis. Every 18 seconds while responding to \nfires, we expect them to be willing to give their lives in exchange for \nthe lives of our families, neighbors and friends. One hundred \nfirefighters lost their lives in 2002 in the line of duty, and nearly \n450 lost their lives in 2001. The unyielding commitment these \nindividuals have made to public safety surely deserves an equally \nstrong commitment from the Federal Government.\n  In 2000, Congress affirmed the value of having a properly trained, \nequipped and staffed fire service by passing the Firefighter Investment \nand Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act--legislation that Senator Dodd and \nI introduced, along with Congressmen Pascrell, Weldon, and many others, \non the House side. In the 4 years since the FIRE Act become law, fire \ndepartments have made significant progress in terms of filling the \nsubstantial needs outlined in the National Fire Protection \nAssociation's ``needs assessment.'' To date, Congress has appropriated \nnearly $2 billion for the FIRE Act program. Virtually every penny of \nthat amount has gone directly to local fire departments through FIRE \ngrants to provide firefighter personal protective equipment, training \nto ensure more effective firefighting practices, breathing apparatus, \nnew firefighting vehicles, emergency medical services supplies, fire \nprevention programs, and other important uses. The direct nature of the \nFIRE Act grant program--funds literally go straight from the Federal \nGovernment to local fire departments--is an extremely important aspect \nof the law, particularly in light of the difficulties we are seeing \nwith other homeland security grant programs getting money to flow \ndirectly to the intended recipients.\n  FIRE Act grants are awarded based on a competitive, peer-review \nprocess that helps ensure that the most important needs are filled \nfirst and that funding will be used in an effective manner. I am proud \nto note that 86 of Ohio's 88 counties have received FIRE Act funding up \nto this point and that the fire service in my home State is much better \nprepared to respond to emergencies as a result. The bottom line is \nthis: The FIRE Act program has proven to be an extremely valuable tool \nfor fire-based first responders.\n\n  The time has come to reauthorize this important legislation--to build \nupon the successes of the original FIRE Act and to refine the program \nwhere improvements can be made. Just as we did in 2000, Senator Dodd \nand I have come together, along with the support of several national \nfire service organizations, to introduce a bill to reauthorize the FIRE \nAct. Our bill focuses on four central themes. First, we take steps to \nmake the grant program more accessible for fire departments serving \nsmall, rural communities and to eliminate barriers to participation \nfaced by departments serving heavily populated jurisdictions. Second, \nwe codify changes made in program administration since its transfer to \nthe recently created Department of Homeland Security. Third, the bill \nincreases the emphasis within the program on life-saving Emergency \nMedical Services and technologies. And fourth, we evaluate the program \nthrough a series of reports to help ensure that resources are targeted \nto the areas of greatest need. These priorities have been developed \njointly with the fire service, and represent a means to strengthen the \nFIRE Act program for years to come.\n  First, our new legislation would help the FIRE act program be more \naccessible for fire departments serving the very largest and smallest \njurisdictions in America. Our experience over the past 4 years has been \nthat a number of features in the program make participation difficult \nfor departments serving these populations. Career fire departments, \nmost of which serve populations well in excess of 50,000, have been \nreceiving only a small percentage of the total grants thus far. After \nconsulting with the fire service organizations, fire chiefs in my home \nState of Ohio, and officials administering the program at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, we've found that there are two main \nreasons why this has been the case.\n  First, matching requirements for large departments, currently fixed \nat 30 percent, have been particularly difficult to meet. Second, \ncurrent law dictates that departments--whether they serve a large city, \nsuch as Cleveland and have numerous fire stations, or a small town, \nsuch as Cedarville, OH and have only one station--are eligible for the \nexact same level of funding each year: $750,000. These two elements of \nthe current program have caused a number of large fire departments to \nforego applying for FIRE grants. With respect to smaller, often \nvolunteer-based departments serving populations of 20,000 or less, \nbudgets are often so limited that meeting the current match is simply \nnot possible. Many of these departments struggle with even the most \nbasic needs, such as having an adequate number of staff available to \nrespond to a structure fire.\n  Our bill addresses each of these problems in a simple and \nstraightforward fashion. Specifically, the bill would reduce matching \nrequirements by one third for departments serving communities of \n50,000, and by the one half for departments serving 20,000 or fewer \nresidents in order to encourage increased participation by these \ndepartments. The bill also would restructure caps on grant amounts to \nreflect population served, with up to $2,250,000 for departments \nserving one million or more, $1,500,000 for departments serving between \n500,000 and one million, and $1,000,000 for departments serving fewer \nthan 500,000 residents. Together, these two changes would go a long way \ntoward increasing the accessibility of the program for the very largest \nand smallest departments in the United States.\n  The second major component of our bill has to do with the transfer of \nthe FIRE Act administration from the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration (FEMA) to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). \nWhen FEMA's functions were transferred into the DHS, the FIRE grant \nprogram, along with the U.S. Fire Administration, also were transferred \nto DHS. As part of that transfer, formal administration of the FIRE \ngrant program has been delegated to the Department to the Office of \nDomestic Preparedness (ODP), which oversees all DHS grant programs. \nWhile the U.S. Fire Administration--the real fire experts within the \nFederal Govenment--remains involved, we need to take steps to formalize \nthe management of the program following the transfer to DHS.\n  There are a number of reasons for solidifying program administration \nin law, chief among them being the ability of fire departments across \nour Nation to plan for the future, and the ability to ensure an ongoing \nrole for fire experts in the process. First, our bill gives the \nSecretary of Homeland Security overall authority for the program. This \njust makes sense given the Secretary's current home within ODP. \nAdditionally, the bill would codify in law practices currently in use \nby ODP--peer review by experts from national fire service \norganizations, a formal role for the U.S. Fire Administration, and \ncollaborative meetings to recommend grant criteria.\n  These steps would benefit the program for years to come and would \nhelp bring stability to the increasingly mature FIRE grant program. \nPerhaps\n\n[[Page S5235]]\n\nmore importantly, formalizing the role of the U.S. Fire Administrator \nand national fire service organizations would help resolve a \nfundamental tension between the mission of the FIRE Act program (to \nimprove firefighting and EMS resources nationwide for all hazards) and \nthe mission of its caretaker, ODP (to focus on terrorism prevention and \nresponse).\n  It makes sense for ODP, as the central clearinghouse for grant \nprogram within DHS, to manage the FIRE grant program. Equally so, it \nmakes sense to build features into the program which would help ensure \nthat the FIRE grant program will remain dedicated solely to the fire \nand emergency medical services (EMS) communities and will not be \ndiluted over time into a generic terrorism-prevention program. Our bill \ncarefully strikes this balance.\n\n  The third major focus of this reauthorization bill is on finding ways \nto improve safety and to save lives. We do this in a number of ways. \nFirst, we've teamed up with national fire service organizations to \nincorporate firefighter safety research into the fire prevention and \nsafety set-aside program. This new research, supported by a 20 percent \nincrease in funds for the prevention and safety set-aside, would help \nreduce the number of firefighter fatalities each year and would \ndramatically improve the health and welfare of firefighters nationwide.\n  Second, we place an increased emphasis on Emergency Medical Services. \nIn most communities, the fire department is the chief provider for all \nemergency services, including EMS. To illustrate this point, a 2002 \nNational Fire Protection Association study indicates that fire \ndepartments received more than seven times as many calls for EMS \nassistance as they did for fires. When our family members, neighbors, \nand friends need immediate medical help, we turn to EMS providers, and \nwe rely on this help to be as effective and timely as possible. It is \nour duty in structuring the FIRE grant program, then, to do everything \nwe can to give EMS squads the assistance they need to carry out this \nimportant mission.\n  Despite the overwhelming ratio of EMS calls to fire calls, the FIRE \ngrant program has not adequately reflected the importance of EMS over \nthe past few years, with about 1 percent of all grants going \nspecifically for EMS purposes. While there is no question that a number \nof other grants have indirectly benefited EMS and that departments do \ninvest their own money into this service, more can and should be done \nthrough the FIRE Act to boost our EMS capabilities nationwide. To \naccomplish this goal, we do a number of things in the reauthorization \nbill, including specifically including fire-based EMS professionals in \nthe peer review process and allowing EMS grant requests to be combined \nwith those for equipment and training.\n  Additionally, we include language to incorporate independent, non-\nprofit EMS squads into the FIRE grant program for the first time. While \nour work with national fire service organizations on this particular \nprovision has been productive and is ongoing, its intent is clear--and \nthat is to try to bring the emphasis within the FIRE grant program on \nEMS closer to the level of demand in the field for this life-saving \nservice. I am pleased that we have this language in the bill and \nbelieve that through debate here in committee, and perhaps on the \nSenate floor, we can find an even better solution for increasing \nsupport for EMS.\n\n  Third, we create a new incentive program within the FIRE Act that \nencourages departments to invest in life-saving automated external \ndefibrillator (AED) devices. These devices are capable of dramatically \nreducing the number one cause of firefighter death in the line of \nduty--heart attacks. Our incentive program essentially says to fire \ndepartments that if you equip each of your firefighting vehicles with a \ndefibrillator unit, we'll give you a one-time discount on your matching \nrequirement. Congress has expressed, time and again, strong support for \ngetting these devices out to communities through various grant \nprograms. It is our hope that we can maintain that commitment by \nextending support for life-saving defibrillator technologies to fire \ndepartments across the country.\n  Fourth, we eliminate a burdensome and unintended matching requirement \nfor fire prevention grants. These grants generally go to non-profit \norganizations, such as National SAFE KIDS, to provide for fire safety \nawareness campaigns, smoke detector installations in low-income \nhousing, and other important prevention efforts. Though no match was \nrequired in the first few years of the program, a recent legal opinion \nfrom the Office of Domestic Preparedness has reversed course and \ninstituted a 10 percent match for grantees. This unanticipated \nrequirement, which is extremely difficult for non-profits with limited \ncapital, has had a debilitating effect on the prevention program and \nneeds to be eliminated. Our bill does just that.\n  Together, these common-sense features of our reauthorization bill \nwould dramatically improve the safety of our communities, as well as \nthe firefighters who bravely serve them.\n  The fourth section of this reauthorization bill centers on a \ncomprehensive review of the FIRE grant program. This review, to be \nconducted in part by the National Fire Protection Association, and in \npart by the General Accounting Office (GAO), seeks to evaluate the \nprogram with an eye toward ensuring that resources are targeted to the \nareas of greatest need. A similar study by the National Fire Protection \nassociation conducted shortly after passage of the initial FIRE Act was \nextremely helpful as far as identifying the nature of the fire service \nneeds. Ultimately, this part of the bill is about making sure that the \nbillions of taxpayer dollars authorized by this legislation are used in \nthe most responsible and effective manner possible.\n  Our bill is a good bill. It is comprehensive and collaboratively \ndrafted with input from fire and emergency services experts from across \nthe country. The National Safe Kids Campaign, the International \nAssociation of Fire Fighters, the International Association of Fire \nChiefs, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the International \nAssociation of Arson Investigators, the International Society of Fire \nService Instructors, and the National Fire Protection Association, \namong others, all support our legislation. I am proud to introduce this \nbill with my friend and colleague from Connecticut and look forward to \nworking to ensure that the Federal Government increases its commitment \nto the men and women who make up our local fire departments. We owe \nthem and their service and dedication nothing less than our full \nsupport.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Dodd and \nDeWine and my other colleagues in introducing the Assistance to \nFirefighters Act of 2004, which will reauthorize the Assistance to \nFirefighters Grant Program. This program, which is also know as the \nFIRE Grant program, addresses a critical need by ensuring that our \nNation's firefighters have adequate funding for training and equipment \nto deal with the many hazards that they face.\n  As Chairman of the authorizing committee of jurisdiction, I am \nfamiliar with the success of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant \nProgram. Funding under the FIRE grant program is provided directly to \nlocal jurisdictions. Applications undergo a competitive, merit-based \nprocess, which helps to ensure that funding is spent responsibily and \nproductively. The grant program includes a matching requirement to \nensure that the local community is committed to spending the grant. It \nalso includes a ``maintenance of expenditures'' provision to ensure \nthat the grant will supplement, not replace, local firefighting funds. \nIn addition, the program ensures that new technology that is bought \nwith FIRE Grant funds meet standards set by voluntary consensus \norganizations, so that local fire departments will buy effective \nequipment.\n  For Fiscal Year 2004, the program received over 20,000 applications \nfrom local fire departments across the country. These requests totaled \napproximately $2.3 billion. The program also received around 20,000 \napplications in 2001, 2002, and 2003, which clearly demonstrates the \nneed and importance of this program to the firefighting community.\n  The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program recipients use such \nfunds to help meet their basic needs. The uses for these grants \ninclude: personal protection and firefighting equipment;\n\n[[Page S5236]]\n\ntraining; firefighting vehicles; fire prevention campaigns; fire code \nenforcement; and arson detection and prevention. I would like to \nemphasize that these grants are dedicated to improving the local \nresponse to ``all-hazards,'' including natural disasters, structural \nfires, and acts of terrorism.\n  I thank my colleagues for their leadership on this issue, and urge \nthe Senate to support passage of this legislation this year.

Res. 106\n\n       Whereas the establishment of a democratic, transparent, and \n     fair election process for the 2004 presidential election in \n     Ukraine and of a genuinely democratic political system are \n     prerequisites for that country's full integration into the \n     Western community of nations as an equal member, including \n     into organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas the Government of Ukraine has accepted numerous \n     specific commitments governing the conduct of elections as a \n     participating State of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), including provisions of the \n     Copenhagen Document;\n       Whereas the election on October 31, 2004, of Ukraine's next \n     president will provide an unambiguous test of the extent of \n     the Ukrainian authorities' commitment to implement these \n     standards and build a democratic society based on free \n     elections and the rule of law;\n       Whereas this election takes place against the backdrop of \n     previous elections that did not fully meet international \n     standards and of disturbing trends in the current pre-\n     election environment;\n       Whereas it is the duty of government and public authorities \n     at all levels to act in a manner consistent with all laws and \n     regulations governing election procedures and to ensure free \n     and fair elections throughout the entire country, including \n     preventing activities aimed at undermining the free exercise \n     of political rights;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires a \n     period of political campaigning conducted in an environment \n     in which neither administrative action nor violence, \n     intimidation, or detention hinder the parties, political \n     associations, and the candidates from presenting their views \n     and qualifications to the citizenry, including organizing \n     supporters, conducting public meetings and events throughout \n     the country, and enjoying unimpeded access to television, \n     radio, print, and Internet media on a non-discriminatory \n     basis;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires that \n     citizens be guaranteed the right and effective opportunity to \n     exercise their civil and political rights, including the \n     right to vote and the right to seek and acquire information \n     upon which to make an informed vote, free from intimidation, \n     undue influence, attempts at vote buying, threats of \n     political retribution, or other forms of coercion by national \n     or local authorities or others;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires \n     government and public authorities to ensure that candidates \n     and political parties enjoy equal treatment before the law \n     and that government resources are not employed to the \n     advantage of individual candidates or political parties;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires the \n     full transparency of laws and regulations governing \n     elections, multiparty representation on election commissions, \n     and unobstructed access by candidates, political parties, and \n     domestic and international observers to all election \n     procedures, including voting and vote-counting in all areas \n     of the country;\n       Whereas increasing control and manipulation of the media by \n     national and local officials and others acting at their \n     behest raise grave concerns regarding the commitment of the \n     Ukrainian authorities to free and fair elections;\n       Whereas efforts by the national authorities to limit access \n     to international broadcasting, including Radio Liberty and \n     the Voice of America, represent an unacceptable infringement \n     on the right of the Ukrainian people to independent \n     information;\n       Whereas efforts by national and local officials and others \n     acting at their behest to impose obstacles to free assembly, \n     free speech, and a free and fair political campaign have \n     taken place in Donetsk, Sumy, and elsewhere in Ukraine \n     without condemnation or remedial action by the Ukrainian \n     Government;\n       Whereas numerous substantial irregularities have taken \n     place in recent Ukrainian parliamentary by-elections in the \n     Donetsk region and in mayoral elections in Mukacheve, Romny, \n     and Krasniy Luch; and\n       Whereas the intimidation and violence during the April 18, \n     2004, mayoral election in Mukacheve, Ukraine, represent a \n     deliberate attack on the democratic process: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) acknowledges and welcomes the strong relationship \n     formed between the United States and Ukraine since the \n     restoration of Ukraine's independence in 1991;\n       (2) recognizes that a precondition for the full integration \n     of Ukraine into the Western community of nations, including \n     as an equal member in institutions such as the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO), is its establishment of a \n     genuinely democratic political system;\n       (3) expresses its strong and continuing support for the \n     efforts of the Ukrainian people to establish a full \n     democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights in \n     Ukraine;\n       (4) urges the Government of Ukraine to guarantee freedom of \n     association and assembly, including the right of candidates, \n     members of political parties, and others to freely assemble, \n     to organize and conduct public events, and to exercise these \n     and other rights free from intimidation or harassment by \n     local or national officials or others acting at their behest;\n       (5) urges the Government of Ukraine to meet its \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     commitments on democratic elections and to address issues \n     previously identified by the Office of Democratic \n     Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the OSCE in its \n     final reports on the 2002 parliamentary elections and the \n     1999 presidential elections, such as illegal interference by \n     public authorities in the campaign and a high degree of bias \n     in the media;\n       (6) urges the Ukrainian authorities to ensure--\n       (A) the full transparency of election procedures before, \n     during, and after the 2004 presidential elections;\n       (B) free access for Ukrainian and international election \n     observers;\n       (C) multiparty representation on all election commissions;\n       (D) unimpeded access by all parties and candidates to \n     print, radio, television, and Internet media on a non-\n     discriminatory basis;\n       (E) freedom of candidates, members of opposition parties, \n     and independent media organizations from intimidation or \n     harassment by government officials at all levels via \n     selective tax audits and other regulatory procedures, and in \n     the case of media, license revocations and libel suits, among \n     other measures;\n       (F) a transparent process for complaint and appeals through \n     electoral commissions and within the court system that \n     provides timely and effective remedies; and\n       (G) vigorous prosecution of any individual or organization \n     responsible for violations of election laws or regulations, \n     including the application of appropriate administrative or \n     criminal penalties;\n       (7) further calls upon the Government of Ukraine to \n     guarantee election monitors from the ODIHR, other \n     participating States of the OSCE, Ukrainian political \n     parties, candidates' representatives, nongovernmental \n     organizations, and other private institutions and \n     organizations, both foreign and domestic, unobstructed access \n     to all aspects of the election process, including unimpeded \n     access to public campaign events, candidates, news media, \n     voting, and post-election tabulation of results and \n     processing of election challenges and complaints; and\n       (8) pledges its enduring support and assistance to the \n     Ukrainian people's establishment of a fully free and open \n     democratic system, their creation of a prosperous free market \n     economy, their establishment of a secure independence and \n     freedom from coercion, and their country's assumption of its \n     rightful place as a full and equal member of the Western \n     community of democracies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/11/senate-section/article/S5236-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3142.

We also are going to pass the IDEA \nbill within the next couple of days. I see no reason we couldn't also \ncomplete the mental health parity legislation. I spoke with Senator \nDomenici and our leader. There is no reason we couldn't do that in a \nvery short time period, a matter of just an hour or two. The only thing \nwe are waiting on is the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, who has \nan amendment that deals with the scope of the bill.
