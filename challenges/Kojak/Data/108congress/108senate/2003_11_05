Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for \nconducting this time for morning business.\n  I rise in a very different mood today--different from any other mood \nI have been in since I had the privilege of becoming a Member of this \nbody. I had the privilege of serving for 8 years in the House of \nRepresentatives, and now for a year in my first term in the Senate. \nDuring my last 2 years in the House, I served on the House Intelligence \nCommittee. For the past year now, I have served on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, under the strong leadership of the Senator from \nKansas, Senator Roberts, as well as his vice chairman, Senator \nRockefeller of West Virginia. We operate in a very bipartisan way in \nboth the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.\n  I was privileged to serve alongside of the now-ranking member of the \nHouse Intelligence Committee in conducting a very thorough and detailed \nreview of the intelligence community leading up to September 11 and \nparticularly concluding with a report detailing the failures in the \nintelligence community leading up to September 11, 2001. All of this \noversight work has been done in a very bipartisan way since I have been \nin the Senate. Again, we have operated within the Intelligence \nCommittee in a very bipartisan way. We can have our differences, and we \nhave had them; but it has been a very healthy debate up to this point \nin time.\n  Unfortunately, yesterday, the Republicans on the Senate side of the \nIntelligence Committee came into possession of a two-page memorandum \nthat details a systematic way in which the other side of the aisle \nintends to undermine and attack the President of the United States on \nthe intelligence information not only leading up to the conflict in \nIraq, but also moving beyond that, into the policy area--again, trying \nto undermine the policy of the President of the United States with \nrespect to the conflict in Iraq.\n  This is a different road than the Intelligence Committees on the \nHouse and Senate sides have been down before. It is not the kind of \nroad an Intelligence Committee should be traveling down. I rise to say \nthat I don't know where this memo came from. I have seen a copy of it. \nI don't know whether it was staff driven or member driven. I have great \nrespect for the members of the Intelligence Committee on both sides of \nthe aisle, and I don't think anyone on the other side of the aisle \nwould intentionally try to undermine the operation of our troops in \nIraq today. Yet, as I looked at this memorandum and read through it, \nthere was a very clear and definite outline of undermining the policy \nof the President of the United States, the Department of Defense, the \nintelligence community, and anybody involved in the current conflict \nwith Iraq.\n\n  If that particular outline were followed, it would be devastating not \nonly to this body--the bipartisan integrity of this body--but it would \nhave the potential effect of truly undermining the operation in Iraq.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will rethink the \nposition if it is one in which they are moving toward. I hope they will \ncertainly disavow any knowledge of the position or intent to undermine \nthe operation in Iraq from an intelligence or oversight standpoint \nwithin the Senate Intelligence Committee with respect to a report we \nare going to be concluding and preparing within a matter of days or \nweeks.\n  I truly hope we can move forward in a positive way, with a strong, \npositive attitude toward ensuring the operation in Iraq is concluded in \na satisfactory manner, and that the intelligence community can move \nforward knowing they have the support, in a bipartisan way, of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, and the matter-of-fact ideas and plans \nlaid out in this memorandum will certainly not be carried out.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership and position on this. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri, Senator Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, who I believe is doing a very fine job under very difficult \ncircumstances, leading a bipartisan inquiry, which is the legitimate \nscope of the Intelligence Committee on how we can improve our \nintelligence system.\n  When we are fighting the battle against terrorism, there is no \nquestion that intelligence is the coin of the realm. There is no way we \ncan deter terrorist attacks by threatening to retaliate or administer \nretributive justice to those who make terrorist strikes against us. \nWhen you are dealing with suicide bombers, there is not going to be \nanything left for us to retaliate against or take retribution against.\n  Finding the holes in our intelligence system, and how we can do a \nbetter job, is a major challenge. I joined the Intelligence Committee \nthis year because I realized how important it is to the future of peace \nand security in the world and to our own security. I know from personal \nexperience that we and our staffs--and particularly our staffs--have \nbeen engaged in an exhaustive examination of what the intelligence was \nprior to declaring Operation Iraqi Freedom. This was a major effort.\n  As those in the Chamber may know, I have supported the President. I \nsupported the Iraqi supplemental, and I thank our colleagues for \npassing that bill to defend our troops and also to make sure we build \nIraq so we can move our troops out.\n  But when the revelation came out yesterday of a memorandum apparently \nfrom Democratic staff, minority staff on the Intelligence Committee, \nindicating there was a different agenda, I was very much concerned. The \nkey element in the Intelligence Committee, unlike any other committee, \nis that we have to do our work in confidence. We have to be able to \nmaintain the confidence of the intelligence community that comes before \nus. We must protect intelligence sources, and we cannot get engaged in \npartisan battles.\n  Yet the memorandum that came out yesterday has such interesting \nquotes such as:\n\n       Pull the majority along as far as we can on issues that may \n     lead to major new disclosures regarding improper or \n     questionable conduct by administration officials.\n\n  They are not looking at the Intelligence Committee; they are looking \nat the administration. They say:\n\n       We need to look at activities of the Office of the \n     Secretary of Defense and the State Department.\n\n  They talk about preparing additional views. And they say:\n\n       Among other things, we will castigate the majority for \n     seeking to limit the scope of the inquiry.\n\n  They talk about an independent investigation, and they say:\n\n       We can pull the trigger on an independent investigation on \n     the administration's use of intelligence at any time.\n\n  When you talk about what goes on and how intelligence is used, that \nis a topic of debate in the political realm, and there is no shortage \nof that debate in particularly the Democratic primaries right now. We \nsee many of the candidates who are arguing very forcefully about it. I \nam disappointed that the discussion in the Presidential primary has \ntotally ignored or forgotten the old adage that politics stops at the \nwater's edge; that we should not be getting into political battles when \nwe have troops in harm's way, and there is no question we have troops \nin harm's way.\n\n[[Page S13949]]\n\n  It appears this memo suggests there is, at least at the staff level, \na Democratic game plan to make the Intelligence Committee a focal point \nfor the 2004 Presidential debates. This memorandum said:\n\n       Yet, we have an important role to play in revealing the \n     misleading, if not flagrantly dishonest, methods and \n     motives of the senior administration officials who made \n     the case for a unilaterally preemptive war.\n\n  Those are pretty harsh words. Those are the words of a political \nattack.\n  Unfortunately, it is not just the staff who has been talking about \nthem. There is an article in the Sunday Telegraph of London quoting a \nDemocratic member of the Intelligence Committee:\n\n       We want to know whether the administration put pressure on \n     the agencies to come up with certain kinds of information. \n     It's a question that's been explored at great length in \n     Britain. If the Republican leadership of the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee is determined to protect the \n     administration at any cost, we'll do the investigative job on \n     our own.\n\n  I can assure you that this inquiry goes into every area that we can \nfind in the intelligence operation, in many intelligence agencies, how \nthat information is developed. There are suggestions that there is \nimproper influence. This is something we are exploring assiduously. The \ncommittee staff has interviewed many members of the Intelligence \nCommittee, anybody who might have information. They have been asked: \nWere they pressured? Was the information tainted or changed or \npressured? And absolutely not. If there is evidence of pressure, that \nwill undoubtedly be included in the chairman and vice chairman's \nreport.\n  Moreover, I tell you regrettably, it will be leaked almost \nimmediately because the committee has a tendency right now to leak like \na sieve. There was one person who said he had a problem, and I turned \nto my colleague on the Intelligence Committee and said: Let's take bets \non how long before it is on the national news wire. It was less than an \nhour. It turns out that the analyst did not have any problem with the \nintelligence related to the operations of Iraq, but it came out \nimmediately.\n  The question that is being raised that some of our Democratic \ncolleagues want to address in the Intelligence Committee is: Can we \nfind a way to undercut the President, the Vice President and the \nadministration? That, I submit, is not the role of the Intelligence \nCommittee. The Intelligence Committee has a very important \nresponsibility. We need to determine how to improve our intelligence \nsystem to win the war on terrorism, not to win the war for the White \nHouse.\n  What is the job of the Intelligence Committee? Is it to determine and \nargue with the policy or is it to find out if the intelligence-\ngathering information is appropriate? The people in the intelligence \ncommunity have to deal with information that is fragmentary. We \ncriticized them as a result of 9/11 for not having connected all the \ndots and come together to forecast and perhaps forestall the attacks of \n9/11. Now we are saying they didn't have enough information, but this \ninformation has been available and has been supplied by the \nIntelligence Committee for some time.\n  I quote a statement by the President. The President said:\n\n       Heavy as they are, the cost of action must be weighed \n     against the price of inaction. If Saddam defies the world and \n     we fail to respond, we will face a far greater threat in the \n     future. Saddam will strike again at his neighbors. He will \n     make war on his own people. And mark my words, he will \n     develop weapons of mass destruction, he will deploy them, \n     and he will use them.\n\n  Those are the words of the President talking about intelligence that \nhe received. And by the way, that was a speech on December 16, 1998, by \nPresident Bill Clinton. That was based on the information he was \nreceiving at the time.\n  If that intelligence was grossly inaccurate or inadequate, then we in \nthe Intelligence Committee need to fix it. I happen to think there were \nsome major mistakes made 7 or 8 years ago in the intelligence community \nwhen they decided to restrict severely the number of human intelligence \nsources they could use by refusing to take intelligence sources from \npeople who didn't meet the highest moral and ethical standards. \nFrankly, those people often don't deal with terrorists and provide us \nthe information we need.\n  We need to do a better job. We are making improvements in \nintelligence, but I don't think anybody will say we have an \nintelligence system that is as good as it should be. I can tell you, \nthe battle over how intelligence is used is a broader political battle.\n  Leaving aside the question of whether it should be carried on while \nwe have troops in harm's way in Iraq, it is not a question, in any \ncase, to be fought out in the Intelligence Committee by trying to \nchange or develop information that is not there.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair, and I urge our colleagues to remember \nthat the battle of the Intelligence Committee is to win the war against \nterrorism, not to win the White House.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator retains 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee and applaud him for the work he has been doing \nand commiserate with him today. Having served on that committee for 8 \nyears, I know how difficult it is to keep focused on the important \nintelligence issues that confront our country, especially in this time \nof war, and do that in a way that maintains the traditional bipartisan \nrelationship that has heretofore characterized the members of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  Having served there for 8 years, I never saw the kind of blatant, \npartisan politics emerge that has apparently emerged as revealed in \nthis memorandum that has been discussed this morning. It is a \ndisgusting possibility that Members of the Senate would actually try to \npoliticize intelligence, especially at a time of war, even apparently \nreaching conclusions before investigations have been performed.\n  This memo refers to the fact that, for example, if we carry this plan \nout that has been discussed already, we will identify additional views \nand castigate--well, I will quote it exactly:\n\n       Our additional views will, among other things, castigate \n     the majority for seeking to limit the scope of the inquiry.\n\n  In other words, before something is even done, the plan has already \nbeen devised about how they are going to criticize the majority about \nsomething it has not even done yet. This is blatant partisan politics.\n  Now, our Democratic colleagues have denied that this memorandum \nrepresents their plan. One of two things is true. It either is or it is \nnot. If it is, it is reprehensible. If it is not, there is a sure way \nto prove it and that is to repudiate the memorandum and to ensure that \nthis plan of action is never carried out. So we shall see.\n  Are the denials of the Democrats going to result in this plan being \nrepudiated and not carried out? That will be the test of whether this \nis really the plan of the Democrats.\n  I note that parts of the plan appear already to have been set in \nmotion. The first item of the plan:\n\n       Pull the majority along as far as we can on issues that may \n     lead to new disclosures. . . . We are having some success in \n     that regard.\n\n  I mean, this is being done. This is not a plan that somebody had, an \nidea that is out in the future someplace. It is part of what is \ncurrently a Democratic process in the committee.\n  Secondly, the suggestion that there should be an independent \ncommission, well, while there is some confusion in the memo about when \nto ``pull the trigger'' on that, the ranking member on the committee \nhas already called for an independent commission. So there appears to \nbe some elements of a plan that are already in play, but I am willing \nto accept the denials of my Democratic colleagues that this represents \ntheir proposed course of action. As I said, the sure way to prove that \nis for them to repudiate it and to ensure that, in fact, that plan does \nnot go forward.\n  I note one other thing. There is much in this memo that deals with \nhow the Republican position will be characterized. We are talking about \na Republican Senate position. I urge my Democratic colleagues to \nconsider this. It is\n\n[[Page S13950]]\n\nunethical and improper under the rules of the Senate to characterize \nthe motives of fellow Senators. We all know that. We do not do that. \nThat begins the breakdown of the comity that must exist in this body.\n\n  I do not question my colleagues' motives and clearly they should not \nquestion mine, but there is an opportunity in this memorandum for \nquestioning motives. I want to bring this to the attention of people \nbecause clearly this should not be a part of anything we do in this \nbody.\n  In the summary, the memorandum itself says:\n\n       Yet we have an important role to play in revealing the \n     misleading, if not flagrantly dishonest, methods and motives \n     of senior administration officials who made the case for \n     unilateral preemptive war.\n\n  I think it may be inappropriate to question the motives of senior \nadministration officials, as well as Senators. In any event, as I say, \nthere is much in here that goes to the questioning of the report that \nthey presume will be prepared by the majority. That would be a breach \nof ethics, and I urge my colleagues to strongly consider what that \nwould result in and to repudiate this memorandum because of language \nlike that.\n  We do not need more reviews. We have already had the review that was \nconducted when I was on the Intelligence Committee that resulted in a \nlengthy report. The Kean Commission is doing its work right now; and, \nthird, we have the Intelligence Committee doing its work. So I think \nthat enough review has occurred. We certainly should not let partisan \npolitics intrude into the important work of the Intelligence Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas retains 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee for yielding me this time. I will adhere to the \n4 minutes because I know that he wants to wrap this up, too.\n  First, I want to thank the chairman for his diligence in trying to \nmake sure the Intelligence Committee does its job and does its job in a \nnonpartisan, bipartisan way. I went on the Intelligence Committee this \nyear because I believe it was one of the most important committees in \nthe Senate. I like the fact that while the committee's work is always \ndifficult, the committee worked together in a bipartisan way and has \nnot become a political tool.\n  I have also expressed myself that I am concerned about the \nintelligence that we have received before going into Iraq, and the \nintelligence that is available even today. So I am not one who is going \naround trying to make excuses for the intelligence community. But my \napproach is different. I think we need to find out where our problems \nare, where we need more assistance, and how we can do a better job in \nthe future.\n  It should not be about the blame game. It should not be about \npolitics. It should not be about trying to find a way to blame it on \nthe President or the Vice President or anybody else, even though \nobviously there will be some criticism directed at one place or \nanother. The thing we need to do is to make sure we have the \nintelligence that our officials need and our military men and women \nneed, and that should be the focus.\n  This memorandum outlines a political plan of attack in the \nIntelligence Committee. Our adversaries around the world must be \nsmiling this morning. They must be enjoying watching us fight among \nourselves instead of focusing on doing what we need to do to get the \nkind of intelligence we require to do the job against the terrorists \naround the world. This memorandum is a very sad commentary. While I am \nnot quite sure of its origin, whether it was written by a particular \nSenator or by a staff member at the direction of a Senator, it clearly \nis something that a Democrat staff member, working with some members of \nthe Intelligence Committee, drafted.\n\n  When you start talking about castigating the majority or pulling the \ntrigger on an independent investigation, or an independent commission, \nthe Senate voted on that just a week ago and overwhelmingly defeated \nthe idea that we kick the football over to somebody else, let somebody \nelse do our job. I say we should do our job, do it here, and do it in a \nconstructive, aggressive, nonpartisan, bipartisan way.\n  This is a very debilitating thing that we have seen. One might say, \nwell, maybe we are protesting too much, that this does not necessarily \nreflect all of the Democrat members of the Intelligence Committee. But \nalready the London Telegraph in London is quoting Democrats in the \nSenate Intelligence Committee using some of the exact words in the \nmemorandum.\n\n       We want to know whether the administration put pressure on \n     the agencies to come up with certain kinds of information.\n       If the Republican leadership of the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee is determined to protect the administration at any \n     cost . . .\n\n  I have watched the chairman aggressively pursue information and \ninsist that the administration provide information to this committee. \nWe have not been shrinking violets. We are doing our job.\n  To have this attack plan come out and make it totally political is \none of the most disquieting things I have seen in recent months in the \nSenate. We should not proceed in this way. I hope the Democrats will \ndisavow this whole approach and say that is not their political plan, \nthat is not their intent. The alternative is chaos in the committee \nthat is so critical to making sure we have what we need in terms of \nintelligence.\n  Just this week I proposed that we make the membership permanent on \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee. I know there has been an argument \nthat permanent membership on the committee could impact objectivity, \nbut what I want are members who are experienced enough to do the job.\n  I thank the chairman for yielding me this time, and I am looking \nforward to hearing Democrats assure us that this is not what is going \non.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator's \ntime has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five and a half minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, as members of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee are well aware, we have spent almost 6 months pouring over \nthousands of documents that are related to Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction programs and its ties to terrorism. We have interviewed \nover 100 people. This is probably the most thorough and complete review \nof intelligence that has ever been conducted, and the committee's \nprocess is completely open and transparent to Members on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  All staff involved certainly participate on an equal basis. I have \nworked to ensure the minority's voice has been heard at all times. \nThere should be no legitimate question as to our approach or our \ndedication to following the information no matter where it leads. I \nhave said that over and over. We have asked the hard questions.\n  When the inquiry is complete, I believe strongly the facts will speak \nfor themselves. Yet despite all efforts to handle this review in the \nmost professional and bipartisan way, we have learned of an effort to \ndevelop a plan to discredit the committee's work, undermine its \nconclusions, no matter what those conclusions may be.\n\n  Our goal is to discover the facts, not to target any individuals or \nto serve any agenda. We want to know that the assessments reached by \nthe intelligence community were based on sound intelligence and that \nthe policymakers, including the President and the Congress, got the \nbest information possible.\n  I have been asked, Where do we go from here? The answer is simple: We \ngo back to work. We build a bridge and go back to work. We have a \nnumber of documents yet to review. We have a handful of interviews yet \nto conduct. Then we will begin the process of drafting a committee \nreport and preparing for public hearings. It is critical that all of \nthis take place in an atmosphere of good faith and mutual trust. Secret \nplans to undermine the committee's work are examples of neither. I urge \nmy friends across the aisle, those members of the committee, to \ndisavow--and\n\n[[Page S13951]]\n\nif that word is too strong, just to say not to go down this path of a \nstrategy of attack, and join us to work together to complete the \nbusiness of the committee. The American people, and particularly those \ncurrently serving in uniform overseas, deserve nothing less.\n  I know Senator Rockefeller. He is a good friend. He is a good \ncolleague. We have had a good private discussion. It is time to put \nthis in the past, build a bridge to the future, and let the \nIntelligence Committee, unique among the committees in the Congress, do \nour work, our congressional oversight on behalf of national security.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on my own time I would like to ask the \nchairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee if he would respond to a \nquestion.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nis he prepared to say on the Senate floor today that the investigation \nof this committee will not only look into the conduct and activity of \nthe intelligence agencies, but allow us to follow the intelligence \ninformation gathering to its use by the administration, from the \nPresident on down, specifically whether the committee, as we have \nrequested on the Democratic side, will take this intelligence \ninformation, determine whether there was any influence by the \nadministration on intelligence agencies, and determine whether or not \nthe administration and any of its spokesmen, before the invasion of \nIraq, in any way exaggerated or distorted the intelligence that was \ngathered in portraying the case to the American people?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I say to my friend and colleague, we are in the process \nof conducting an inquiry. That inquiry I would say is about 85 percent \ncomplete. We have had full cooperation--not full cooperation but a \nspirit of cooperation from the White House, State Department, \nDepartment of Defense, and the CIA. Once our inquiry is complete, I \nthink I can answer the question the Senator has posed.\n  We are on the right track. We want to get at the timeliness and the \ncredibility of the intelligence that was provided. We had four goals to \ndo that, agreed upon by Senator Rockefeller. We will do that job. At \nthat particular time, why, the Senator's question would be pertinent.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me reclaim the time. The response or lack of response \nfrom the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee explains why we \nare in the Chamber today. There are two responsibilities of this \nIntelligence Committee: Not only to determine whether the intelligence \nagencies did their job but whether or not the information they \ngenerated was correctly portrayed by the administration.\n  I have just asked the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee \ndirectly whether this investigation will go into the use of \nintelligence information by the administration, and you heard his \nresponse: Only after we have completed the first round of inquiry about \nintelligence agencies would we consider asking the question whether \nanyone in the administration exerted influence on intelligence agencies \nor mischaracterized the information coming from those agencies.\n  That was the direct question. There was an opportunity for the \nchairman of the committee to say point blank that we will allow this \ninvestigation to take its normal course, and he deferred. He said we \nwill wait to a later time. That, I believe, is the source of \nfrustration within this committee.\n  Our ranking member on this committee, Senator Jay Rockefeller of West \nVirginia, has shown the patience of Job. He has tried literally for \nmonths to encourage and convince the Republican majority on this \ncommittee to have a full and complete investigation. That is what the \nAmerican people deserve. That is what this committee should do. But, \nsadly and unfortunately, the Republican majority has built a wall and \nsaid we will gather all of the information and all the investigation \nabout intelligence--but we will not breach that wall and go over the \nother side to see how the administration used this information.\n  That is the critical issue. How can you have a complete investigation \nwithout asking both questions? Unfortunately, it has been a decision by \nthe Republican majority that they will not allow us to look into the \nuse of intelligence data.\n  I have never seen this memo that has been referred to. No one has \never given it to me. I certainly had no role in the preparation of this \nmemo. I don't know what it said. But if that memo expressed the \nfrustration of many Senators on the committee that we have created this \nfirewall to protect the administration, then the memo, frankly, speaks \nto real feelings.\n  The Intelligence Committee historically has been bipartisan, as it \nshould be. Our efforts on the Democratic side were to urge the \nRepublican majority to take perhaps the uncomfortable but necessary \nstep so that the investigation would be complete. You heard what \nChairman Roberts said this morning. He is not prepared to take the \ninvestigation of the Intelligence Committee to the use of intelligence \ndata. And as long as that wall has been created, sadly, this cannot be \nthe kind of investigation the American people deserve.\n  Just several weeks ago--maybe 2--Senator John Corzine of New Jersey \ncame to the floor and asked for an independent commission on the \nintelligence that was gathered and how it was used by the \nadministration before the invasion of Iraq. At that time his amendment \nwas rejected by the Senate. It was opposed by Chairman Roberts of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee and Senator Rockefeller, the ranking \nDemocrat. They said: Stay with the investigation of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  I, frankly, took a different position. I really think this debate \nthis morning proves the point that it is now time to appoint an \nindependent commission--independent and bipartisan--that will literally \ntake this investigation wherever it leads. If the chips fall on a \nprevious administration or this administration, so be it. It is not our \nrole in the Intelligence Committee, nor in Congress, to protect any \npolitical party or administration. Our role is to protect the United \nStates of America. Our responsibility is national security. Once the \nchairman of the committee, as he said this morning, decided this \ninvestigation will not go into the use of intelligence data, it is \nclear that this Intelligence Committee cannot do its job as it should. \nIt makes the case now more than ever that an independent commission \nneeds to be appointed so there is integrity, transparency, and \nbelievability in this process.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate that because I believe Senator Roberts did \nrespond to your question.\n  I didn't mention any names quoted in this London Telegraph article. \nBut, Senator Durbin, you are quoted as saying that a public split and \nnew inquiry is inevitable. I hope that is not a quote from you.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, it is a quote from me.\n  Mr. LOTT. Because to prejudge----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reclaiming my time----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators will respond to each other \nthrough the Chair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Responding to my friend from Mississippi, let me say that \nquote is accurate, that quote is mine, and what you heard from our \nchairman this morning is the reason for the quote. If we do not allow a \ncomplete and full investigation, a split is inevitable. If a decision \nis made to protect this administration at any level at the expense of \nthe credibility of this investigation, we are not serving the American \npeople well.\n  Senator Rockefeller has tried time and time again to convince the \nchairman, the Republican chairman of this committee, that we need a \ncomplete investigation. He said repeatedly to Senator Rockefeller, I \nhave been led to believe, what he said on the floor this morning: We \nare going to draw the line. We will not look into the use of \nintelligence.\n  That, sadly, I think, is the reason we are here today and tied in \nthis political knot. It is time for an independent commission.\n\n[[Page S13952]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer a few remarks on \nbehalf of myself and also the distinguished Senator from Oregon with \nregard to the brouhaha that has broken out over the Intelligence \nCommittee and our inquiry into the possible existence of weapons of \nmass destruction and the use of intelligence information by this \nadministration.\n  In many ways, it is an unfortunate debate because if there is one \nthing that should absolutely be above and beyond partisanship, it is \nthe Intelligence Committee, our intelligence services, and the use to \nwhich that information is put. We need to dedicate ourselves not to \nscoring political points but, instead, to protecting the national \ninterest. When we have Members' motives cast in a bad light and heated \nrhetoric used, it does not serve that purpose in any way whatsoever.\n  Senator Rockefeller, the ranking member on the Intelligence \nCommittee, has been doing a very admirable job. It is my strong \nimpression that he has been pursuing his responsibilities in a \nbipartisan way, trying to get at the truth in a way that is consistent \nwith the finest traditions of the Intelligence Committee.\n  I have never seen the report that has been alluded to. I understand \nit was simply a listing of possible options. And I can guarantee you \nthat Senator Rockefeller has been under intense pressure by some others \nto pursue a much more partisan line of inquiry and to be much more \nconfrontational. Instead, he has chosen to try to pursue the \ncooperative path first. I compliment him for that because it is exactly \nthe course that needs to be pursued on the Intelligence Committee and \nin this body. Most importantly, we need to get beyond this current \ncontroversy.\n  I happen to think those who are watching this debate out beyond the \nbeltway are scratching their heads and saying: There they go again. \nWhat on Earth are they doing?\n  We have gone to war at least in part because of the possible \nexistence of weapons of mass destruction in the nation of Iraq. Our \ncredibility is at stake. We need to get to the bottom of this and \nunderstand, if they do exist, what we can do to root them out and, if \nthey do not exist, why we were led to believe they do exist. This is \nimportant to ensuring the national security interests of our country.\n  We also need to get to the bottom of allegations about the possible \nmanipulation or misuse of intelligence in the runup to the war--not for \nthe purpose of scapegoating or witch hunting but for the purposes of \nensuring that in fact it never takes place.\n  Those in the majority shouldn't stonewall or circle the wagons, and \nthose on our side of the aisle shouldn't engage in finger pointing and \ntrying to score political points in a runup to a Presidential election \nnext year. We need an objective, dispassionate search for the truth. \nThat is what the American people deserve. It is my understanding that \nis what Senator Rockefeller is pursuing.\n  Finally, the British have some experience in this area. They have \njust recently gone through an inquiry of their own over what was \nallegedly the ``dodgy dossier.'' I think that is how it is referred to \nin British circles. The Prime Minister even had to offer evidence under \noath as part of that inquiry.\n  No one is suggesting anything so intrusive on our side of the aisle. \nOn the contrary, we would like to pursue this in a cooperative, \nnonpartisan manner to get at the truth, to determine whether weapons of \nmass destruction existed and, if not, why we were led to believe they \ndid, and always to fairly and dispassionately analyze how information \nfrom the intelligence world was used in making the case to pursue the \nouster of Saddam Hussein. That is in the national security interests of \nour country.\n  I salute Senator Rockefeller for taking the appropriate course. I \nhope this debate will calm down and refocus on the business at hand, \nwhich is protecting the national security of our country, rather than \nengaging in heated, partisan rhetoric which we have way too much of \naround this town and in this Chamber.\n  Those are my thoughts.\n  I again compliment Senator Rockefeller, and I look forward to working \nwith Members on both sides of the aisle to bring about that kind of \ninquiry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I very much share the view of the Senator \nfrom Indiana. I simply say that a lot of paper floats around Capitol \nHill that never sees the light of day. The document that has to guide \nthe members of the Intelligence Committee--both Democrats and \nRepublicans--is the Constitution of the United States. That is the tone \nthat our vice chairman, Senator Rockefeller, has consistently set \nthroughout this effort to get at the facts with respect to Iraq. That \nis the path I think every Member of the Senate ought to continue to \nfollow. It ought to be a bipartisan goal. The American people deserve \nno less.\n  There are legitimate and very troubling questions that need to be \nanswered about the intelligence used to bring this Nation to war in \nIraq. In fact, serious issues have come up just in the last week.\n  I will say that I found it exceptionally troubling--really chilling--\nthat just last week, Paul Bremer, who is the point man with respect to \nthe efforts on the ground in Iraq, was asked about the nature of the \nIraqi resistance and in fact was told there really wasn't a capability \nin the intelligence community to give our country the information that \nis so necessary to protect our courageous men and women who are in \nharm's way.\n  That is the kind of issue about which I think every Member of the \nSenate ought to be concerned. That is what the Intelligence Committee \nought to be tackling in a bipartisan way. That is what Senator \nRockefeller has consistently been trying to do.\n  We can go through a lot of the past history. Certainly, in \ndiscussions about weapons of mass destruction, we were told right here \nin the U.S. Capitol on a number of occasions that those weapons have \nnot materialized. There are issues with respect to the past that need \nto be examined. There are issues such as the point Mr. Bremer made just \nin the last week that I think are very troubling.\n  I just urge that every Member of the Senate--and certainly those on \nthe Intelligence Committee--recognize it is not the paper that floats \naround here that may or may not see the light of day and various kinds \nof draft documents that are important; what is important is that we do \nthe work of oversight. That is what is in line with the document that \nought to guide us--the Constitution of the United States. And that is \nwhat Senator Rockefeller has set out for us in his work. I commend him \nfor it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, early this morning there was a discussion \non the\n\n[[Page S13953]]\n\nfloor of a staff memo from some Intelligence Committee staffers which \nhad not either been authorized or indeed shared by members of the \nIntelligence Committee. But it was characterized--and I think \nmischaracterized, quite clearly--as a Democratic plan relative to the \nreview of the intelligence that was created and used prior to the Iraqi \nwar.\n  The only thing that Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee \nhave pressed is for a full investigation, a full inquiry into not just \nthe creation of the intelligence but the use of that intelligence.\n  Without looking at the use of intelligence that was created by the \nintelligence community, there would only be half a picture painted. \nHopefully, that half of a picture will be fully explored on a \nbipartisan basis. I think the first half of the picture, indeed, is \nbeing fully explored on a bipartisan basis. That is the part of the \npicture that looks at the intelligence community's production of \nintelligence and as to whether or not that intelligence community in \nsome way either shaped or exaggerated that intelligence for whatever \npurpose. It has also been now added that if any of the administration \nput pressure on the intelligence community that would also be included \nin the review.\n  But what is left out is the critical half of the picture which the \nAmerican public hears, which is the use of the intelligence given to \nthe policymakers by those policymakers. Now, the word ``use'' of \nintelligence, that word ``use'' actually appears in the resolution \ncreating the Intelligence Committee and identifying the oversight role \nof the Intelligence Committee. So the word ``use'' is actually embedded \nin the very document creating the Intelligence Committee that sets \nforth what its role will be and what its oversight responsibilities \nare. Yet so far the majority of the Intelligence Committee has said: We \nwill not look at the use of the intelligence which was given to the \npolicymakers.\n  Now, that is a huge gap. That means we will be walking up to the \nwater's edge and stopping there. That means instead of letting the \nchips fall where they may, the chips will only be allowed to fall on \nthe intelligence community's side of the fence. They will not be \nallowed to fall on the policymakers' role and responsibility.\n  We were told by the policymakers, prior to the war, that--this is \nSecretary Rumsfeld--\n\n       We know where the weapons of mass destruction are.\n\n  We were told, before the war, by the Vice President:\n\n       Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now \n     has weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  We were told, before the war, by the President, himself, that:\n\n       Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves \n     no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and \n     conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised.\n\n  So the heart of the problem that we have at the Intelligence \nCommittee is whether or not we are going to stop at that water's edge \nor look at the use of the intelligence, whether a critique will be made \nof the intelligence community's shaping or exaggeration, to the extent \nthat existed, or whether or not the same searchlight will be placed \nupon the policymakers as to whether they exaggerated or shaped or \nmisstated what was given to them by the intelligence community.\n  The Department of State had a Web site. On December 19 of last year, \nthat Web site said:\n\n       Why is the Iraqi regime hiding their uranium procurement?\n\n  This is months after the CIA apparently told the State Department \nthat there was no such effort on the part of Iraq to obtain uranium, or \nat least that they had not reached that conclusion. Yet in December--\nand by the way, much later--the State Department's Web site still is \nrepresenting to the public that the Iraqi regime is hiding uranium \nprocurement.\n  Why should we not look into that Web site? How does that Web site get \ncreated, despite what we now believe was the intelligence community's \nconclusion or lack of conclusion relative to uranium acquisition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair. I appreciate very much the comments \nof the Senator from Michigan, particularly in informing the Senate that \nthe charge of the Intelligence Committee includes the use of \nintelligence as part of its mission.\n  Frankly, this whole discussion of this leaked memo today only \nreinforces my own view that we need an independent, bipartisan \ncommission because it is now becoming a political debate about whether \nthere is politics inside the Intelligence Committee.\n  I listened to the earlier discussion on the floor. People are talking \nabout Presidential politics and talking about how inappropriate it is \nfor people to talk in a thoughtful manner about how processes may occur \nover a period of time. We are missing the point.\n  There are men and women who are dying in Iraq because either the \ndevelopment or the use of our intelligence is not at a level where we \nare protecting the people of America and the men and women in uniform.\n  The issue is not whether this is a political debate. The issue is \nwhether Iraq possessed chemical or biological weapons.\n  It is whether Iraq had links to al-Qaida or whether Iraq attempted to \nacquire uranium. It is an issue of whether we are going to turn loose \nthe names of our intelligence operatives because there is political use \nof the need or want to discredit someone who might challenge some of \nthe answers to the questions I just raised.\n  We have a fundamental question right here and now of whether we are \ngoing to have an intelligence operation that informs policymakers so \nthey can make good decisions or whether we are going to have an \nintelligence operation that is used to justify policy decisions already \ntaken.\n  The idea that we are going to debate whether this is a political \nissue or not really does argue in the strongest terms that we need to \nhave an independent, bipartisan approach to understanding whether the \ndevelopment of our intelligence was appropriate and whether the use of \nthat was even consistent or whether it was designed to justify as \nopposed to inform.\n  When men and women are dying, I don't understand why we are even \nthinking about this in the context of politics on either side of the \naisle. The real issue is, we ought to get to the bottom of it. What led \nto decisions that don't match the reality we have come to find on the \nground in Iraq?\n  I have over and over again--and will again--asked for an independent \ninvestigation, a bipartisan investigation, a commission to understand \nwhy we don't know what we should have known when we entered into this. \nIt seems to me that is the essence and the most important issue we \nought to be discussing, not some memo that wasn't seen by anybody else \nin the committee, developed by a staffer as a concept memo. That really \ndiverts from the fundamental issue of protecting our men and women, \nprotecting the people of the United States.\n  By the way, there is some reason to believe we are not getting all \nthe information, whether it is in the Intelligence Committee. We know \nthe independent commission studying 9/11 has said they have been \nstonewalled. People from both sides of the commission, as far as \npolitical background, have said that. They had to subpoena information \nfrom the FAA to be able to get information to move forward to \ninvestigate.\n  We are missing the point. One of the reasons I do believe we need an \nindependent, bipartisan commission is so we don't have the kind of \ndiscussion we had on the floor today, so we can get to the facts that \nactually will protect the American men and women in uniform. It is high \ntime we put our priorities right, which is understanding how our \nintelligence operations develop and how they are used, not whether we \nhave a political issue that can be talked about on the talk shows at \nnight.\n  I find it very hard when senior people in the State Department, who \nhave worked there 25 or 30 years, say, speaking about folks, that we \nhave a faith-based approach to intelligence, that we are developing \nintelligence to show what we want to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S13954]]\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Parliamentary inquiry: What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 8 minutes remaining in morning \nbusiness that the Senator may consume or yield back.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, given that opportunity, I will consume a \nfew of those minutes to respond to the conversations about Iraq.\n  I was in this body when we went to S-407 and heard the intelligence \ncommunity brief us on the manufacture of chemical weapons taking place \nat what appeared to be a pharmaceutical factory in the Sudan. We were \ntold repeatedly by high officials of the administration this was a \nplant producing weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons; it had \nto be taken out by a cruise missile. Some of us asked to see the \nintelligence. We asked to know exactly what it was that led the \nadministration to believe this was in fact a chemical plant.\n  As we were given that intelligence, I found myself questioning it. I \nwalked away from that meeting saying to myself: This is a little bit \nthin. There is not a lot of substance here. But administration \nofficials were very emphatic in saying, no, we have gone through the \nintelligence. It is very firm. We have to take this out.\n  The administration in this instance, of course, was the Clinton \nadministration. The intelligence being presented to us was being \npresented by Secretary Cohen, the Secretary of Defense. We now know the \nintelligence was wrong. This was not, in fact, a factory for weapons of \nmass destruction. It was, rather, a pharmaceutical plant, just as the \npeople said it was.\n  We blew it up nonetheless. We killed some people with the cruise \nmissiles we threw in there. After recognizing the intelligence was \nwrong, we apologized, as indeed we should.\n  The question I would ask those who are now raising the issue about \nintelligence in Iraq would be this: Would they suggest the result of \nour actions in Iraq called for an American apology? Are they suggesting \nwe should apologize to the people of Iraq for having taken out Saddam \nHussein and, when we find him, replace him in power?\n  This is a man who killed 300,000 of his own people. We have uncovered \nthe mass graves. This is a man responsible for over 1 million \nadditional deaths in the two wars he started with his neighbors.\n  This is a man who has destroyed his own country. This is a man who \nhas raped and brutalized those of his citizens whom he has not killed. \nThis is a man who was willing to pay $25,000 to anyone who would wrap \nhimself in dynamite and blow himself up, as long as he took some others \nwith him. This is a man who had weapons of mass destruction and has \nused them against his own people. This is a man whose actions are \nclearly in violation of the U.N. Resolution 1441.\n  Am I supposed to apologize for having supported an effort to remove \nhim just because some people are challenging the details of the \nintelligence that led us to this action? I do not apologize for one \nmoment for supporting the war or for supporting the supplemental to pay \nfor the war, because the consequences of the action we have taken have \nliberated over 20 million people and made the neighborhood in which \nSaddam Hussein lived substantially safer for all of the neighbors \naround him.\n  This is not similar to the case of the blowing up of a pharmaceutical \nplant in Sudan because the intelligence was faulty, which took place in \nthe Clinton administration. This is an action that history will look \nback upon and say we did the right thing.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of morning business time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S13954-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to H.R. 2673, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2673) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken, that amendment No. 2072, which is the \ntext of Calendar No. 216, S. 1427, the Senate committee-reported bill, \nbe inserted in lieu thereof, that the bill, as amended, be considered \nas original text for the purpose of further amendments, and that no \npoints of order be waived by reason of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the Agriculture \nappropriations subcommittee report to the full Senate and to recommend \npassage of this bill. I am very grateful to the ranking member, Senator \nKohl, and his professional staff.\n  It has been one of the most satisfying experiences of my service in \nthe Senate to see how Senator Kohl's staff and our staff have been \nintegrated and have performed as truly professional staffs, regardless \nof any partisan affiliation. I think one of the reasons the bill moved \nas smoothly as it did through subcommittee and full committee is that \nthe staffs have worked together in such a professional way. I am \ngrateful to Senator Kohl for his wisdom in the people he has chosen, \nand I am grateful to them for the professional way in which they have \nhandled it.\n  The bill is at the 302(b) discretionary allocation level of $17.005 \nbillion. That is $873 million less than the fiscal 2003 level, which \nwas $17.878 billion.\n  It is always difficult to bring an appropriations bill to the floor \nthat has an allocation lower than the previous year and, in this case, \nit is almost $1 billion lower. That has made the challenge of putting \nthe bill together extremely difficult and, once again, underscores the \naccomplishments of the professional staff as they have dealt with this \nchallenge.\n  To run through the various titles of the bill and help people \nunderstand what we are talking about, I will give you the following \nnumbers.\n  On title I, dealing with agricultural programs, we have a total of \n$26.776 billion, of which $20.658 billion is mandatory. This is $1.318 \nmillion more than fiscal year 2003.\n  On food safety, it is $783.761 million, which is an increase of $28.9 \nmillion over fiscal 2003. The Agricultural Research Service is at \n$1.092 billion. The Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension \nService is at $1.118 billion. The Animal and Plant Inspection Service, \nAPHIS, is at $711 million. That takes care of title I.\n  Title II, conservation programs, come in at a total of $973 million, \nwhich is $48 million less than fiscal 2003. Conservation operations are \nat $826.635 million.\n  Title III, rural economic and community development programs, the \ntotal appropriated funds will be $2.588 billion, which will support a \nloan level of $4.353 billion. Single-family housing is at the $4.084 \nbillion level. The Rural Community Advancement Program is at $769.479 \nmillion. Distance learning, telemedicine, and broadband is at $685.963 \nmillion.\n  Title IV, domestic food programs, there is a total of $44.088 \nbillion, of which $39.164 billion is mandatory. This is $2.197 billion \nmore than fiscal 2003. Food stamps will be funded at $27.745 billion. \nWIC, Women, Infants, and Children, will be funded at $4.639 billion.\n  Title V, foreign assistance and related programs, there is a total of \n$1.486 billion, which is $349 million less than fiscal year 2003, which \nincluded supplemental funding of $369 million.\n\n[[Page S13955]]\n\n  Title I, development food assistance, is $131.67 million.\n  Title II, emergency food assistance, is $1.192 billion. McGovern-Dole \ninternational food for education and child nutrition, which is a new \ndiscretionary account, is funded at $25 million.\n  On the overall bill, title VI, related agencies and the Food and Drug \nAdministration, this is an increase. It is $1.482 billion, $16 million \nmore than in fiscal 2003.\n  The Food and Drug Administration gets $1.39 billion in direct \nappropriations, plus an additional $302 million in user fees.\n  The committee provides $10 million toward the Government's share of \nthe medical device review user fee program.\n  Finally, title VII, general provisions, the committee includes \nlimitations on several farm bill mandatory programs. We do not freeze \nthese programs at a level below fiscal 2003, and we do no harm to \nexisting programs by these limitations.\n  The committee did not include a limitation on the mandatory funding \nlevel for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP.\n  Now, in the bill, there are necessary pay costs for employees \ncovered: $131.208 million.\n  I will make a personal and parochial observation with respect to this \nbill. Utah is in its fifth year of the worst drought in memory, which \nis a situation shared by many Western colleagues. We have not provided \nemergency funding for the drought, but we have made substantial \ninvestments in farm programs and conservation efforts that we think \nwill help producers deal with these weather-related disasters.\n  This is an appropriations bill, not an authorizing bill. I know there \nis a strong temptation to use appropriations bills as a vehicle to \ncatch up on authorization situations. Senator Kohl and I have agreed \nthat we will oppose any authorizing amendment regardless of how \nsalutary it may be, unless it has been cleared by both the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the appropriate authorizing committee.\n  I am grateful to Senator Kohl for his willingness and leadership on \nthis particular issue. We have done our best to accommodate Member \nrequests in this bill. This is not always possible. The fact that we \nare almost $1 billion less than fiscal 2003 makes it difficult. We have \ndone our best to be as fair as we can and as complete as we can. If \nthere are any funding amendments, therefore, offered on the floor, they \nmust be offset.\n  It is the desire of the leadership, Senator Frist and Senator \nDaschle, to finish this bill today. I think that can be done. But if it \nis to be done, we are going to have to have full cooperation of all of \nthe Senators. We know of some of the amendments that have been \nproposed. We have done our best to deal with those amendments at the \nstaff level and in the committee by having conversations and \noccasionally colloquies. But we understand there are some amendments \nthat will be proposed, will be debated, and will be voted on.\n  I ask for the cooperation of all of my colleagues and that, first, \nthey come to the floor in a timely fashion to offer their amendments; \nsecondly, that they would understand we need to move through these \namendments as quickly as possible in order to meet the leadership's \nrequest that we finish the bill tonight. I am hoping we can finish it \nin good time tonight. We will stay, as I understand it from Leader \nFrist, as long as we have to stay to get the bill done.\n\n  While the time seems to be hanging heavily on people's hands right \nnow, I hope they will come to the floor and offer their amendments now, \nrather than rushing in at 10:30 tonight and saying: I have an \namendment, and I need to have it brought up.\n  I will do my best to allow full and fair debate on each amendment, \nbut I am prepared to offer a tabling motion if it appears to me all of \nthe arguments have been made. I believe we know which are the more \ncontroversial amendments. I have talked with people who stand on both \nsides of those amendments and suggested to them the arguments have been \nmade; there is really nothing new to be said about it. While we did get \nthe information on the record, we really need to come to a conclusion \nand move on these particular amendments.\n  I don't think there is any amendment on which a Senator is undecided. \nI think the controversial amendments have been sufficiently discussed \nprior to coming to the floor so that everyone pretty much knows where \nhe or she stands.\n  I will use the tabling motion judiciously. I will not attempt to cut \nanybody off or violate his or her privileges, but I will do what I can \nto keep the bill moving in a timely fashion.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2073\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], for himself and Mr. \n     Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 2073.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 47, line 13, insert a period after ``$335,963,000'' \n     and strike the remainder of the sentence, and on page 48, \n     lines 7 through 9, strike all after ``transmission in'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following: ``rural areas eligible \n     for Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program benefits \n     authorized by 7 U.S.C. 950aaa.''.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand Senator Kohl is on his way \nand will be here shortly. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal year \n2004 appropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural Development and Related \nAgencies. This year, the subcommittee faced a difficult task. The \nallocation provided to the subcommittee, just over $17 billion in \ndiscretionary funding, was a significant decrease from the fiscal year \n2003 funding level. Our new chairman, Senator Bennett, worked extremely \nhard to balance priorities in this bill with limited funding. It has \nbeen a pleasure to work with him, and I appreciate the good job that he \nhas done.\n  I would like to briefly mention some of the highlights of this bill.\n  Continued funding has been provided for important research projects \nranging from nutrition issues to the control of emerging diseases. As \nwe witnessed the devastating economic effect that one case of mad cow \ndisease had on Canada, the importance of knowing all we can about it \nand making certain that our borders are protected becomes very clear. \nFurther, outbreaks of Chronic Wasting Disease and West Nile Virus \ndemonstrate how small the world has become, and research funded in this \nbill plays an integral role in keeping America prepared.\n  Continued funding has also been provided for ongoing conservation \nprojects across the country. The Natural Resources Conservation Service \nprovides basic services to help ensure that agriculture and our natural \nresources can fully complement each other. Risks from drought and \nflooding are reduced due to activities carried out by the NRCS. In \nrecent years and recent days, it seems nearly every community in \nAmerica has been faced with one or the other, and the NRCS, along with \nthe Farm Service Agency, has played a vital role in protecting and \nassisting affected communities.\n  Funding has been provided to improve food safety, including funding \nfor the Food Safety and Inspection Service to hire an additional 87 \nfood safety inspectors and foreign program auditors. Funding for \nadditional training, to improve the scientific and surveillance skills \nof these inspectors, as well as improved laboratory capability to \nensure that they have access to modern equipment, is also included in \nthis bill. The Food and Drug Administration is provided funding to \nimprove monitoring of the food industry, improve the FDA's laboratory \npreparedness, and to implement the recently mandated Food Registration \nSystem.\n  For rural development, this bill provides adequate resources to \ncontinue\n\n[[Page S13956]]\n\nthe important programs that include homeownership, essential community \nfacilities, water and waste assistance, business loan and grant \nprograms. The committee has also provided sufficient funds for farm \ncredit programs, which are essential to farmers who could not obtain \nfunding from the commercial sector for ownership and operating loans.\n\n   The bill provides sufficient funding for the WIC program to support \na monthly participation level of approximately 7.8 million low-income \nwomen, infants and children, the same participation level requested in \nthe budget. This level includes funding for several initiatives \nrequested by the President, and includes $25 million for the popular \nWIC Farmers' Market program and a $125 million contingency fund. \nFunding for the food stamp program and the commodity supplemental food \nprogram is also provided in this bill.\n   Funding for the child nutrition programs, which include school \nbreakfast, school lunch, the child and adult care feeding program, and \nthe summer food service program, is included at the President's request \nlevel. In previous years, I have worked to include several provisions \nin this bill to expand the availability of these important programs. \nThis year, due to the scheduled reauthorization of the child nutrition \nprograms, these provisions are not included. Instead, I have been \nworking with the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture \nCommittee to have these provisions included permanently in child \nnutrition reauthorization.\n   The FDA is funded in this bill at sufficient levels to continue its \nmission of promoting and protecting the public health. Increased \nfunding is provided for the food safety items I previously mentioned, \nas well as patient safety activities, medical device review, over the \ncounter drugs, generic drugs, and pharmaceuticals for children. Last \nyear, consumers spent nearly $1.5 trillion dollars on FDA-regulated \nproducts. The work done there is vital to this country, and the nearly \n$1.4 billion in funding provided to the agency reflects that \nimportance.\n   I believe that more could be done with additional funding. However, \nwith the dollars available, the chairman has put together a good bill \nthat I fully support. I would like to thank Senator Bennett for his \nleadership and hard work, as well as the hard work of his staff Pat \nRaymond, Fitzhugh Elder, Hunter Moorhead, and Dianne Preece. It is hard \nto believe that this is their first year working on this bill. Their \nexpertise and professionalism would indicate that they had many years \nexperience on this subcommittee.\n   Again, I strongly support this bill, and I urge all Members to vote \nfor its passage.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Chairman and \nthe Ranking Member for bringing the Senate a carefully crafted spending \nbill within the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation and consistent with \nthe discretionary spending cap for 2004.\n  The Senate reported bill provides $17.0 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority and $17.6 billion in discretionary outlays for fiscal \nyear 2004 for the Department of Agriculture. This is 8.5 percent less \nthan last year in discretionary budget authority and 1.6 percent less \nthan last year in discretionary outlays. This bill also provides $55.5 \nbillion in mandatory budget authority and $39.5 billion in mandatory \noutlays in fiscal year 2004 for the Department of Agriculture.\n  The Senate reported bill is at the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation \nfor budget authority and $171 million in outlays below the 302(b) \nallocation. The bill provides $1.57 billion less in budget authority \nand $279 million less in outlays than the FY 2003 level and $22 million \nmore in BA and $96 million less in outlays than the President's \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nS. 1427, AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS, 2004.--SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-\n                              REPORTED BILL\n                      [Fiscal year 2004 $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority.............       17,005       55,536       72,541\n    Outlays......................       17,632       39,472       57,104\nSenate Committee allocation:\n    Budget authority.............       17,005       55,536       72,541\n    Outlays......................       17,803       39,472       57,275\n2003 level:\n    Budget authority.............       18,575       52,763       71,338\n    Outlays......................       17,911       40,712       58,623\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.............       16,983       55,536       72,519\n    Outlays......................       17,728       39,472       57,200\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.............       17,004       55,143       72,147\n    Outlays......................       17,657       39,142       56,799\n \n                    Senate-Reported Bill Compared To\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority.............            0            0            0\n    Outlays......................         -171            0         -171\n2003 level:\n    Budget authority.............       -1,570        2,773        1,203\n    Outlays......................         -279       -1,240       -1,519\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.............           22            0           22\n    Outlays......................          -96            0          -96\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.............            1          393          394\n    Outlays......................          -25          330          305\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted for\n  consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the fiscal \nyear 2004 Agriculture, rural development, and related agencies \nappropriations bill, and I would like to speak on the issue of \nincreased funding provisions related to the treatment of animals.\n  Two agencies in the Department of Agriculture are charged with the \nresponsibility of carrying out regulatory programs to protect animals \nfrom mistreatment, called for under the Animal Welfare Act and the \nHumane Methods of Slaughter Act. The Animal Welfare Act is enforced by \nthe Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the Humane Methods \nof Slaughter Act enforced by the Food Safety and Inspection Service.\n  The need for this increase in funding and commitment is due, in part, \nto media reports above livestock being raised in unspeakable conditions \nwhere they did not even have room to lie down, and about animal \nslaughter operations where animals are not properly stunned before \nbeginning the process of dismemberment. While the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, and certain state authorities, did initiate investigations \nregarding some of the more egregious reports, I understand that those \ncharges were dismissed due to evidentiary problems, leaving unanswered \nthe actual degree of severity to which humane slaughter regulations \nwere violated in the reported cases, or the degree to which similar \nviolations occur throughout the Nation.\n  During consideration of the fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations \nbill, the Senate included, at my request, $5 million for the hiring of \nat least 50 additional humane slaughter inspectors. Report language \naccompanying that bill instructed these new inspectors to work solely \non the enforcement of the Humane Slaughter Act.\n  Prior to the $1.25 million allocation in the fiscal year 2001 \nsupplemental appropriations bill for the hiring of 17 district \nveterinary medical specialists at the Food Safety Inspection Service to \nwork solely on the enforcement of the Humane Slaughter Act, there were \nno inspectors employed exclusively for this purpose.\n  On May 7, 2003, the Secretary of Agriculture testified before the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture regarding the \nadministration's fiscal year 2004 budget request. At that hearing, I \nasked the Secretary about the hiring of additional Food Safety \nInspection Service inspectors for which funding had been appropriated \nin the previously enacted appropriations bill; however, it became \napparent that the Department had yet to hire any new inspectors.\n  As a result of continued interest in this matter, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee included additional report language clarifying \nthe funding provided in fiscal year 2003 regarding the Department's \ngoal for hiring 38 new inspectors by the end of fiscal year 2003. As of \nOctober 28, 2003, this goal was met, and I understand that the \nremaining 12 inspectors will be hired by the end of this calender year.\n  The fiscal year 2004 Senate Agriculture appropriations bill provides \nstatutory language to continue funding for the 50 humane slaughter \ninspectors and the 17 district veterinary medical specialists, and \noutlines the Committee's expectation that this funding will be included \nin the Department's fiscal year 2005 budget request.\n  I strongly believe that much work remains to be done. I believe that \ncontinued attention should be placed on enforcement on both the Animal \nWelfare Act and the Humane Methods of\n\n[[Page S13957]]\n\nSlaughter Act to put a stop to the mistreatment of animals.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee for their support in this every \nimportant effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S13957-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STATUS OF APPROPRIATIONS BILLS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as Members are aware, all 13 appropriations \nbills have cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  Four bills have been sent to the President for signature, of which \nthree have been signed into law. The Defense, Homeland Security, and \nLegislative Branch appropriations bills have been signed, and the \nInterior appropriations bill is awaiting signature.\n  Five appropriations bills are in conference. These are the Military \nConstruction, Energy and Water Development, Labor-HHS-Education, \nForeign Operations, and Transportation and Treasury appropriations \nbills. The Military Construction appropriations bill completed \nconference yesterday, and the Energy and Water Development conference \nmet today.\n  Four appropriations bills are awaiting completion of Senate action--\nAgriculture, VA-HUD, Commerce-Justice-State, and the District of \nColumbia. The Agriculture appropriations bill is being considered on \nthe floor today.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should proceed to process these four final \nbills on the floor and to send them to conference with the House. This \nwill protect our rights as Senators to offer amendments. The Senate \nshould process 13 individual appropriations bills, and avoid an omnibus \nappropriations bill. Omnibus appropriations bills have the effect of \nshoehorning large segments of the Federal Government into one monstrous \nbill. Members' rights to amend legislation are severely limited, and \nthey will not be able to know what they are voting for or against. \nOmnibus appropriations legislation also has the result of bringing the \nWhite House to the table, which has the effect of blurring the \ndistinction between the responsibilities of the executive branch and \nthe constitutional responsibilities of the legislative branch to \ndevelop legislation under the separation of powers. This is no way to \nlegislate.\n  I thank and commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Mr. Stevens, for his steadfast pursuit of the goal of \nprocessing 13 individual appropriations bills. The Senate would not be \nat this stage of processing the appropriations bills, if my friend, the \nSenator from Alaska, had not pursued this matter with such vigor on his \nside.\n  Again, I thank my distinguished and able colleague, Mr. Stevens, for \nhis efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S13957-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13957-S13980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RURAL UTILITIES SERVICE BROADBAND LOAN PROGRAM\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I support the effort spearheaded by my \ncolleagues, Senator Burns and Senator Dorgan, and have serious \nobjections to the Bush administration's proposal to gut the only \nnational program we've ever enacted to get broadband high speed \nInternet connectivity deployed across our country.\n  It was just last year that Congress passed, as part of the farm bill, \nthe only national broadband deployment incentive I am aware of that has \nbeen enacted by the Federal Government--a program that was supposed to \nprovide over $700 million in loans a year to help get broadband to all \nparts of the country--$700 million in loans a year to help create and \nbring jobs to rural parts of the country--$700 million a year to help \nimprove health care and education delivery to places like Upstate New \nYork, rural Montana, North Dakota, Alaska, Iowa, and all across the \ncountry--$700 million a year to help improve emergency communications \nsystems so that our first responders can actually receive those calls \nfor help.\n  From a fiscal perspective, you couldn't ask for a better deal. It \ntakes just $20 million in Federal resources to leverage over $700 \nmillion in loans--$700 million in loans plus at least another 20 \npercent in investment from the private sector. Has the program been \npopular? You better believe it has. In just 9 months since the Rural \nUtilities Service published regulations for the broadband loan program, \nthe RUS has received applications that total over $1 billion. Our rural \ncommunities across the country recognize the promise of new \ntelecommunications technologies.\n  Our rural communities and the coalition of Members from Congress that \nhelped create the RUS broadband loan program in last year's farm bill \naren't the only ones who recognize the promise of broadband. Look what \nother countries are doing.\n  A recent study by the International Telecommunications Union, the \nUN's telecommunications agency, confirmed what many of us already know. \nSouth Korea is leading the world in numbers of high-speed Internet \nconnections per capita, with Hong Kong and Canada coming in at second \nand third. Where is the U.S. a distant 11th.\n  And these other countries are outspending us on broadband \ninfrastructure. Sweden has set aside some $800 million on broadband \ndeployment in rural areas of the country. France is following suit, \nhaving announced not long ago its plans to invest $1.5 billion on \nbroadband infrastructure over 5 years. In Japan, through the majority \ngovernment owned Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the country is in the \nmiddle of a huge fiber-to-the-home project across the country. In \nKorea, the government is laying out some $15 billion to provide an \noptical fiber connection to 84 percent of homes by 2005.\n  We are falling behind. I don't know about the rest of my colleagues, \nbut I think that's a huge problem. People in upstate New York know it's \na huge problem. There is little disputing that a nation with ubiquitous \nbroadband will be more efficient and productive than a nation without \nit. Just a couple weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal had a story \ntitled, What's Slowing Us Down?, with the byline, ``Broadband is seen \nas a critical part of the national economy. Yet the U.S. lags behind \nother countries.''\n  The Wall Street Journal piece points out that, ``Rising rates of \nhigh-speed Internet access are expected to trigger everything from \nincreased sales of new computers to a massive rise in worker \nproductivity.'' A recent Brookings Institution study found that \nuniversal broadband access could add $300 billion a year to the U.S. \neconomy. Forgoing a major broadband rollout, the Wall Street Journal \nnotes, might not only hinder economic growth, but also worsen an \nalready bleak picture for battered telecommunications and high-tech \nindustries.\n  That explains the letter that a host of companies and high-tech \nassociations have sent to Senators Bennett and Kohl, the managers on \nthis important bill. This letter pleading to restore funding of the RUS \nbroadband loan program is signed by 3M, Alcatel, Cisco Systems, \nCorning, Intel, Nortel Networks, Siemens, and so many others who \nrecognize the importance of this modest investment.\n  But they are not the only ones we're hearing from. I am hearing from \nsmall carriers across New York who need assistance to get broadband \ndeployed to their rural areas--companies like Castle Cable Television \nin Alexandria Bay, NY who want to do the right thing--who recognize the \npotential of broadband to bring jobs and better services to their \ncommunities.\n  So what is our plan, our national strategy to help ensure broadband \ngets deployed across America? What is our plan to ensure America's \ncompetitiveness? Well, the administration's plan and the one that's \ncome out of committee in the Senate is to crush the one permanent \nbroadband deployment program the Federal government has ever enacted.\n  I understand that we have replaced $10 million that would leverage \nover $350 million in broadband loans with $10 million in grants. That \ndoesn't make any sense. I am not suggesting we not do grants--but it \ndoesn't make fiscal sense to saw off $10 million that will leverage \nover $350 million in loans for a simple $10 million in grants.\n  And it certainly doesn't make sense to take away the Rural Utilities \nService's administrative funding and capacity to process and review the \npending applications. Rural communities across the country, like Alex \nBay in New York, need these resources to create and attract jobs. And \nour country needs to make these investments if we're to stay ahead of--\nor at least competitive with--South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, and our \nneighbors to the\n\n[[Page S13958]]\n\nnorth, Canada, who are making the investments in broadband to move \nahead.\n  I commend my colleagues, Senators Burns and Dorgan, for their \nleadership in helping restore the full funding level for the RUS \nbroadband loan program, and I ask the managers of this bill and for the \nadministration to join in what should be a national strategy to deploy \nbroadband across America.\n  Mr. KOHL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could I \nask the Senator from West Virginia how long he intends to speak?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would say 15 to 18 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and \ncolleague.\n\n\n                        LEAK OF STAFF DRAFT MEMO\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. There have been statements made on the floor today--\nwhich I was not here to listen to because I was in a Commerce Committee \nmeeting--expressing concern, outrage, et cetera, about what is \nhappening with the Senate Intelligence Committee's inquiry into the \nprewar Iraqi intelligence. We have heard charges that a draft memo \ntaken from the Intelligence Committee spaces and provided to the media \nsomehow represents a plan to discredit what the Intelligence Committee \nis doing and to politicize the inquiry. These charges are inaccurate \nand unfortunate. I wish to speak to them as vice chairman of that \ncommittee.\n  I would suggest to my colleagues that there is in fact reason for \nconcern today, but it is not because of the content of this draft staff \nmemo--a memo which, for the record, was not approved by me, was not \ngiven to any other member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, nor to \nany other staff person, my own staff on the Intelligence Committee, nor \nto any other member of the Senate, nor anybody else. It was an internal \ndraft memo. It happens all the time in the Senate. At some point very \nsoon the committee and the Senate are going to have to explore the \nchain of events surrounding this draft memo since it raises serious \nquestions about whether the majority is obtaining unauthorized access \nto private internal materials of the minority, and who made the \ndecision in this case to leak the draft of an unofficial memo to the \npress.\n  It is disturbing that individuals are seeking, perhaps or perhaps \nnot, to score political points with a draft paper describing the rights \nof the minority to push for a full and fair review of the issues of the \ncommittee and that the memo is being so grossly mischaracterized to try \nto deflect attention from the real issue.\n\n  More importantly, the concern this body should feel today is that the \nIntelligence Committee is not conducting a thorough and in-depth \ninquiry into all aspects of the intelligence process leading up to the \nwar in Iraq. This body should be disturbed that 5 months after we \nstarted asking questions, we are still going, in essence, hat in hand \nto the administration to try to get the documents we need to conduct \nthis review.\n  I most sincerely regret the impression that the draft memo has \napparently given to some of my Republican colleagues, but it clearly \nreflects staff frustration that the Senate Intelligence Committee's \ninvestigation has not tackled all of the tough issues, and frustration \nwith the difficulties we have had in obtaining information from the \nadministration. It should come as no surprise to anyone that there is \ntension on the committee. I have said publicly for months that the \ncommittee must review not only the accuracy of prewar intelligence on \nweapons of mass destruction and terrorism but also the use or misuse of \nthat intelligence by senior policymakers in this administration. This \nis fundamental to answering the questions the American people have \nabout how we got into this war. But at every turn, the chairman has \nmade it clear that the inquiry will be limited to reviewing the prewar \nintelligence against the low threshold of a standard called \nreasonableness. We have a basic disagreement. These kinds of things \nhappen in the Senate.\n  I was pleased last week ended with the chairman and myself standing \nside by side, as we should, insisting on the committee's need for \nevidence wherever it might be located. But the information we have \nrequested to date is only part of our work. It should be obvious to all \nthat our committee still has much to do to assure that our inquiry into \nprewar intelligence about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and links \nto terrorism fulfills our responsibilities to the Senate and to the \nAmerican public.\n  I want to take a minute--it is important for me to do so--to describe \nthese responsibilities because I am not sure all of our colleagues \nknow. The committee's responsibilities come to us from the Senate. We \ndon't make them up. The Senate created the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence in 1976. The measure that established it, S. Res. 400 of \nthe 95th Congress, remains the Senate's charter to us as a committee. \nIt is very specific.\n  S. Res. 400 was not a casual measure. It was the product of years of \ninterest in improving oversight of intelligence, a major investigation \nchaired by Senator Church, reports of several standing committees, \nabout eight or nine, and extensive floor consideration. It is not up to \nthe 17 of us who happen now to be on that committee to make up the \nboundaries of our responsibility. They are given to us and written out \nvery clearly.\n  S. Res. 400 begins by stating its purpose: To create a Senate select \ncommittee ``to oversee and make continuing studies of the intelligence \nactivities and programs of the United States Government.''\n  The Senate did not leave the term ``intelligence activities'', the \nobject of oversight, to the imagination of generations of members of \nthe Intelligence Committee. Instead, the Senate carefully defined the \nterm ``intelligence activities'' in section 14 of the resolution to \ninclude ``the collection, analysis, production, dissemination, or use \nof the information.''\n\n  The five elements of intelligence activity--that is collection, \nanalysis, production, dissemination, and use--represent the full cycle \nwith which the committee must be concerned. That is our charter. If we \nexamine analysis of information without considering the collection of \nit, we fail in our responsibility. If we examine both of them but not \nthe production of reports and the dissemination of information, we fail \nin our responsibility. If we stop at dissemination and do not examine \nthe use of intelligence, we will equally fail in our responsibility. \nThat examination is what I have been pushing for and it is what I will \ncontinue seeking.\n  I have heard it said that policy is the responsibility of other \ncommittees. Of course, other committees have responsibilities relating \nto national security policies. But so do we. Our mandate from the \nSenate is clear. S. Res. 400 also says the information which is subject \nto the committee's oversight includes information relating to foreign \ncountries and to ``the defense, the foreign policy, the national \nsecurity, or related policies of the United States.'' It is broad. It \nis thorough.\n  We should be committed as a committee to developing a full record. \nThe joint letters the chairman and I wrote last week insisting the \nadministration provide us with the necessary documents and interviews \nare a step in the right direction which I very much appreciate. But \nthere is a lot more to be done. Even if we might disagree about the \nevaluation of evidence, we should put the full weight of the committee \nbehind obtaining all the facts our members believe to be necessary for \na complete inquiry. For me, that means all communications, not just a \nlimited list, about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and terrorism \nintelligence between the Intelligence Committee and policymakers, \nincluding the White House.\n  Without those, our record will not be complete. We cannot assess, for \nexample, whether intelligence agencies were\n\n[[Page S13959]]\n\npressured to conform to the views of policymakers unless we know what \npolicymakers were asking of these agencies. This is a key objective of \nthis inquiry, and we are in danger of completely missing it.\n  Albeit in strong language, what staff suggests in the draft memo--\nwhich, again, nobody on the committee saw and nobody else had seen it \nuntil it was leaked, and then everybody has it--is that the minority \nwork with the majority to get as far as we can in this effort. That was \nour purpose--to work as far as we can and be as successful as we can in \nthis effort, and if the majority continued to refuse, then the minority \nshould be prepared to point out shortcomings consistent with the rules.\n  It is misleading to suggest this possible approach comes as a \nsurprise to anyone in this body. I have been clear with the chairman \nfor months that there is growing interest among many members of the \ncommittee in pursuing a separate investigation. It is not a course I \nchoose to follow. Many Senate Democrats are on record in support of an \nindependent commission. We voted it down the other day. I voted against \nit, but many Members did not; they voted for it. I am on record \nopposing that approach and I continue to oppose it. But, it is an \noption that cannot be ruled out.\n\n  Exploring or asserting the rights of the minority under the \nIntelligence Committee rules in no way amounts to politicizing \nintelligence. A substantive disagreement is not grounds for charges of \npartisan politics; it is a difference of approach, a difference of \nopinion.\n  I have worked for months within the committee to try to get these \ncritical questions answered. It was not until the committee Democrats, \nin fact, exercised their rights under the rules and forced a meeting in \nJune that the committee first discussed the parameters of a review. \nDemocrats, some of them, wanted a formal investigation and ultimately \nagreed to the majority's less formal, less structured approach because \nthe issue was too important to descend into political bickering.\n  In August, I wrote the chairman with a list of 14 areas where I \nthought the committee needed to do more work. I got no response. In \nSeptember, after press reports that the chairman was planning to wrap \nup the interim investigation by the end of September, I wrote again to \nexpress my belief that we had more work to do and set out a framework \nfor how we should approach the task we faced. I got no response. I met \nwith the chairman on numerous occasions and got no response.\n  Then, 2 weeks ago, after reading press stories from the chairman \ndescribing a committee report that I had not seen and a deadline I knew \nwe could not meet, I sat down with the chairman--again, we are good \nfriends, and we will remain that way--to talk about where the inquiry \nwas and what was left to do. In that meeting, I provided him with draft \nletters to the different agencies that owed us documents and interviews \nwhich the committee staff, under the control of the majority, had long \nsince asked for, months ago. I cosigned a tough letter, along with the \nchairman, to the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, pressing him \nto provide materials requested by the committee staff--fundamentally \none which his staff director directs. When I provided the majority with \na list of nine examples of the use of intelligence we must have to \nunderstand the interplay between policymakers and the intelligence \ncommunity, I was turned down.\n  The fact is that I have approached the majority in every way I know \nhow--in private letters, in meetings, in committee meetings, in public \nstatements, on the Senate floor, imploring the majority to work \ntogether with us and imploring the majority to meet the committee's \nfundamental responsibility to investigate the potential misuse of \nintelligence by policymakers leading up to the war in Iraq. My \nentreaties have been to no avail, eliciting either no response or, \nworse yet, public statements by the chairman unilaterally announcing \nthat the committee will, in fact, not pursue the critical issue of use.\n  The majority has left the Senate minority with two choices: Either \nabandon what we believe is a fundamental obligation in this body to the \nAmerican people as is laid out in the Senate resolution creating us, \nor, reluctantly, part ways and use our rights as a minority to get the \njob done on our own. I prefer not to do that. It is not my nature. \nI prefer not to do that. That calls for members working together and \ncalls for following committee rules and following our charter.\n\n  Throughout this difficult situation, I have remained committed to the \ncommittee's investigation. I have been vocal in my appreciation of the \nabsolutely excellent job done to date by the staff on the aspects of \nthe investigation they have been asked to perform, which is reviewing \nthe prewar Iraqi intelligence. They have done a superb job, absolutely \nsuperb job.\n  I still strongly believe the committee can and should do this job. I \nam confident that, presented with the facts, the American people can \nand will judge this administration fairly. For my part, I have and I \nwill continue to support the President when I believe he is right. I \nhad the same approach with the previous President, President Clinton. \nWhen I believed he was wrong, I went after him really hard, on steel \nand other things. But when he was right, I said so. On the other hand, \nI will also challenge and question the President and his administration \nwhen I think they are in error. That is my duty. I am an elected \nSenator and I represent my people. That is my job as a Senator. It is \nmy responsibility as vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  I conclude by saying I am also confident that the members of the \nIntelligence Committee can put aside their differences and continue \nwith the tough tasks facing members. Maybe it took this to somehow \nembarrass all of us enough to bring us together. I want the result to \nbe that we do this together under the Senate resolution. I hope we can \nput this behind us.\n  I suggest to the chairman that the full committee meet again this \nweek to bring us to a point of consensus. We must pursue this inquiry \nto the end. These are extraordinarily important matters we are \ndiscussing, not to score political points on either side but because we \nmust make sure we fix problems and provide our country with the best \nintelligence possible. That is our job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are back on the bill. I see some \nSenators have come to the floor and I ask those who are here if they \nintend to offer amendments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Utah, it \nis my intention to offer an amendment. I would like to speak about a \nsubject that is going to prompt the amendment and then discuss with my \ncolleague, Senator Burns from Montana, who will be joining me with an \namendment. There are several ways we might offer this amendment. I \nwould like to have a discussion with Senator Burns and also with \nSenator Kohl and Senator Bennett about the specific amendment because \nmy hope is we can work things out as this bill is on the floor.\n  It is my intention to offer an amendment with my colleague, Senator \nBurns from Montana. I would like to speak about it, and he would \nprobably want to speak as well.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may respond, the Senator from \nCalifornia is here. In fact, she left a very important conference \ncommittee to come here because she feels strongly about her amendment. \nShe has an amendment to offer and she is not in a position to agree to \nany time. She will probably take an hour, an hour and a half. So it \nwill be the first lengthy amendment on this bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I understand the Senator from California had the desire \nto offer her amendment, and I encouraged her to come to the floor to do \nso. Now she has come.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota how long he might want to take \nbecause I want to accommodate the Senator from California. I say that \nas if I control the time, which I clearly do not, but the Senator from \nNevada has suggested the Senator from California be allowed to offer \nher amendment and I want to be as accommodating as I can be to all \nSenators.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I inquire of the Senator from Utah? First of all, I \nwould like to speak for perhaps 5 to 7 minutes initially. I guess the \nSenator from Montana may want to speak for a\n\n[[Page S13960]]\n\nvery short time. Following the presentation by Senator Feinstein and \nperhaps after a meeting I will attend, I will speak at greater length, \nif I could be recognized--I would be very brief--in order to describe \nto the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Utah what Senator \nBurns and I want to try to achieve this afternoon on this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I think we can introduce that very shortly and then perhaps discuss \nit at greater length at a later time.\n  Mr. BURNS. If the Senator from North Dakota will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield.\n  Mr. BURNS. It is a good idea to give us time to work it out to the \nagreement of both sides. This can be done. We are going to have to \noffset it. We would work with the chairman and the ranking member.\n\n  I don't need any time prior to Senator Feinstein speaking. We can do \nthat after because she has come, with all good intentions, to offer her \namendment, and I think she should be allowed to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. In that case, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator from North Dakota be recognized for 7 minutes and, \nfurther, that he be followed by the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I said, I will speak about this at \ngreater length this afternoon, but I did want to advance the topic \nSenator Conrad Burns and I wish to advance, an amendment on this bill \ndealing with something called the Broadband Loan Program.\n  Let me describe what that is. Let me describe it by telling you I was \nrecently in my hometown, a town of fewer than 300 people, in \nsouthwestern North Dakota. I visited a home there. I stopped by to say \nhello, and there was a woman in that home who had a little device on \nher counter. It looked different to me. It had a camera mounted on it. \nIt was no bigger than a shoe box. She had a bracelet hanging on a \nlittle round projectile on it.\n  I said: Well, what are you doing there? She said: I am taking a \npicture of this bracelet. I said: Why are you doing that? She said: I \nsell on eBay.\n  Here in my hometown is a woman who sells on eBay, and she takes a \npicture of those products and puts them on her computer. She told me \nshe has been supplementing her income by doing business on eBay.\n  It describes the need, even in a town of 300 people, for computer \naccess, the need for broadband, the need for the big pipes in which you \ncan do business on the Internet in a way that does not take you a day \nto download something others are downloading in 5 minutes.\n  So the question of the building out of broadband to rural communities \nall across this country, including rural areas especially, is a very \nimportant question. Because if you do not build out broadband \ncapability, then what happens is you leave some parts of the country \nbehind. You have an Internet divide. You have people on the right side \nof it and you have people on the wrong side. The people on the wrong \nside will never have any economic development opportunities because \nwhen you talk to somebody about building a business in this town, they \nwill ask: Do you have the capability to connect us by computer with \nsome reasonable speed? When you say: No, we don't, they will say: Well, \nso long. We're going elsewhere. That is why this is so important.\n  Let me describe quickly what we did. In the farm bill, a group of \nus--Senator Burns, myself, and others--included a provision that deals \nwith a broadband loan program. It is the first and the only program in \nthis country designed to spur the development of the buildout of \nbroadband capability to rural areas. It was scheduled to use $100 \nmillion in direct spending to subsidize $3.5 billion of loans over the \n6 years of the farm bill.\n  Pursuant to that, RUS, down at the Department of Agriculture, put \ntogether the first 2 years $40 million, and they announced they would \nmake $1.4 billion in loans available. As a result of that, they set a \nJuly 31 deadline. They received $1 billion in loan applications because \nwe have people with interests and businesses really interested in \nbuilding out this broadband capability to rural areas, very much like \nthe old REA program.\n  Prior to REA, there was no electricity on America's farms. They were \ndark. When the Sun went down, you could not plug into anything because \nno one built electricity infrastructure out to America's farms. We \ncreated the Rural Electrification Act, and all of a sudden America's \nfarms got electricity. It created dramatic explosions in productivity \non America's farms. That is what this is about: the buildout of the \ninfrastructure for broadband to our small rural communities and to our \nfarms.\n  So what happened was the USDA put together this program. The loans \nwere requested. We have applications for loans. They came in by July \n31. What happened, however, is the language that is included now in \nthis appropriations bill eliminates the broadband section of the farm \nbill--it eliminates it--and in its place puts a $9.1 billion \nappropriation, which is less than half the amount that should have been \navailable this year.\n  If we move down this road, it appears to us the money that has been \napplied for, for loans will not be at this point continued. They will \nhave to start over. You will have half the money. There is no assurance \nthe additional money will be available in future years because this \nwill be an appropriated amount rather than being in the farm bill which \nauthorized this for 6 years.\n  This is very important. This is about the haves and have-nots in this \ncountry with respect to access to the Internet and with respect to \nbroadband capability. If we decide that access to the Internet, with \npipes that are of reasonable circumference so you get some decent \nspeed, does not matter to rural areas, we will have, in my judgment, \neconomic development only in areas of the country where we have \nbroadband, and small towns and rural areas are going to be told: So \nlong, Charlie. Just tough luck. You are not going to be developed \nbecause we have a digital divide, and we support that digital divide. \nThat is a terrible message to come from the Congress.\n  What I would like to do, with my colleague, Senator Burns, is to work \nwith Senator Bennett and Senator Kohl to try to deal with this problem \nthat is created in the appropriations bill. We have two problems. One \nis a language problem. We need to restore the language that existed in \nthe farm bill that calls for this Broadband Loan Program. We should not \nkick that out in this appropriations bill, No. 1.\n  No. 2, we should restore the funding that was there that was promised \nand upon which applicants now have applied for $1 billion in investment \nfunds to build out broadband capability to rural areas of the country.\n  I know rural areas are sometimes looked at as kind of the ``back \n40.'' Well, it is not the ``back 40.'' It is a wonderful part of this \ncountry. It is small towns and good families trying to make a living, \noften in circumstances where they are losing population. These are \nplaces with strong schools, places in which you can raise kids without \nworrying about their safety, with good neighbors, good places to be. \nBut if we decide, as a country, in the age of information technology \nand information revolution, that only the big cities are going to have \nthe aggressive, robust buildout of broadband, then we are consigning \nrural America to a pretty desperate struggle for their future. That is \nnot what we want. That is not what Congress decided.\n  Congress already made this judgment when it passed the farm bill. It \nsaid: Rural America matters as well. Small towns matter, too. That is \nwhat the Congress decided. As a result of that decision, it made a \nspecific, deliberate investment to say we are going to fund, through \nloans, and we are going to encourage, through loans, the buildout of \nbroadband infrastructure to help small towns and family farms in this \ncountry.\n  That promise was well underway, and now what has happened is, in this \nbill, we have a problem that derails it. We want to fix it. I want to \nwork with my colleagues, Senator Bennett and Senator Kohl, to do that. \nI will return this afternoon to see if we can do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S13961]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Lugar, Mr. Levin, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Boxer, \n     Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Hollings, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2083.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment has to do with \nproviding some regulatory oversight over energy trading. It has to do \nwith closing the Enron loophole. It has to do with providing \ntransparency. Energy trades today are not subject to the 2000-passed \nCommodity Modernization Act. Rather, these energy trades take place \nelectronically, take place in secret, without transparency, with no \nrecords kept, with no audit trail available, and with no regulatory \noversight to prevent fraud and manipulation in energy trading.\n  I would like, first of all, from the Derivatives Study Center, to \nindicate and read a couple of paragraphs from the letter they have \nsent, which I think defines the issue very well.\n  I quote:\n\n       This regulatory assistance comes at a critical time. \n     According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's \n     Director of the Office of Market Oversight, ``energy markets \n     are in severe financial distress.'' Along with the decline in \n     credit quality in these markets, the loss of confidence and \n     trust has led to a ruin in the liquidity and depth of these \n     markets. This legislation will go a long way to address this \n     problem.\n\n  Then he defines what derivatives are. This is important for Members \nto know. It is complicated. We went through this once before. I would \nlike to give you this definition because it is a good one:\n\n       Derivatives are highly leveraged financial transactions, \n     allowing investors to potentially take a large position in \n     the market without committing an equivalent amount of \n     capital. Moreover, derivatives traded in over-the-counter \n     markets are devoid of the transparency that characterizes \n     exchange-traded derivatives, such as futures, and this lack \n     of transparency introduces a greater potential for abuse \n     through fraud and manipulation.\n\n  That is exactly what happened. He goes on to say:\n\n       Derivatives are often combined into highly complex, \n     structured transactions that are difficult, even for the \n     seasoned securities trader and finance professionals, to \n     understand and price in the market. Enron used such over-the-\n     counter derivatives extensively in order to hide the nature \n     of their activities from investors. The failure of Enron and \n     the demise of other energy derivatives dealers has had a \n     devastating impact on the level of trust in energy markets.\n\n  That is a good definition of what we are trying to do, why we are \ntrying to do it, and what we are trying to involve.\n  Now I would like to read into the Record a portion of a letter from \nEliot Spitzer. Mr. Spitzer is the attorney general of the State of New \nYork. That is the place where many of these cases are now coming to \ntrial.\n  He says:\n\n       I firmly support your efforts to make energy markets \n     competitive and protect those markets from fraud and \n     manipulation. The bill sponsored by Senators Feinstein, \n     Levin, and Lugar, and under consideration as an amendment to \n     the proposed 2004 agricultural appropriations bill, is a \n     major step toward both goals.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The amendment makes a major contribution to competitive \n     energy markets by initiating an electronic information system \n     to be operated through the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission. This system will provide open access to \n     comprehensive, timely, and reliable wholesale electricity and \n     transmission, price and supply data, greatly expanding the \n     choices of both buyers and sellers. In addition, the \n     reliability of market information would be markedly improved \n     by the amendment's general prohibition on manipulation of the \n     purchase or sale of electricity or the transmission services \n     needed to deliver electricity, and by specific prohibition of \n     the round-trip trading manipulation used so effectively to \n     inflate electricity prices to the public's injury.\n\n  This is a letter from the attorney general of the State of New York. \nAs such, it places an imprimatur of correctness, of need, and of value \non the amendment that we introduce today.\n  Now, what is in that amendment? Specifically, the amendment would \nimprove price transparency in wholesale electricity markets. The \namendment directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to do just \nwhat Mr. Spitzer said it would do: to establish an electronic system to \nprovide information about the price and availability of wholesale \nelectricity to buyers, to sellers, and to the public. This provision is \nactually similar to the transparency provision offered by my colleague \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Domenici, in the Energy bill.\n\n  Secondly, this legislation would prohibit round-trip electricity \ntrades. What is a round-trip trade? It is the simultaneous buying and \nselling of the same quantity of electricity at the same price, in the \nsame location, with no financial gain or loss. In other words, no \ncommodity ever changes hands. Again, this is similar to a provision \nthat Senator Domenici offered during consideration of the Energy bill. \nRound-trip or wash trades are bogus trades. No electricity changes \nhands but the profits from the trades enrich the bottom line of a \ncompany's financial report.\n  In fact, I think we had one company--I believe it was CMS--say that \n80 percent of their balance sheet in a given year was from bogus \ntrades. And there is nothing we can do about it? Does anyone believe \nthat is right? I think not. I don't think the American people do, and \nthat is one of the reasons these markets are so decimated.\n  Next we would increase penalties for violations of the Federal Power \nAct and the Natural Gas Act. Maximum fines for violations of the \nFederal Power Act would be increased from $5,000--that is nothing to a \nbig company--to $1 million. And maximum sentences are increased from 2 \nto 5 years. Remember, these rip-offs were tremendous. Just look at the \npeople plea-bargaining from Enron, look at what they did, look at the \namounts of money they fraudulently compromised.\n  This language is identical to section 209 of the Senate-passed Energy \nbill. Current fines are extraordinarily low and, therefore, provide no \ndeterrence to illegal activity.\n  We also amend the Natural Gas Act to do essentially the same thing. \nSenator Domenici, in his substitute electricity title to the Energy \nbill, increased the fines in the Gas Act but he did not do so in the \nFederal Power Act. We would do both in this amendment.\n  Next the amendment would prohibit manipulation in electricity \nmarkets. Manipulation is prohibited in the wholesale electricity \nmarkets, and FERC is given discretionary authority to revoke market-\nbased rates for violators.\n  Strangely enough, manipulation of energy markets is not prohibited in \ncurrent law. Can you believe that? Manipulation of energy markets is \nnot prohibited in current law. This would add language to part 2 of the \nFederal Power Act to do just that.\n  Most importantly, this bill would repeal the Enron exemption and \nallow the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which has oversight \nover virtually all other trading, to monitor the over-the-counter \nenergy market.\n  This would repeal what happened in 2000 when Enron pushed the \nCommodities Futures Modernization Act exemption for large traders in \nenergy commodities. And it would apply antimanipulation and antifraud \nprovisions of the Commodities Exchange Act to all over-the-counter \ntrades in energy commodities and derivatives.\n  In my view, when Congress exempted energy from the Commodities \nFutures Modernization Act of 2000, it created the playing field for the \nwestern energy crisis of 2000 and 2001. The western energy crisis cost \nmillions of people millions of dollars in my home State of California. \nSo this is a charge I am making. When this Congress permitted\n\n[[Page S13962]]\n\nthe Enron loophole to exist in the Commodities Modernization Act, they \ncreated the loophole for the playing field that Enron and others used \nto manipulate the western energy markets.\n\n  Next, our bill would provide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nthe tools to monitor over-the-counter energy markets. Over-the-counter \nenergy trade in energy commodities and derivatives performs a \nsignificant price discovery function, including trade on electronic \ntrading facilities. Our amendment requires large, sophisticated traders \nto keep records and report large trades to the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission. This doesn't change the law. It only applies the \nlaw that exists for futures contracts to over-the-counter trades in \nenergy markets.\n  We would limit the use of data. This requires the CFTC to seek the \ninformation that is necessary for the limited purpose of detecting and \npreventing manipulations in the futures and over-the-counter markets \nfor energy, to keep proprietary business data confidential, except when \nused for law enforcement purposes. This does not require the real-time \npublication of proprietary data. It does not.\n  This would have no effect on nonenergy commodities or derivatives. \nThe amendment would not alter or affect the regulation of futures \nmarkets, financial derivatives, or metals. We have specifically stated \non page 20 the following:\n\n       The amendments by this title have no effect on the \n     regulation of excluded commodities under the Commodity \n     Exchange Act.\n\n  In addition, we state:\n\n       The amendments made by this title have no effect on the \n     regulation of metals under the Commodity Exchange Act.\n\n  Mr. President, my colleagues may be asking themselves why I continue \nto press this cause. Here I note that Senator Levin has come to the \nfloor. I want the Senate to know how helpful the Senator from Michigan \nhas been in working on this complicated issue. He has spent hours and \nhours of his time. His staff has worked with my staff in evolving this \nmeasure. We have carefully vetted it. I believe we really know what we \nare doing here.\n  The energy crisis in the West demonstrated that, without Federal \noversight, a business becomes solely concerned with its bottom line and \nnot with any sense of ethical behavior; and arrests and convictions to \ndate have clearly documented this to be the case.\n  Californians are still paying the price of this unethical behavior. I \nmake the point that we are not talking about one bad player in the \nCalifornia market. This goes way beyond Enron. It extends to others as \nwell--to Reliant, Dynegy, Williams, AEP, CMS, El Paso Merchant Energy, \nDuke, Mirant, Coral, Sempra Energy Trading--unfortunately, in my own \nState--Aquila, the City of Redding, Morgan Stanley Capital Group, \nPacificorps, and to the Puget Sound Energy.\n  We believe California was duped out of $9 billion. The Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission has illustrated its inability to refund \nCalifornia the money it is owed by recently recommending settlements \nthat in no way, shape, or form reflect the damage that was caused to \nboth consumers and the economy of the largest State in the Union. In \nfact, FERC settled with Reliant on August 29, allowed them not to admit \nwrongdoing, and fined them $836,000. That was $836,000 for rules of \nconduct that cost the State $13 million--hardly fair.\n  This disproportionately low fine gives credibility to the fact that \nthe price one would have to pay in penalties, if caught manipulating \nthe market, is worth the risk since the benefits of not getting caught \nfar outweigh any penalty that may be levied upon a company.\n  I think it is pretty clear that this disproportionately low fine \ngives credibility to the fact that the price one would have to pay in \npenalties, if caught manipulating in the market today, is worth the \nrisk. There is no deterrence, since the benefits of not getting caught \nfar outweigh any penalties that may be levied on a company. That is \nwhat we are trying to change.\n  If I left any doubt in my colleagues' minds about the widespread \nmanipulation that took place during the western energy crisis, let me \npoint out some recent examples of a case that was brought by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission against David Delaney, a former \nchief executive with two of the most prominent divisions of Enron.\n  On October 30, 2002, Delaney pled guilty to insider trading. The SEC \nbrought charges against him for selling millions of dollars in Enron \nstock at a time he knew it was being manipulated. While these charges \nappear to be financial in nature, the underlying facts of the case were \nthat Enron was engaged in manipulative business practices, especially \nin California.\n  In March of 2003, the FERC staff report on price manipulation in \nwestern markets: Investigators said they suspected Enron was using \nprice information obtained in regulated deals to manipulate trades in \nunregulated energy derivative markets.\n  In one instance, Enron manipulated the price of physical gas, upward, \nthen downward. Although the price change in the physical markets was \nonly 10 cents per million Btus, Enron profited due to the effect that \nthis small change in the physical price had on its large financial \nposition. Enron earned more than $3 million in the unregulated over-\nthe-counter markets, while losing only $86,000 on the physical sale of \nnatural gas.\n  I think it is important to note that the FERC report also states:\n\n       Enron's corporate culture fostered a disregard for the \n     American energy customer. The success of the company's \n     trading strategies, while temporary, demonstrates the need \n     for explicit prohibitions on harmful and fraudulent market \n     behavior and for aggressive market monitoring and \n     enforcement.\n\n  That is what we are trying to provide in this amendment. That is what \nFERC says is missing.\n  Our amendment would provide greater oversight over these markets so \nthat fraudulent and manipulative behavior could be prevented. It would \nincrease the penalties if, in fact, a company engaged in fraudulent or \nmanipulative behavior, and it would outlaw all types of manipulation \nincluding round-trip trading, wash trades, false reporting, churning, \nand deliberately withholding generation. All of the Enron trading \nstrategies, such as Ricochet, Death Star, Get Shorty, Fat Boy, Non-Firm \nExport, Load Shift, Wheel Out, Black Widow, Red Congo, and Cuddly Bear: \nthese are euphemisms for fraud and manipulation and our amendment would \ncover them all.\n  It is not clear to me why energy derivatives are not regulated while \nthe Federal Government oversees some physical energy transactions. In \nother words, if I buy natural gas, and it is delivered to me, then that \ntransaction is overseen by FERC, which has the authority to ensure that \nthis transaction is both transparent and reasonably priced.\n\n  But a giant loophole is opened where there is no Government \noversight, when transactions are carried out in electronic exchanges. \nAs a result, if I sell natural gas to you, and you sell it to someone \nelse who sells it to another person who then sells it again, none of \nthese transactions are covered by FERC or the CFTC. Because of that, \nwhat we saw in the western energy crisis is that this particular \nloophole allowed energy companies to manipulate prices and to escape \nany investigation or prosecution by any regulatory agency.\n  Our amendment will close the loophole, as Senator Levin said, created \nin 2000 when Congress passed the Commodities Futures Modernization Act.\n  The loophole exempted energy trading from regulatory oversight, and \nit excluded it completely if the trade was done electronically. At the \ntime, Enron was the main force behind getting this exemption in this \nact. By closing this loophole, the amendment will prohibit fraud and \nprice manipulation in all over-the-counter energy commodity \ntransactions and provide the CFTC the authority it needs to investigate \nand prosecute allegations of fraud and manipulation.\n  Opponents of this amendment have questioned why we need to explicitly \ngive the CFTC this authority. The answer is we need to give the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission this authority because we \nlearned during the western energy crisis that there was, in fact, \npervasive manipulation and fraud in energy markets, and that FERC and \nthe CFTC were either unable or unwilling to use the authority they\n\n[[Page S13963]]\n\nhad to intervene. I think Mr. Delaney's plea bargain is eloquent \ntestimony to that.\n  We need to give the CFTC this authority because we need regulators to \nprotect consumers and make sure they are not taken advantage of. We \nneed to give the CFTC this authority because, when there are inadequate \nregulations, consumers are ripped off. Let me be clear. Our amendment \nwill provide the same protections to consumers in energy markets as \nthese same consumers have in all other commodity markets such as the \nNew York Merchantile Exchange or the Chicago Merchantile Exchange. Our \namendment does not provide more regulation or greater oversight than \nwhat currently exists for other commodity markets, merely the same \nprotections: Protections which are currently lacking.\n  In fact, in an effort to avoid onerous or complicated requirements, \nSenator Levin, Senator Lugar, and I have worked together to make sure \nthe recordkeeping and reporting requirements are very clear. Our \namendment only requires traders to keep records of over-the-counter \ntrades in energy commodities and derivatives that perform a significant \nprice discovery function. In other words, these are the trades that \naffect the pricing for everyone. These are the big trades, and these \nare the trades where there needs to be transparency because they affect \nthe market.\n  If I am a large company and I sell you 1,000 decatherms of natural \ngas in a typical transaction on the spot market, this is a price \ndiscovery transaction because the prices of these transactions are \nusually covered and reported by the press and will affect prices of \nsubsequent transactions. Trades on electronic markets serve, by their \nvery nature, as price discovery functions. They should be available for \neveryone to see because they will very likely influence what price the \nnext trader will buy or sell at in an open and transparent fashion.\n  Our amendment would require traders to keep records of their trades \nand to maintain an audit trail. This requirement would simply regulate \nenergy trading in the same way other finite commodities are handled. \nWhy should pork bellies or frozen concentrated orange juice have more \nprotection for consumers than electricity?\n  There is nothing in this amendment that should be burdensome for \ntraders in any way. I would think responsible traders would already be \nkeeping records and maintaining an audit trail for their own protection \nin this world. In fact, the amendment only allows the CFTC to seek \ninformation to investigate allegations of wrongdoing.\n  We have worked for almost 3 years to craft this provision. It has had \nhearings in the committee. It has been discussed on the floor. We have \nmet with dozens of people. We understand there are those who do not \nwant to support it. But in not supporting it, what they are doing is \ncondoning a marketplace that has practiced deep fraud and deep \nmanipulation and for the most part gotten away with it.\n  I don't think we do our job as Senators if we can't protect an \nunsuspecting public. As the Derivative Center pointed out, these \nmarkets are in disarray now. Why are these markets in disarray? They \nare in disarray because people do not have confidence in them. They are \nin disarray because there is no transparency because there are hidden \nmarkets, and when they explode, they explode big time.\n  Why should Mrs. Smith from Texas or Mr. Jones from Pennsylvania or \nMr. Cornyn from Texas invest in these markets? Why should he? He \nwouldn't have confidence in them. He would have no transparency. He \nwould have no ability to know what is going on.\n  What we are trying to do is put that confidence back in the \nmarketplace by providing some prudent, commonsense, antifraud, \nantimanipulation oversight by saying: If you trade this way, you must \nkeep a record of the trade. You must keep an audit trail. And these \ntrades must be transparent so that the Smiths, the Jones, and the \nCornyns, if they so desire, can find out what in fact is going on.\n  Let me stress that this does not impact financial derivatives in any \nway whatsoever. We have clarified that. Our opponents persist in using \nthe argument that financial derivatives are affected. They are not. \nLook at page 20, lines 17 to 20, if you want to see it in black and \nwhite. Nothing in this provision affects the authority of the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission. We don't change it in any way.\n\n  To respond to concerns about trading platforms that only match buyers \nand sellers, there is no capital requirement. Let me repeat that \nbecause people are going around saying there is. To respond to concerns \nabout trading platforms that only match buyers and sellers, there is no \ncapital requirement.\n  Bottom line: Our amendment merely gives back to the CFTC most of the \nauthority it had before Congress passed the Commodity Futures Exchange \nAct.\n  I note that Senator Levin is in the Chamber. I wonder if it would be \nappropriate for him, if other Members would agree, to make some \ncomments at this time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would have no objection to having the \nSenator from Michigan make his statement. But I wonder if we can arrive \nat some kind of time agreement as to how much longer we are going to \nspend on this amendment. I was told the Senator from California \noriginally said she could deal with it in an hour and a half. I \nsuggested an hour and was told that was not acceptable. I am now \nwilling to say an hour and a half if we can, in fact, nail that time \ndown, with the Senator's statement until now applying against the full \nhour and a half.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might respond, I believe Senator Levin will \nspeak, Senator Lugar wishes to speak, and Senator Cantwell wishes to \nspeak. So on our side of this issue, I believe it will be at least an \nhour and a half.\n  Mr. BENNETT. An additional hour and a half, I ask?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It may not be. I will try to move it rapidly along. \nThese Senators have indicated they wish to come to the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent, then, that the debate on the \nminority side be limited to an hour and a half from this point forward, \nand I will control the time on the majority side and see that we have \nno more than an hour and a half to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. In that case, I have no objection to the Senator from \nMichigan speaking now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Feinstein for \nher leadership on this issue and for her typical courtesy in \ninterrupting her statement so I may give mine at this time. It is most \nappreciated. More important, I thank her for her leadership and Senator \nLugar's leadership in bringing this amendment to the floor.\n  Recent highly negative events in our energy markets show that there \nis an urgent need to prevent price manipulation in those markets, \nimprove the transparency of energy markets, and to strengthen the \nability of State and Federal agencies to enforce the rules governing \nthe operation of those markets.\n  Widespread price manipulation and falsification of price information \nin the electricity and natural gas markets in the last few years have \ninflicted billions of dollars in extra costs on energy consumers and \nbusinesses and have been a severe blow to our economy.\n  The corruption and manipulation of these markets by Enron and other \ncompanies fueled the collapse of some energy markets in the United \nStates, the bankruptcy of some energy companies, and a huge decline in \ninvestment and trading in the energy markets.\n  The bipartisan amendment of Senators Feinstein, Lugar, myself, and \nothers would close these ``Enron loopholes.'' Enron used these \nloopholes, and other companies joined with them, to manipulate energy \nmarkets at the public's expense. Our amendment would strengthen \nprohibitions on fraud and manipulation and give both the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, FERC, and the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, CFTC, the necessary tools to monitor the energy markets, to \nprevent manipulation, and ensure that prices are fairly and \ncompetitively arrived at.\n  This legislation is needed because companies such as Enron are now \npermitted to trade large amounts of energy in virtually unregulated \nmarkets, making those unregulated markets and\n\n[[Page S13964]]\n\nthe resulting price of the energy we use vulnerable to fraud and \nmanipulation.\n  FERC's recent report on manipulation in the western energy market \nprovides some stunning examples of how the energy markets can be \nmanipulated.\n  FERC found that Enron, through an unregulated electronics trading \ncenter called EnronOnline, ``manipulated the price of physical gas \nupward and downward,'' earning huge amounts of illegal profits. FERC \ndetermined that Enron often ``invited counterparties to wash trades, \nand these trades created a false sense of liquidity, which can distort \nprices. Enron also manipulated prices on the EOL by having affiliates \non both sides of certain wash-like trades. This created artificial \nprice volatility and raised prices.''\n  The report by FERC concluded that ``large-volume, rapid-fire trading \nby [Enron] . . . substantially increased natural gas prices in \nCalifornia.'' FERC found ``significant market manipulation'' in the \n``inextricably linked'' natural gas and electricity markets, and that \n``dysfunctions in each fed off one another'' during the energy crisis \nin California.\n  According to FERC:\n\n       Spot gas prices rose to extraordinary levels, facilitating \n     the unprecedented price increase in the electricity market. \n     Dysfunctions in the natural gas market appeared to stem, at \n     least in part, from efforts to manipulate price indices \n     compiled by trade publications. Reporting of false data and \n     wash trading are examples of efforts to manipulate published \n     price indices.\n\n  Finally, the report found:\n\n       The widespread false reporting led staff to conclude that \n     reported prices did not reliably reflect market activity.\n\n  I would like to give one specific example on how one day, January 31, \n2002, Enron used an unregulated, nontransparent Internet trading system \nto manipulate the natural gas market in California.\n  In August of 2002, the FERC staff issued an investigatory report \nfinding that out of a total of 227 trades on that day, January 31, \n2002, 174, or more than two-thirds of the trades on that day, involved \nEnron and a single unnamed party. Most of these trades took place \nduring the last hour of trading with two parties buying huge amounts of \nnatural gas from each other in numerous transactions.\n  FERC determined that the trades took place at ``higher prices,'' in \ntheir words, than other trades that day, and resulted in a steep price \nincrease over the last hour of trading. FERC described this trading \nactivity as ``difficult to rationalize as a normal or standard business \npractice'' and noted:\n\n       [O]nly Enron and possibly the counter party could have \n     known that so much of the trading was going on between \n     themselves, because parties looking at EOL's screens could \n     only see the bid and ask prices; they could not know who the \n     counter party was on any particular trade.\n\n  The FERC report indicated that EnronOnline's prices were routinely \nused to prepare published reports on natural gas prices, which meant \nthat the Enron price data was not just affecting Enron trades but also \ncausing higher natural gas prices industry-wide. The report concluded \nthat Enron had ``significant ability and incentive to manipulate the \nprice data published by the reporting firms.''\n  This spring, FERC issued a number of recommendations to fix the \nproblems in the energy markets. FERC recommended new policies and \nprocedures for the oversight of commodity trades and prices and a \nsystem of market surveillance to detect and prevent manipulation.\n  In March of this year, following a year-long investigation, I \nreleased a Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations staff report into \nthe operation of crude oil markets. The report describes the regulated \nand unregulated markets for buying and selling crude oil and explains \nhow crude oil prices are set and how they affect the price of critical \noil commodities, such as gasoline, home heating fuel, jet fuel, and \ndiesel fuel.\n\n  The report describes the vulnerability of unregulated commodity \nmarkets to price manipulation and the need for and beneficial effects \nof U.S. commodity regulation. The report also explains how the over-\nthe-counter markets are virtually unregulated and, therefore, \nvulnerable to manipulation.\n  The report recommends that traders in over-the-counter markets be \nrequired to ``provide the CFTC with routine information on large \npositions in crude oil and energy contracts and derivatives, as well as \nother information that would aid the CFTC in detecting, preventing, and \nhalting commodity market manipulation.''\n  So we have two reports reaching the same conclusions about the need \nfor more market transparency and strengthened oversight to detect and \nprevent fraud and manipulation in energy markets.\n  How did we get to this position where companies, such as Enron, are \npermitted to manipulate prices in our energy markets? The answer lies \nin how the energy markets and the Federal regulations have evolved over \nthe last 20 years.\n  Billions of dollars' worth of contracts for the future delivery of \nenergy are now traded every day. These contracts are called energy \nderivatives because they derive their price from the price of the \nenergy commodity in the contract.\n  There are two basic types of energy derivatives. Energy derivatives \nthat are traded on futures exchanges are called futures contracts. The \ntrading of futures contracts on futures exchanges is regulated by the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act.\n  The other type of energy derivatives, which are not traded on futures \nexchanges, are called over-the-counter energy derivatives. These \nderivatives may be traded by fax, by phone, in face-to-face meetings, \nor over the Internet. The trading of these derivatives is virtually \nunregulated.\n  Both the futures markets and the over-the-counter markets perform \nidentical economic functions. Both markets enable traders to buy and \nsell commodities at fixed prices, disseminate information about \ncommodity prices, and provide a way for buyers and sellers to hedge \nagainst changes in the price of these commodities. Commodity traders \nroutinely use both the futures markets and the over-the-counter markets \nfor price discovery and hedging.\n  Today, the types of contracts traded in the futures markets and the \nover-the-counter markets are virtually identical. As an indication of \nhow indistinguishable these contracts really are, the NYMEX even calls \nsome of the contracts that it offers on its over-the-counter electronic \nmarket ``futures contracts.''\n  This is an example of what is shown on the NYMEX boards. This is the \nway the NYMEX advertises: Light Louisiana sweet crude oil futures--\nfutures. Futures are supposed to be bought and sold on futures markets, \nnot over-the-counter markets, but this is an over-the-counter sale and \noffer.\n  This is a picture the New York Mercantile projects over the Internet \nfor the purchase and sale of over-the-counter contracts. Notice it \nsays: Trading venue is over the counter, and yet it calls that over-\nthe-counter offer ``futures.'' If they were really futures, they would \nbe regulated as futures contracts are by the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission. But these are over-the-counter sales. These are \nunregulated, and yet they are characterized as futures. The language \nused here is interchangeable. The economic function is interchangeable. \nThe only difference--and it is a critical difference--is that futures \ncontracts are regulated by the Commission and over-the-counter \ncontracts are not. And they should be. They perform the same economic \nfunction. The language used is exactly the same and yet there is one \ngroup of contracts unregulated. The other group of contracts is \nregulated. It is the unregulated contracts which got us into so much \ntrouble, the lack of transparency which got us into so much trouble.\n\n  Let me give another example. The largest over-the-counter electronic \ntrading facility is the Intercon-\ntinentalExchange, known as ICE, in Atlanta. It trades contracts that it \ncalls futures, and yet these are not futures; these are over-the-\ncounter transactions, described by the ICE as futures. It says you can \ntrade futures from your desktop. Yet these are over-the-counter \ntransactions.\n  Here is what they say on their Web site:\n\n       IntercontinentalExchange brings parallel trading in IPE \n     Brent crude of futures to the ICE platform. Electronic \n     futures trading sessions operate in parallel with the regular\n\n[[Page S13965]]\n\n     open-outcry session on the IPE floor in London.\n\n  Now, that open-outcry session, as they phrase it, is the futures \ntrading session that occurs at the exchanges. So they are treating them \nthe same. They are saying, one can trade in futures electronically. The \nlanguage now has become the same, the economic function is the same, \nbut there is one key difference, and it is a deadly difference in terms \nof consumers and in terms of manipulation of prices. That difference is \nthat futures contracts are in fact regulated and must be disclosed and \nare in fact transparent, whereas the over-the-counter trades are not. \nThey are now dealt with interchangeably by the largest exchange, the \nlargest over-the-counter electronic trading facility in the country, \nthe IntercontinentalExchange in Atlanta.\n  Only real futures markets are regulated to prevent price \nmanipulation. That is a fact. The over-the-counter market is not. That \nis what has got us in the hole we are in. That is what permitted Enron \nto dig us deeper into the hole we are in and to cause the loss of huge \namounts of money to our consumers and to many customers. No disclosure, \ntake care of these trades over the market. If the market were a \nregulated market, such as the futures market is, it would have been \nregulated. It could have been transparent. We would not have seen the \nEnron disaster and the manipulation that we saw in Enron and by other \ncompanies.\n  The Commodity Exchange Act regulates the futures exchanges so that \nthey cannot be artificially manipulated. This regulation and \ntransparency has bolstered the confidence of traders in the integrity \nof these markets and it has helped to propel our country into the \nleading marketplace for many commodities.\n  For example, the New York Mercantile Exchange, NYMEX, is the world's \nleading exchange for futures contracts, for energy products such as \nnatural gas, crude oil, gasoline, and home heating oil. The CEA makes \nit a felony to manipulate the price of any commodity, and it contains a \nnumber of provisions to enable the futures exchanges and the CFTC to \ndetect and prevent price manipulation. The CEA requires the regulated \nfutures exchanges to ensure that trading is orderly and to detect and \nprevent price manipulation. The CEA directs the CFTC to oversee the \noperations of the futures exchanges and to itself perform market \noversight and ensure that trading is orderly.\n  According to a former CFTC Chairman:\n\n       The job of preventing price distortion is performed today \n     by regulatory and self-regulatory rules operating before \n     the fact and by threats of private lawsuits and \n     disciplinary proceedings after the fact. Both elements are \n     essential.\n\n  According to the CFTC:\n\n       The heart of the commission's direct market surveillance is \n     a large-trader reporting system, under which [the futures \n     exchanges and brokers] electronically file daily reports with \n     the commission. These reports contain the futures and option \n     positions of traders that hold positions above specific \n     reporting levels set by the CFTC regulations.\n\n  There are no protections against manipulation in the over-the-counter \nmarkets. Unlike the futures markets, the over-the-counter markets are \nnot required to monitor trading to detect and deter fraud and price \nmanipulation. Information that is routinely reported to the futures \nexchanges and the CFTC is not available to the over-the-counter \nexchanges or to the CFTC. Traders do not have to report large trades. \nThere are no position limits or daily price limits. The over-the-\ncounter markets lack all of the critical features of an effective \nprogram to detect and prevent price manipulation.\n  Over-the-counter energy derivatives are unregulated because of a \nprovision that was added to a conference report at the last minute in \nan amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act in an omnibus appropriations \nbill at the end of the Congress in the year 2000. The Commodity Futures \nModernization Act of 2000 was intended to clarify the regulation of \nfinancial instruments. Most of the provisions in the CFMA were based \nupon the recommendations contained in the Report of the President's \nWorking Group on Financial Markets, Over-the-Counter Derivatives \nMarkets and the Commodity Exchange Act, which was jointly issued in \nNovember 1999 by the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the SEC, \nand the CFTC.\n  The working group recommended that financial derivatives be excluded \nfrom regulation under the CEA but that derivatives involving \nnonfinancial commodities with a limited supply, such as energy \ncommodities, not be excluded.\n  The working group stated:\n\n       Due to the characteristics of markets for nonfinancial \n     commodities with finite supplies, however, the working group \n     is unanimously recommending that the exclusion not be \n     extended to agreements involving such commodities.\n\n  A unanimous recommendation of the working group and the House and \nSenate bills leading up to that conference in fact did not extend the \nexclusion to commodities transactions. Yet the exemption in the current \nlaw for trades in over-the-counter energy derivatives, the Enron \nexemption, somehow or another got inserted in that law at the eleventh \nhour during a House-Senate conference. This exemption was never \nconsidered by any committee. It was never discussed at any hearing. It \nwas never commented on by interested parties. It was simply inserted in \nthe conference report at the last minute. It is one of the reasons for \nthe Enron mess that we have had to clean up after.\n  This amendment would correct that situation. It is essential we have \nthis kind of transparency regulation in the commodities markets. I hope \nthis amendment, which is a bipartisan amendment, will be adopted by \nthis body and close the Enron loophole which was created in the dark of \nnight, without any debate in this body, without any knowledge of this \nbody, in a bill which this body had passed without such an exemption, \nin a bill which the House had passed without such an exemption, and yet \nthe exemption showed up nonetheless in a conference report and helped \nto create the Enron disaster and mess which we have been trying to \nclean up ever since.\n   Exempting energy commodity trades from the CEA did not make sense \nwhen it happened in 2000. It would be irresponsible to continue it now, \nespecially after we have seen how it facilitated the market fraud and \nmanipulation by Enron and others.\n   The amendment before us would return the commodities law to the way \nit was for decades prior to the passage of the Enron exemption. It \nwould ensure that fraud and price manipulation would be a felony, and \nit would remove ``the Enron exemption'' as a shield against regulation \nand prosecution. It would authorize the CFTC to establish recordkeeping \nrequirements to enforce the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation \nprohibitions in the CEA.\n   This amendment also contains important provisions to improve FERC's \nability to ensure the transparency and integrity of wholesale energy \nprices. It would direct FERC to establish an electronic price reporting \nsystem, strengthen the penalties for violations of the Federal Power \nAct and the Natural Gas Act, prohibit wash trading and other collusive \nand manipulative practices in wholesale energy markets, and clarify \nFERC's authority to fashion appropriate remedies in cases of wholesale \nprice manipulation.\n   There is a great deal of support for this legislation.\n   Governor Jennifer Granholm, of my home State of Michigan, writes \nthat, in the aftermath of the massive electricity blackouts that struck \nMichigan and large areas of the midwest and northwest this past summer, \n``all necessary steps should be taken to bolster business and consumer \nconfidence in the Nation's energy markets and promote additional \ninvestment in reliable energy delivery at a fair price.'' Governor \nGranholm says our language ``would improve energy price transparency in \nwholesale electricity markets, greatly increase criminal and civil \npenalties for trading violations, prohibit market manipulation and \nfraud in all energy market sectors, and strengthen day-to-day energy \nmarket oversight, including over-the-counter market transactions that \nsignificantly affect energy prices.''\n   The American Public Gas Association supports the amendment because \n``it will improve market transparency and provide the essential \nregulatory oversight to detect and prevent manipulation and improve the \nefficiency of energy markets.''\n   Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, from the State of New York, urges \nswift\n\n[[Page S13966]]\n\nadoption of the amendment, writing that ``the amendment closes \nloopholes used to manipulate energy markets, improves the ability to \ndetect fraud and other manipulation, and deters manipulation by \nestablishing substantive penalties.''\n   The North American Securities Administrators Association, the \nassociation representing the securities administrators of the 50 \nStates, supports this amendment because it ``would provide more \ntransparency to the wholesale electricity markets, supply the CFTC with \nthe authority to detect fraud and manipulation, and help to deter \nwrongdoing by significantly increasing the penalties for violations of \nthe Federal Power Act.''\n   Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America, Public Citizen, \nand the U.S. Public Interest Research Group support this amendment. \nThey state it ``would go a long way towards addressing the serious \nproblems plaguing the Nation's energy markets.''\n   The Derivatives Study Center comments that ``this important \nlegislation will assure that [energy commodities] will be covered by \nFederal prohibitions or fraud and manipulation. . . . It will subject \n[energy] derivatives to some of the same regulations that apply to \nsecurities, banking, exchange-traded futures and options and other \nsectors of U.S. financial markets.''\n   The National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates writes \nthat this legislation ``will help fix broken energy markets and given \nregulators the tools needed to protect consumers from market \nmanipulators.''\n   One hundred and fifty years of history of our commodity markets \ndemonstrates that market integrity and investor confidence will not \nmagically spring up in markets that have been tainted by manipulation. \nThat same history shows that fair and efficient markets do not emerge \nby themselves. Rather, regulation and oversight are necessary to ensure \nthat markets are fair and efficient. Without fair and efficient, and \nthat means transparent, energy markets consumers will pay higher prices \nfor energy products, capital will be misallocated, and out national \neconomy and energy security will be harmed.\n   This history also shows that a legal prohibition against commodity \nmarket manipulation, without more, does not deter or prevent \nmanipulation. Continuous market disclosure and oversight are essential \nto halt manipulation before economic damage is inflicted upon the \nmarket and the public. This is why a major portion of the CFTC's budget \nand resources is devoted to oversight of the futures markets.\n   Although some enforcement actions have been brought following the \nmanipulation of the western markets, these enforcement actions will do \nlittle to make whole the consumers and businesses that suffered \nbillions of dollars in losses from those misdeeds. It would be far \nbetter to ensure that such abuses do not occur in the first place, \nrather than rely on the hope that a few of the manipulators are caught \nafter the fact.\n   We cannot afford to have more Enrons, more manipulations, more \nfrauds, and more flight of capital in the energy sector. It is \nimperative that we restore the integrity and credibility of our energy \nmarkets.\n   Our bipartisan amendment will help create fair and transparent \nenergy markets that investors can trust.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for her tenacity \non this and so many other issues. But in this matter she and her State \nhave suffered firsthand probably more than any other State as a result \nof this Enron loophole which she is so heroically and determinedly \ntrying to close this afternoon.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Michigan. More than just \nthank him, I thank him for his brilliance and for his willingness to be \npart of this effort. I think Senator Levin is really one of the fine \nminds in this Senate. It has been a great delight for me to have the \nopportunity to work with him. I think he has helped us make this a much \nbetter bill. I thank him so much.\n  Mr. President, at this point I would like to read into the Record a \ncolloquy between the two leaders, Senators Frist and Daschle, which \nmakes clear the parameters of this and why we are on the floor on this \nbill. If I may:\n\n       Senator Daschle: Mr. President, Senator Feinstein has a \n     market manipulation amendment that she was seeking a vote on. \n     It is my understanding that the agricultural appropriations \n     bill would be the appropriate bill for that amendment. I \n     would inquire of the majority leader, should she offer her \n     amendment to that bill, would she be assured of a vote on or \n     in relation to her amendment with no second-degree \n     amendments, prior to such vote?\n\n  The majority leader responds:\n\n       The Democratic leader is correct. If Senator Feinstein \n     offers her amendment to that bill, she will get a vote on or \n     in relation to it.\n\n  I just offer that to clarify the present legal situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I \ncompliment her and I compliment Senator Levin on this work. I am \npleased to be associated with them in this amendment.\n  I come to this amendment from an experience serving on the \nAgriculture Committee throughout the 27 years of my service in the \nSenate and 6 years as chairman of the committee. The Agriculture \nCommittee spent a great deal of productive time working with the CFTC \nto make certain that the regulatory aspects with regard to trading were \nas strong and as just as possible. We did so, not in a sense of being \npunitive with regard to new markets and new innovations to weigh in on \nhow American enterprise might flourish, but rather to try to give \nconfidence to hundreds of thousands of traders and beyond--the farming \ncommunity in particular--of our country. That was the basis for the \ncreation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. We have had \nrenewals of the CFTC during my tenure, and I believe we have improved \nupon the situation on each occasion.\n  Historically, energy has been exempted from CFTC regulations. I will \nnot attempt to trace the history of why those exemptions occurred. But \nI will say, in the give and take of compromise as the legislation made \nits way through the committees of the House and the Senate, and \nconferences in consultation with the White House, on each occasion in \nwhich energy was about to be incorporated in a regulatory pattern, it \nwas exempted as a final compromise in order to gain passage of \nlegislation at one juncture or another. That turned out to be a fatal \nflaw.\n  The testimony before the Agriculture Committee, quite apart from \ntestimony before other committees represented by the Senators here \ntoday, indicated it was not the entirety of the problem but certainly \nan example of the contribution of a very grave set of circumstances in \nwhich traders without particular scruples and with a minimum of \nregulation bankrupted each other, and unfortunately, a good number of \nother innocent parties in the process.\n  Even in the midst of all of this rubble, as we witnessed the whole \nthing collapsing, there were still brave spirits in committee and \nelsewhere who said: ``Let freedom rein; don't regulate anything that \ndoesn't need regulating.'' But, of course, by that time, most of the \nmarket aspects of it--all the electronic aspects of it--the poles and \nthe plugs, had literally been pulled.\n  I do not claim to understand the entirety of the complexities of how \nthose markets work. At some point, if there are not people who can make \ngood trades, you literally pull the plug and stop your electronic \nmechanism and the trading stops, and those who are still on the merry-\ngo-round are out of luck.\n  There has always been the arguments that this is simply a subject for \na few wealthy Americans to consider as they deal with each other. But \nthat is not the case. The principal users of these markets are very \nwealthy people--people who ought to know better and who have proper \nlegal or financial counsel so they don't make mistakes.\n  But there are other people who get involved. The ramifications of the \nenergy markets are not just for private corporations but they branch \nout into services for communities and the governing systems of this \ncountry.\n  I appreciate very much those who will continue to advocate in the \nmidst of all of the devastation which is apparent--and books are now \nbeing written about the difficulties. These books\n\n[[Page S13967]]\n\nwill point out, as some already have, that the President's working \ngroup--whose members testified before the Agriculture Committee several \ntimes when I was chairman--let the markets go without regulation; and \nsaid if you have not regulated at this point, let them alone. I am here \nto advise the President and the member of this working group, that \nthese markets do not work well without public confidence, and without a \ndegree of transparency. If there is anything occurring in American \nfinancial markets now, anything encouraging to investors, it is the \nthought that finally many people in Government have come to their \nsenses and realized a good number of things have been going on to \nundermine confidence in those markets. Those of conservative persuasion \nwho favor the markets and believe markets work, have to take \nresponsibility and make certain they do actually work. In order for \nthem to work, markets must be just, and investors must understand that \nthere are remedies, as opposed to pulling the plug, literally, and \nletting the trades flounder and bankruptcy ensue.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a very serious problem. I appreciate very much \nthe persistence of the Senator from California in insisting that this \nissue needed to be raised again. She has raised it, and this is why I \nhave come to the floor today in support of it.\n  I recognize the atmosphere in which we are involved in trying to come \nto grips with the Agriculture appropriation in such a short time frame. \nIt is a necessity to complete our work.\n  This is not, perhaps, the most conducive manner to study this complex \nsubject matter that Senators might require. However, I simply say, \nduring my chairmanship, the Agriculture Committee studied this issue to \na fault. Beyond circumstances I can control, I was no longer chairman, \nand the issue slid from the agenda. I do recall that we researched the \nissue, brought all the parties together, and held 2 days of study with \nexperts on how future markets work. Many Members came to the conclusion \nthat energy should be included, and it should be reformed. I pray that \nwill occur.\n  The CFTC, I believe, is the logical repository, but I am not \ninsistent upon that. The need for reform is at hand and this amendment \nadvances that ball.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana. He \nhas taken a position based on extraordinary knowledge, having served on \nthat committee for 27 years, having been its chair, having seen what \nhappened with the Commodity Futures Oversight Act.\n  In resisting, as he termed it, the movement just to have anything go, \nlet anything go, if they are not regulated, let it go that way, he \nrealizes the American people are not well served and the investment \ncommunity is not well served when every day you pick up a newspaper and \nsomeone else is being arrested for fraud or manipulation. Our laws can \nprevent that from happening.\n  I thank the Senator very much. You have been terrific. Your support \nis very meaningful to us.\n  I have stated in the Senate numerous times it is the duty of this \nCongress to make sure our regulators have all the authority they need \nto prevent fraud and manipulation in the energy markets. Simply put, \nthis is what our amendment does.\n  Enron remains the perfect example of how the systems were so easily \ngamed. After Enron successfully lobbied for an exemption to the \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000, they and others in the \nenergy sector quickly took advantage of this new freedom by trading \nenergy derivatives absent any transparency and regulatory oversight. In \nother words, in secret. Thus, after the 2000 legislation was enacted, \nEnron began to trade energy derivatives literally without being subject \nto proper regulatory oversight. That is how all these schemes came \nabout. Some hot-shot trader, sitting in front of his computer, found a \nway to evolve a strategy for the fraudulent and manipulative action of \nthe marketplace. They let these various strategies play out.\n  Unlike the NASDAQ, from which timely electronic trade reports are \navailable to the public, even prior to its transparency-enhanced \nreforms in 1997--in 1997, the NASDAQ reformed itself to make their \ntraders more transparent--EnronOnline did not offer timely reporting of \nexecutions. This means EnronOnline provided no data regarding recently \nexecuted transactions. Consequently, even after the trades, basic \nmarket information was not provided to market participants.\n  It should not surprise anyone that without basic transparency, \nwithout the ability to see what is happening, prices would soar. What \ninterests me is they did and yet there is still resistance to this \nlegislation.\n  In 2 years, Enron's derivatives business had been a stand-alone \ncompany. It would have been the 256th largest company in America. That \nyear, according to author Robert Bryce, Enron claimed it made more \nmoney from its derivatives business, $7.23 billion, than Tyson made \nfrom selling chickens. That is huge, if you think about it. Think what \nthat means. This segment of the market in one year made $7 billion and \nnobody knew how. No one knew what the trades were. They were all in \nsecret. Nothing was registered. There was no audit trail. There was no \nantifraud, antimanipulation oversight. Boom. It happened.\n  EnronOnline rapidly became the biggest platform for electronic energy \ntrading. But unlike the regulated exchanges, such as the New York \nMercantile Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the Chicago \nBoard of Trade, EnronOnline was not registered with the CFTC. So Enron \nset its own standards. In other words, it had a very secure, quiet, \nprotected niche on the market.\n  Others have tried to replicate that. The banks, for example, Senator \nLevin said, devised something called the IntercontinentalExchange so \nthey could do the same thing Enron has done. It is wrong.\n  Traders and others in the energy sector came to rely on EnronOnline \nfor pricing information. Yet the company's control over this \ninformation and its ability to manipulate it was tremendous. As author \nRobert Bryce went on to describe--and this is very colorful and true--\nEnron did not just own the casino. On any given deal, Enron could be \nthe house, the dealer, the oddsmaker, and the guy across the table you \nare trying to beat in diesel fuel futures, gas futures, or the \nCalifornia electricity market. You tell me that is a good situation?\n  You tell me this Senate and this Congress should let that happen. We \nshould not. That is just plain wrong. Those who want to protect this \nsecret niche are just dead wrong. It is not in the American people's \ninterest to have a secret trading niche that can be an empire for fraud \nand manipulation. We need to protect consumers from future Enron-like \nscams because they are going to happen.\n  Now, was Enron and its energy derivative trading arm, Enron Online, \nthe sole reason California and the West had an energy crisis? \nAbsolutely not. Was it a continuing factor to the crisis? I certainly \nbelieve that evidence has shown it was.\n  Unfortunately, because of the energy exemptions in the 2000 Commodity \nFutures Modernization Act, which took away the CFTC's authority to \ninvestigate, we may never know for sure. In other words, quite \npurposely, this Congress, in 2000, let this secret world be created and \nsaid: We are going to take energy and metals out of the entire trading \nregulatory structure and we are going to let them go ``on operating'' \non their own, without the proper oversight. That is exactly what \nhappened. It is just plain wrong.\n  I repeat, once again, the amendment we offer will subject electronic \nexchanges such as EnronOnline to the same oversight as other commodity \nexchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York \nMercantile Exchange, and the Chicago Board of Trade--no more, no less. \nWithout this type of legislation, there is insufficient authority to \ninvestigate and prevent fraud and price manipulations since parties \nmaking the trade are not required to keep a record.\n  This amendment is not going to do anything to change what happened in \nCalifornia and the West. That is done. But it does provide the \nnecessary authority for the CFTC to protect other parts of this country \nagainst this kind of thing happening again. And it well could happen.\n\n[[Page S13968]]\n\n  Nobody thought we would ever see the kind of event that blacked out \nmost of the east coast and the Midwest, but we did. Nobody thought we \nwould ever see what happened in the West, but we did. Nobody ever \nthought anybody would come up with schemes like ``Ricochet,'' ``Death \nStar,'' ``Get Shorty,'' ``Fat Boy,'' but they did. Nobody thought they \ncould use them to commit a manipulation of the market, but they did.\n  I will leave you with one fact: The total cost of electricity in \nCalifornia in 2000 was $7 billion. The cost the next year was $28 \nbillion. Does anyone believe that market forces--namely, supply and \ndemand--could account for a 400-percent increase in the cost of \nelectricity in a year? The answer has to be no. The answer has to be \nthat bad things were done.\n  So we have worked on this amendment. I sit on the Energy Committee. I \nhave tried to pay a great deal of attention to these matters, to follow \nthis, and I am absolutely convinced that America and the business \nclimate of America is much better off when things are transparent, when \nthere are records kept, when there is a regulatory authority that can \nsay: Whoa. Something may be going haywire. Let's take a look at it. \nThat is all we do--no more and no less than for any commodity.\n  I wish to say one other thing. A financial derivative is not like an \nenergy derivative. For people to confuse this and say it affects \nfinancial derivatives is not right. Energy is a finite commodity. There \nis a beginning and there is an end, and it is different from a \nfinancial derivative.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time our side has remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 32 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you. I retain the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield half an hour to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Just a moment, Mr. President. I was unaware that the Senator from \nMississippi was on the floor. He was hiding behind me. So I yield 15 \nminutes to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank the chairman \nvery much for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. President, the Feinstein amendment suggests a significant change \nin the regulatory regime that exists today for energy markets.\n  My understanding of the Senator's amendment is that it would, for the \nfirst time, require regulation of off-exchange energy derivatives. \nThese complex instruments, used to transfer risk among sophisticated \ntraders, are vital tools in today's energy trading environment.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission exempted off-exchange energy \nderivatives from regulation in 1993. The Congress codified this \nexemption, largely without change, as part of the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act of 2000. The Congress considered regulating off-\nexchange energy derivatives when it debated the modernization act but \nchose not to do so because of the disruption new burdensome regulation \nwould cause to these sophisticated traders.\n  Senators should remember that the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia initially offered an amendment similar to the one before us \ntoday during last year's Senate debate on the Energy bill. On April 10, \n2002, the Senate voted 48 to 50 not to invoke cloture on this initial \nversion of the Feinstein amendment. Senator Feinstein tried again with \na new version of her amendment in June of this year, again during \ndebate on the Energy bill. On June 11, 2003, the Senate tabled this \namendment by a vote of 55 to 44. It should be noted that the second \nversion of her amendment received four fewer votes than the first \nversion. Now we have before us a third version of the Feinstein \namendment.\n  Senators may remember from the debate last summer on the second \nversion of the Feinstein amendment that I read into the Record a June \n11, 2003, letter from the President's Working Group on Financial \nMarkets. In that letter, Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal \nReserve; John Snow, Secretary of the Treasury; William Donaldson, \nChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and James Newsome, \nChairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, all expressed \nopposition to the Feinstein amendment.\n  The letter warned that the Feinstein amendment would have significant \nunintended consequences for this important risk management market. It \nalso pointed out that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has \nbrought formal legal actions against Enron, Dynegy, and El Paso for \nmarket manipulation, wash--or round-trip--trades, false reporting of \nprices, and operation of illegal markets.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, and the Department of Justice have also initiated formal \nactions in the energy sector. Some of these actions have already \nresulted in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and make \nclear that wrongdoers in the energy markets are fully subject to the \nexisting enforcement authority of Federal regulators.\n  To my knowledge, the President's working group has not changed its \nposition on this latest version of the proposal of the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Finally, the Feinstein amendment may create regulatory uncertainty \nfor off-exchange energy derivatives from multiple Federal agencies. On \none hand, the amendment before us requires the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission to regulate off-exchange energy market derivative \ntransactions. However, the amendment also contains a provision that \nappears to preserve the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's \nauthority in this market. At a minimum, the amendment appears to muddy \nthe regulatory water with respect to this market.\n  Remember, the CFTC has antifraud authority. It has brought legal \nactions against Enron, El Paso, Dynergy, and others regarding energy \nmarket problems. It has recovered millions of dollars in fines from \nthese companies. It has numerous ongoing investigations in this area. \nAnd more charges are possible. The Senator from California has said \nthat her amendment is needed to prevent wash trades. The CFTC has wash \ntrade authority. It has specific authority under section 4 of the CEA. \nThe CFTC has brought several wash trade actions in the last several \nyears, and its authority to do so has been upheld recently by two U.S. \nappeals courts. Just this year, the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission has recovered tens of millions of dollars from merchant \nenergy traders for wash trades and false trades.\n  It has also been suggested by the Senator that because exempt \ncommercial markets such as the InterContinentalExchange are exempt from \nregulation under the Commodity Exchange Act that they have no \nregulatory oversight. These markets are subject to many regulatory \nrequirements. They are required by statute to have an electronic audit \ntrail. They are required by statute to keep records for 5 years. They \nare subject to antifraud and antimanipulation authority under the \nCFTC's jurisdiction. They are subject to special call examinations by \nthe commission as well.\n  This amendment would impose large trader reporting on exempt \ncommercial markets. Large trader reporting works on retail futures \nexchanges with standardized contracts but wouldn't work on exempt \ncommercial markets which do not have the same type of standardization. \nLarge trader reporting on exempt commercial markets could actually lead \nto misleading information being provided to the public. Large trader \nreporting is used for market surveillance in retail futures markets.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's statutory authority for \nexempt commercial markets is after-the-fact antifraud and \nantimanipulation enforcement and is, therefore, inconsistent with a \nlarge trader reporting scheme.\n  For these reasons, which I think are very compelling, the Senate \nshould reject this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the text of a letter \nthat went out to all Senators signed by myself, Senator Pete Domenici, \nSenator Mike Crapo, and Senator Zell Miller on this subject, along with \nenclosures which are letters addressed to Senators Crapo and Miller \nfrom the Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System,\n\n[[Page S13969]]\n\nsigned by John W. Snow, Alan Greenspan, William Donaldson, and James E. \nNewsome, along with a Department of the Treasury letter, dated \nSeptember 18, 2002, to these same two Senators, Mr. Crapo and Mr. \nMiller.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Oppose Feinstein Derivatives Amendment to Agriculture Appropriations \n                                  Bill\n\n       Dear Colleague: We are writing to express our opposition to \n     the Feinstein Derivatives Amendment to the Agriculture \n     Appropriations bill. This amendment has been defeated twice \n     before on a motion to invoke cloture in April 2002 (48-50) \n     and most recently on a motion to table in June 2003 (55-44).\n       The amendment before us today is an up or down vote. The \n     amendment would significantly modify portions of the \n     Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA) and re-\n     introduce legal uncertainties into derivatives markets. It is \n     our understanding that the amendment's goal is to provide \n     additional regulatory oversight to the over-the-counter (OTC) \n     energy derivatives markets in light of the California energy \n     crisis and Enron's bankruptcy; however to date, there is no \n     evidence that derivatives caused either crisis.\n       Attached please find copies of two letters from the \n     President's Working Group. The 2002 letter discusses reasons \n     why the derivatives amendment is not warranted and urges \n     Congress ``to be aware of the potential unintended \n     consequences of current legislative proposals.'' The 2003 \n     letter discusses all the civil, criminal and enforcement \n     actions taken by the various federal agencies against the \n     wrongdoers in the energy markets since Enron and specifically \n     highlights the CFTC's actions.\n       Finally, the Energy Policy Act of 2003 will address many of \n     the provisions in Senator Feinstein's proposed legislation, \n     including increased protection against fraud and \n     manipulation, which addresses the Enron-On-Line problem, a \n     ban on roundtrip trading, and increased penalties for \n     violations of the Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act. Any \n     attempt to undermine the Energy bill by adding similar \n     provisions to the Agriculture Appropriations legislation is \n     unnecessary and we strongly oppose this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thad Cochran.\n     Mike Crapo.\n     Pete Domenici.\n     Zell Miller.\n       Attachments.\n         Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the \n           Federal Reserve System, U.S. Securities and Exchange \n           Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission,\n                                                    June 11, 2003.\n     Hon. Michael D. Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Zell B. Miller,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Crapo and Miller: Thank you for your letter \n     of June 10, 2003, requesting the views of the President's \n     Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) on proposed Senate \n     Amendment #876 to S. 14, the pending energy bill. As this \n     amendment is similar to a proposed amendment on which you \n     sought the views of the PWG last year, we reassert the \n     positions expressed in the PWG's response dated September 18, \n     2002, a copy of which is enclosed. The proposed amendment \n     could have significant unintended consequences for an \n     extremely important risk management market--serving \n     businesses, financial institutions, and investors throughout \n     the U.S. economy. For that reason, we believe that adoption \n     of this amendment is ill-advised.\n       We would also point out that, since we wrote that letter \n     last year, various federal agencies have initiated actions \n     against wrongdoing in the energy markets. As you note, the \n     CFTC has brought formal actions against Enron, Dynegy, and El \n     Paso for market manipulation, wash (or roundtrip) trades, \n     false reporting of prices, and operation of illegal markets. \n     The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Justice have \n     also initiated formal actions in the energy sector. Some of \n     these actions have already resulted in substantial monetary \n     penalties and other sanctions. These initial actions alone \n     make clear that wrongdoers in the energy markets are fully \n     subject to the existing enforcement authority of federal \n     regulators.\n       The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 brought \n     important legal certainty to the risk management marketplace. \n     Businesses, financial institutions, and investors throughout \n     the economy rely upon derivatives to protect themselves from \n     market volatility triggered by unexpected economic events. \n     This ability to manage risks makes the economy more resilient \n     and its importance cannot be underestimated. In our judgment, \n     the ability of private counterparty surveillance to \n     effectively regulate these markets can be undermined by \n     inappropriate extensions of government regulation.\n           Yours truly,\n     John W. Snow,\n       Secretary, Department of the Treasury.\n     Alan Greenspan,\n       Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n     William H. Donaldson,\n       Chairman, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     James E. Newsome,\n       Chairman, Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the \n           Federal Reserve System, U.S. Securities and Exchange \n           Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission,\n                                               September 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Michael D. Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Zell B. Miller,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Crapo and Miller: In response to your letter \n     of September 13, we write to express our serious concerns \n     about the legislative proposal to expand regulation of the \n     over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets that has recently \n     been proposed by Senators Harkin and Lugar.\n       We believe that the OTC derivatives markets in question \n     have been a major contributor to our economy's ability to \n     respond to the stresses and challenges of the last two years. \n     This proposal would limit this contribution, thereby \n     increasing the vulnerability of our economy to potential \n     future stresses.\n       The proposal would subject market participants to \n     disclosure of proprietary trading information and new capital \n     requirements. We do not believe a public policy case exists \n     to justify this governmental intervention. The OTC markets \n     trade a wide variety of instruments. Many of these are \n     idiosyncratic in nature. These customized markets generally \n     do not serve a significant price discovery function for non-\n     participants, nor do they permit retail investors to \n     participate. Public disclosure of pricing data for customized \n     OTC transactions would not improve the overall price \n     discovery process and may lead to confusion as to the \n     appropriate pricing for other transactions, as terms and \n     conditions can vary by contract. The rationale for imposing \n     capital requirements is unclear to us, and the proposal's \n     capital requirements also could duplicate or conflict with \n     existing regulatory capital requirements.\n       The trading of these instruments arbitrages away \n     inefficiencies that exist in all financial and commodities \n     markets. If dealers had to divulge promptly the proprietary \n     details and pricing of these instruments, the incentive to \n     allocate capital to developing and finding markets for these \n     highly complex instruments would be lessened. The result \n     would be that the inefficiencies in other markets that \n     derivatives have arbitraged away would reappear.\n       It is also unclear who would benefit from the proposed \n     disclosures and regulations other than whoever simply copied \n     existing products and instruments for their own short-term \n     advantage. Weakening the protection of proprietary \n     intellectual property rights in the market arena would \n     undercut a complex of highly innovative markets that is among \n     this nation's most valuable assets.\n       While the derivatives markets may seem far removed from the \n     interests and concerns of consumers, the efficiency gains \n     that these markets have fostered are enormously important to \n     consumers and to our economy. We urge Congress to protect \n     these markets' contributions to the economy, and to be aware \n     of the potential unintended consequences of current \n     legislative proposals.\n           Yours truly,\n     Paul H. O'Neill,\n       Secretary, Department of the Treasury.\n     Alan Greenspan,\n       Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n     Harvey L. Pitt,\n       Chairman, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     James E. Newsome,\n       Chairman, Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield a half an hour to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to address the Feinstein amendment, \nas the Senator from Mississippi has indicated, for the third occasion \nthat we have debated this issue in this Congress. It is important to \nnote that each time this amendment has been raised, it has been \ndefeated. Each time the amendment has been raised, it has been opposed \nby those in the regulatory community--again as has been indicated by \nthe Senator from Mississippi--whether it be the CFTC, the Department of \nthe Treasury, the Board\n\n[[Page S13970]]\n\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve, or others. The fact is that \nconsistently those who are in charge of regulating, overseeing, and \nmanaging our economy and our financial markets have been opposed to \nthis amendment. The question that we must ask ourselves is, Why?\n  To do so it is important to go back over the history of this act. The \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act that we are debating is one with \nwhich we have had a long history of dealing in this Congress. In fact, \nbefore 2000, when President Clinton was in office, a President's \nworking group was established which brought together experts from \nacross the industry, not only those who were in the financial \nindustries, but those who were regulating the financial industries, \nthose we have already mentioned. The Secretary of the Treasury, the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, the Board of the Federal Reserve, \nand others were a part of this Presidential working group. Those who \nwere involved in this Presidential working group looked at all the \ndifferent commodities that we deal with, the different types of manners \nin which we deal with these commodities, and came up with an approach \nto how we should reform and modernize our law to best take advantage of \nthe types of trading contexts or trading ideas that were utilized in \nthe management and trading of commodities.\n  It is a difficult subject to talk about because it is so complicated. \nThe bottom line is that this act was then put forward. It was brought \nforward on a bipartisan basis in Congress, studied extensively by \ncongressional committees after the Presidential committee brought \nforward its recommendations. And in the year 2000, reforms of the act \nwere implemented.\n  The amendment seeks to change the structure of regulation that this \nact established. The first time this challenge to the act was brought \nforward, we had occasion to have Mr. Greenspan before the Banking \nCommittee. Mr. Greenspan was asked in his testimony what the proposed \namendment would mean and what this concept of derivatives, that most \npeople in America don't really get very engaged with, meant to our \neconomy. I was the one who asked the question at that time.\n  Mr. Greenspan's answer is very illuminating. He said, in his opinion, \nincreasing the regulation and changing the scheme for regulating the \nmanagement and the trading in derivatives from that which had been put \ntogether by the President's working group and approved by Congress \nwould actually increase the threat to our economy. In fact, he pointed \nout that a very simple way to understand derivatives is that they are a \ntool by which sophisticated participants in the market are able to \nallocate risk so that those who are better able to bear it can pick it \nup, and that by being an instrument or a tool through which we allocate \nrisk in our economy, the American economy actually was able to respond \nmore quickly, more resiliently, and more effectively to the threats \nthat have faced it over the last few years.\n  Had we not had the capacity for derivatives transactions between \nsophisticated buyers, had that been regulated and diminished or pushed \noffshore because the United States chose to regulate it so \naggressively, we would not have had the resilience and the response in \nour economy that we had.\n  We would have had a deeper trough and a more difficult recovery. \nAgain, this amendment seeks to change that regulatory system Congress \nand the President and his working group so carefully put together.\n  How did that act work? Well, the act created three different \ncategories of derivatives transactions. The first category that was \nfully covered and is on an exchange--regulated exchange--where the \nfirst category was the category of agricultural transactions. Those \ntransactions are fully regulated and fully covered under the act.\n  The act identified certain types of transactions that should not be \ncovered at all and should have no regulatory impact. Those were called \nfinancial derivatives. They include things such as treasury bonds, \nforeign exchange, or interest rates--those types of transactions that \noccur in the financial markets, and it was concluded they should not \nhave any regulation. They were simply excluded from the act.\n  A middle category was created for all other kinds of transactions. We \nhave, on the one hand, agricultural transactions, which are fully \ncovered. On the other hand, we have financial transactions, which are \nfully excluded and, in the middle, all other types of commodities, \nwhere the energy transactions fall. It has been argued today that these \nenergy transactions simply are not covered. In fact, the phrase that \nhas been used is one that would imply those engaged in energy \nderivatives transactions simply don't have any regulatory coverage at \nall. The phrase ``let anything go'' has been used, or it has been said \nthere is literally no antifraud or antimanipulation provision or \nprotection in the law regarding these types of transactions. That \nsimply is not the case. This middle type of transaction was not put on \nan exchange because these are not the kinds of transactions that \ngeneral investors in the market get involved with. These are highly \nsophisticated transactions, detailed negotiations between very \nsophisticated buyers and sellers, accomplishing this result which I \ntalked about earlier of trading and exchanging risk. It is done in such \na way that it doesn't effectively work on an exchange. That is why in \nthis middle category the exchange was not included, but regulation for \nprice reporting, antiprice manipulation, antimarket manipulation, and \nantifraud protection was included. So it is simply not correct to say \nthose engaged in energy transactions--derivatives transactions--are not \nsubjected to antifraud, antimanipulation, or price-reporting \nrequirements. They are, which brings to bear the question of why we \nneed to change this system of regulation.\n  Again, on the floor today, as has been the case in the past each time \nwe have debated it, the argument has been made that the Enron \ntransaction or the Enron problem would not have been a problem had we \nhad the aggressive kind of antifraud and antimanipulation this \namendment proposes to create. Well, again, when we have had experts \nbefore us, and as has been said on the floor already by others, the \nAgriculture Committee and other committees have studied this very \ncarefully. The experts have said to us there is no indication the lack \nof regulatory authority, if such exists, was any cause for what \nhappened with Enron, and the lack of having regulated derivatives \ntransactions, in terms of putting them on an exchange, or failure to \nhave further fraud or antiprice manipulation and enforcement authority, \nwas the cause of what happened with regard to the Enron transaction.\n  As a matter of fact, I asked that same question, when this issue \nfirst came up, to Alan Greenspan. He, among many others, has indicated \nthere is no evidence the failure to have more rigorous regulatory \nschemes in place on derivatives transactions would have stopped Enron \nfrom doing exactly what it did.\n\n  Nobody is saying Enron did not violate the market, that Enron did not \nengage in price manipulation, that Enron did not engage in these wash \ntransactions, that Enron did not engage in fraudulent behavior. The \nfact is, Enron did engage in these types of activities. The fact is the \nCFTC is currently investigating and enforcing its antifraud and \nantimanipulation enforcement authority against Enron and others in the \nmarket who might engage in these types of activities.\n  The point is, as we proceed, we must understand whether what happened \nin terms of the Enron circumstance was as a result of the law not being \nstrong enough or was simply the result of the fact that Enron violated \nthe law. The fact is Enron did violate the law, those violations are \nbeing identified, and something over $90 million in fines and penalties \nagainst Enron and other market violators have already been enforced.\n  Again, the point is enforcement is occurring. Why should we be \nconcerned about adding a further regulatory scheme on top of that which \nis already in place? It gets back to the point Alan Greenspan made in \nthat first hearing, where I first asked him about the issue; that is, \nwe have a need in this country for resilience in our marketplace, in \nterms of allocation of risk.\n  Our management of derivatives is critical in terms of how well we\n\n[[Page S13971]]\n\nachieve that objective. If we want to increase the regulatory burden \nand increase the potential of diminishing our ability in the market to \nhave the benefit of these very important types of transactions, then we \nbetter have a very good reason for doing so. If we want to have the \nbenefit of a resilient marketplace, where derivatives transactions can \noccur between sophisticated buyers and sellers, then we want to be very \ncareful about how we regulate it or overregulate it.\n  I agree with anybody who says we want to make sure there should be \nantiprice manipulation or antifraud provisions in place. We should have \nthose kinds of protections in place. But we should be very careful \nthat, as we implement this type of regulatory scheme, we don't drive \noffshore derivatives transactions or cause a loss of resilience in our \nmarketplace because we overregulate these important transactions.\n  I note the chairman is looking to perhaps intervene here to conduct \nother business. I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the Feinstein amendment No. 2083 occur at 2:30 today; \nprovided that no second-degree amendments be in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote, with the time until then equally divided in the \nusual form. I further ask unanimous consent that following that vote, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on passage of H.R. 2622, the Fair Credit \nReporting bill. I also ask as in executive session that the Senate then \nproceed to executive session and an immediate vote on the confirmation \nof calendar No. 402, Roger Titus to be U.S. District Judge for the \nDistrict of Maryland; provided further, that following that vote the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate \nthen resume legislative session. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided for debate prior to each of the \nvotes following the first vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend will modify his \nrequest to have the votes following the first vote be 10 minutes in \nlength.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to have the second two votes be 10-minute \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Idaho if he has \nfurther comments.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I do. I will need 3 or 4 or 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield 5 more minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I want to conclude by once again going over \nthe material that has already been put into the record by Senator \nCochran from Mississippi.\n  As I indicated, as we have gone through this battle--now the third \ntime--and the debate over whether we should change the manner in which \nwe address derivatives transactions in this country, each time those \nwho are charged with regulating and overseeing these types of concerns \nhave weighed in in opposition to this amendment. I simply want to go \nthrough some of the points they have made from the materials. Again, \nthey are already a part of the record.\n  The first time we debated this amendment, back in September, a letter \nwas submitted by Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve System, Paul O'Neill from the Department of \nTreasury, Mr. Harvey Pitt, Chairman of the U.S. Security and Exchange \nCommission, and James E. Newsome, Chairman of the CFTC.\n  In their letter at that time, they pointed out that this proposal \nwould subject market participants to disclosure of proprietary trading \ninformation and new capital requirements.\n  The capital requirements, I understand, have been dropped in this \namendment. But as they go forward, they explain they don't believe a \ncase exists in public policy to justify this increased level of \nGovernment intervention.\n  The OTC markets, they state, trade a wide variety of instruments. \nMany of them are idiosyncratic in nature. They are customized markets \nand do not generally serve a significant price discovery function for \nnonparticipants, nor do they permit retail investors to participate.\n  Again, this is not a market in which general investors participate. \nHighly sophisticated investors engage in these transactions. There has \nbeen some debate they have actually created the market through wash \ntransactions and other activity. My point is that type of manipulation, \neither through manipulating a price or through other activities, such \nas wash trades, is already regulatable and being addressed by the CFTC.\n  They go on to make the point: The trading of these instruments \narbitrages away the inefficiencies that exist in all financial and \ncommodities markets, and that we should not cause increased regulatory \nburdens on those important functions in our economy.\n  Then again in June, when we addressed this issue last, the same group \nresponded again to the same proposal. They wanted to point out then \nthat with regard to the argument there was all of this bad activity \ntaking place and we needed to pass new laws to stop this bad activity, \nthe same group of regulators--the Treasury, the Federal Reserve System, \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, and the CFTC--stated they have \nbrought formal actions against Enron, Dynegy, and El Paso for market \nmanipulation, wash or roundtrip trades, false reporting of prices, and \noperation of illegal markets, and these actions have already resulted \nin substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.\n  Again, the point there is, as I made earlier, that we are enforcing \nthe existing regime.\n  Lastly, if there is still concern that we don't have enough \nprotection in the law, our current chairman of the Energy Committee, \nSenator Pete Domenici, and those who are working with him from the \nAgriculture Committee, and others are beefing up those protections in \nthe current law.\n  A letter which, again, the Senator from Mississippi has already put \nin the Record, coming from Senator Cochran, myself, Senator Domenici, \nand Senator Miller, explains that the Energy Policy Act, which we are \nnow working through in conference, will contain increased protection \nagainst fraud and price manipulation which addresses the EnronOnline \nproblems that have been raised by the Senator from California.\n  Even if the current situation in the law was not already \nsatisfactory, we are increasing the antifraud and antimanipulation \nprovisions to make certain that any concerns about this possibility \noccurring again are addressed as we focus the regulation without trying \nto do something to our derivatives markets that would cause a reduction \nin the resiliency of U.S. markets.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2084\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Kohl and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Is this meant to be an amendment to my amendment?\n  Mr. BENNETT. No, the unanimous consent agreement, I say to the \nSenator from California, is that no second-degree amendments are in \norder to her amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. This is a freestanding amendment separate and apart. If \nthe Senator from California prefers, I can wait until after the vote to \noffer this amendment. This is a housekeeping action.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator be quick? I want to address some of \nthe comments that have been made.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will, indeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the consideration of the \namendment?\n  Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], for himself and Mr. \n     Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 2084.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S13972]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 79, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following new \n     section:\n       ``Sec.  . Statements made by the Chairman and/or Ranking \n     Member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, and \n     colloquies engaging the Chairman and/or Ranking Member of the \n     Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, given on the Senate \n     Floor or submitted for the Record during Senate consideration \n     of this Act shall be deemed part of Senate Committee Report \n     108-107 for purposes of conference with the House of \n     Representatives.''.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, this amendment provides that statements \nmade by Senator Kohl and myself, as well as colloquies we have with our \ncolleagues during consideration of this bill would be germane for \nconference with the House. I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2084) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2083\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to try to respond to some \nof the comments that have been made.\n  I believe the CFTC has antifraud and antimanipulation oversight on \nfutures exchanges but not on over-the-counter energy trades. That is \nthe difference here. We would cover over-the-counter energy trades and \nparticularly those trades that are electronic.\n  I also want to show where existing law is inadequate. There is a case \nthat has just been brought to my attention which I think shows that the \nexisting law is inadequate, and this is what we are trying to fix.\n  Two energy traders from the energy firms Dynegy and El Paso were \ncharged by the U.S. Government with reporting false information on a \nnumber of trades--at least 48 trades. They falsely reported the number \nand the prices used in trades they conducted involving natural gas in \nan attempt to influence the natural gas spot price indices.\n  The Federal indictment charged them, among other matters, with wire \nfraud and violation of the Commodity Exchange Act, which is what we are \ntalking about, provisions prohibiting price manipulation and \ndissemination of false information about energy commodity rates.\n  The Federal court allowed the wire fraud charges, but it dismissed \nthe Commodity Exchange Act charges on the ground that the wording of \nthe act failed to prohibit persons from knowingly providing false \ninformation. While the CEA used the word ``knowingly'' in an earlier \npart of the provision, the court ruled that the word had to be repeated \nin the section prohibiting false information.\n  The Feinstein-Lugar-Levin amendment would clarify the wording of the \nCEA provision to resolve the problem identified by this Federal \ndistrict court in the case of the United States of America v. Michelle \nValencia, Criminal Action No. 8-03-024.\n  That is a pretty clear indication of where present law is not \nadequate. These were bogus trades. These trades never took place. There \nwere totally bogus, and yet the wording in the Commodity Exchange Act, \nwhich we are trying to fix, was judged by the court as too vague to \ntake any action.\n  Second, I want to make this point: What we are trying to do is \nprevent fraud and manipulation. We are trying to prevent it and deter \nit from happening. The soft penalties we have now don't prevent it. \nThat should be very clear. We toughen the penalties in the Electricity \nAct and in the National Gas Act. Clearly, a number of these schemes \nthat Enron practiced, whether it was Death Star, Ricochet, or Black \nWidow, or any of these other terrible schemes, took place. Our bill \nwould specifically prevent them.\n  We are trying to prevent and deter, and the way we do that is by \nstrengthening the law.\n  I am really puzzled by the administration's position. I am really \npuzzled because it seems to me they should be on the side of the \nAmerican people, not on the side of the traders and those who want to \nget rich quick from this open marketplace.\n  Additionally, it is interesting to me that the President's working \ngroup, when it came out in 1999, specifically said:\n  ``Due to the characteristics of markets for nonfinancial commodities \nwith finite supplies''--that is energy--``however, the working group is \nunanimously recommending that the exclusion''--the exclusion from the \nbill--``not be extended to agreements involving such commodities.''\n  So beginning in the year 2000, they have done a total switch and I do \nnot understand why, particularly after the events of 2000 and 2001, \nwhere we know fraud and manipulation was explicit. Now when the \nGovernment tries to go after two companies for bogus trades, a court \nfinds the Commodities Exchange Act is inadequate; it is vague.\n  Why would people oppose what we are trying to do? I think we are on \nthe side of the angels.\n  Let me quickly go over some points. Why do we need this legislation? \nWe need it because companies are now permitted to trade large amounts \nof energy in virtually unregulated markets, which makes it easier for \nunscrupulous companies such as Enron to manipulate the price of energy. \nThe bill would close the Enron loophole that allows this unregulated \ntrading.\n  Secondly, do we have any examples of how these markets have been \nmanipulated? FERC recently released a 1-inch thick report on how the \nmarkets for electricity and natural gas in the western United States \nwere manipulated in 2000 and 2001. So we know it happened. The FERC \nfound Enron and other companies lied about the prices of their trades, \nreported fictitious trades to drive up prices, did wash trades with \neach other, and engaged in rapid trading to drive prices up and then \nback down, reaping millions of dollars of profits in the process and \ncosting customers billions of dollars in unjustified energy costs. That \nis according to FERC. That is a finding in their study. Yet people \nstill oppose this legislation. Unbelievable.\n  Would this legislation have prevented these manipulations? Under \ncurrent law, the CFTC is totally in the dark about what goes on in the \nover-the-counter markets. Under this legislation, manipulation in these \nmarkets would be a felony and the CFTC would get reports about large \ntrades in the over-the-counter markets, so it would be able to monitor \nthese markets, something it cannot do now. Should anybody be able to \nescape from ongoing monitoring of what they do in these markets, big \ntraders? I do not think so. Yet they are in this little loophole that \nwas created. That was the purpose of the loophole, to prevent anybody \nfrom looking; keep no records. Therefore, they are not going to be able \nto catch us, and there will be a weak law so it will not be sustained \nin court when they try to bring a case.\n  Another question: Enron is bankrupt. A number of traders have been \nfined and energy trading is back on the rise. The marketplace seems to \nbe correcting itself. Why is this legislation needed?\n  It is needed to avoid more problems like we have just had. Although \neverything mentioned in the question I just asked may be true, there is \none other significant fact. The consumers and businesses that paid \nhigher prices have only recovered a small fraction of their losses. It \nis better to prevent the manipulation and the losses from happening \nthan try to make up for them after they take place. That is the point. \nWhat our agencies have shown is there is, up to this point at least, no \nway for an aggrieved marketplace to recover its losses from fraud and \nany manipulation. Therefore, it should be our job to see the laws are \naccurate and in place to prevent this kind of activity from taking \nplace in the beginning. That is where increasing the penalties comes \nin.\n\n  Imagine, a $2,000 penalty for doing this. That is nothing. That is \nnot even a slap on the wrist for multibillion-dollar companies.\n  How does one respond to the concerns that this legislation will \nincrease costs and uncertainty and scare off investment in the energy \nmarkets? It will not. The regulated U.S. commodities\n\n[[Page S13973]]\n\nmarkets are the most successful and reliable in the world. Ever since \nthe agricultural exchanges were first regulated, we have heard dire \npredictions from commodities traders that regulation will drive \nbusiness overseas. In fact, the opposite has happened. We have seen a \nflight to quality as investors seek safe and reliable markets. That is \na fact. This helps the market.\n  Many traders and energy companies have said the actual cost of \ncompliance with this legislation will be minimal.\n  The final question: Why should energy derivatives be regulated \ndifferently or more stringently than financial derivatives? Because we \ndo not touch financial derivatives. Mr. Greenspan, please know that.\n  The price of energy derivatives can be manipulated by manipulating \nthe supply of the underlying energy commodity. The price of financial \nderivatives is very difficult to manipulate because it is difficult to \nmanipulate the price of financial measures underlying the instruments, \nwhich generally are not commodities but abstract financial measures \nsuch as interest rates and currency exchange rates.\n  Then again, in 1999, the President's working group saw this. They \nrecommended they not put energy into the loophole. The Congress saw \ndifferently and put energy into this loophole, and the never-never land \nof secrecy went on. These bogus trades were enabled. These bogus trades \ntook place.\n  There are cases being brought, and we are even finding that the law \nis inadequate because a court has said it is too vague. We correct \nthat.\n  I think this is really an important amendment. I do not think I could \nlive with myself if I did not try to do it. If we lose today, believe \nme, I will come back again and again, because we saw what happened. We \nknow there was massive fraud and manipulation. We know the loophole was \nthere. We know there is no transparency, no record, no audit trail, and \nno antifraud and antimanipulation oversight for any over-the-counter \nenergy trade. That is what we are trying to do.\n  My colleagues have referred to futures exchanges rather than over-\nthe-counter energy trades, and that is what we are referring to in this \nbill. Please, I know back here people look at the West and they say, \naha, it is not us, but what I say to them is some day it could be them. \nDo they not want the law right? Do they not want to be protected? Do \nthey not want a record kept so the regulatory agency can look at it? I \nreally hope the answer is yes, and I hope this Senate will vote for \nthis amendment.\n  If there are no further comments, I will yield the remainder of my \ntime. If there are, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand there will be a response on \nthis side so I would recommend to the Senator from California that she \nhang on to all the cards she has.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I will do that.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to respond to some of the \npoints my colleague from California has made and try to further clarify \nsome of these issues. It appears there may be a difference of \nunderstanding between us as to just what the CFTC actually has \njurisdictional authority over. My colleague from California has \nindicated that the antifraud and antimanipulation provisions in the \nCommodities Futures Modernization Act do not apply to over-the-counter \ntrades. My understanding is very different from that. In fact, it is my \nunderstanding that the CFTC has antimanipulation authority that allows \nthe Commission to obtain books and records from any market participant \nwhen the CFTC believes the prices are being manipulated. In fact, as I \nhad indicated in my previous comments, enforcement authority with \nregard to market manipulation and price manipulation is being \nundertaken with regard to Enron.\n  The question here is whether there is a standardized set of books and \nrecords that are required of each participant. In that case, that is \ncorrect; the act does not put the full level of regulation onto those \nin the energy derivatives markets, only on agricultural commodities. So \nthat might be the difference we are talking about. But the fact is, the \ndistinction here is whether there is an exchange type of document \ndisclosure as opposed to simply the type of document disclosure that \nthe CFTC can ask for if it is investigating alleged price manipulation.\n  Second, the Senator from California indicated that she believed the \npenalties were too soft, and her legislation addressed that issue. I \nsuppose there is not a lot of disagreement. I have not really talked \nwith other Members of the Senate about it. I don't know if there is a \nlot of disagreement in strengthening the penalties, but that is not \nreally all this amendment does. In fact, it is not really the focus of \nthis amendment. What this amendment does, as I said before, is it \nincreases and creates an entirely new regulatory regime for the \nmanagement of derivatives transactions in energy.\n  I think this next point is a very critical point that we need to \naddress. The Senator from California said in 1999 the working group \nsaid that energy transactions should not be excluded from the act. I am \nnot familiar with the exact quotation or document that is being \nreferred to there. But if the word ``excluded'' is the word the \nPresident's working group used, then that makes sense because, as I \nsaid earlier in my remarks, the act that we established after the \nPresident's working group went through its analysis created three \ndifferent categories: Those that were included, those that were \nexcluded, and those that were exempted. Why they use the word \n``exempted'' as opposed to some other category, I don't know. But there \nis a real distinction in this law between the word ``excluded,'' which \nmeans they are not covered, and the word ``exempted,'' which means they \nare not required to be registered on an exchange.\n  Those that are in the exempted category are not excluded, which is \nwhat the 1999 working group apparently recommended for energy. Energy \ntransactions in derivatives are not excluded, they are exempted, which \nmeans they, along with every other commodity transaction except for \nagricultural and financial transactions, are required to be subject to \nthe reporting and investigatory antifraud and antimanipulation \nprovisions of the act. That is what we are debating here.\n  Finally, the Senator from California mentioned a case where the court \ndid say there was a sufficient lack of clarity in the act that it could \nnot be enforced against knowing and willful conduct. That is correct. \nThat case, to my knowledge, is one of the only, if not the only, case \nin the country where there has ever been a court ruling that did not \ngive the CFTC the authority it needs to go after this type of conduct.\n  As I indicated in my earlier remarks, the Energy bill, which we are \nnow putting together in the Energy conference, is correcting the \nproblem that came up with that case. I actually have the language in \nfront of me that is being changed in the law to address the concern \nraised by that case.\n  So because there is a case where the court said the language needs to \nbe tightened up a little bit, that does not mean we then need to create \na whole new regulatory regime for the management of derivatives. What \nit means is we need to correct that problem that the case law pointed \nout in the statute to be sure that the antifraud and antimanipulation \nlanguage is able to be enforced as we intended it to be. That is \nexactly what the chairman of the Energy Committee and the others of us \nwho submitted this letter have stated is being corrected in the Energy \nbill.\n\n  Then just one final comment. There was some question as to whether \nMr. Greenspan or those of us on this side were making a distinction \nbetween financial derivatives or energy derivatives. I can assure those \nwho were involved in the debate on all sides that Chairman Greenspan, \nas well as the rest of us, understand that we are talking about \ndifferent types of derivatives when we talk about financial derivatives \nor energy derivatives or agricultural derivatives or other types of \ntransactions in these commodities. The fact is, whether it is \nagriculture or energy or financial or other types of commodities, the \nmanner in which we regulate them has incredible impacts on the way in \nwhich the markets operate.\n\n[[Page S13974]]\n\n  I will conclude my remarks at this time by asking unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record a letter which was delivered to me today, \nagain by Alan Greenspan, responding this third time to the issue, and \ndiscussing the reasons our market needs to retain its resilience as we \ndeal with the management of different types of very sophisticated \ntransactions like these derivatives transactions.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Board of Governors,\n\n\n                                       Federal Reserve System,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Michael D. Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: You have asked me for my views on Senator \n     Feinstein's latest proposal for additional regulation of \n     energy derivatives. By imposing large trader reporting \n     requirements on bilateral transactions in energy commodities, \n     the proposal would take the first steps toward introduction \n     of an ex ante prophylactic regulatory regime for the OTC \n     energy derivatives markets. Such a regime would undermine \n     market discipline to the extent that market participants come \n     to depend on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) \n     to protect their interests and therefore fail to do more to \n     protect themselves. Reliance on market discipline rather than \n     government regulation has allowed derivatives markets to \n     allocate risks very flexibly and effectively, which has \n     contributed importantly to the resiliency of our financial \n     system and our economy.\n       In my view, concerns about market manipulation in the \n     energy derivatives markets would be addressed more \n     effectively by a combination of: (1) enhanced market \n     discipline on the processes through which price data are \n     gathered and price indexes are constructed, and (2) more \n     vigorous exercise of the CFTC's existing ex post enforcement \n     authority with respect to market manipulation. Some \n     clarification of the CFTC's enforcement authority would be \n     desirable, but it is not at all clear that the provisions in \n     the proposed amendment are the best way to accomplish that \n     goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alan Greenspan.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. With that, I withhold my further remarks. I suspect we may \nneed to get into a little bit of debate on these issues, and that may \nhelp us to bring focus on what the differences and concerns we have \nare. But I withhold further remarks at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to respond to the \nSenator. I think this discussion is constructive and I am pleased to \npartake in this exchange with my good friend from Idaho.\n  This is a report entitled ``The Over-the-Counter Derivatives Market \nin the Commodity Exchange Act'' which was written by the President's \nworking group on financial markets in 1999.\n  On page 16 of that report, it goes on to say--and I want to read it \nin its context:\n\n       Due to the characteristics of markets for nonfinancial \n     commodities with finite supplies--\n\n  Which energy would be one--\n\n     the working group is unanimously recommending that the \n     exclusion--\n\n  In other words, the loophole--\n\n     not be extended to agreements involving such commodities. For \n     example, in the case of agricultural commodities, production \n     is seasonal and volatile and the underlying commodity is \n     perishable, factors that make the markets for these products \n     susceptible to supply and pricing distortions and to \n     manipulation. There have also been several well known efforts \n     to manipulate the prices of certain metals by attempting to \n     corner the cash or futures markets. Moreover, the cash market \n     for many nonfinancial commodities is dependent on the futures \n     market for price discovery. The CFTC, however, should retain \n     its authority to grant exemptions for derivatives involving \n     nonfinancial commodities as it did in 1993 for energy \n     products, where exemptions are in the public interest and \n     otherwise consistent with the Commodities Exchange Act.\n\n  Then the loophole was promulgated. The section of the Commodities \nExchange Act which contains that loophole is section 2(g) and is \ntitled, ``Excluded Swap Transactions.''\n  The section reads, No provision of this Act (other than section 5a \n(to the extent provided in sections 5a(g)), 5b, 5d, or 12(e)(2) shall \napply to or govern any agreement, contract or transaction in a \ncommodity other than an agricultural commodity if agreement, contract \nor transaction is . . .\n  And then it goes on.\n  This section in the Commodities Exchange Act is what creates the \nloophole, and that is the problem that we are trying to correct in this \nlegislation. I believe we do correct it.\n  Again, it is very hard for me--and this might have something to do \nwith the fact we went thorough it the west--to understand why we would \nnot want to deter this activity and strengthen the rules to prohibit \nsuch manipulation from happening in the future.\n  We want to be very certain that with all of this kind of trading, \nincluding over the counter trades and electronic trades, that the \nrecords are kept and there is an audit trail clearly exists and there \nis an opportunity for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to note \nsomething may be wrong and hold the proper investigation. This is no \nmore and no less than what exists on the exchange today.\n  Why should this secret world of trading be allowed to exist? I know \npeople get rich through it. This secret trading world allows people to \nget rich by engaging in fraudulent trades, as was seen during the \nWestern energy crisis. It is this type of manipulative behavior that we \nare trying to stop.\n  I can't understand why the administration would not want to support \nthis. When Mr. Greenspan came in and talked to me a few years ago when \nwe first proposed this legislation, his main concern was financial \nderivatives. This is why we made certain, as I have said in my \ncomments, that this legislation does not concern financial derivatives. \nHe may well have expanded his view to all kinds of over-the-counter \ntrades since then, but at the time I sat down and met with him, that \nwas not his position.\n  Regardless, we are talking about public policy. We are talking about \nprotecting the people of America. We are talking about strengthening \nthe law so that what happened on the west coast can never happen in the \nMidwest or on the east coast or any part of the nation.\n  I mentioned what the attorney general of the State of New York--the \nattorney general, not a deputy--Mr. Spitzer, has written. Once again, \nlet me read what he said. He is the one who prosecutes many of these \ncases and I really think his views in this area should make a \ndifference.\n  He says:\n\n       I urge your amendment's adoption. In addition to providing \n     wholesale electricity markets, the transparency vital to \n     effective competition, the amendment closes loopholes used to \n     manipulate energy markets. It improves the ability to detect \n     fraud and other manipulation, and it deters manipulation by \n     establishing substantive penalties.\n\n  This is the attorney general of the State of New York who is going to \nbe prosecuting many of these cases. He says it is a wise thing to do, \nit is a prudent thing to do, and you should do it.\n  He also says that this amendment makes a major contribution to \ncompetitive energy markets by initiating an electronic information \nsystem to be operated through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \nI have already talked about this. Earlier, I said how this legislation \nwill provide open access to comprehensive, timely, and reliable \nwholesale electricity and transmission prices. The attorney general \nrepeats that. He says:\n\n       The reliability of market information would be markedly \n     improved by the amendment's--\n\n  Don't we want that? I think so--\n\n     general prohibition on manipulation of the purchase or sale \n     of electricity, or the transmission services needed to \n     deliver electricity and by the specific prohibition of the \n     round trip trading manipulation used so effectively to \n     inflate electricity prices to the public's injury.\n\n  This is the prosecutor in one of the main States that would have this \nkind of litigation.\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       Enforcement of the law and regulation safeguarding our \n     energy markets would be greatly aided by other reforms the \n     amendment provides. The amendment would repeal the so-called \n     Enron exemption which shields large energy traders from \n     oversight.\n\n  Once again, I want to iterate that this is the attorney general of \nNew York speaking.\n\n       In addition, the amendment would apply to anti-manipulation \n     and anti-fraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act--\n\n  I just read to this provision to you. Clearly this section of the Act \nis inadequate by anybody's reading to effectively regulate all energy \ntransactions--\n\n       Our legislation would improve the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission's ability to\n\n[[Page S13975]]\n\n     address complaints, and it would lift the restriction on the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's authority to order \n     refunds. These reforms will make accountable parties, which \n     are currently beyond the law's reach accountable for their \n     actions and will increase recovery of overcharges.\n\n  Once again, I ask, don't we want to do this? Do we really want to \nprotect these people who are willing to do such harmful things to the \nAmerican people?\n  I am shocked at the administration's letter. I thought they were \nthere to protect the public.\n  I thank the Chair. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I yield an additional 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Idaho and allow him to yield back whatever time he might \ndecide not to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you very much, Madam President. I will try to be \nbrief.\n  I wish to respond to what really has become the one focal point in \nthe discussion we have been having over the last few minutes; that is, \nwhether the Commodity Futures Trading Act applies and provides tools to \nprotect against over-the-counter trades and derivatives. There isn't \nany difference between us in regard to that.\n  The Senator from California said: Would we want to protect people who \nwould do all of these bad things? She indicated from the letter she \nread from the attorney general of New York that we were shielding large \nover-the-counter trades from oversight. I will simply say again that \nthis is not the way the laws have been interpreted by the authorities \nof the government who administer this act, and it is not the way the \nlaw has been interpreted by those who were involved in writing the act. \nFrankly, with the exception of one case of a word change correction in \nthe energy conference bill to address the issue--with the exception of \nthat one case, to my knowledge, there is no indication that the CFTC \ndoes not have authority to regulate these trades.\n  Let me go on. I will go back to the letter of June 11. This is a \nletter from the Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve System, the U.S. Securities and Exchange \nCommission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in which they \nstate they were aware that one of the arguments was they do not have \nthe authority or that adequate regulation is not taking place.\n  This is a letter written to me and to Senator Zell Miller, whom I \ncommend for his efforts in this matter. They state in the letter:\n\n       As you know, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has \n     brought formal actions against Enron, Dynegy, and El Paso for \n     market manipulation, wash--roundtrip--trades, false reporting \n     of prices, and operation of illegal markets.\n\n  If they don't have the authority under the act to regulate price \nmanipulation or other market manipulations, then how could they have \nbrought formal actions to enforce it? Not only do they bring formal \nactions but the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, and the Department of Justice have also \ninitiated formal actions in the energy sector.\n  At the time of this letter, which was last June, they indicated:\n\n       Some of these actions have already resulted in substantial \n     monetary penalties and other sanctions. These initial actions \n     alone make clear that wrongdoers in the energy markets are \n     fully subject to the existing enforcement authority of \n     Federal regulators.\n\n  We can debate about whether we should increase the penalties or add \nmore regulations on top of this, but the fact is that under the \nCommodity Futures Trading Act, anti-price-manipulation and other \nantifraud provisions are enforceable.\n  I wish to go back also to one other comment the Senator from \nCalifornia made. She read to us out of the 1999 report of the \nPresident's working group. I listened very carefully to the words she \nwas reading because it is important to understand the usage of words by \nthe President's working group.\n  I will go back again to when the President's working group \nrecommended how to create this statutory system. When Congress adopted \nthat recommendation and made it law, we created three categories--\nincluded, exempted, and excluded. What this working group language \nwhich was read to us said was that due to the characteristics of \nnonfinancial commodities, exclusion was not intended or not \nrecommended.\n  That is exactly, in fact, what we did in the law. We did not exclude \nthe energy sector. We put it in the middle category, which is exactly \nwhere their working report said it should go. It said they should have \nauthority to be exempted. It was put in the ``exempted'' category \nwhich, again, although that exempted word makes it sound as if they are \nexcluded, is not the way the wording of the statute works. The exempted \ncategory is fully subject to antifraud and antiprice manipulation \nprotections and to record-reporting requirements imposed by the CFTC.\n  Again, we may have a difference of opinion on where the reach of the \nlaw is, but the bottom line is the agencies involved in administering \nthese and other laws are fully enforcing the law.\n  I conclude by reading one further letter sent to the Honorable Bill \nFrist and Tom Daschle yesterday by a number of associations. I will \nread the names of the associations. These are not just energy companies \nbut companies, associations, and groups involved with the management of \nour economy from many different perspectives. They point out that the \nPresident's working group's approach, which we have been debating \ntoday, has been applied and that enforcement actions are taking place. \nIn their words:\n\n       These actions make it clear that wrongdoers in the energy \n     markets are fully subject to the significant authority of \n     federal and state authorities.\n\n  Again, in their words:\n\n       Led by the CFTC, federal and state authorities are \n     currently investigating 32 companies and since last year the \n     Commission has entered into six settlements collecting a \n     total of $96 million in civil penalties from energy companies \n     and power merchants for attempting to manipulate energy \n     prices.\n\n  Again, if they do not have the authority to regulate, they are \ncertainly doing a good job of regulating. They have collected over $96 \nmillion in civil penalties and continue to enforce the act.\n  Signers of this letter are: the American Bankers Association, the ABA \nSecurities Association, the Association for Financial Professionals, \nthe Bond Market Association, EMTA, the Financial Services Roundtable, \nthe Foreign Exchange Committee, the Futures Industry Association, the \nInternational Swap and Derivatives Association, the Managed Funds \nAssociation, the National Mining Association, and the Securities \nIndustry Association.\n  I bring that up simply to point out that not only are those agencies \nin our Government--such as the Department of the Treasury and the CFTC \nand the Federal Reserve and others--concerned about this, but those in \nthe industry, those operating in our financial industries are concerned \nabout what this will do to our economy and the resilience of our \nability to manage risk in our economy.\n  One of the factors that gives us the ability to have the strongest \neconomy in the world is our ability to utilize these types of \ntransactional authorities to allocate risk in a way that gives us the \nresiliency to defend against the kinds of threats against our economy \nwe faced over the last few years.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 3 minutes 16 seconds \nand the Senator from California has 2 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I would like to make a brief statement on \nthis amendment. This is a complicated issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be very happy to yield my 2 minutes to the \nranking member if I might have 3 minutes to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. This is a very complicated issue. This is an issue on which \nthe Senator from California has spent a lot of time. I believe she \nknows it thoroughly. Her proposal would bring more transparency to the \nderivatives market, something we should all support. With above-board \ntransparent\n\n[[Page S13976]]\n\nmarkets, derivatives trading will never be taken seriously and \ninvestors will always be at risk of being taken advantage of. I will be \nsupporting the Feinstein amendment. I urge fellow Senators to do the \nsame.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, there really is a difference of \nopinion. I would like to have the time to read part of the transcript \nin a hearing on the Committee on Agriculture on July 10. A question \nthat Senator Crapo asks to Mr. Newsome of the CFTC.\n\n       Senator Crapo: I know we have been over this before but I \n     want to be sure that I have it right. As I listened to the \n     testimony of both of you it seems to me that there is \n     actually a lot more agreement than disagreement with respect \n     to what we ought to be doing and where we ought to be. The \n     disagreement, as I understand it, is over whether 2G excludes \n     from the fraud and manipulation provision swap transactions.\n\n  Now, swap transactions are the dominant majority of what goes over \nthe over-the-counter market.\n\n       I am correct about that. Would the two of you agree that is \n     the core of the disagreement between your testimony?\n       Mr. Newsome: 2G certainly does exclude swap transactions.\n\n  That is my point. And he is testifying to it in this committee that \nthis is not covered by the CFTC.\n  It goes on.\n\n       Senator Crapo: It excludes them from fraud and manipulation \n     protections.\n       Mr. Newsome: 2G excludes them from jurisdictions of the \n     CFTC.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to oppose this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Wall Street Journal \nthat explains how small firms are potentially affected by this \namendment, a way that small firms have had for hedging so they could \nstay in business in markets that fluctuate dramatically so they could \nkeep a level price for consumers and still make a profit, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 3, 2003]\n\n         Small Firms Are Turning to Financial Futures for Fuel\n\n                           (By Russell Gold)\n\n       Dallas.--Deregulated energy markets have taken their fair \n     share of criticism in recent years. But that hasn't scared \n     off some of the nation's small-business owners, who are \n     betting that the wild and woolly world of the financial-\n     futures markets will provide more price stability than the \n     stodgy regulated utilities.\n       That's a big departure. Typically, small businesses have \n     relied on the regulated utilities for their energy needs. But \n     in the past three years, natural-gas prices have surged and \n     the regulated utilities have been slow to find ways to put a \n     lid on the trend. That's opened the doors to marketers that \n     can use financial derivatives and fixed-rate contracts to \n     offer stable pricing for customers.\n       By the end of this year, an estimated 550,000 commercial \n     clients nationwide will have purchased fixed-price, natural-\n     gas contracts through energy marketing middlemen, according \n     to Kema, a consulting firm in Fairfax, Va., that researches \n     retail-energy markets. That represents a 10% increase from \n     two years ago. ``We are seeing slow and steady growth'' in \n     small businesses switching from utilities to deregulated \n     energy marketers for fuel supplies, says Kema's natural-gas \n     research director, Gerry Yurkevicz.\n\n\n                       locking into fixed prices\n\n       In the past, only large industrial companies would take \n     such risks. But an increasing number of small and midsize \n     businesses, including property managers, hospitals and fast-\n     food franchises, are locking in a fixed price rather than \n     watching their energy bills gyrate from month to month. If \n     they're lucky, they will save money on fuel. But if a warm \n     winter causes prices to collapse, they may end up spending \n     more on natural gas than what utilities would charge.\n       But for most small businesses, natural-gas marketers have \n     something to offer besides the possibility of lower prices: \n     They can offer near-term price stability. This allows \n     businesses to set their energy budgets for the year and not \n     worry.\n       Mark Beffort, president of a real-estate-management concern \n     in Oklahoma City recently made the switch. Instead of buying \n     natural gas from the local utility for a 22-story suburban \n     office tower he manages, he works with natural-gas marketer \n     Clearwater Enterprises LLC. This past fall, Mr. Beffort \n     called Clearwater and chewed over whether to but natural gas \n     for the winter or wait. ``Do we want to lock or do we want to \n     gamble?'' he asked. Last month, a government report on levels \n     of natural gas stored in reservoirs for winter use sent \n     natural-gas prices down. At the urging of Clearwater, Mr. \n     Beffort bought on the drop. He orally agreed to take enough \n     natural gas to heat the office tower at a fixed price. \n     Clearwater then locked in supply using a combination of \n     futures contracts and fixed-price deals with producers.\n       ``Customers can fix their energy budgets at the beginning \n     of the year,'' Mr. Yurkevicz says. ``They can set it and \n     forget it.'' By contrast, regulators set up rules that \n     discourage utilities from hedging, making retail prices \n     almost as volatile as natural-gas prices.\n       For most of the 1990s, natural-gas prices, as measured by \n     tradable futures contracts on the New York Mercantile \n     Exchange, held stable at about $2.50 per million British \n     thermal units. Since 2000, however, the price has whipsawed, \n     and the average cost so far this year has exceeded $5 per \n     million BTUs.\n       Many marketing firms are targeting smaller and smaller \n     commercial customers. Peoples Energy Services, a unit of \n     Chicago-based Peoples Energy Corp., reported it number of \n     commercial clients jumped 20% to 13,073 for the year ended \n     Sept. 30. Meanwhile, the company's average customer usage \n     decreased by 9% to 3.2 million cubic feet, as the energy \n     marketer takes on more smaller customers.\n       UGI Energy Services, a subsidiary of suburban Philadelphia-\n     based UGI Corp., has more than quadrupled its number of \n     customers since 1999. Over the same span, its average \n     customer usage has dropped 13%, to 23 million cubic feet. \n     ``We view ourselves as risk managers,'' says UGI Energy \n     Services President Bradley Hall. ``What most people are \n     looking for its stability.''\n\n\n                           switch to propane\n\n       That's what attracted customer Jeff Uhlenburg. His family-\n     owned industrial furnace in Philadelphia had spent more than \n     six months of its energy budget by mid-March, and high \n     natural-gas prices forced him to switch to propane. ``I got \n     burned,'' he says. This summer, he switched to UGI, which \n     buys natural-gas futures and supplies Mr. Uhlenburg natural \n     gas at a fixed price.\n       Rather than fighting the trend, some regulated utilities \n     are encouraging their customers to switch. The utilities \n     continue to profit from transporting the natural gas. And \n     often, the utility and energy marketer share a common \n     corporate parent.\n       Oklahoma Natural Gas Co., a regulated utility owned by \n     Oneok Inc., gained approval from the state earlier this year \n     to permit even smaller customers than previously allowed to \n     switch to third-party marketer. The 97-year old utility last \n     month began asking commercial clients as small as dry \n     cleaners for permission to send their contact information to \n     marketers. Oneok is hoping that commercial customers will \n     choose to sign up with its unregulated subsidiary, Oneok \n     Energy Marketing Co., to provide their natural gas.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I know this is a glaze-the-eyes-over issue. It is hard for \nme to understand. It is probably hard for me to be able to spell \nderivatives, let alone understand paragraphs A, B, C, D, G, or whatever \nthey were.\n  This amendment has come up twice before. We voted it down twice \nbefore. There have been some changes to pick up a little bit more of a \nmajority. As the letter read by the Senator from Idaho pointed out, the \nindustries that were excluded in this have not bit into it yet. They \nunderstand it is a slippery slope and they will come back up and pick \nthem up.\n  The SEC has brought action against these companies. If Sarbanes-Oxley \nhad been in place a year before the time that it was, we would not have \nhad any problem. There are protections out there. So let's not take \nthis advantage away from the small businesses.\n   The proponents of the amendment believe that the trading of \nderivatives, especially in the energy area, were the cause of the \nenergy problems faced by western States in recent years. Specifically, \nthe proponents believe that energy trading of derivatives by Enron \ncontributed significantly to the energy problems.\n   Unfortunately, the problems that caused Enron to fail were based \nupon failures in corporate governance and outright fraud. Ironically, \nwe are addressing this amendment after we celebrated the 1-year \nanniversary of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley act in July. If that \nact had been in place earlier, the problems of Enron, and companies \nlike Enron, would have been discovered by the independent directors and \neffective auditors required by the law.\n   Proponents of the amendment also would have us believe that Federal \nregulators do not have enough power and authority to seek out and \npunish the wrong doers. That is simply not true. Three Federal agencies \nhave brought enforcement actions as a result of the activities of Enron \nand companies like Enron and the Department of Justice has instituted \ninvestigations into the matter.\n\n[[Page S13977]]\n\n   Two weeks after we defeated the amendment in June, the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission issued two ``broad show cause'' orders to \nover 60 power trading companies that are alleged to have engaged in \nmanipulative practices that disrupted the western energy markets in \n2000 and 2001.\n   In addition, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission documented \nadministrative and criminal actions of the energy trading industry in \nthe agency's, ``Report on Energy Investigations'' that was released on \nApril 9 of this year.\n   Finally, in late July, the Securities and Exchange Commission \nsettled enforcement proceedings in the amount of $255 million against \ntwo investment banks that conspired with Enron to commit fraud. This is \nnot the first action by the Securities and Exchange Commission in this \narea. In total, the Securities and Exchange Commission has brought six \nseparate actions in connection with the Enron matter.\n   In addition, the Federal agencies are not sitting idle. In \nparticular, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has regulatory \ninitiatives to provide greater clarity and transparency to the energy \nmarkets.\n   It is abundantly clear that the Federal agencies are acting where \nappropriate and are using their full authority to pursue those who \ncommit fraud on the energy and securities markets.\n   During the debates on the June 11 amendment, the President's working \ngroup, which is comprised of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, \nthe Chairman of the SEC, and the Chairman of the CFTC, sent a letter to \nopposed the amendment. In the letter, the working group stated that the \nJune 11 amendment ``could have significant unintended consequences for \nan extremely important risk management market--serving businesses, \nfinancial institutions, and investors throughout the U.S. economy.''\n   On July 16, Chairman Greenspan testified before the Senate Banking \nCommittee on the state of monetary policy. In response to question \nposed at the hearing, he reiterated his opposition to the amendment.\n   As I stated on June 11, as we debated this amendment before, I \nbelieve that the amendment is overly broad and if adopted will likely \ndecrease market liquidity because of increased legal and transactional \nuncertainties. In addition, I am suspect of this amendment as it \nincludes a carve-out for the metals industries. Congress should be very \ncautious about carve-outs as it may start out to be a slippery slope \nwhere the initial carve-out is for the metals industry. The next move \nwill be to exempt other industries until there are enough votes to pass \nan amendment--then the process well reverse to pick up the exemptions.\n   Instead of cutting the throats of particularly small companies, this \nwill be the death by a thousand small slices. Derivatives are \nprotecting hedging for small companies and it works. Evidence of small \nbusiness use of energy financial products on energy issues can be seen \nin the November 3 article of the Wall Street Journal entitled, ``Small \nFirms are turning to Financial Futures for Fuel.'' I also would like to \nacknowledge the financial services industries opposition to this \namendment.\n   For every reaction Congress tends to have an overreaction. I believe \nthat this is the case here. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission \nalready oversees market manipulation concerns with the energy trading \nmarkets. The pursuit of a new broad-based regulatory scheme for the \noversight of energy trading may be an unnecessary addition to the \nmarket.\n   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to vote against this particular \namendment as they have voted it down twice before.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, as I have listened to this debate, it \nhas reminded me once again of why I am glad I did not go to law school. \nThe details of the legislation are best left to the lawyers who have \nargued it.\n  I simply share with my colleagues a conversation I had when the \nquestion of derivatives arose with respect to the bankruptcy of Orange \nCounty in California. There was an attempt at that point to say we must \nregulate these derivatives. Derivatives are terrible. Derivatives are \nresponsible for all of our troubles. Chairman Greenspan was asked \npointblank if derivatives were responsible for the bankruptcy in \nCalifornia. He said no, all derivatives did was make the stupid actions \nof the treasurer of Orange County be carried out more effectively than \nwould have been the case without them.\n  We must remember that derivatives are neutral. They are tools to be \nused by managers to hedge risks and to make things move more \nefficiently in the marketplace. We sometimes move away from that \nunderstanding and think they are inherently evil in and of themselves.\n  I accept the assurances that the trading in this area is \nappropriately managed by the regulatory agencies that have been set up \nand I intend to oppose the amendment. I urge my fellow Senators to do \nthe same.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to permit \nSenator Cantwell to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I come to the floor to support the Feinstein \namendment. I think Senator Feinstein has done an outstanding job of \ntrying to communicate what is essential for markets to operate \nefficiently. For markets to operate efficiently, they need \ntransparency. That is what the underlying amendment does.\n  It says, let's make these commodities have the same transparency as \nother products on the market that are sold as futures, have the ability \nto look at the books, and make sure that manipulation has not happened.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator withhold for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will withhold.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I have a copy of a colloquy between \nthe leaders that we would have an up-or-down vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, while that is being considered, I ask \nunanimous consent that a statement of the American Public Gas \nAssociation, supporting the amendment; a statement of Attorney General \nEliot Spitzer, supporting the amendment; a statement of the North \nAmerican Securities Administrators Association, supporting the \namendment; a statement from the Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and Public Citizen, \nsupporting the amendment; and a statement from the Derivatives Study \nCenter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                              Gas Association,\n\n                                     Fairfax, VA, October 8, 2003.\n     Re protecting electricity markets and consumers.\n\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lugar: The American Public Gas Association \n     (APGA) is very pleased that you and Senators Levin and \n     Feinstein are leading a bipartisan effort to ensure that \n     energy prices are determined in a competitive and informed \n     marketplace. The provisions in your ``Energy Market Oversight \n     Amendment'' are significant steps toward closing the gaps \n     that impede effective federal oversight of the energy \n     marketplace. We strongly support the changes you propose to \n     the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and the Federal Power Act \n     (FPA). We also urge that you amend the Natural Gas Act (NGA) \n     in the same manner as the FPA so natural gas markets and \n     consumers are provided the same level of protection you \n     propose for electricity markets and consumers.\n       APGA represents the interests of municipally-owned gas \n     utilities. There are over 950 public gas systems across the \n     country in 36 states serving more than five million \n     residential and commercial customers. APGA represents over \n     600 of these public gas systems. Our members are not-for-\n     profit utilities, and their boards are composed of locally \n     elected and appointed officials. No other trade association \n     in the gas industry is closer to the customers they serve \n     than APGA members. And, on behalf of APGA, we strongly \n     support your amendment because it will improve market \n     transparency and provide the essential regulatory oversight \n     to detect and prevent manipulation and improve the efficiency \n     of energy markets. Greater\n\n[[Page S13978]]\n\n     transparency and effective oversight are the basic steps \n     necessary to restore confidence in the energy markets and \n     promote the investments needed to provide reliable energy at \n     fair prices to consumers and businesses.\n       We applaud your efforts and your goals: to improve \n     transparency, strengthen enforcement, and preclude \n     manipulation in energy markets. Fundamental to achieving \n     these goals is to undo the special exclusions and exemptions \n     granted in the closing hours of the 106th Congress. The \n     amendments to the CEA you now propose are focused \n     specifically on energy markets and will provide a basic level \n     of protection for all energy consumers because the provisions \n     clearly establish anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority \n     in the over-the-counter derivatives contracts for energy \n     commodities.\n       However, we urge you to include changes to the NGA that are \n     consistent with your changes to the FPA. Unless such changes \n     are made in tandem, there will be even further disparity \n     between the consumer protection provisions in these two \n     important acts. We hope that such disparate treatment will \n     not be tolerated.\n       Again, public gas utilities and the hundreds of communities \n     we serve commend you for your thoughtful and deliberate \n     leadership on this very important issue. While there may be \n     some who will oppose this amendment, one need not look far to \n     see whether the opposition is looking out for the best \n     interests of Wall Street or Main Street. We pledge to work \n     with you in any way we can to pass this much-needed \n     amendment. Please let me know how I can assist you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Cave,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                State of New York,\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                   New York, NY, October 15, 2003.\n      Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert Bennett,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and \n         Related Services, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural \n         Development, and Related Services, Appropriations \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: I firmly support your efforts to make our \n     energy markets competitive and to protect those markets from \n     fraud and manipulation. The Energy Market Oversight \n     Amendment, sponsored by Senators Feinstein, Levin and Lugar \n     and under consideration as an amendment to the pending 2004 \n     Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Services \n     Appropriations legislation, is a major step toward both \n     goals. I urge its swift adoption. In addition to providing \n     wholesale electricity markets the transparency vital to \n     effective competition, the amendment closes loopholes used to \n     manipulate energy markets, improves the ability to detect \n     fraud and other manipulation, and deters manipulation by \n     establishing substantive penalties.\n       The amendment makes a major contribution to competitive \n     energy markets by initiating an electronic information system \n     to be operated through the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission (`'FERC''). This system will provide open access \n     to comprehensive, timely and reliable wholesale electricity \n     and transmission price and supply data, greatly expanding the \n     choices of both buyers and sellers. In addition, the \n     reliability of market information would be markedly improved \n     by the amendment's general prohibition on manipulation of the \n     purchase or sale of electricity or the transmission services \n     needed to deliver electricity, and by the specific \n     prohibition of the ``round trip trading'' manipulation used \n     so effectively to inflate electricity prices to the public's \n     injury.\n       Enforcement of the laws and regulations safeguarding our \n     energy markets would be greatly aided by other reforms the \n     amendment provides. The amendment would repeal the so-called \n     ``Enron exemption,'' which shields large energy traders from \n     oversight. In addition, the amendment would apply the anti-\n     manipulation and anti-fraud provisions of the Commodity \n     Exchange Act to energy transactions, would improve FERC's \n     ability to address complaints, and would lift a restriction \n     on FERC's authority to order refunds. These reforms will make \n     accountable parties now beyond the law's reach and will \n     increase the recovery of overcharges.\n       Finally,the amendment would give effect to the deterrents \n     against energy market abuses. These reforms make FERC \n     penalties more than just a ``cost of doing business.''\n       The events of the past three years teach that we need \n     better and stronger laws to protect our energy markets. The \n     Energy Market Oversight Amendment would significantly improve \n     our laws and strengthen crucial deterrents against the fraud \n     and other energy market manipulations that have cost our \n     citizens and our economy billions. The national interest \n     would be served by the amendment becoming law as soon as \n     possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Eliot Spitzer,\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         North American Securities\n\n\n                             Administrators Association, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 2003.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Appropriations Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert Bennett,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and \n         Related Services, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural \n         Development and Related Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: The North American Securities Administrators \n     Association is writing to express its support for the Energy \n     Market Oversight Amendment, sponsored by Senators Feinstein, \n     Levin and Lugar. It is our understanding that this amendment \n     will be considered as part of the Agriculture Appropriations \n     bill.\n       The collapse of Enron, continued reports of fraud, \n     manipulation in the energy markets, and the lack of \n     transparency in over-the-counter (OTC) energy trading \n     underscore the need for this amendment. The Energy Market \n     Oversight Amendment would provide the transparency and \n     regulatory tools necessary to detect and prevent manipulation \n     and improve the efficiency of these markets. Its disclosure \n     requirements will make the energy marketplace more open for \n     all producers and consumers, and the result will be a more \n     sound and efficient market. During this period of market \n     unrest, now is the time to strengthen the oversight of the \n     energy markets.\n       NASAA supports the Feinstein-Levin-Lugar amendment because \n     it would provide more transparency to the wholesale \n     electricity markets, supply the CFTC with the authority to \n     detect fraud and manipulation, and help to deter wrongdoing \n     by significantly increasing the penalties for violations of \n     the Federal Power Act.\n       The events of the past three years should be a wake-up call \n     that we need stronger laws to protect the users of our energy \n     markets. This amendment would improve our laws and help to \n     ensure that problems associated with Enron, the Western \n     electricity crisis, and the recent Northeast blackout do not \n     recur. Thank you for your consideration of these 693Y85X \n     views. Please do not hesitate to contact Deborah Fischione \n     House, NASAA's Director of Policy at 202-737-0900, if we may \n     be of assistance to you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Ralph A. Lambiase,\n\n                                                  NASAA President,\n     Director of Connecticut Securities.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 16, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to urge you to support the \n     bipartisan Energy Market Oversight Amendment, which will be \n     offered during consideration of the Fiscal Year 2004 \n     Agriculture Appropriations bill. This amendment, being \n     offered by Senators Feinstein, Lugar, Levin and others, would \n     go a long way towards addressing the serious problems \n     plaguing the nation's energy markets.\n       Unfortunately, we have been bombarded with a steady stream \n     of news reports about how electricity traders have \n     unscrupulously manipulated the market to unfairly inflate \n     their profits, costing consumers billions of dollars. More \n     than one trader has admitted to engaging in ``round trip \n     trading'' to artificially inflate prices. Some created \n     transmission congestion in order to be paid to relieve that \n     congestion. Supplies were withheld to drive prices up, \n     resulting in a series of rolling blackouts in California. We \n     are still learning the full extent of the misconduct, and \n     only now are we coming to understand the nature of these \n     schemes.\n       Today, the loss of trust and confidence in the integrity \n     and creditworthiness of energy and energy derivatives markets \n     has left trading in oil, gas and electricity suffering from a \n     lack of liquidity. If markets are going to be the terrain for \n     setting the price for our key energy products, then it is \n     crucial that they be orderly and efficient. Towards that end \n     this amendment seeks to put an end to this plague of fraud \n     and market manipulation. It will help improve market \n     oversight and surveillance. It will enable the Commodity \n     Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to detect and deter \n     manipulation. Its disclosure rules will make the marketplace \n     more transparent for all producers and consumers, and the \n     result will be a more sound and efficient market.\n       Given all this, we believe that it would be irresponsible \n     to weaken consumer protections and cut federal oversight of \n     the electric industry, as both the Senate and House-passed \n     versions of the energy bill would do. That is why the Energy \n     Market Oversight Amendment is so timely. This amendment \n     would:\n       Improve price transparency in wholesale electricity markets \n     by directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) \n     to establish an electronic system to provide information \n     about the price and availability of wholesale electricity to \n     buyers, sellers and the general public;\n       Prohibit round trip trading;\n       Increase penalties for violations of the Federal Power Act \n     and the Natural Gas Act from $5,000 to $1,000,000;\n       Prohibit manipulation of the electricity markets, including \n     giving FERC the authority to revoke market-based rates for \n     companies that are found to have engaged in market \n     manipulation;\n\n[[Page S13979]]\n\n       Repeal the ``Enron exemption'' in the Commodities Future \n     Modernization Act for large traders in energy commodities and \n     apply the anti-fraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act \n     to all over the counter trades in energy derivatives; and\n       Provide the CFTC tools to monitor energy markets, including \n     requiring traders to keep records and report large trades to \n     the CFTC, focusing on transactions that perform a significant \n     price discovery function, while limiting the CFTC to seeking \n     only information necessary to detect and prevent price \n     manipulation in the futures and over the counter markets for \n     energy.\n       In addition, the amendment would have no effect on futures \n     markets, financial derivatives, metals, swaps or electronic \n     trading of non-energy commodities.\n       Energy production is a major sector of the economy, but \n     energy's importance is greater than that measured by its \n     size. One of the hard learned lessons from the Western \n     electricity meltdown of 2000 and 2001 is that when energy \n     companies manipulate the electricity markets, devastating \n     consequences result. Billions of dollars were lost and \n     millions of lives were adversely affected. The toll on \n     businesses both large and small was enormous. The impact of \n     the Northeast-Midwest blackout was also immense. Congress \n     should do everything within its power to ensure that such \n     devastation never occurs again, and, if it does, that those \n     responsible are punished severely.\n       Please protect the nation's electricity markets from \n     further Enron-style manipulations--support the Energy Market \n     Oversight Amendment.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n       Adam J. Goldberg, Policy Analyst, Consumers Union.\n       Mark N. Cooper, Director of Research, Consumer Federation \n     of America.\n       Anna Aurilio, Legislative Director, U.S. Public Interest \n     Research Group.\n       Michelle Boyd, Legislative Representative, Public Citizen.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Financial Policy Forum,\n\n\n                                     Derivatives Study Center,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 22, 2003.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am writing regarding the Energy \n     Market Oversight legislation being offered as an amendment to \n     the FY 2004 Agricultural Appropriations bill. This important \n     legislation will assume that over-the-counter derivatives \n     markets in ``exempt'' commodities such as energy will be \n     covered by federal prohibitions on fraud and manipulation. It \n     will also help to create energy derivatives markets that are \n     more transparent and thus more efficient. In doing so, this \n     legislation will bring OTC energy derivatives out of the \n     shadows and into the same light of financial disclosure. It \n     will subject these derivatives to some of the same \n     regulations that apply to securities, banking, exchange-\n     traded futures and options and other sectors of U.S. \n     financial markets.\n       This regulatory assistance comes at a critical time. \n     According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's \n     Director of the Office of Market Oversight, ``energy markets \n     are in severe financial distress.'' Along with the decline in \n     credit quality in these markets, the loss of confidence and \n     trust has led to a ruin in the liquidity and depth of these \n     markets. This legislation will go a long way to address this \n     problem.\n       Derivatives are highly leveraged financial transactions, \n     allowing investors to potentially take a large position in \n     the market without committing an equivalent amount of \n     capital. Moreover, derivatives traded in over-the-counter \n     markets are devoid of the transparency that characterizes \n     exchange-traded derivatives such as futures, and this lack of \n     transparency introduces a greater potential for abuse through \n     fraud and manipulation.\n       Derivatives are often combined into highly complex \n     structured transactions that are difficult--even for seasoned \n     securities traders and finance professionals--to understand \n     and price in the market. Enron used such over-the-counter \n     derivatives extensively in order to hide the nature of their \n     activities from investors. The failure of Enron and the \n     demise of other energy derivatives dealers has had a \n     devastating impact on the level of trust in energy markets.\n       This legislation would help ensure that over-the-counter \n     derivatives markets operate with proper federal oversight \n     which will make the markets more stable and transparent. It \n     is appropriate to place this oversight authority with the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which, as the principal \n     federal regulator of derivatives transactions since its \n     founding in 1975, will provide oversight, surveillance and \n     enforcement of anti-fraud and anti-manipulation laws. The \n     CFTC has the experience to handle these complex financial \n     transactions and to develop the best rules to implement these \n     protections.\n       At a time when these energy markets are deeply distressed \n     and the investing public looks skeptically at derivatives \n     trading and firms engaged in derivatives trading, we should \n     take decisive steps to ensure that the public is protected \n     from Enron-like abuses and that derivatives are properly \n     regulated so as to make energy markets more efficient. This \n     amendment is just such a step, and the authors of the \n     legislation deserve appreciation for their work in the public \n     interest.\n       Thank you for introducing this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Randall Dodd,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 State of Michigan\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                     Lansing, MI, October 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for passage of the Feinstein-Lugar-Levin amendment to \n     the Fiscal Year 2004 agriculture appropriation bill.\n       In the aftermath of the massive electricity blackout six \n     weeks ago that affected at least six million Michiganians, I \n     believe all necessary steps should be taken to bolster \n     business and consumer confidence in the nation's energy \n     markets and promote additional investment in reliable energy \n     delivery at a fair price. Your amendment would improve \n     electricity price transparency in wholesale electricity \n     markets, greatly increase criminal and civil penalties for \n     trading violations, prohibit market manipulation and fraud in \n     all energy market sectors, and strengthen day-to-day energy \n     market oversight including over-the-counter market \n     transactions that significant affect energy prices.\n       By directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     (FERC) to establish an electronic price and supply monitoring \n     system and crack down on manipulation in wholesale \n     electricity markets. Congress would be providing new \n     authorities consistent with my testimony before the House \n     Energy and Commerce Committee last month that urged Congress \n     to sharpen the teeth of federal regulators and hold \n     electricity market participants accountable to assure energy \n     reliability.\n       I appreciate your efforts in the Senate to strengthen \n     federal oversight of energy markets and promote reliable and \n     fairly priced energy that will protect consumers and fuel \n     economic growth.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Jennifer M. Granholm,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                             State Utility Consumer Advocates,\n\n                                                 October 27, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: The National Association of State Utility \n     Consumer Advocates strongly support the bipartisan Energy \n     Market Oversight Amendment, which will be offered during \n     consideration of the FY 2004 Agriculture Appropriations bill.\n       The proposal, offered by Senators Feinstein, Lugar, Levin, \n     and others will help fix broken energy markets and give \n     regulators the tools needed to protect consumers from market \n     manipulators.\n       The amendment improves price transparency, prohibits round \n     trip trading, and increases penalties for Federal Power Act \n     and Natural Gas Act violations. The amendment also prohibits \n     manipulation of the energy market and repeals the ``Enron \n     exemption.''\n       The nation's consumer advocates urge you to support this \n     important consumer protection amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Charles A.

Madam President, as I understand the colloquy, it was \neither a vote on the amendment or in relation to the amendment, and \nthat a motion to table is determined as being in relation to the \namendment.\n  Now, out of courtesy to the Senator from California, I will not make \nthe motion to table. But I want to make it clear, I am reserving the \nright to make a motion to table in future situations similar to this. I \ndo not want to be discourteous to her for her understanding, but it is \nmy understanding that I do, indeed, have the right to make that motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, the extraordinary courtesy of the \nSenator is appreciated because he is actually correct. It did say ``in \nrelation to.''

Under the previous order, all after the \nenacting clause is stricken and the text of S. 1753, as amended, is \ninserted in lieu thereof.\n  The clerk will read the bill for the third time.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read the \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have decided to vote against the \nNational Consumer Credit Reporting System Improvement Act because, \nbottom line, this bill reduces the privacy rights of 36 million \nCalifornians.\n  These rights were obtained through the passage of landmark \nlegislation sponsored by Senator Jackie Speier earlier this year in \nCalifornia, which gave consumers the right to tell financial \ninstitutions that they don't want their most sensitive personal \ninformation shared with hundreds or even thousands of affiliated \ncompanies.\n  This practice--affiliate sharing--can include your most sensitive \ninformation--the stocks you own, the certificates of deposit you hold, \nor the amount of money in your checking account.\n  Importantly, California's financial industry signed off on Senator \nSpeier's bill, rather than face a ballot initiative, which likely would \nhave succeeded.\n  Industry executives said at the time that the California bill \n``encompasses all aspects of the workability needed to ensure \nprotection of customers' privacy'' and that it is ``a workable, \nreasonable compromise.'' In fact, the only major reservation expressed \nabout that provision was that the bill did not represent a national \nstandard. But now, given the opportunity to set such a national \nstandard, these same companies worked to wipe out such protections--and \nI find this conduct particularly concerning. Attached is a letter from \nSenator Speier that attests to the behavior of California's financial \nindustry.\n  So in response to calls for a national standard and to protect the \nrights of Californians, Senator Boxer and I developed an amendment that \nwould have established a strong national standard on affiliate sharing, \nconsistent with California's law, which would have given consumers a \nreal voice in how their personal information is used.\n  This amendment came up for a vote and, unfortunately, it was \ndefeated. I think time will show that this was the wrong vote, and I \nhave no doubt that this issue will resurface as consumers learn more \nabout the misuse of their most sensitive personal information.\n  I am disappointed that we did not achieve our main goal of adopting \nan amendment which would allow consumers to have control over their \npersonal data, but I am pleased that the Senate approved two \namendments, which I sponsored along with Senator Boxer, to protect \nconsumers.\n  The first amendment, authorized by Senator Boxer, which I \ncosponsored, would give consumers greater protection against unwanted \nmarketing.\n  Most importantly, the amendment would allow consumers to permanently \nopt-out of marketing by unrelated affiliates, while the underlying bill \nwould have only limited the opt-out to 5 years. This means that if a \nconsumer asks a corporation not to share information with its \naffiliates for the purpose of marketing, the affiliate cannot solicit \nthem--forever. Without this amendment, a consumer would have been \nrequired to go back to the corporation and reiterate his request after \n5 years.\n  Additionally, this amendment clarified what the bill meant by a \n``pre-existing business relationship'', where there was no definition \nbefore. With this amendment, a company's affiliate would only be able \nto market to consumers who have:\n  One, purchased, rented or leased the seller's goods or services or \ncompleted a financial transaction between the consumer and seller, \nwithin the 18 months immediately preceding the date of a solicitation; \nor\n  Two, inquired about or applied for a product or service offered by \nthe seller, within the 3 months immediately preceding the marketing \ncontact.\n  Without this clarification, companies might have been able to market \nto customers who purchased goods as many as 5 or 10 years earlier, or \nwho made the mildest inquiry a few years ago. It is the same definition \ndeveloped by the Federal Trade Commission in creating a national ``Do \nNot Call'' registry for telemarketers.\n  The Senate also adopted a second amendment, which I authored and was \ncosponsored by Senators Boxer and Kennedy, that essentially provided a \nfar more encompassing definition of medical information than is \ncontained in current law.\n  Simply put, this amendment will help ensure that consumers aren't \ndiscriminated against based on their medical or health information when \nthey apply for credit, insurance, or employment. The amendment also has \nthe support of the American Medical Association, the American Cancer \nSociety, and the California Medical Association.\n  The Feinstein amendment would broadly expand the definition of \n``medical information'' to read:\n\n       Information or data except age or gender, whether oral or \n     recorded in any form or medium, created by or derived from a \n     health care provider or the consumer that relates to:\n       (1) The past, present or future physical, mental or \n     behavioral health or condition of an individual;\n       (2) The provision of health care to an individual; or\n       (3) Payment for the provision of health care to an \n     individual.\n\n  This is the same definition of medical information established by the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2002. This \ndefinition has been implemented in a vast majority of our states.\n  Even with these modest amendments, however, I cannot support the \nreauthorization of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n  The Boxer-Feinstein marketing amendment will help prevent consumers \nfrom receiving unwanted solicitation, but it will do nothing to limit\n\n[[Page S13981]]\n\nthe ability of companies to share information with their affiliates.\n  Affiliates, therefore, will continue to be able to use personal \ninformation to profile consumers in a way that leads to unfair \nincreases in premiums or interest rates, to giving certain consumers \ninferior service, or to outrightly deny them credit cards, insurance \npolicies, or other products.\n  Furthermore, the bill will do nothing to stop the creation of \n``internal credit reports'' by large financial institutions. Unlike \nwith traditional credit reports, consumers will continue to have no \nability to access or correct errors in these documents.\n  Most Americans consider their personal information their private \nproperty. Yet, this bill will continue to deprive ordinary American \nconsumers from having any choice over how their information is shared \nin the business world. This is the fundamental issue.\n  To give you a sense of the deep support for privacy, I would point to \na survey of California voters completed on February 7 of this year.\n  The statewide survey found that by a 91-to-7 percent margin, \nCalifornia voters would favor a ballot proposition that ``would require \na bank, a credit card company, insurance company, or other financial \ninstitution to notify a customer and receive a customer's permission \nbefore selling any financial information to any separate financial or \nnon-financial company.''\n  This means that 9 out of 10 Californians support even stronger \nprotections--where companies would have to gain your prior consent--\nopt-in--to share your financial data--than the amendment which Senator \nBoxer and I offered. And polls across the country reflected similar \nlevels of support by Americans for stronger privacy laws.\n  This only underscores the need for strong federal standards. Clearly, \nbusinesses should be able to manage customer information in order to \nenhance services. But there must be strong rules that protect \nconsumers. That is why Congress should have given consumers a choice--\nallowing them to tall companies that they don't want their most \npersonal information shared.\n  So despite the fact that I support efforts in this legislation to \ncombat identity theft and improve consumer access to credit report \ninformation, I believe that the bill doesn't do enough to protect \nconsumer's privacy, and that is why I am voting against it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Senator \nJackie Speier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                      California State Senate,\n\n                                 Sacramento, CA, October 24, 2003.\n     Hon.

Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senator, California,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Feinstein and Boxer: I wish to thank you for \n     your efforts on behalf of consumer privacy rights, and urge \n     you continue to do all that is possible to protect \n     California's hard-fought consumer privacy gains.\n       It has recently come to my attention that the financial \n     services industry has been criticizing the contents of your \n     amendment to S. 1753, substituting the newly-enacted and \n     stronger California privacy standard on affiliate sharing in \n     the ``corporate family of companies,'' as unworkable and \n     unreasonable. This same industry recently called my \n     California bill ``workable and reasonable,'' specifically \n     removing their opposition to my measure and lavishing praise \n     on it, even helping to gather votes. Industry made it clear \n     that my bill met their workability concerns, progress made \n     with their active participation. If my bill was workable for \n     industry in California, then why shouldn't it be the national \n     standard? A transcript of their August 14, 2003, public \n     comments bear this out and is attached.\n       One industry representative stood with me on that day and \n     said my bill ``encompasses all aspects of the workability \n     needed to ensure protection of customers' privacy,'' while \n     another called it ``a balanced measure that will provide \n     meaningful privacy protections to consumers while also \n     addressing the workability concerns'' that industry had. Now \n     the story is different, as industry sees a political \n     opportunity to preempt California's standard on affiliate \n     sharing with a weaker one.\n       The financial services industry appears to be acting in bad \n     faith--it seems willing to say and do anything to erode \n     California's recent progress on behalf of consumers, first to \n     avoid a costly initiative battle and local ordinances \n     limiting third-party sharing, now to pull the wool over \n     Congress' eyes. Does the financial services industry really \n     believe that millions of American consumers don't deserve a \n     choice over what happens when their personal financial \n     information, their financial DNA, is shared with thousands of \n     affiliated companies? The industry's position is flawed \n     public policy, weaker than their own standards abroad, and \n     the kind of business practice that erodes consumer \n     confidence.\n       I urge you to continue your efforts in making California's \n     privacy standards those of the nation. California's affiliate \n     standard was good enough for the financial industry two \n     months ago; it certainly is acceptable now. Thank you again \n     for your efforts; I stand ready to help you in any way \n     possible.\n           All the best,\n                                                    Jackie Speier,\n                                         California State Senator.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my strong support for \nS. 1753, the National Consumer Credit Reporting System Improvement Act \nof 2003. I would like to commend both Chairman Shelby and Ranking \nMember Sarbanes on this legislation and the thoroughness of the \nhearings which preceded this legislation. I applaud their deep \ncommitment and thank them for their strong leadership on this issue.\n  This legislation is not perfect. It is not the bill that I would have \nwritten. Nor do I believe that this legislation represents a perfect \nbill from the perspective of the chairman or ranking member. However, I \nbelieve that it is a bipartisan bill that does a lot of very good \nthings, and was put together in a very balanced manner.\n  The Banking Committee, both during the hearing process and the mark-\nup of this legislation examined the numerous issues surrounding the \nFair Credit Reporting Act: accuracy, privacy, security, financial \nliteracy, among others.\n  We learned some critical information during this process. I believe \nthat the hearing process shed significant light on the positives of the \nFair Credit Reporting Act and gave us insight on how to enhance its \neffectiveness. The consumer credit system is critically important to \nour nation's economy, and this legislation attempts to balance the \ngreater access to credit for consumers, more efficiency in the credit \ngranting process and the needs of consumers to have greater accuracy \nand privacy protections.\n  Numerous witnesses testified to the need to improve accuracy in the \ncredit reporting process. Concerns were raised that currently the \ncritical information that is used in the credit granting process is not \nas timely and accurate as is necessary. Accurate credit reporting is \nessential to the proper functioning of our credit system and to the \nfinancial security of American consumers. Also, consumers must have a \nclearly articulated remedy for correcting errors when they do occur.\n  Additionally, consumers must be given greater knowledge and control \nover their personal financial information. The hearing on affiliate \nsharing shed light on current practices and the positives and negatives \nassociated with those practices.\n  The committee heard from numerous witnesses that consumers were not \nprovided with the tools necessary to fully understand the credit \nreporting process and become adept to using it to their maximum \nadvantage. Financial literacy is not a one time event--it is a long \nprocess--educating more and more Americans as they become consumers.\n  Of special concern, we learned about the epidemic of identity theft. \nIdentity theft is a growing problem affecting millions of Americans and \nthat we must devote our full attention to increasing the security of \nfinancial information. We heard from a witness named John Harrison, a \nretired Army Captain from Connecticut who was the victim of identity \ntheft. His credit reports clearly contained false information--\nmisinformation that was planted there by a criminal--but Captain \nHarrison has had--and continues to have--enormous difficulty restoring \nhis credit worthiness.\n  These are just some of the lessons regarding the current operation of \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n  This legislation addresses many, if not all, of the concerns raised \nthroughout the six hearings conducted by the committee.\n  This legislation strengthens consumers' ability to control both their \npersonal financial and medical information. I have long supported the \nneed to improve the privacy rights of consumers with respect to \ngenetic, medical, and financial information. I am a cosponsor of \nlegislation which would\n\n[[Page S13982]]\n\nprovide greater choices for consumers to prevent sharing of information \nbetween affiliates and unaffiliated third parties. While this \nlegislation does not go far enough to completely protect consumers, I \nbelieve it is an important step in the right direction.\n  This legislation provides consumers with the ability to prohibit \naffiliates from using their personal financial information for \nsolicitations and other marketing purposes. In addition, an important \namendment was adopted on the floor to provide consumers with additional \nprotections against the misuse of sensitive medical information. It \nalso contains important provisions that will significantly enhance \nconsumer protections against the growing problem of identify theft.\n  Additionally, it grants consumers with access to one free credit \nreport per year from the credit reporting bureaus. This access will \nallow consumers to monitor the accuracy of the information contained in \ntheir credit files and ensure that information resulting from identity \ntheft does not end up destroying their financial reputation.\n  And by providing consumers with a free credit report, and access to \nthe information used by creditors to judge their creditworthiness, this \nbill equips consumers with the tools to competitively shop for sources \nof financing and will lead consumers to make better informed and more \njudicious, credit-related decisions.\n  I believe that we can do more to give consumers better control over \ntheir personal information and how financial institutions share their \ninformation with their affiliates, for marketing as well as other \npurposes. This legislation is an important step in the right direction.\n  Irrespective of any changes that I, or others, may wish to raise with \nregard to S. 1753, there is no doubt that this legislation \nsignificantly improves the current privacy and accuracy standards of \nour consumer credit reporting system.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senators Sarbanes and Shelby and their \nstaffs for their hard work on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport S. 1753.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? There is 1 minute remaining \non each side.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute or less. We are \ngetting ready to vote on the Fair Credit Reporting Act. We were able \nyesterday to move it to where we are today. We believe we have put \ntogether a bipartisan bill. We expect a heavy vote on both sides of the \naisle. It is a complicated piece of legislation.\n  I commend Senator Sarbanes, my colleague and the ranking Democrat, \nfor his leadership in helping us to get where we are today.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this is the legislation we spent all day \nyesterday on. We worked through the issues, I think, in a reasonable \nand collegial fashion and the measure is now before us for final \npassage. I thank the chairman of the committee for his many courtesies.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 95, nays 2, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 437 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--95\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--2\n\n     Boxer\n     Feinstein\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n  The bill (H.R. 2622), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2622\n\n         Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 2622) entitled ``An Act to amend the Fair Credit \n     Reporting Act, to prevent identity theft, improve resolution \n     of consumer disputes, improve the accuracy of consumer \n     records, make improvements in the use of, and consumer access \n     to, credit information, and for other purposes.'', do pass \n     with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

TITUS, OF MARYLAND, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \n                                 JUDGE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session for the consideration of Executive Calendar \nitem No. 402, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Roger W. Titus, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes evenly divided on the \nnomination.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I compliment the Republican leadership for \nfinally agreeing to move to the nomination of Roger Titus, who has been \ncleared on this side for some time.\n  The nominee has won universal acclaim as a member of the Maryland \nbar. In fact, it was suggested that he was going to be nominated to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. It would have been a \nconsensus where both Republicans and Democrats would have agreed. I \nwish the administration had done that. Instead, they have moved him to \nfill this seat. It is not a confrontational one for the circuit. In any \nevent, he should be supported. He will make the 168th judicial nominee \nof President Bush's to be confirmed, which sets an all-time record for \nthis time in a President's term in office, surpassing even that of \nPresident Reagan, when we had a Republican majority.\n  Mr. Titus has been an active litigator in Maryland for over 37 years, \nand has litigated hundreds of cases, both civil and criminal. He has \nbeen a partner at the Venable law firm and is a former president of the \nMaryland Bar Association. He has also served as an adjunct professor at \nthe Georgetown University Law Center. Mr. Titus earned a unanimous \n``well-qualified'' rating from the ABA, and an AV rating from \nMartindale-Hubbell.\n  In 2001, Mr. Titus was honored with The Baltimore Daily Record's \nfirst Leadership in the Law Award, which recognizes members of the \nlegal community for their devotion to the betterment of the profession \nand their communities. In 1999, Mr. Titus received the Century of \nService Award from the Montgomery County Bar Association for his \noutstanding contributions to the legal profession and community during \nthe 20th century.\n  According to an article in The Baltimore Sun, Mr. Titus was \napparently in the running to be nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In light of his stellar \nqualifications, deep roots in his legal community and ability to garner \nthe bipartisan support of his elected officials he would have been a \nconsensus choice for this important appellate seat. It is unfortunate \nthat the President felt the need to nominate someone without any local \nties to that Maryland vacancy.\n  There are reportedly 30,000 practicing attorneys in the State of \nMaryland. Instead of nominating a well-qualified Marylander like Mr. \nTitus to Judge Murnahan's vacant seat on the Fourth Circuit, the \nPresident selected a younger, more controversial nominee with very \nlittle litigation experience. Not surprisingly, that nominee, Claude \nAllen, received a partial ``not qualified'' rating by the American Bar \nAssociation and his selection for this prestigious lifetime appointment \nhas garnered a significant amount of opposition from concerned citizens \ngroups.\n  It is regrettable that this President has again chosen the course of \nconfrontation and conflict for his appellate court nominations. Mr. \nTitus, with his many years of litigation experience and his well-\ndeserved reputation as a leader among lawyers in Maryland, is the type \nof person who should have been chosen for Judge Murnahan's vacant seat \non the Fourth Circuit. His nomination stands in sharp contrast to the \ninexperienced and divisive candidates chosen by the White House for too \nmany appellate judgeships in what appear to be an effort to pack the \ncourt with ideological nominees and tilt these courts.\n  There is no doubt that Mr. Titus is a Republican, yet he has the \nsupport of both of his home-State Senators and has earned the unanimous \nsupport of the Members of the Judiciary Committee. I am happy to \nsupport his nomination today and I congratulate Mr. Titus and his \nfamily on his confirmation. I commend Senators Sarbanes and Mikulski \nfor their efforts to identify outstanding Maryland lawyers to maintain \nthe high standards of the Federal bench in Maryland.\n  In less than 3 years' time, President George W. Bush exceeded the \nnumber of judicial nominees confirmed for President Reagan in all 4 \nyears of his first term in office. Senate Democrats have cooperated so \nthat this President already surpassed the record of the President \nRepublicans acknowledge to be the ``all time champ'' at appointing \nFederal judges. Since July, 2001, despite the fact that the Senate \nmajority has shifted twice, with today's vote, a total of 168 judicial \nnominations have been confirmed, including 29 circuit court \nappointments. One hundred judges were confirmed in the 17 months of the \nDemocratic Senate majority and with Mr. Titus' nomination we will have \nconfirmed 68 during the comparative time of the Republican majority.\n\n[[Page S13995]]\n\n  One would think that the White House and the Republicans in the \nSenate would be heralding this landmark. One would think they would be \ncongratulating themselves for putting more lifetime appointed judges on \nthe Federal bench than President Reagan did in his entire first term \nand doing it in three-quarters the time. But Republicans have a \ndifferent partisan message and this truth is not consistent with their \nefforts to mislead the American people into thinking that Democrats \nhave obstructed judicial nominations. That is why the President chose \nto criticize the Senate from the Rose Garden again last week rather \nthan work with us and recognize what we can accomplish together.\n  Not only has this President been accorded more Senate confirmations \nthan President Reagan achieved during his entire first term, but he has \nalso achieved more confirmations this year than in any of the 6 years \nthat Republicans controlled the Senate when President Clinton was in \noffice. Not once was President Clinton allowed 68 confirmations in a \nyear when Republicans controlled the pace of confirmations. Despite the \nhigh numbers of vacancies and availability of highly qualified \nnominees, Republicans never cooperated with President Clinton to the \nextent Senate Democrats have. President Bush has appointed more \nlifetime circuit and district court judges in 10 months this year than \nPresident Clinton was allowed in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, or 2000.\n  Last year alone, the Democratic majority in the Senate proceeded to \nconfirm 72 of President Bush's judicial nominees and was savagely \nattacked nonetheless. Likewise in 1992, the last previous full year in \nwhich a Democratic Senate majority considered the nominees of a \nRepublican President, 66 circuit and district court judges were \nconfirmed.\n  Historically, in the last year of an administration, consideration of \nnominations slows, the ``Thurmond rule'' is invoked and vacancies are \nleft to the winner of the upcoming Presidential election. In 1992, \nDemocrats proceeded to confirm 66 of former President Bush's judicial \nnominees even though it was a Presidential election year. By contrast, \nin 1996, when Republicans controlled the pace for consideration of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees only 17 judges were confirmed and \nnot a single one of them was to a circuit court.\n  In fact, President Bush has now already appointed more judges in his \nthird year in office than in the third year of the last five \nPresidential terms, including the most recent term when Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate and President Clinton was leading the country to \nhistoric economic achievements. That year, in 1999, Republicans allowed \nonly 34 judicial nominees of President Clinton's to be confirmed all \nyear, including only 7 circuit court nominees. Those are close to the \naverage totals for the 6 years 1995-2000 when a Republican Senate \nmajority was determining how quickly to consider the judicial nominees \nof a Democratic President. By contrast, with today's confirmation, the \nSenate this year will have confirmed 68 judicial nominees, including 12 \ncircuit court nominees, almost double the totals for 1999.\n  We have worked hard to balance the need to fill judicial vacancies \nwith the imperative that Federal judges need to be fair. In so doing, \nwe have reduced the number of judicial vacancies today to 40. More than \n95 percent of the federal judgeships are filled. After inheriting 110 \nvacancies when the Senate Judiciary Committee reorganized under \nDemocratic control in 2001, I helped move through and confirm 100 of \nthe President's judicial nominees in just 17 months. With today's 68th \nconfirmation this year, we have reached the lowest number of vacancies \nin 13 years. There are more Federal judges on the bench today than at \nany time in American history. These facts stand in stark contrast to \nthe false partisan rhetoric that demonize the Senate for having blocked \nall of this President's judicial nominations. The reality is that the \nSenate is proceeding at a record pace and achieving record numbers.\n  I congratulate Mr. Titus and his family on his confirmation today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am especially pleased today to speak in \nsupport of our nominee to the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Maryland, Roger Titus.\n  When the White House nominated Mr. Titus last June, Judge Peter \nMessitte of the district of Maryland, who happens to be an old high \nschool classmate of Mr. Titus, called him a ``first-class appointment \nand just a great guy. He is really one of the finest lawyers around.'' \nI agree wholeheartedly.\n  Not only is Mr. Titus a ``great guy'' and ``one of the finest lawyers \naround,'' he is extremely well qualified--and well-deserving of the \nABA's unanimous Well Qualified rating. His credentials are impeccable.\n  Mr. Titus earned a B.A. from Johns Hopkins and a J.D. from Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center. Following his graduation from law school in \n1966, Mr. Titus entered public service. He was first appointed as an \nassistant city attorney for Rockville, Maryland. He served in that \ncapacity until 1970, at which time he was appointed city attorney.\n  While serving as a committed public servant, Mr. Titus established a \nprivate and prestigious law practice specializing in complex civil and \nappellate litigation. And in between serving in public office and \noperating a successful law practice, he found the time to teach at his \nalma mater, Georgetown University Law Center.\n  In 1988, Mr. Titus and his law partner merged their practice into \nVenable, Baetjer and Howard, LLP, where he is currently a partner. His \nclients include the Board of Education of Montgomery County, the \nMontgomery County government, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Igen \nInternational, Inc., and Circuit City Stores, Inc.\n  Fellow members of the Maryland bar have recognized Mr. Titus's \noutstanding legal skills. He has received numerous accolades, among \nthem fellowships in notable organizations such as the American Bar \nFoundation, the American College of Trial Lawyers, the American Academy \nof Appellate Lawyers, and the Maryland Bar Foundation. In 1989, he was \nappointed to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure \nof the Court of Appeals of Maryland. In 1999, he was one of seventeen \nliving attorneys to be awarded the Century of Service Award by the Bar \nAssociation of Montgomery County. And in 2001, he was awarded the \nLeadership in Law Award of The Daily Record.\n  Mr. Titus brings sterling credentials, legal acumen, and nearly 40 \nyears of experience to the Federal bench. He will undoubtedly be an \nexcellent addition to the bench and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting his confirmation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my enthusiastic \nsupport for Roger Titus, a dedicated and well-qualified Maryland \nlawyer, to be a Federal district court judge for the District of \nMaryland.\n  When I review nominees for our Federal courts, I consider three \ncriteria. They must have the utmost legal competence, the highest \nintegrity and have a staunch dedication to protecting core \nconstitutional values and guarantees. Mr. Titus meets all of these \nstandards. I believe he will represent Maryland well on the District \nCourt.\n  Mr. Titus is recognized as one of the best lawyers in Maryland. He \nhas been awarded Century of Service Award by the Bar Association of \nMontgomery County and has been recognized for his leadership in the \nlegal community with the Leadership on Law Award from The Baltimore \nDaily Record.\n  He is committed to serving the community and his profession. For over \n16 years he served city attorney's office of Rockville, rising to \nposition of city attorney. He is also a member of Board of Trustees of \nSuburban Hospital and pro bono counsel to Mobil Medical Care, Inc., a \nnonprofit dedicated to bringing health care services to Maryland's \nhomeless population.\n  The position that Mr. Titus is nominated for is important to \nprotecting the rights of all Marylanders. Mr. Titus will join two other \ndistinguished nominees that the Senate confirmed earlier this year, \nwhom I strongly supported, Judges Bennett and Quarles.\n  These nominees represent the types of lawyers that we should be \nputting on our Federal courts. They have strong bipartisan support, \ndistinguished legal careers in the state from which they are selected \nand they are in the mainstream of legal thought.\n\n[[Page S13996]]\n\n  One of the things that impresses me about Mr. Titus is his strong \nties to the community. Mr. Titus was raised in Maryland, attended \nBethesda/Chevy Chase high school and went to college at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity. He was the first in his family to go to law school. In \nfact, he was an electrical engineering major and had not really had any \nexposure to lawyers until he eloped with the daughter of a lawyer in \ncollege. From there the rest is history. He is now one of many in a \nfamily of lawyers.\n  As a young lawyer, he worked as assistant city attorney in Rockville \ndefending and representing the city. In 1972, he was appointed to be \nthe city attorney of Rockville were he continued to represent the city \nin matters of complex municipal law. He also served as adjunct law \nprofessor at Georgetown Law School and then went on to establish his \nown successful law firm.\n  In 1988, his firm merged with one of the top law firms in the United \nStates, based right here in Washington DC--the firm of Venable, Baetjer \nand Howard, LLP. Mr. Titus is a leader in the firm as the partner in \ncharge of the Montgomery County office and as a member of firm's \nManagement Board.\n  Roger Titus has had a distinguished legal career both working in the \npublic sector as the advocate for the city of Rockville before the \ncourts, and then in the private sector where he is known for his \nexpertise in complex civil litigation. It is because of his service to \nthe bar and his outstanding legal skills and intellect that Mr. Titus \nhas received a ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  Mr. Titus' dedication to the law is also seen in his work as a \nvolunteer counsel for Mobile Medical Care, Inc. This is an organization \nthat provides free medical services to poor and homeless persons. Some \nof the most vulnerable citizens in our society. As their legal counsel, \nhe helped them resolve legal hurdles which enabled them to set up a \nheadquarters in Bethesda, MD. His commitment to the law is also \nreflected in his service to the bar. As a member of the Standing \nCommittee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Court of Appeals of \nMaryland, he worked to secure guidelines for legal representation of \nminors in proceedings terminating parental rights.\n  I mentioned before the awards that Mr. Titus has received. These \naccolades from his colleagues are proof of the respect he has in the \nlegal community and his intellect and ability. They demonstrate his \nservice to bar and community and how much he has accomplished in \ncareer.\n  I do not know how Mr. Titus will vote on every issue that comes \nbefore him. I know he has been nominated by a Republican President, and \nit is likely that my beliefs and Mr. Titus' beliefs on certain issues \nwill differ. But I am confident that he will use his expertise and \nlegal experience to guide him as he makes important decisions affecting \nMarylanders. I am also confident that his legal background and respect \nfor the law will be his foundation as he serves on the Federal District \nCourt in Maryland.\n  I am impressed with Mr. Titus' commitment, expressed during his \nhearing before the Judiciary Committee, to adhering to the law. His \ndedication to following precedent and a statute's requirements, even \nwhere it is inconsistent with his own personal beliefs or is unpopular. \nIt is the ability to put the law first, to know that personal views are \nirrelevant, that will serve him and Maryland well when he is a Federal \ndistrict judge\n  I am proud to support this distinguished Maryland lawyer for a seat \non the prestigious Federal court in Maryland. It is well qualified, \ndistinguished members of the bar, who are respected in their legal \ncommunity and who are in the mainstream of legal thought, like Mr. \nTitus, that this administration should be nominating. These are \nnominees who have excelled in their profession and who are looked up to \nby Republicans and Democrats alike. Like Judges Quarles and Bennett, \nMr. Titus is a nominee who both of Maryland's Senators can support. We \nsupport him because we are foremost concerned with protecting the \nintegrity and excellence of the Maryland Federal judiciary.\n  That concern has lead both Senator Sarbanes and myself to work with \nand support the choices of the administration for these District Court \nnominees. That concern is why I wish the administration had looked to \nthe Maryland legal community when it nominated someone to fill the \nvacancy left by the death of Judge Francis Murnaghan, an esteemed \njurist who served on the Fourth Circuit for over 20 years.\n  Today, as I rise to enthusiastically support the nomination of Mr. \nTitus and as I have risen to support the other nominees for the \ndistrict court, I believe these individuals are a model of the types of \nlawyers that should be nominated to fill Judge Murnaghan's seat on the \nFourth Circuit. These nominees show that the President could easily \nnominate someone from Maryland who is fit for the bench and will serve \nwith pride and excellence. They also show that the administration would \nnot have to look far for a qualified nominee from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my support for the nomination of Roger W. Titus to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Maryland.\n  I have always believed that one of the most important roles I have as \na United States Senator is the responsibility to provide ``advice and \nconsent'' with respect to nominees to the Federal judiciary, and it is \nwith sober deliberation that I consider all nominations made by our \nPresidents. When considering nominees, I apply a high standard to \ndetermine whether to support them for the Federal bench. A candidate \nshould have had a career that has provided the breadth and depth of \nexperience necessary to be a Federal judge, have contributed to the \nlegal profession of our State, and have been an active participant in \nMaryland's civic community. All of these factors taken together must \nhave elevated the nominee to a position of respect and esteem in our \nState that demonstrates that the nominee is ready and worthy for the \nchallenges of a Federal judgeship.\n  Applying these standards, I am pleased to speak today on behalf of \nRoger Titus and urge the Senate to confirm his nomination. Roger Titus \nclearly meets these requirements, and will make a valuable contribution \non the District Court.\n  Roger Titus received his undergraduate degree from Johns Hopkins \nUniversity and his juris doctorate from Georgetown University Law \nCenter. His legal career has spanned more than 30 years, during which \ntime he has held a variety of positions in the public sector; private \nsector, with more than 30 years in private practice at firms large and \nsmall; and the academic field, as an adjunct professor at Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center.\n  Roger Titus' career in private practice has been broad in scope--a \nfact that will serve him well on the bench. Concentrating in \nlitigation, he has significant experience in State and local government \nlaw, general litigation, constitutional litigation, complex commercial \nlitigation, as well as appellate work. Roger Titus has also been a \nleader in Maryland's legal community, most notably serving as President \nof the Maryland State Bar Association, but also devoting his time to \nnumerous other legal organizations on a State, local and national level \nincluding the Bar Association of Montgomery County, American Bar \nAssociation, Maryland Municipal Attorneys Association, and the National \nConference of Bar Presidents, among others. During this busy career, he \nhas been active in the Maryland community, devoting substantial time to \nthe Maryland Bar Foundation and as Chairman and member of the Board of \nTrustees for Suburban Hospital.\n  Given this record, it is no surprise that the American Bar \nAssociation gave Roger Titus a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating in \nits evaluation of his nomination. He has also received a number of \nprestigious awards for his career and record of service, including the \nDaily Record's first Leadership in the Law Award, which recognizes \nmembers of the legal community for their devotion to the betterment of \nthe profession and their communities, and the Century of Service Award \nfrom the Montgomery County Bar Association, for his outstanding \ncontributions to the legal profession and community during the \ntwentieth century.\n  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak today on behalf of \nRoger Titus' nomination to the Federal\n\n[[Page S13997]]\n\nbench, and I would like to congratulate him and his family on his \nconfirmation. It is truly indicative of the exemplary career he has had \nin the legal profession, his commitment to our State, and the esteem \nwith which Marylanders view his accomplishments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time for the majority?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back? Without objection, \nall time is yielded back.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Roger W.

Mr. President, it is our intention to move next to the \namendment of the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka; and, after that, to \nthe amendment of Senator Cantwell. However, Senator Specter from \nPennsylvania has an amendment which he wishes to propose. The time will \nnot be long and he has another time commitment. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Specter be recognized before we proceed in the manner that \nI have outlined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nUtah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2080\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2080, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2080.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To limit the use of funds to allocate the rate of price \nsupport between the purchase prices for nonfat dry milk and butter in a \n manner that does not support the price of milk at the rate prescribed \n                                by law)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7__.

Mr. President, this is an amendment which I am offering \nfollowing a letter on July 8, 2003, to the Secretary of Agriculture, \ncosigned by some 20 Senators. This amendment provides that the \nSecretary must take immediate action concerning the Commodity Credit \nCorporation's purchase price for dairy products. The market price for \nindividual products has fallen below the support levels, thus allowing \nthe price of milk products to fall below the statutory level of $9.90 \nper hundredweight.\n  In the year 2000, 7 out of 12 months the price was below the $9.90 \nset at $8.57. In 2002, 4 out of 12 months were below the support price, \nand currently, in 2003, 6 out of 12 months were below the support price \nset at $9.11.\n  This amendment prohibits the expenditures in the Department of \nAgriculture unless they follow the clear-cut mandate of existing law, \nwhich is to have the prices set.\n  I had understood a few moments ago that this was cleared on both \nsides, but it may be that there are some objections to be lodged. It is \nmy hope that this can be worked out in the course of the afternoon.\n  I thank my colleagues for yielding these few minutes. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2088\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. \n2673, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2004, that will \nhelp protect the health of the American public. This amendment would \nprohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) from utilizing funds \nunder this Act to approve downed animals for human consumption. I thank \nSenators Levin, Cantwell, and Lieberman for cosponsoring this \namendment.\n  Downed animals are livestock such as cattle, sheep, swine, goats, \nhorses, mules, or other equines that are too sick to stand or walk \nunassisted. Many of these animals are dying from infectious diseases \nand present a significant pathway for the spread of disease.\n  I commend USDA and livestock organizations for their efforts to \naddress the issue of downed animals. However, I am deeply concerned \nabout diseases such as BSE, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, more \ncommonly known as mad cow disease, that pose a serious risk to the \nUnited States cattle industry and human health. A food inspection study \nconducted in Germany in 2001 found that BSE is present in a higher \npercentage of downed livestock than in the general cattle population. \nUSDA stated that downed animals are one of the most significant \npotential pathways that have not been addressed in previous efforts to \nreduce risks from BSE. Stronger legislation is needed to ensure that \nthese animals do not enter our food chain. My amendment prevents downed \nanimals from being approved for consumption at our dinner tables.\n  On January 21st of this year, USDA's Animal and Plant Health \nInspection\n\n[[Page S13998]]\n\nService (APHIS) proposed rules in the Federal Register asking for \ncomments on reducing the risks of BSE from downed and dead livestock. \nIn the proposed rules, USDA acknowledges that downed animals serve as a \npotential pathway for the spread of BSE. Currently, before slaughter, \nUSDA's Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) diverts downer livestock \nthat exhibit clinical signs associated with BSE or other types of \ndiseases until further tests may be taken. However, this does not mean \nthat downed livestock cannot be processed for human consumption. If \ndowner cattle presented for slaughter pass both the pre- and post-\ninspection process, meat and meat by-products from such cattle can be \nused for human consumption. Routinely, BSE is not correctly \ndistinguished from many other diseases and conditions that show similar \nsymptoms. This was demonstrated by the surveillance of a similar \ninspection process in Europe, showing that the process is inadequate \nfor detecting BSE. Consequently, BSE-infected cattle can be approved \nfor human and animal consumption.\n  Although USDA increased the number of cattle tested for BSE from \n5,200 during the year 2001 to 19,990 in the year 2002, this still \nrepresents less than one percent of the industry that is tested. Of the \n5,200 cattle tested for BSE in fiscal year 2001, approximately 87 \npercent of the animals targeted for testing were downed. Today, USDA \nhas increased its efforts to test approximately 10 percent of downed \ncattle per year for BSE. It is interesting to note, however, that Japan \ncurrently tests each of its 1.3 million beef cattle slaughtered \nannually for BSE. While I am not asking the industry and Federal \nGovernment to test every slaughtered cow, I am asking the Federal \nGovernment to address and reduce the real risks associated with BSE and \nsimilar diseases in the U.S.\n  Some individuals fear that my amendment would place an excessive \nfinancial burden on the livestock industry. I want to remind my \ncolleagues that one single downed cow in Canada diagnosed with BSE this \nyear shut down the world's third largest beef exporter. It is estimated \nthat the Canadian beef industry lost over $1 billion as a result of the \ndiscovery of BSE and more than 30 countries banned Canadian cattle and \nbeef. As the Canadian cattle industry continues to recover from its \neconomic loss, it is prudent for the United States to be proactive in \npreventing BSE and other animal diseases from entering our food chain.\n  We must protect our livestock industry and human health from diseases \nsuch as BSE. My amendment reduces the threat of passing diseases from \ndowned livestock to our food supply. USDA only tests a small sample of \ndowned animals for diseases. This is not enough. My amendment ensures \ndowned animals will not be used for human consumption. It also requires \nhigher standards for food safety and protects human health from \ndiseases and the livestock industry from economic distress.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it would be my intention on this side to \naccept this amendment.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I ask my amendment be set aside momentarily and we return \nto it at a future time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has not formally sent up the \namendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I assumed we would go to the amendment from the Senator \nfrom Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii has not sent his \namendment to the desk.\n  Without objection, the pending amendments are set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka], for himself, and Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Lieberman, and Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2088.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To restrict funding for the approval for human consumption of \n                   meat produced from downed animals)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7__.

PROHIBITION OF ENERGY MARKET MANIPULATION.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Part II of the Federal Power Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 824 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 215. PROHIBITION OF MARKET MANIPULATION.\n\n       ``It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or \n     indirectly, to use or employ, in connection with the purchase \n     or sale of electric energy or the purchase or sale of \n     transmission services subject to the jurisdiction of the \n     Commission, any manipulative or deceptive device or \n     contrivance in contravention of such regulations as the \n     Commission may promulgate as appropriate in the public \n     interest or for the protection of electric ratepayers.''.\n       (b) Rates Resulting From Market Manipulation.--Section \n     205(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824d(a)) is \n     amended by inserting after ``not just and reasonable'' the \n     following: ``or that result from a manipulative or deceptive \n     device or contrivance''.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Bingaman, \nHollings, Jeffords, Dorgan, and Feingold be added as cosponsors to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the time to discuss this \nissue.\n  Some colleagues may wonder why we are talking about energy \nlegislation and market manipulation on the Agriculture appropriations \nbill. As my colleague from California pointed out in the previous \namendment on derivatives legislation and market manipulation \nprevention, this was part of an agreement that the Western Senators \nworked out when we were discussing the Energy bill prior to our August \nrecess. The fact that we were willing to move off that debate on a \nvariety of amendments was because we had a commitment for a chance to \nhave further discussion on important issues that impacted the economies \nof Western States.\n  That was the agreement made at that time, and today is the moment in \nwhich Senator Feinstein and I both have our opportunities to discuss \nwhat we consider very important legislation and to get the Congress on \nthe record and make sure the Senate takes a stand against market \nmanipulation.\n  Many Members know a lot has happened since the time of discussion of \nthese issues about the energy crisis and what we should do. But we \nshould be clear about the sequencing of things that the United States \nnow knows and understands. The Senate knows and understands that Enron \nhas admitted market manipulation. They have executives who have said, \nyes, these contracts were manipulated and prices were faulty.\n  We have a report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission so thick \nit is hard for me to hold in one hand that goes through a variety of \nissues in relation to market manipulation in which FERC found there was \nnot only manipulation, but a demonstration for the need of explicit \nprohibitions on this kind of harmful and fraudulent market behavior.\n  That is exactly what this amendment tries to address. The amendment I \nhave offered, and Senator Bingaman and others have offered, says \nsomething very basic and simple that probably many Americans, and I \nguarantee many Washingtonians, assumed would\n\n[[Page S13999]]\n\nalready be in a Federal statute such as the Federal Power Act. The \namendment simply says that manipulation or manipulated contracts under \nthe Federal Power Act cannot be just and reasonable.\n\n  Some of my colleagues may have remembered an earlier amendment where \nwe prescribed some solutions. This amendment has been compromised and \noffers no specific remedies to the legislation but is specific in \nsaying that market manipulation, in fact, is not something that can be \njust and reasonable under the Federal Power Act and it is not the kind \nof activity that the Commission should consider as lawful activity.\n  Most of my colleagues would say that manipulation and fraud surely \nhas no place in the Federal Power Act; sanctioning those activities is \nsomehow legal. But the absence of that prohibition in the Federal Power \nAct is leaving some doubt in people's minds that, in fact, manipulation \nis unlawful.\n  I bring that up because Washingtonians--as Ohio, Indiana, Nevada, \nCalifornia, Utah--have been suffering from high energy costs related to \nthese manipulations of Enron contracts. Not only will they be stuck \nwith paying those Enron contracts over a long period of time, but my \nState, the State of Washington, had utilities as much as a 50-percent \nrate increase because of Enron's contracts, and we will be stuck with \nthose contracts over 5 years.\n  While Ken Lay remains uncharged, or at least not paying any dues for \nthe crime he perpetrated, and he keeps the millions of dollars of money \nthat he has gotten from Enron, my ratepayers in Washington State for \nthe next 5 years will end up paying the high prices of those \nmanipulated contracts. Not only will we end up paying the high prices \nof those manipulated contracts, but the utilities in my State and other \nStates--Nevada, California, Oregon, some of the other Midwest States I \nmentioned--have tried to basically deal with Enron. They have been \nbasically sued by the company. So not only is my ratepayer stuck with \npaying those high utility bills, they are actually trying to fight the \nlegal battle against Enron, which is turning around and suing them.\n  My amendment does something very simple today. It basically says in \nthe Federal Power Act that for the prospective issue of making sure it \nis clear to people throughout the country that the Senate does not \ntolerate market manipulation.\n  I have to say we have done great work on this issue as it relates to \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, and as it relates to making \nsure that accounting practices have been changed. But nowhere have we \nbeen specific in saying that market manipulation is an unlawful \npractice and cannot be just and reasonable under the Power Act. That is \nsimply what we are trying to say today.\n  Why is that needed? I have a letter I circulated to my colleagues \nfrom one of the newest nominees to the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, a Republican nominee who spent many hours in the \nlegislative branch working under Energy Secretary Abraham and spent \ntime in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to whom I posed this \nquestion as a nominee before FERC because I wanted to understand where \nFERC nominees were going in the future.\n  Mr. Kelliher responded exactly where I think the input needs to be to \nthe Senate. He said:\n\n       I agree with much of what you have said. I agree that the \n     markets subject to manipulation cannot operate properly and \n     there is an urgent need to proscribe manipulation of \n     electricity markets.\n\n  He further states:\n\n       You have correctly noted that there is no express \n     prohibition of market manipulation in the Federal Power Act \n     and have proposed legislation to establish that prohibition. \n     This is a critical point. The Federal Regulatory Commission \n     only has the tools Congress chooses to give it, and Congress \n     has never given the Commission express authority to prohibit \n     market manipulation. I believe the time has come for Congress \n     to take that step.\n\n  That is an exact quote from a letter by the FERC nominee Joseph \nKelliher from the administration saying, ``You want me to be a FERC \ncommissioner? I am telling you exactly what I think about the FERC \nrules. And I am telling you we need the language that is in this \namendment.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: I am writing at your request to \n     explain at greater length my views on legislation to prohibit \n     manipulation of electricity markets.\n       I have followed your comments on market manipulation with \n     great interest during the two years since my nomination was \n     announced. I agree with much of what you have said. I agree \n     that markets subject to manipulation cannot operate properly \n     and there is an urgent need to proscribe manipulation of \n     electricity markets. You have correctly noted there is no \n     express prohibition of market manipulation in the Federal \n     Power Act and have proposed legislation to establish an \n     express prohibition. This is a critical point. The Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission only has the tools that Congress \n     chooses to give it, and Congress has never given the \n     Commission express authority to prohibit market manipulation. \n     I believe the time has come for Congress to take that step.\n       Market manipulation is a relatively recent development in \n     electricity markets, but it is not a new problem. \n     Manipulation has occurred in other markets, and Congress has \n     enacted laws to proscribe manipulation in these markets. \n     These laws can serve as models for legislation to prohibit \n     manipulation of electricity markets.\n       Securities and commodities law establish an express \n     prohibition of market manipulation and authorize a regulatory \n     agency to prohibit specific manipulative practices by \n     rulemaking. That approach allows an agency to act quickly \n     once manipulative practices are identified. These models have \n     worked well over time and could serve as the basis for \n     legislation to prohibit manipulation of electricity markets.\n       The penalties authorized by congress in the Federal Power \n     Act are unlikely to discourage criminal behavior. For that \n     reason, tougher penalties--both higher monetary penalties and \n     longer prison terms--are needed. Legislation is necessary to \n     accomplish this. I should note that I advocated tougher \n     penalties well before the Western electricity crisis and \n     subsequent release of the Enron marketing memoranda. In \n     addition to higher monetary penalties and longer prison \n     terms, I recommend Congress grant the Commission authority to \n     impose a lifetime ban on individuals found guilty of criminal \n     violations of market manipulation laws. That authority exists \n     at the regulatory agencies that oversee securities and \n     commodities markets, and I see no reason why market \n     manipulation in electricity markets should be subject to \n     lesser sanction.\n       This is not to say that the Commission cannot take steps to \n     prevent market manipulation under its existing legal \n     authority. For example, the Commission can revoke the \n     authorization of a public utility to sell electricity at \n     market-based rates if it determines the public utility \n     engaged in market manipulation. Further, I believe the \n     Commission could prohibit manipulative practices under \n     section 206 of the Federal Power Act if it determined that \n     such practices were inherently unjust, unreasonable, unduly \n     discriminatory or preferential. Since there would likely be \n     legal challenges to any such effort to proscribe manipulative \n     practices, it would be helpful for Congress to give the \n     Commission clear authority to prohibit market manipulation.\n       At you request, I have reviewed your marked manipulation \n     amendment. I support the goals of your amendment and believe \n     it would go far towards effectively prohibiting manipulation \n     of electricity markets.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on this \n     subject with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Joseph T. Kelliher.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I think the Kelliher letter and the \nreport we have seen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on \nprice manipulation in western markets is the evidence we need. We have \nall admitted this manipulation has taken place. What is not clear to \nthe American public is if we plan to do anything about it or if we plan \nto prohibit it in the future.\n  I think we need to be clear. The language I have offered in this \namendment, as I said, is very simple and straightforward. It is that \nway because we want to make sure the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission does not misinterpret the intent of Congress, that Congress \nneeds to say manipulating prices cannot be just and reasonable or in \nthe public interest, and their job is to basically protect electric \nratepayers from these kinds of manipulation.\n  I am not going to continue to take up the time of my colleagues who \nhave heard about this amendment and have had an opportunity to review \nit. I urge them, as part of our further understanding of where the \nEnergy bill is, that it is being set aside. This is the opportunity \nbefore us to make sure we\n\n[[Page S14000]]\n\ntake a stand against market manipulation and we need to make it clear \nto the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which seems to be unclear \nabout what authority they currently have, and to make it explicit that \nmarket manipulation cannot be tolerated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, quick housekeeping.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2088\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we go back to the Akaka \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I call for a vote on the Akaka amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 2088.\n  The amendment (No. 2088) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2087\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I move that we go back to the Cantwell \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am not familiar with this issue, but I \nhave asked members of the Energy Committee about it, and they have \nindicated opposition to the Cantwell amendment. There are some members \nof that committee who are on their way here. In the meantime, I will \nshare with my colleagues the contents of a memorandum with respect to \nthe Cantwell amendment that has been provided to Senator Domenici.\n  In this memorandum, the following objections are raised.\n  First:\n\n       FERC has and is using its authority to stop fraud and \n     manipulation. . . .\n       FERC has demonstrated that it will use the full extent of \n     its authority to assure honest, fair wholesale electricity \n     markets.\n\n  FERC has taken a number of initiatives which are listed in the memo \nand which I will share with Members if the appropriate members of the \nEnergy Committee do not arrive.\n  The second objection to the Cantwell amendment is that it is too \nvague. It is suggested that:\n\n       It is written in such general terms that it will lead to \n     greater uncertainty. A general ban on manipulation will not \n     help companies determine what conduct amounts to manipulation \n     and what conduct is appropriate behavior in a competitive \n     market. . . . [A] blanket prohibition on ``manipulation,'' \n     without defining the elements of what constitutes \n     manipulation . . . could have a chilling effect on the market \n     without meaningfully adding to the protections already \n     available to electricity customers under existing law.\n\n  The third objection is that:\n\n       The Cantwell Amendment could lead to duplication and \n     confusion among the agencies.\n       The enabling statutes of the Commodity and Futures Trading \n     Commission (CFTC) and the Securities Exchange Commission \n     (SEC) already contain broad prohibitions against conduct that \n     is intended to manipulate markets. Adding such another broad \n     general prohibition to the Federal Power Act would only lead \n     to unnecessary duplication and potential conflict between \n     various enforcement agencies.\n       In addition, the Federal Power Act already prohibits \n     wholesale electricity prices that are not ``just and \n     reasonable.'' Therefore, FERC has the authority to \n     investigate electricity prices and to require refunds if \n     prices are not ``just or reasonable'' or modify contracts if \n     it is in the public interest to do so.\n       The House and Senate Energy bills both would enhance FERC's \n     existing refund authority and increase civil and criminal \n     penalties for violations of the Federal Power Act.\n\n  The memo makes the point that this issue has been addressed in the \nEnergy bill, and that is the place for it to be done.\n  The next objection raised is:\n\n       The number of Federal investigations and prosecutions by a \n     broad array of agencies demonstrates there is no need for the \n     Cantwell Amendment.\n       Federal agencies have been and continue to be active in \n     investigating criminal offenses in the energy industry.\n\n  These agencies as listed in the memorandum include the President's \nCorporate Fraud Task Force, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the United States \nPostal Service, and numerous U.S. Attorney's offices across the \ncountry.\n\n       Through ``cooperative enforcement,'' these agencies have \n     focused on investigations of possible round trip trading, \n     false reporting and fraud and manipulation by energy \n     companies and their affiliates, employees and agents. There \n     have been a number of arrests, settlements and continued \n     investigations and prosecutions reported based on these \n     agencies' efforts.\n\n  And the argument is made that:\n\n       The Cantwell Amendment will not improve or change these \n     actions.\n\n  Then reference is made to:\n\n       The Domenici Electricity Amendment effectively deals with \n     market manipulation.\n\n  This is the amendment that is part of the Energy bill that is now in \nconference. The memo outlines all the reasons why that particular \namendment is sufficient.\n  As I say, I am waiting for a member of the Energy Committee to come \nmake these arguments with perhaps a little more background than I have. \nI would like to move to a vote on this amendment, so I ask, before I \nwould suggest the absence of a quorum, if the Senator from Washington \nwould agree to a vote, let us say, at 4:20. Would that be a sufficient \nperiod of time for the Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I have not taken up a significant amount \nof time because I think Members have been educated on this issue, so I \nwould suggest we just go ahead and vote on the issue and move ahead.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator is suggesting we vote right now? I am \nwilling. I am anxious to move as much time as possible. If the Senator \nis ready, if there is no one else who wants to speak on this issue----\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am sure there are Members who, if they \nhad the time, would come and speak, but I think to make this process \nmove as smoothly as possible, I see no need to continue to wait for \nMembers of the Energy Committee to show up. If Members are here who \nwant to speak on behalf of the amendment, one way or another----\n  Mr. BENNETT. I see the Senator from Nevada is on the floor, and he \nmay wish to speak.\n  I would ask, then, following the remarks of the Senator from Nevada, \nif no other Senator has come wishing to speak, we proceed directly to \nthe vote.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have always been a great admirer of the \nSenator from the State of Washington. She always steps forward with \namendments that are extremely important.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would propound a unanimous consent request that the \nvote occur at 4:30.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do not think there is going to be a vote \nvery soon on this matter. I think it is going to be quite a long time \nbefore we vote. We have a lot of things we need to talk about.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reid are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe maybe we need a vote.\n  So when would my friend from Utah like to vote?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would be happy to vote on the Cantwell \namendment immediately and then go on to other business connected to the \nbill.\n  Mr. REID. I think the Senator should move forward.\n\n[[Page S14001]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the Cantwell amendment No. \n2087. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand there are several Senators \nwho have amendments they would like to offer. Senator Dayton has one. \nSenator Bingaman has one. We have not yet had an opportunity to go \nthrough the Bingaman amendment which came to us relatively recently. So \nI would prefer to go to Senator Dayton to give us a little more time to \nexamine the Bingaman amendment, but that could be the decision of the \nminority. I prefer to go to Senator Dayton's amendment next if that is \nagreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I defer to the manager of the bill. If \nhe would like time to review the amendment that I have given him, I \nhave no problem with that course of action.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask Senator Dayton if he would give us \nsome indication of how long he thinks he will take on his amendment and \nsee if we cannot enter into a time agreement so that we can know when \nwe might be able to vote.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, responding to the distinguished manager of \nthe bill, I myself will take less than 10 minutes. It is my \nunderstanding there may be one or two other Senators who wish to speak \non this matter. I do not have their requests before me.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent then that we vote \non the Dayton amendment at 5:15.\n  Mr. REID. I object. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. It is my understanding then that I have the floor to \nproceed but there is no further agreement thereafter; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no agreement.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2089\n\n  (Purpose: To provide emergency disaster assistance to Agricultural \n                               producers)\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2089.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this summer farmers in my State of \nMinnesota suffered one of the worst droughts in the State's history. \nThroughout the critical months of July and August, Minnesota received \nno rain whatsoever. Those cloudless blue skies with lots of warm \nsunshine which are considered good summer weather become deadly when it \nbecomes relentless. Ninety-five percent of Minnesota's crop acres \nsuffered some loss as a result, and 62 of our 87 counties were declared \nby the Secretary of Agriculture to be disaster area counties. Yields, \nmoisture content, and overall quality of crops were all adversely \naffected by this drought.\n  To add misery to injury, insect infestation attacked thousands of \nsoybean acres in southern Minnesota, further destroying plants, \nlowering yields, and forcing already hard-pressed growers to spend \n$10,000, $20,000, or even more to spray their fields in order to fight \noff total devastation.\n  In total, Minnesota farmers lost more than $1.1 billion in expected \ncrop revenues. That is over 30 percent of our State's total crop \nrevenue.\n  Yet, tragically, another disaster afflicts those unfortunate farmers \nand thousands of other farmers who suffered similar losses in other \nStates this year. That disaster is that there is no disaster aid \nfunding in the current farm law which was enacted last year. The Senate \nbill that we passed here provided disaster aid. The House bill did not. \nThe conference report, regrettably, took the House and the \nadministration's position, with the result that if you are hurt by low \nprices, you are helped under the current law, but if you are \ndevastated, you are on your own and receive no assistance whatsoever.\n  My amendment provides assistance when disaster does strike. It does \nso by starting with the formula that was used in last year's disaster \naid bill; from losses exceeding 35 percent of total value, farmers \nreceived disaster aid payments equal to 65 percent of the losses above \nthe 35 percent threshold. It is a survival payment. It is not a break-\neven and certainly not a profit payment.\n  My amendment also adds a lower reimbursement for losses between 25 \npercent and 35 percent of value. Formerly, those losses would have \nreceived no assistance whatsoever. This formula pays 40 percent of \nthose losses between 20 percent and 35 percent of total value.\n  The amendment also covers unreimbursed losses during the 2001 and \n2002 seasons. As my colleagues will recall, farmers who suffered \ndisasters in both of those years were allowed to receive payments from \nlosses in only one of them. In other words, disaster aid is Sophie's \nchoice. This amendment would compensate those farmers for their losses \nin the second year.\n  My amendment as written covered program crop losses and specialty \ncrop losses throughout the country. However, I have also added, at the \nrequest of other Members, losses suffered during the year, which means \nthe amendment now covers losses of shrimp in Louisiana, North Carolina, \nSouth Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas, and \nother losses which occurred in the States of Michigan, Florida, and \nCalifornia, as well as other national specialty crops.\n  The total cost of my amendment, as estimated by the Congressional \nBudget Office, is approximately $6.3 billion. Because it is, in my \nview, an emergency expenditure, I do not believe it requires, under the \nBudget Act, an offset, and I am not providing one.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceed to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S14002]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the chairman if this is an appropriate time for me \nto make a 10- or 15-minute statement relative to an amendment which you \nhave accepted on the FDA and dietary supplements.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask the Senator if he would withhold for just a \nmoment. We are trying to pull a few things together. But I am more than \nhappy to have the time appropriately spent other than in a quorum call.\n  If the Senator will withhold for just a few moments, I will be in a \nposition to respond.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the chairman of the Budget Committee is \nanxious to come over to develop the issue of the budget point of order \nfor emergency designation with respect to the amendment offered by \nSenator Dayton. As he has indicated, it is $6.3 billion, and there is \nno offset in the bill. Our bill is $1 billion below last year's fiscal \nyear 302(b) allocation, and therefore this is obviously a very \nsignificant number.\n  Until the Senator from Oklahoma, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, has an opportunity to be here to review this matter with us, \nI would be willing to allow the Senator from New Mexico to begin the \ndescription of his amendment because I understand he would like to get \nthat done. He has a timeframe tonight. And we could view the \npossibility of voting on both amendments at some point when the debate \non both amendments has subsided rather than keeping the time tied up in \na quorum call.\n  With recognition of the pressures the Senator from New Mexico is \nunder, I would like to perhaps move ahead on both of those amendments \non a double track situation.\n  Mr. REID. I object. If there is going to be a request to set aside \nthe Dayton amendment, I object.\n  Mr. BENNETT. All right. There is objection. Therefore, I do not \npursue that. I suggest to the Senator from Illinois this might be a \ngood time to hear from him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair of the committee and the ranking \nmember, Senator Kohl of Wisconsin, for agreeing to an amendment which \nwill be offered here in a moment as part of a managers' amendment, to \nmy understanding. This is an amendment with which I tried to construct \na deal, facing what I consider to be an extremely serious situation.\n  We now have a body of law in America relative to products which are \nsold for human consumption, and there are different laws and standards \nfor different products. The ordinary American walking into a pharmacy \nor drugstore or health food store or nutrition store may not know that, \ndepending on which product you take off the shelf, there is a different \nstandard of care, a different legal requirement.\n  I would like to spend a moment to discuss the differences.\n  If you were to go into your local pharmacy and have a prescription \nfilled--which many of us have--this is what you know. This prescription \ndrug has been tested for three things before it was sold to you. First, \nthat it is safe, that you can consume it without injuring yourself; \nsecond, that it is efficacious, meaning it will do what it is supposed \nto do; and, third, it has been packaged and manufactured in a fashion \nso when they say it is 200 milligrams, it is in fact 200 milligrams. \nYou know that. The Food and Drug Administration has required clinical \ntests to make sure it is safe--efficacious--and packaged in a fashion \nas it is represented. With that assurance, your doctor prescribes it \nand you take the medicine.\n  Now you walk down from the pharmacy counter in the drugstore and you \ndecide to pick up some cough syrup such as this. You have bought this \ncough syrup. The question is: What standard of care, what body of law \ngoverned the manufacture of this over-the-counter drug, in this case, \nRobitussin DM, which was previously a prescription drug. It went \nthrough the same test for safety and efficacy to determine whether or \nnot it met those tests and could be sold. Then it reached a point where \na medical decision was made that you no longer needed a prescription \nand the component parts of this drug meet the same test of safety and \nefficacy and it is packaged in such a fashion that you know what you \nare buying.\n  I might also add for both the prescription drug and the over-the-\ncounter drugs, which I have just described, if something happens--if \nyou take this prescription, for example, and have a bad health result \nor this over-the-counter drug with a bad health report and you report \nit to the company or to your doctor, it is expected and required that \nadverse event, as it is known, will be reported to the Food and Drug \nAdministration. They keep track of those. If they find out what they \nthought was a safe drug turns out to have a bad reaction, they will \npull it from the market. The same is true with an over-the-counter \ndrug. You know the standard of care for both prescription drugs and \nover-the-counter drugs.\n  We have other things which you will find in that same drugstore. One \nof them would be ordinary vitamin pills, the kind I took this morning. \nWhat are the standards for these vitamins--vitamin C or ordinary \nmultivitamins? Unfortunately, the standards are much different. In this \ncase, they are basically being manufactured and sold without the same \nclinical tests. No one has tested them for safety, for efficacy. \nFrankly, the standards for many are questionable as to even how they \nare packaged and sold to the public. But the belief is most of these \nnaturally occurring minerals and vitamins and this type of supplement \nare generally good for your health. Those who believe in them take them \nfor a variety of conditions. It is believed they cause no great harm; \nin fact, that they may have real health benefits.\n  We passed a law about 9 years ago which established a standard for \nsomething we call dietary supplements which are also for sale in the \nsame drugstore with prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and \nvitamins. These dietary supplements might be one such as this, natural \nherbal formula to promote energy and diet. What kind of standard of \ntesting went into this product? The answer is none. There was \nno testing in advance required by law that what is included in this \nbottle is safe for human consumption or in fact even helps you when it \ncomes to your energy or diet, and few, if any, standards about whether \nor not when they say this is 200 grams of one thing or another, in \nfact, are included. When you buy a dietary supplement, frankly, there \nare no standards of testing and care before the product is put on the \nshelf for the consumers.\n\n  I tell you this by way of background because that is why this \namendment is important. When we passed the Dietary Supplement Health \nEducation Act, we said we were dealing with natural supplements like \nvitamin C and garlic, multivitamins and the like. What has happened \nover the past 8 or 9 years is we have gone way beyond the basic \nvitamins. We now find a witches brew of a variety of different dietary \nsupplements way beyond vitamins and minerals that are being sold under \nthe same law with no testing standards, with no establishment of their \nsafety or efficacy, no standards as to how they are packaged, and no \nrequirement that they report adverse events to the FDA. As you walk \ninto the drugstore and fill your prescription and walk past the \ncounters, the American consumer has no idea that at end of the counter, \nthe standard of protection and care changes depending on what you are \nbuying.\n  That is why I am offering an amendment to this bill which earmarks \n$250,000 for the Food and Drug Administration to examine one particular \ncompound being sold in dietary supplements. The compound is ephedrine. \nEphedrine is a naturally occurring chemical that one finds similar to \nthe synthetic chemical ephedra. Ephedrine is very closely monitored by \nFDA in\n\n[[Page S14003]]\n\nboth prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs. But when it is sold \nin these types of dietary supplements, it isn't tested for safety, it \nisn't tested for efficacy, and it isn't tested in terms of how much is \nincluded in the bottle, and certainly no requirement for adverse events \nto be reported to the FDA.\n  Sadly, this product I have in my hand, known as Yellow Jackets, is \nsold as an extreme energizer, an herbal dietary supplement containing \nephedrine. The reason I have kept this bottle is because 30 miles from \nmy hometown in Springfield, IL, just last year a young man who was a \nhigh school senior and a football player in preparation for a football \ngame decided he needed a shot of energy, a boost of strength to go out \nand play for his team. He went into a local gas station and bought \nthese Yellow Jacket energizers and washed them down with Mountain Dew, \nwhich is heavy in caffeine, had a heart attack, and died. Ephedra \nproducts, as a consequence, have been under suspicion for a long time.\n  The sad reality is the United States is almost last in the world when \nit comes to dealing with ephedra products. You may not know it, but \nalmost 2 years ago Canada banned ephedra products for sale in their \ncountry. They said it is too dangerous. Over a year ago, the American \nMedical Association said to the Food and Drug Administration, take \nthese ephedra products off the shelf; they are dangerous. After 30 \nservice men and women had serious adverse health effects, we have \nremoved all ephedra products from military commissaries across the \nUnited States. The National Football League, the NCAA, the National \nBasketball Association, and major league baseball have banned the use \nof these products. You can't use them if you want to compete in Olympic \ncompetition. Yet kids in junior high and high school can walk into a \ngas station and still buy this in most States, with the exception of \nIllinois, and I believe New York and California have joined suit in \nbanning ephedra products.\n\n  Over a year ago, I wrote to Secretary Tommy Thompson of Health and \nHuman Services and said you have to do something. If Canada believes \nthey are dangerous, if we think they are dangerous for service men and \nwomen, if the American Medical Association says they are dangerous, and \nif major sports have banned them, why in the world do we allow them to \nbe sold in America?\n  What happened in the meantime is the Government did absolutely \nnothing--issued a press release and did nothing to take these products \noff the shelf.\n  What happened was a lot of the victims and their families went into \ncourtrooms. A lot of people are critical of people filing lawsuits. \nThis is a clear example where that was the only place to turn to \nprotect innocent families and victims across America. Because of the \nclass action lawsuits that were filed, we have now determined there \nwere over 16,500 adverse events reports related to ephedra products \nthat had been accumulated by all the companies that were selling them. \nNow they had to turn them over and disclose them.\n  Within those 16,500 adverse events there were events including \nseizures, strokes, and 155 deaths. I think, frankly, we all know what \nis at stake here. We realize major drugstores see liability if they \ncontinue to sell products like these Yellow Jackets and they will take \nthem off the shelf. Walgreen's, CVS, Eckerd, Rite Aid, and Wal-Mart, \nrepresenting 17,300 stores nationwide, have pulled these ephedra-\ncontaining dietary supplements from shelves. GNC, the largest specialty \nretailer of nutritional supplements in the country, with 5,300 stores \nnationwide, stopped selling ephedra products in June.\n  One of the largest sellers of ephedra products, Metabolite--I am sure \nyou have heard that name--sold ephedra compounds and was sued right and \nleft because of these compounds. They said at one point they didn't \nhave any adverse event reports. After they were pressed in a lawsuit \nthey turned over thousands of examples of people who had bad health \nevents because they took Metabolite's ephedra products.\n  Metabalife is now advertising what they are selling is ``Ephedra \nfree.'' Despite all this having taken place, our Government has done \nnothing, absolutely nothing. I have written over and over again to \nSecretary Thompson. I have met with Dr. McClellan, the doctor in charge \nof the Food and Drug Administration, and asked: When are you going to \nstart protecting Americans? We have a clinical trial in America today. \nWe are selling Ephedra to innocent people and seeing if they have a \nseizure or heart attack.\n  Secretary Thompson, in April, said he was concerned about Ephedra and \nhad taken more and stronger actions to address public health issues \nraised by Ephedra alkaloid than in the previous decade.\n  That was his letter to me in April. Since Secretary Thompson wrote \nthat letter to me, another 38 reports of death related to Ephedra have \nbeen accumulated, bringing the total to 155.\n  A representative of the FDA spoke in front of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee last week and said the Agency is in the process of analyzing \n30,000 comments they have received in response to the reopening of the \n1997 proposed rule on Ephedra and they are reviewing scientific \nevidence. Of course, delay means death, delay means injury, and delay \nis evidence that the Food and Drug Administration is not meeting its \nobligation under the law to protect American families from dangerous \nproducts.\n  We had a hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee before Senator \nMcCain last week. A case was made very clearly that it is time to \nchange the law. But first, get Ephedra off the shelves. That is why I \nintroduced this amendment, put $250,000 in the FDA, earmarked to deal \nwith Ephedra, to get an answer, get a conclusion and get it off the \nshelf as quickly as possible.\n  When that is done, we will have made progress. But we need to do \nmore. The makers of dietary supplements such as this one must be \nrequired by law to report to the Food and Drug Administration if people \nare dying from their products. That is not too much to ask in this \nsociety. Those who say that, because I am going after a deadly product \nlike yellow jackets, that my real war is against vitamin C just do not \nunderstand the reality. The reality is vitamin C can help. Vitamin C is \nnot going to kill you.\n  This product killed a 16-year-old high school football player in \nLincoln, IL. It has been attributed to the death of a Major League \nbaseball player of the Baltimore Orioles.\n  I asked the committee to earmark this money. I am glad the chairman \nhas accepted. I hope that finally this will push Health and Human \nServices into doing the right thing and banning this dangerous \nsubstance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, thank you very much for this \nopportunity to speak on an issue important not only to my State but \nalso to other States in my country as it continues to plague \nagricultural producers all over the United States. I thank Senator \nDayton, my colleague from Minnesota, for offering this amendment and \nfor his continuing good work on this important issue.\n  Last year at this time this Chamber had a prolonged debate on whether \nto provide much needed emergency drought assistance to those hurt by \ncontinuing record drought. Some argued that there should be no \nassistance; others argued that, unlike with every other national \ndisaster, assistance for drought victims should be funded through \noffsets. Some even argued we could always come back to take care of \nthese victims at a later date.\n  Still some argued that a drought is no less devastating than a \nhurricane or flood for those who are affected and it should be treated \nas we would treat other natural disasters, by providing full \nassistance, treat it as an emergency, which, in fact, it is.\n  It took a while to get any help to our agricultural producers. \nDespite the plague of bankruptcies and the anticipated loss of \nthousands of family farms across the country, we could not get drought \nassistance passed until last spring, nearly 2 years after the worst of \nthe drought had begun. That assistance came at a cost.\n  It covered less than half of the damage the USDA estimated had been \ncaused by the drought, and it was paid for out of elements of the new \nfarm\n\n[[Page S14004]]\n\nbill, robbing Paul to pay Paul. To survive, our farmers would have to \nsacrifice their future for their present.\n  Despite all that, despite waiting months for Congress to act, despite \ngetting what assistance was offered at the expense of the farm bill, \neven now, more than 7 months after the passage of that inadequate bill, \nmany of those hurt are just beginning to receive emergency payments. \nSome have received nothing while the least fortunate went bankrupt \nduring the wait.\n  The drought package passed last spring offered a little over $3 \nbillion for drought losses, half the estimated $6 billion in actual \ndamages. By October 1, $1.85 billion had been distributed, just over a \nquarter of actual damages through 2002. Nebraska, which alone had $1.2 \nbillion in damages, has received only $138 million in crop disaster \npayments, barely 10 cents on the $1 of what it lost. As of September \n15, the sugar beet program had not even been implemented, leaving those \nproducers with nothing.\n  Still, the drought continues. That is why I am here today. And still, \nbecause that drought continues, our farmers and ranchers need help.\n  I am here today to remind those who settle for less that we still \nneed to do more. This map reflects the current drought impact in the \nUnited States. The red and brown areas are those areas that have been \nlabeled as a drought area by the U.S. Drought Monitor at the University \nof Nebraska. The red areas within the regions have been declared as \ndrought areas by the State or Federal Government. The brown areas have \nnot been declared. As I said, they are considered to be declared \ndrought areas by the U.S. Drought Monitor. The green areas are \nrecovering from drought but could be impacted by recurring or lingering \nconditions. The yellow areas are under drought watch.\n\n  This map is for the time period of September 5 through October 2 of \nthis year, less than 60 days ago. We can see this drought continues.\n  As is clear from this map, 16 States have seen at least half of their \ncounties declared drought disasters and another 5 have some declared \ndrought area and 2 additional States are considered drought States by \nthe U.S. Drought Monitor but not all declared drought regions. All \ntold, 23 States at the present time have at least some drought regions \nas labeled by the U.S. Drought Monitor. Another six States have some \nareas under drought watch.\n  This map makes it very clear, and it should be clear for everyone to \nsee, the drought has not ended. It remains a national problem and has \ntaken another planting season, another growing season, and another \nharvest. We need to provide more assistance for our farmers and our \nranchers. We need to do more to mitigate the effects of this drought.\n  Finally, we need to take seriously the fact that a drought is no less \ndevastating to those afflicted than of any other natural disaster.\n  The unfortunate thing on a comparison basis, some natural disasters \nare immediate or nearly immediate. This natural disaster takes time to \ndevelop. In this case, it is continuing.\n  If some believe this drought is not as damaging as other natural \ndisasters, I invite them to visit Nebraska and the other States, visit \nfarmers and ranchers who are selling their lands, selling their herds \nor those who have already sold their land and herds. I invite them to \ntour our rural communities to see how damaging this drought has been to \nsmall businesses, Main Street America, small communities that comprise \nthose Main Streets that are connected to the land and the economic \nactivity that it produces. I invite them to talk to the Governor of \nNebraska who a few days ago asked the Department of Agriculture to \ndeclare our entire State a disaster area because of drought damages.\n  I tried a number of measures to focus some attention on the plight of \nour agricultural producers. I even tried to name the drought, Drought \nDavid, thinking that would give it some sort of focus, just as we name \nhurricanes. I even brought drought ribbons that some of my colleagues \nwere good enough to wear a year ago because they understood the \nnational impact of this drought as well as the impact on their \nparticular States. I worked with leaders in this area such as Senators \nDaschle, Harkin, Baucus, Dayton, and Johnson, who also pushed for \ncomprehensive drought assistance. But still it has not been enough. We \nneed to do more. With economic conditions being what they are, we \ncannot risk losing more family farms, we cannot risk losing rural \nbusinesses, and we cannot risk agricultural bankruptcies and \nforeclosures.\n\n  This issue has not been resolved--not through the rains these \ncounties and States need, and not through the paltry assistance \nprovided by the Federal Government. We need to do more.\n  So today I rise in support of Senator Dayton's amendment to provide \nmore support for our family farmers. In fact, I considered offering an \namendment myself on this very issue. And that, again, shows the breadth \nof the disaster. Such States as Nebraska and Minnesota, and everything \nin between, and all around, are still in dire trouble. Our Nation is at \neconomic risk.\n  If we dislike importing 50 to 60 percent of our oil for our energy \nneeds, let me assure you, we will hate importing our food if it ever \ngets to the point that we lose agriculture as we have it today.\n  So we must act. We must act now or it will be too late for tens of \nthousands of more family farms and the rural way of life.\n  I thank you, Madam President. I thank the chairman, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Dayton for \noffering this amendment to secure emergency agricultural disaster \nassistance for our drought stricken agricultural producers.\n  I worked the past 2 years to pass meaningful disaster assistance. For \n2 years, I worked to attach a disaster assistance package onto every \npiece of legislation I could. It passed twice in the Senate--once with \n70 votes. Unfortunately, the House and the administration failed to see \nthe necessity of disaster assistance for our Nation's agricultural \nproducers.\n  A disaster package was eventually signed into law, but this package \nwas a mere ghost of the original disaster package and did little to \nhelp those who were hurt the most by drought. Producers in my State of \nMontana experienced devastating drought in 2001 and 2002, but the \npackage that was signed into law only provided relief for one of those \nyears. I don't know many businessmen who would stay in business after 2 \nyears of more than 35 percent losses.\n  Our Nation's agricultural producers are still hurting. I can count on \none hand how many days it has rained in Billings, MT since June. The \nlack of moisture in my State combined with consecutive days of 100-plus \ntemperatures during the summer exasperated the multiyear drought \nconditions.\n  The effects of the drought have gone beyond our farmers and ranchers. \nBusinesses are closing their doors, employees are being laid off, and \nmain streets are literally drying up.\n  When drought hits, it affects everyone in the area. In Geraldine, MT, \nwhich is located in Choteau County--right in the heart of the drought--\nstudents who qualify for free and reduced meals increased from 47 \npercent to 64 percent over the past year. This signals a dramatic fall \nin income for this area. Farmers who grow food for a living are asking \nfor help to feed their families.\n  As a Nation, we provide emergency assistance when a hurricane smashes \ninto the East Coast, when a tornado rips through the Midwest, or when a \nflood destroys southern communities. We step in and help our neighbors \nwho are in need and offsets are not required. There is no reason that a \ndouble standard should apply to drought.\n  The agricultural producers in Montana hung on to strings of hope last \nyear as we were fighting for disaster assistance for drought. After \nwitnessing the atrocity of a package that passed, many of them were \nforced to sell their farms, their livelihood, their way of life. It was \nheartbreaking. Many people are still hanging on by their fingertips \nthough and that is why I support this amendment. We need to save these \nproducers--the people who wake up at the crack of dawn every day to \nensure that our Nation has a safe, abundant, and inexpensive food \nsupply.\n  This is about providing relief for the small businessmen and women \nwho raise our food and experienced a natural disaster.\n\n[[Page S14005]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to do what is right and what is fair and to vote \nfor this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I see no other Senators wishing to \nspeak on this matter. The chairman of the Budget Committee has not \npresented himself. But speaking on his behalf, I will raise a budget \npoint of order about the emergency designation.\n  Utah is at the bull's eye of the drought. We have more drought \nproblems in Utah perhaps than any other State, and it is with some \nreluctance that I raise this point of order. But this is $6.3 billion, \nand there is no offset for it.\n  I think if it is of value, it is of sufficient value that it is \nworthwhile to have a supermajority to support going $6.3 billion into \nan emergency. I think an emergency designation for this much money is \nsomething for which this procedure is designed.\n  Therefore, I raise a point of order against the emergency designation \ncontained in the pending amendment, that it violates section 502 of the \nconcurrent budget resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004, and \ntherefore is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, with due respect to the Senator from \nUtah, it seems to me that if we are going to measure whether something \nis an emergency by the extent of the emergency, we are misperceiving \nthose situations.\n  I regret that the cost of this measure is estimated to be $6.3 \nbillion, but that is a function of the extent of the disaster which has \noccurred nationwide. If disaster aid is not itself considered to be an \nemergency, frankly, I don't know what possibly could be under the \nBudget Act.\n  So, Madam President, I move to waive the budget point of order and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 40, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 440 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--40\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Domenici\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n     Miller\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 40, the nays are \n55. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained. The emergency designation is stricken.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, the amendment is still pending. It is \nnow $6.3 billion for which there is no offset. Therefore, I believe we \nshould vote the amendment down. We have already said this was the last \nvote today, but if the Senator wants a vote, I suppose there could be \none. This is now $6.3 billion for which there is no offset with the \nemergency designation stricken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I will agree to a voice vote if the \nSenator from Utah concurs.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Under those circumstances, Madam President, I raise the \npoint of order that this is in violation of the Budget Act since there \nis no emergency designation and urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken, and it is \nsustained. The amendment falls.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, we now have a group of amendments which \nhave been offered by a number of Senators and examined by a number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, all of which have been agreed to \nand cleared. I would like to send them to the desk, asking for a voice \nvote on each one. In every case, the amendment is in behalf of myself \nand Senator Kohl--I apologize, Madam President, there are other \nSenators involved. It is just the first amendment that is in behalf of \nmyself and Senator Kohl.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2091\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Kohl and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], for himself and Mr. \n     Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 2091.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 50, line 14, strike ``$27,745,981,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$29,945,981,000''.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, due to increased projections of \nunemployment which result in higher participation and food inflation, \nit is necessary that we increase the Food Stamp Program by $2.2 \nbillion, and this amendment will enable all qualified applicants to \nparticipate in this mandatory program. I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2091) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2092\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Durbin and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], for Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2092.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 79, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following new \n     section:\n       ``Sec.  . Hereafter, no funds provided in this or any other \n     Act shall be available to the Secretary of Agriculture acting \n     through the Foreign Agricultural Service to promote the sale \n     or export of tobacco or tobacco products.''.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, this amendment will ensure that USDA \nfunding is not used to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco \nproducts. This provision was inadvertently left out of the subcommittee \nbill. I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S14006]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 2092) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2093\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Kohl and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MODIFICATION OF BOUNDARIES OF AROOSTOOK COUNTY AND \n                   GRIGGS-STEELE EMPOWERMENT ZONES.\n\n       ``(a) Aroostook County Empowerment Zone.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, the Aroostook County empowerment \n     zone shall include for the period such empowerment zone \n     remains designated, in addition to the area designated as of \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the remaining area of \n     the county not included in such designation.\n       ``(b) Griggs-Steele Empowerment Zone.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the Griggs-Steele empowerment zone \n     shall include for the period such empowerment zone remains \n     designated, in addition to the area designated as of the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the remaining area of Griggs \n     County not included in such designation.''.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Olympia Snowe, in offering an amendment that will expand the \nborders of the Aroostook County Empowerment Zone to include the entire \ncounty, so that the benefits of empowerment zone designation can be \nfully realized throughout the northernmost county in Maine.\n  The Department of Agriculture's Empowerment Zone program addresses a \ncomprehensive range of community challenges, including many that have \ntraditionally received little Federal assistance, reflecting the fact \nthat rural problems do not come in standardized packages but can vary \nwidely from one place to another. The Empowerment Zone Program \nrepresents a long-term partnership between the Federal Government and \nrural communities--10 years in most cases--so that communities have \nenough time to implement projects to build the capacity to sustain \ntheir development beyond the term of the partnership. An Empowerment \nZone designation gives designated regions potential access to millions \nof dollars in Federal grants for social services and community \nredevelopment as well as tax and regulatory relief over a ten-year \nperiod.\n  Aroostook County is the largest county east of the Mississippi River. \nYet, despite the impressive character and work ethic of its citizens, \nthe County has fallen on hard times. The 2000 Census indicated a 15 \npercent loss in population since 1990. Loring Air Force Base, which was \nclosed in 1994, also caused an immediate out-migration of 8,500 people \nand a further out-migration of families and businesses that depended on \nLoring for their customer base.\n  Unfair trade practices have also struck a blow to the County's \neconomy. Aroostook shares more border miles with Canada than most \nnorthern states. It is bordered for approximately 280 miles to the \nwest, north and east by Canada. Canadian farmers and businesses have \nbeen extremely competitive in Aroostook's traditional business markets; \nas a result, Aroostook's farmers have experienced a loss in sales which \nhas caused additional job loss, and still more people migrating from \nAroostook County. Aroostook's economic situation has been further \nworsened by the strong value of the Canadian dollar in relation to the \nU.S. dollar and the restrictive personal exemption duty limits that \nCanada imposes on its citizens when they make shopping trips to U.S. \nbusinesses on the border.\n  In response to these developments, the Northern Maine Development \nCommission and other economic development organizations, the private \nbusiness sector, and community leaders in Aroostook County have joined \nforces to stabilize, diversify, and grow the area's economy. The \ndesignation of Aroostook as an Empowerment Zone has been a vital \nelement of this ongoing effort to enhance both the present and the \nfuture economic prosperity of the county.\n  There is, however, a restriction in the law governing empowerment \nzones that prevents this tremendous program from benefitting all of the \nsmall rural communities in Aroostook. Currently, the law limits the \nAroostook empowerment zone to 1,000 square miles, despite the fact that \nAroostook covers some 6,672 square miles and only has a population of \napproximately 72,000 people. Including all of the county in the \nempowerment zone will guarantee that parts of the county will not be \nleft behind as economic prosperity returns to the area. It does little \ngood to have a company move from one community to another within the \nCounty simply to take advantage of empowerment zone benefits.\n  America's greatest success can only be achieved when everyone has the \nopportunity to enjoy the fruits of a strong economy. It is only fair \nthat all of Aroostook County's population be given the opportunity to \nfully benefit from the Empowerment Zone Program.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, this amendment would expand the \nboundaries of the Arrostook Empowerment Zone in the State of Maine and \nthe Griggs-Steele Empowerment Zone in the State of North Dakota to \nencompass the remaining area of the respective counties not currently \nincluded in the empowerment zone designation.

Madam President, in recognition that this is the last \none of this stack, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2105) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Utah will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am not certain exactly what the status of the bill is. \nI know we have been working on it all day. My understanding is that we \nhave had the last vote of the day so that may suggest that other \namendments will not be offered, or certainly not voted on. I did want \nto inquire of the Senator from Utah about his plans for this bill.\n  I have a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that deals with the \nimportation of live cattle from Canada. As my colleagues know, last \nweek the Secretary of Agriculture took some action to put Canada on a \nminimum risk category. This is a country within the last 6 or 8 months \nthat has had one case of mad cow disease. I am very concerned about \nthat, and I want to offer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment dealing with \nthe importation of live cattle from Canada and my concerns about that.\n  I would certainly be available to do that in the morning or at a time \nappropriate. I wanted to inquire what the Senator anticipates may \nhappen on this legislation this evening.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I say to the Senator and to all Senators \nthat I was prepared to go on further tonight but I have been informed \nthat no amendments will be offered tonight. Therefore, no more debate \nand certainly no more votes. I would be happy to welcome the amendment \nfrom the Senator when he is prepared to offer it. It is certainly my \nintention to go forward tomorrow. I hope the decision not to offer any \namendments tonight will be lifted by tomorrow and that we will have \namendments before us and therefore items to debate and vote on.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield further for an \ninquiry.\n  I have worked with the Senator from Utah as a ranking member when he \nchaired the subcommittee. He is easy to work with and I know we will be \nable to work with the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Wisconsin \non this issue.\n  Especially in the last week or so, I have been immensely concerned \nabout this issue of the importation of live cattle from Canada, only \nbecause the circumstances of live cattle coming across borders from a \ncountry in which there has been a case of mad cow disease is a very \ndifficult situation. We want to be very careful about our country's \nbeef herd and the potential devastation to that herd were we to have an \noutbreak or a case of mad cow disease.\n  We belong to an organization called the Office of International Des \nEpizooties, which establishes the guidelines that our country and \nothers follow with respect to animal health. I want to talk about that \nat some length and then offer the sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nbecause I think all of us ought to be very concerned about when and how \nwe decide to take action with respect to the import of live cattle from \nCanada.\n  Finally, I might say I regret Canada has suffered this problem. It is \na devastating problem for them to have had a mad cow case, but we ought \nto be very concerned and very careful about our beef herd in this \ncountry, and my amendment will address that subject.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah for his courtesy.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, if he wanted to \noffer that amendment tonight and debate it tonight, certainly that \nwould be very much in order. It has been made very clear there will be \nno further votes tonight.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, today Senator Frist and I are offering an \namendment to authorize a new program that we call the Sun Grant \nInitiative. The Sun Grant Initiative--or SGI--is an effort to provide \nan innovative approach to creating new biobased products and markets \nfor farmers, thereby enhancing the environment and developing new \nindustries in our Nation's rural communities.\n  The SGI would establish five Sun Grant Centers across the Nation to \nstimulate needed research and development projects, while providing \nleadership and coordination for a regional competitive grant program \nthat will address national research issues and educational needs at the \nregional and local levels. This new program will provide a much-needed \nbridge between our Government's current national research efforts and \nthe State-based research education networks of the Land-Grant \nuniversities. The SGI will forge a new partnership between the national \nleadership and energy expertise of the\n\n[[Page S14011]]\n\nFederal Government and the agricultural and rural community development \nexpertise of the Agricultural Experiment Stations and the Cooperative \nExtension System.\n  The United States has steadily increased its reliance on imported \noil. Alternative sources of energy and industrial chemicals must be \ndeveloped as soon as possible. The Sun Grant Initiative will stimulate \nthe production of bioenergy resources to complement and augment \npetroleum energy resources, while helping to reduce our dependence on \nimported oil and constrain energy costs for American industries and \nconsumers.\n  Additionally, American farmers need new products and viable market \nalternatives. Sun Grant research, development and education programs \nwill stimulate the development bioenergy and bioproducts on American \nfarms, creating an opportunity for an additional, significant source of \nincome to farmers. The SGI will encourage new biobased industries and \nnew capital investments, stimulating the economies of these rural \ncommunities.\n  I want to thank Senator Frist, Chairman Bennett, and Senators Kohl, \nCochran, Harkin and Smith for their support of this innovative and \nexciting effort to build a biobased economy that can assist our Nation \nin so many ways.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2112) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2090\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2090.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] for Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n     Harkin, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 2090.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To specify a minimum level of funding for regulation of \n                          dietary supplements)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7__. DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS.\n\n       The Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall provide not less \n     than $11,400,000 from within funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available by this Act for regulation by the Food and \n     Drug Administration of dietary supplements.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the managers, Chairman Bennett and \nSenator Kohl, for agreeing to the amendment that Senators Harkin, \nDurbin and I offer today.\n  The purpose of our amendment is simple. The Food and Drug \nAdministration has advised us that, in fiscal year 2004, it will spend \n$10.4 million to regulate dietary supplements. The Hatch-Harkin-Durbin \namendment would increase those activities by 10 percent, or $1 million.\n  Let me explain why this amendment is necessary. First, I will explain \nthe pertinent law that the FDA administers.\n  There is no question that tens of millions of Americans rely daily on \nsafe dietary supplements to maintain and improve their healthy \nlifestyles. The popularity of these products and the concern over their \nregulation are what led to enactment of the Dietary Supplement Health \nand Education Act, DSHEA, in 1994, a bill that Senator Harkin and I \nwere proud to author with now-Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson. \nDSHEA is a strong law that properly implemented will protect the \ninterests of consumers. But, as with any law, it has to be implemented \nfor it to work.\n  Enactment of DSHEA followed literally decades of Food and Drug \nAdministration animosity toward dietary supplement products. This \nanimosity and the lack of a clear regulatory structure for supplements \nwere clearly demonstrated prior to passage of DSHEA. That is why two-\nthirds of the Senate cosponsored our bill. That is why a majority of \nthe House cosponsored the bill. And that is why it passed so \noverwhelmingly.\n  The basic structure of DSHEA allowed all products marketed as dietary \nsupplements when the bill was enacted to stay on the market unless the \nFDA could show safety problems with a particular product or line of \nproducts--this is the so-called ``grandfather'' provision; \nmanufacturers must notify the FDA before any new ingredients are \nmarketed. At the same time, we provided the FDA with the full range of \nenforcement mechanisms to act against unsafe or misbranded supplements, \nincluding seizure, injunction, civil monetary penalties and even \ncriminal penalties.\n  When Chairman Dingell and Chairman Waxman expressed lingering \nconcerns that an unsafe product might be marketed and FDA would not \nhave adequate authority to act against it, we added a new tool--\nimminent hazard--so that the Secretary could take immediate action \nagainst a product that he believed poses an imminent hazard to public \nhealth. I might add, the definition as to what constitutes an \n``imminent hazard'' is entirely up to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, so this is a very broad authority.\n  Even so, there are some who believe that dietary supplements should \nnot be marketed in the United States without a preclearance similar to \nthat for pharmaceuticals. We who drafted and passed DSHEA along with \nmillions of Americans were persuaded that was not necessary.\n  First, most supplements cannot be patented, so there is little \nincentive for manufacturers to undergo the expensive and time-consuming \nFDA approval process.\n  Second, many supplements have been used safely for literally \ncenturies, if not millennia, so it is not necessary to subject them to \nthe approval process. That was why even the most liberal members felt \ncomfortable with the grandfather structure.\n  Finally, we added a provision so that FDA would have the time to \nexamine any ingredient not previously marketed and the evidence of its \nsafety before that product actually reached the stores.\n  When we drafted DSHEA, ensuring the safety of products was at the \nforefront of our efforts. The law gives the FDA abundant tools to \nremove products that are unsafe from the market. It includes a safety \nstandard that was carefully crafted with Senator Kennedy and \nRepresentatives Dingell and Waxman, the chairs of FDA-related panels in \n1994.\n  There is no excuse for a supplement manufacturer to market products \nthat are unsafe or inaccurately labeled or that make outlandish claims. \nUnfortunately, a small number of irresponsible supplement companies are \ntaking advantage of consumers. I contend that the law is adequate to \ndeal with them if FDA implements and enforces it. So, we come to the \npurpose of our amendment.\n  In the nine-plus years since DSHEA was enacted, there has been too \nmuch talk that the law handcuffs FDA and too little effort to apply the \nlaw.\n  It is impossible for this law to protect consumers if it is not \nenforced.\n  I am not here to criticize the FDA or throw barbs. Frankly, the FDA \nunder Commissioner Mark McClellan has done more to enforce DSHEA than \nthe previous administration had. I credit Commissioner McClellan for \nhis commitment to implement the law fully. I truly believe he wants to \nmake this law work. Congress must support him.\n  That is why I have joined with Senator Harkin to introduce the DSHEA \nFull Implementation and Enforcement Act of 2003, S. 1538. And that is \nwhy we are offering this amendment today, which we consider to be a \ndown payment on S. 1538.\n  Yes, there is a small number of products that do raise serious \nconcerns. Ephedra is one. As I have done for many years, I urge the FDA \nto act definitively on this issue based on the best available science, \nnot politics. If the agency deems that ephedra poses a significant or \nunreasonable risk of illness or injury when used as labeled, than the \nagency can and must move to take the product off the market. This has \ngone on for too long. That is the reason I am happy to cosponsor the \ncompanion amendment offered by Senator Durbin.\n  Earlier this year, the FDA advised me it had received 3,000 comments \nand 12,000 letters in response to the agency's proposed rule-making on \nephedra.\n\n[[Page S14012]]\n\nThis has obviously placed a burden on this tiny agency, which needs \nfunding to complete the job it has undertaken.\n  Indeed, as this example shows, the fight for resources is a huge \nchallenge for FDA. The FDA simply does not have the staff or money it \nneeds to do the job. In short, the agency is woefully underfunded, \nespecially when it comes to dietary supplement regulation. That is the \nonly reason I can see that the safety standard we enacted has never \nbeen invoked. That has to be the reason that it has taken almost a \ndecade to promulgate the good manufacturing practice standards that can \nhelp guarantee the safety, the purity, and the accurate labeling of \nproducts. And that must be the reason that a product like \nandrostenedione, which I believe is not even a dietary supplement, \ncontinues to be marketed in this country.\n  I have been very concerned about the safety of steroid precursor \nproducts like andro--and especially when they fall into the hands of \nour youth.\n  That is why I have joined with Senator Biden, Senator Harkin and \nSenator Grassley to cosponsor the Anabolic Steroid Control Act, S. \n1780, that will add andro and other steroid precursors, as well as THG, \nto the list of controlled substances. I intend for the Judiciary \nCommittee to make adoption of S. 1780 a priority, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting both S. 1780 and S. 1538.\n  We have a very solid dietary supplement law that can deal with \nproblems that arise. But, the FDA must use that law for it to be \neffective, and Congress must support the agency in that effort.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  This language has been cleared by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2090) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n               Beaver Control Cost-share Program in Maine\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee. As the chairman of this subcommittee, my good friend from \nUtah is no doubt aware of the important role that wildlife services \nprovided by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have \nin managing and protecting wildlife. I am pleased that the subcommittee \nmaintained funding for these operations as many States, including my \nown, depend on the cooperative efforts of the Federal Government to \nmeet the growing demands for wildlife services. Given the need for \nbeaver management in my State, I would ask the Chairman to work to have \nAPHIS continue providing cooperative beaver management services in \nMaine.\n  The State's Cooperative Beaver Management Program (CBMP) was \nestablished in 1995 by Maine Wildlife Services as a cooperative effort \nbetween State, Federal, and local governments to provide services to \nlandholders, the Maine Department of Transportation, towns and \nmunicipalities who are experiencing problems caused by beavers. With \nthe cost-share agreement between the State and APHIS, CBMP has been \nable to mitigate beaver related property, road, water, and \nenvironmental damage.\n  A reduction in cost share assistance to Maine would have a severe \nimpact on many of the State's public resources and roadways. Beaver-\nflooded roadways endanger the driving public while beaver-flooded sewer \nand septic systems create a health hazard as well as incur significant \nrepair expenses. In addition to helping avoid costly repairs to our \npublic infrastructure, cost-share assistance to the CBMP can reduce \ndamage to private logging roads that are important to the forest \nproducts based local economies. It reduces environmental damage, such \nas erosion, sedimentation, and habitat degradation, caused by road \nwash-outs.\n  The State of Maine reports that the CBMP provides significant \nbenefits to the public in a very effective way. For example, in fiscal \nyear 2002 CBMP activities prevented the loss of, or damage to, $1.3 \nmillion in resources. For the driving public, the benefits are \nparticularly significant. The program saved $500,000 in roadway repair \ncosts by alleviating flooded roads and rights-of way along the \ninterstate and other State maintained highways. Comparing the cost of \nthe program to the value of resources saved gives a cost-benefit ratio \nof 1 to 10. In other words, for every dollar spent, ten dollars were \nsaved over the long-term.\n  Ever since the creation of the CBMP in 1995, funding has remained \nlevel. Under this agreement Maine has received $75,000 annually. In \nrecent years, however, demand for CBMP services has outstripped program \nfunding thereby limiting the State's ability to prevent property damage \nand threats to human health and safety. Additionally, the State is \nconcerned that highway safety is being compromised because of flooding \ncaused by beaver dams.\n  I recognize that the subcommittee has worked to maintain APHIS \nwildlife services in the face of budget limitations. I appreciate the \nchairman's effort to continue this program and thank the chairman for \nconsidering options to address the unique beaver management needs in \nMaine.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maine for \nbringing this issue to my attention. It is evident that the funding \nused for Maine's Cooperative Beaver Management Program has been used \nwisely. I expect APHIS to continue its cooperative wildlife agreements \nwith the funding provided by the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture \nappropriations bill, and I will work in conference to see that these \nfunds continue to be available for the State of Maine.\n\n\n               Improving Emergency Communications Systems\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof 2002 added new a new provision of the Rural Electrification Act \ngiving the Rural Utilities Service, (RUS), Administrator the authority \nto make loans ``to expand or improve 911 access and integrated \nemergency communications systems in rural areas.''\n  This new provision was in response to the pressing need in rural \nAmerica to upgrade and improve the ability to communicate in times of \nindividual and mass emergencies.\n  In the wake of 9/11 there is no higher telecommunications priority \nthan to ensure that communications systems work best when they are \nneeded most.\n  Senator Clinton and I proposed the emergency communications provision \nin the Agriculture Appropriations bill to give life to that new section \nof the Rural Electrification Act.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am pleased to join the Senator from Montana in this \ninitiative. Last week the Federal Communications Commission held a two \nday meeting on their E-911 Initiative. One issue that requires both \nattention and resources is access to modern emergency communications in \nrural areas. I was pleased that Ed Cameron represented the Rural \nUtilities Service at that meeting and reminded the participants of the \nlong partnership the agency has had with rural telephone consumers and \ncarriers and the commitment Administrator Hilda Gay Legg has to \nimproving safety in rural areas.\n  Mr. BURNS. The Rural Utilities Service, through its talented staff of \nengineers, operations specialists can play an important role in \nensuring that emergency responders can communicate in rural and remote \nareas.\n  The Burns-Clinton provision in this appropriations bill would not \nincrease or decrease spending, but would give the administrator of the \nRUS the flexibility to use funding from several sources within the \nagency to give emergency communications projects in rural areas the \nhigh priority they deserve. It also gives the RUS Administrator a \nsource of loan funds which compliment the grant funds available for \nemergency communications systems in the Community Facilities program.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. It is our intent that this funding flexibility not come \nat the expense of other worthy RUS loan or grant programs.\n  Mr. BURNS. That is correct. At any given time, there are authorities \nwhich are oversubscribed and others which are undersubscribed. This \nprovision gives the Administrator flexibility to use underutilized \nfunds for this high priority purpose.\n\n[[Page S14013]]\n\n  As a member of the Agriculture Appropriations Committee, I will seek \nConference report language to clarify that funding would be available \nto current and prospective RUS borrowers and that a wide range of \nprojects be eligible for funding including 911 upgrades, broad \nemergency communications initiatives, statewide emergency \ncommunications projects which include rural areas and projects that \nprovide a dual public safety and commercial uses.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I strongly support the Senator's effort in this regard. \nAs States and localities in rural parts of New York, Montana and across \nthe country struggle to find sufficient funds to upgrade public safety \nradio and data systems, there are new opportunities to combine public \nsafety needs with commercial efforts to deploy new wireless and \nbroadband networks. These dual use networks also have the advantage of \ngenerating revenues which can be used to pay back loans under this \nsection while bringing advanced voice and data capabilities to rural \nareas. As my colleague from Montana and I both know through our efforts \nwith the Congressional E-911 Caucus, these funds would represent just a \nfirst step in the direction of ensuring deployment of a ubiquitous 911 \nsystem across our country.\n  Mr. BURNS. The emergency communications amendment will help ensure \nthat rural America does not fall on the wrong side of a public safety \ndivide.\n\n\n                          NRCS Clarifications\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my distinguished \ncolleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies, Senator Bennett, \nfor his outstanding work on the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture \nAppropriations bill.\n  I would also like to take the opportunity to clarify three provisions \nthat it contains. Upon reviewing the bill I wish to bring to your \nattention three changes I hope can be incorporated in the statement of \nmanagers. First, I request that two separate projects, described as Old \nCanton Road and Watkins Drive in the current bill, be combined to \ninclude the same overall funding amount and read as follows: ``The \nConference agreement provides $350,000 for erosion control and drainage \nimprovements in Hinds County, Mississippi.'' Second, I request that \nreference to a specific floodwater retarding structure be removed from \nlanguage regarding Town Creek in Tupelo, MS, and that the statement of \nmanagers read as follows: ``The Conference agreement provides funds for \nthe agency to continue assistance for the Town Creek in Lee County, \nMississippi.'' Finally, I request that funding for Oaklimeter \nWatershed, as provided through the Conservation Operations section of \nthe bill, be provided instead through the Watershed and Flood Control \nsection.\n  I would ask that the chairman work to incorporate these changes to \nthis bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from \nMississippi bringing these changes to my attention and will work with \nhim to incorporate them in the statement of managers.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chairman for his assistance in clarifying \nthese issues and for his leadership as we complete work on this bill.\n\n\n                            animal fighting\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your help addressing a long-\nstanding concern of mine--the need for greater enforcement by USDA of \nthe Federal law regarding animal fighting. Earlier this year, I and \nmany of our colleagues--a bipartisan group of 38 other Senators--\nrequested $800,000 to enable USDA's Office of Inspector General to \nfocus on strengthening enforcement of the Federal animal fighting law. \nI am grateful that you were able, in the committee report, to include \nthis $800,000 for the OIG to improve enforcement in this area.\n  However, I did want to ask the chairman for a bit of clarification on \nthis item, as it was included in the committee report. I noted that the \nreport provides ``an increase of $800,000 for OIG to address violations \nof the Animal Welfare Act and to coordinate with State and local law \nenforcement personnel in this effort.'' Would the chairman be willing \nto clarify that this funding would be used specifically to improve \nenforcement of Section 26 of the Animal Welfare Act, which deals \nexclusively with animal fighting, rather than having these funds used \nto enforce the entire Animal Welfare Act? This clarification could be \nfinalized in conference.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, I will work with the House of Representatives \nduring conference negotiations to ensure that the $800,000 is provided \nto address animal fighting.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Senator Kohl, is it your intention as well that this \nfunding would be used specifically to improve enforcement of Section 26 \nof the Animal Welfare Act?\n  Mr. KOHL. Yes. I agree with what Chairman Bennett has said regarding \nthe committee's intentions, and will work with him to make sure this is \nclear in the final bill.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I'm grateful to both of you for your help and leadership \non this issue.\n\n\n                      NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman to clarify the intent of language included in \nthe Senate report regarding studies and evaluations in the Nutrition \nPrograms Administration account. In our Senate report, we have included \nlanguage stating that the committee is providing $3,195,000, the same \nas the fiscal year 2003 level, for studies and evaluations in the \nNutrition Programs Administration Account.\n  I have since been contacted by USDA noting that the $3,195,000 \nprovided in fiscal year 2003 was actually an increase over their base \nfunding. Therefore, the question becomes whether our intent was simply \nto maintain $3,195,000 in funding for studies and evaluations, or to \nmaintain the $3,195,000 increase provided in fiscal year 2003. It is \nmay belief that our intention was to maintain the increase, and while I \nbelieve we should clarify this in the Statement of Managers during \nconference negotiations, I also wanted to mention it during our Senate \ndebate.\n  Is it your understanding that it was our intention to maintain the \nincrease in funding provided in this account?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention and I \nagree our intention was to maintain increased funding for studies and \nevaluations.\n\n\n                       rus telemedicine language\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my distinguished \ncolleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies, Senator Bennett, \nfor his outstanding work on the FY 2004 Agriculture Appropriations \nbill.\n  Upon review of the bill, I request that the following language be \nincluded in the statement of the managers:\n\n       The conferees are aware of and encourage the Secretary to \n     support the utilization of remote telemedicine services \n     capable of transmitting medical information in both real-time \n     and stored scenarios for diagnosis, medical monitoring and \n     emergency purposes. Furthermore, the conferees recognize the \n     need for integration and interoperability of real-time remote \n     mobile medical technology with other devices, systems and \n     services which together offer increased capabilities, \n     functionality, and levels of care.\n\n  I would ask that the Chairman work to incorporate this language in \nthe bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from \nMississippi bringing this language to my attention and will work with \nhim to incorporate it in the statement of the managers.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chairman for his assistance with this \nlanguage and for his leadership as we complete work on this bill.\n\n\n     national agriculture statistics service potato pricing survey\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies regarding the \nNational Agricultural Statistics Service--NASS--and the potato size and \ngrade survey.\n  The NASS provides critical information to growers, processors, \nshippers, and all other segments of the agricultural industry. Its \nhistory of doing so reaches back to the Presidency of Abraham Lincoln \nand travels forward in time to the present, where those in the \nagricultural industry now rely heavily on information for planting and \npricing decisions.\n\n[[Page S14014]]\n\n  Of great importance to my State and others is the information NASS \nprovides regarding the potato size and grade survey. The intent of this \nsurvey is to provide all market participants with comprehensive potato \nsize and grade data. These data are crucial information to both potato \ngrowers and buyers in estimating the current potato crop's quality. \nThis unbiased information will be used by all parties when negotiating \nsale or purchase contracts of processing potatoes.\n  The National Potato Council--NPC, which represents all segments of \nthe potato industry, has identified that these data are imperative to \nthe orderly marketing of the annual potato crop. These data also ensure \nno one group uses their market position to distort the true picture of \nannual crop quality. The size and grade data will complement the annual \nproduction data already provided by NASS and supply the necessary \ninformation for the orderly marketing of the potato crop.\n  Given the importance of the potato industry to the United States, I \nwish to add language to the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture Appropriations \nAct that simply asks the NASS to continue its work on the potato size \nand grade survey within the available funds of the agency.\n  I would ask the chairman and ranking member, given the subcommittee's \ncontinued support for NASS, whether it is also the Committee's intent \nto continue the vital work of this survey?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I understand the Senator's interest in this important \nsurvey. The Senator is correct that the committee intends that the \nDepartment maintain this important work. We will continue to work with \nthe Senator in this area as this bill moves forward.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the Senator's comments and agree that this \nwork merits appropriate emphasis in our upcoming conference on \nAgriculture appropriations.\n\n\n                           ALKALINE DIGESTER\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I would like to engage my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Bennett, the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, in a colloquy regarding \nfunding for an alkaline digester for Kansas State University. This \ndigester will be used to conduct important animal disease research to \nprotect the United States from an agroterrorist attack.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would be pleased.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The published committee report for this legislation \nindicates that $225,000 has been provided for the digester. However, I \nunderstand this is typographical error and the Committee has actually \nprovided $1 million. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chairman for his support.\n\n\n                      ALLIANCE FOR FOOD PROTECTION\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Chairman for your hard work on this \nappropriations bill. I would like to bring to your attention a \nCooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service project \nthat is funded in the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture Appropriations bill, \nthe Alliance for Food Protection. At the time which the Subcommittee on \nAgriculture Appropriations marked up the fiscal year 2004 bill, I had \nnot been notified that the work on this project had been completed.\n  Mr. BENNETT. How does the Senator from Georgia wish to proceed since \n$268,000 has been designated in this bill for the Alliance for Food \nProtection project?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. My intention, with the Chairman's approval, of course, \nwould be to move the funding designated for the Alliance for Food \nProtection project to the Cooperative State Research, Education and \nExtension Service Integrated Fruit and Vegetable research project which \nis in Cooperation with the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension \nService.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his explanation, \nand I will be happy to work with him during conference to address his \nconcerns.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I appreciate the Chairman's cooperation with my \nrequest.\n\n\n          RELOCATING THE WILDLIFE HABITAT MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \nprovisions in the Agriculture appropriations bill before the Senate \nwould in no way affect the proposed reorganization of the Natural \nResources Conservation Service's field laboratory structure. Does the \nSenator from Utah agree with that interpretation?\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is my understanding as well.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Is the Senator aware that the Wildlife Habitat \nManagement Institute, an NRCS facility in Jackson, MS, is unique among \nNRCS facilities in that it is a ``virtual institute'' which draws on \nstaff from all across the country to develop innovative habitat \nmanagement recommendations for landowners?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I was not.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Would the Senator agree that relocating this Institute, \ngiven its unique organization and the dispersion of its staff, would \nnot yield significant savings or efficiency?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I agree.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Given this information, would it be the intent of the \nsubcommittee that the Wildlife Habitat Management Institute remain in \nits current location and excluded from the reorganization?\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with the \ndistinguished chairman of the appropriations subcommittee.\n\n\n                        chronic wasting disease\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I appreciate the work that you have done \nin regard to funding for Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD). As you know, \nthis is a fatal neurological disease of farmed and wild elk and deer \nthat belongs to the family of diseases known as transmissible \nspongiform encephalopathies (TSE's). My State of New Mexico is \ninhabited with ample numbers of elk and deer. The elk are oftentimes \nharvested by hunters who get each animal tested for CWD. With that in \nmind, there continues to be a demand for the State to provide hunters \nwith an accessible location that can perform the test in a timely \nfashion.\n  The State of New Mexico is a Tier I State, which means a confirmed \ncase of CWD has been discovered and the disease is present. I am \nhopeful that the final version of the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture \nAppropriations bill will provide the opportunity for the State of New \nMexico to work in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture to \nestablish an approved CWD testing facility. The State of New Mexico has \nrequested approval of a proposal to establish, equip, and operate a \nlaboratory to conduct a rapid screening test for CWD in the New Mexico \nelk and deer population. This would be done at State expense.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from New Mexico and will encourage \nthe Department of Agriculture to review the current situation. If the \nreview warrants a testing facility, I will suggest that the Department \nof Agriculture consider establishing a testing facility in the State of \nNew Mexico.\n\n\n       NutriCore Northeast and Geisinger Rural Aging Study (GRAS)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition of the chairman \nof the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee to bring to his \nattention two projects that are of great importance to the Commonwealth \nof Pennsylvania: NutriCore Northeast and Geisinger Rural Aging Study.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am more than willing to acknowledge my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania with regard to his two projects.\n  Mr. SPECTER. NutriCore Northeast would be a self-managed and \nultimately self-sustaining not-for-profit corporation existing in \nPennsylvania working in a cooperative research and development \nagreement with the United States Department of Agriculture to provide a \n50-year road map assessing progress toward a healthy and fit populace. \nAdditionally, Geisinger Rural Aging Study is a USDA Agricultural \nResearch Service cohort study of 21,646 rural older Pennsylvanians that \nwould assist them with proper dietary intake as well as formulate a \nlongitudinal nutrition database. I am hopeful that we can work together \nto consider these requests as you complete action on the bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my distinguished colleague for bringing these \nimportant projects to my attention. While this committee is working \nwithin a very tight budget, I will give your requests all due \nconsideration.\n\n[[Page S14015]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am keenly aware of the tight budgetary constraints \nunder which you are operating, and I appreciate whatever assistance you \nmay be able to provide with respect to these requests.\n\n\n                           food aid programs\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, currently, USDA does not distinguish \nbetween white (food grade) sorghum and yellow feed grade sorghum in our \nfood aid programs. Unfortunately, sorghum that is used to make animal \nand pet food, or used to make ethanol, is being sent to African \ncountries where people have been eating sorghum for generations. In \nfact, sorghum originated in Africa. They are keenly aware of the \ndifference between the food grade sorghum that they eat and the feed \ngrade sorghum that is fed to cattle. It is my view that USDA should \nprovide recipient countries with sorghum that has the food qualities \nand characteristics with which the people receiving the aid are \nfamiliar.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I understand the Senator's concern and would also like \nto see that USDA make that distinction.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. By all appearances, the demand for sorghum in our food \naid will be growing in the near future. USAID has doubled the amount of \nsorghum programmed in food aid over the past three years. My sorghum \nfarmers are appreciative of this fact. I think both of us want USAID \nand USDA to provide food aid recipients with the commodity that they \nwant, whenever the commodity is available in the market place.\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the chairman for his support.\n\n\n              eliminating avian influenza in rhode island\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinghished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee, as well as my colleague from Rhode Island, \nSenator Chafee, regarding the presence of Avian Influenza in Rhode \nIsland. Since March of this year, the Rhode Island Department of \nEnvironmental Management's Division of Agriculture has been working to \ncontain an outbreak of Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza in a poultry \noperation in Foster, Rhode Island, as well as a live bird market in \nProvidence. The virus has been definitively identified as H7N2 Avian \nInfluenza, of the same genetic sequence as the virus recently found in \nnearby poultry operations in Connecticut. Little Rhody Farms, the last \nof the traditional egg houses in Rhode Island, currently houses 32,000 \nhens producing brown eggs for sale in markets and food stores. Sales \nand distribution of eggs from the farm have declined due to customers' \nconcerns that the produce may be tainted, and a federally imposed \nquarantine that has frozen the operation at half capacity. To eliminate \nthe risk of the disease spreading further and to give the farm a \ngreater chance to survive, state officials have strongly recommended \ndepopulating the infected flock and disinfecting the premises. We have \nbeen unable to secure financial assistance from USDA to make \ndepopulation possible.\n  I look forward to working with the Chairman and Ranking Member to \ninclude language in the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill to direct USDA's \nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service to provide assistance to \nRhode Island Egg producers who have depopulated their flocks.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am grateful to my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Bennett and Senator Kohl, for giving us an \nopportunity to discuss this matter on the floor. Let me just underscore \na few of the points that Senator Reed has made.\n  First, everyone involved with this situation agrees that depopulation \nis the best strategy for dealing with the problem. The Rhode Island \nDivision of Agriculture, the State Veterinarian, and the farmer favor \ndepopulation and disinfection. And I understand that APHIS has been \nsuccessful in taking this approach with poultry operations in Virginia \nand Texas.\n  Second, it is evident that without some compensation, the farm will \nface bankruptcy. Maintaining the viability of Rhode Island's family \nfarms is a critical element of our efforts to preserve the state's \ncharacter, as well as the natural landscape.\n  Third, I am told that in rare circumstances, low pathogenic forms of \navian influenza can transform into high pathogenic organisms that pose \nserious threats to human health. Not surprisingly, the presence of \navian influenza on American poultry and egg farms is a matter of grave \nconcern to our trading partners. No one wants to give the virus and \nopportunity to mutate.\n  Given the risks associated with avian influenza and the clear \nevidence that the current protocol was not successful in containing the \noriginal Connecticut outbreak, I am anxious to find a solution to this \nproblem. I thank the chairman and ranking member for working with us, \nand hope that language directing APHIS to provide the necessary \nfinancial assistance can be included in the bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I appreciate Senator Chafee and Senator Reed bringing \nthis situation in Rhode Island to the attention of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee. For all of the reasons that my colleagues \nhave raised, I agree that it makes sense to try to eradicate this \norganism from American poultry flocks. I look forward to working with \nthe two Senators and the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, Senator \nKohl, to develop language that directs APHIS to play an active role in \ndepopulating these flocks in Rhode Island.\n  Mr. KOHL. I rise to join Senator Reed and Senator Chafee in \nexpressing my concern about this outbreak of Low-Path Avian Influenza \nin Rhode Island. This disease has resulted in substantial losses in \npoultry producers in several states and, in response, Congress has \npreviously directed APHIS to help poultry producers cover costs \nassociated with depopulating infected flocks. I agree with the \nimportance of doing what we can to prevent avian influenza from \nthreatening the livelihood of poultry operations in Rhode Island and \nsouthern New England. I will work with the distinguished subcommittee \nchairman and try to include language in the fiscal year 2004 \nAgriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nbill to ensure that APHIS provides assistance with depopulation of \ninfected flocks in Rhode Island.\n\n\n                 southern plains range research station\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Chairman Bennett faces many difficult \nfunding decisions as he puts together this year's bill. I appreciate \nthe work he has done in a challenging job. I rise today regarding the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture Southern Plains Range Research \nStation in Woodward, OK.\n  As you know, the Agricultural Research Service is currently \nundergoing a facility modernization at the Southern Plains Range \nResearch Station in Woodward. I submitted a request for Phase II \nfunding to allow the ARS to complete construction of the facility and \nbegin realizing the benefits that this facility will bring to both the \nARS and the Woodward community.\n  The Research Station provides economic opportunities for the citizens \nof Woodward, OK and contributes to USDA's mission of building a \ncompetitive agriculture economy while enhancing the natural resources \nbase in the Southern Plains.\n  This funding is necessary to implement the recommendations of the \nrecent ARS review of facility needs at SPRRS: construction of a new \ngreenhouse, a new laboratory, an office building, and new parking \nstructures and site upgrades. According to USDA, ``The [SPRRS] \nlaboratories are in dire need of repair and renovation.'' This \nmodernization is necessary for SPRRS to employ cutting-edge techniques \nand procedures in rangeland and pasture research.\n  It is my hope that you will work with me to provide the funds \nnecessary to complete construction at the USDA Southern Plains Range \nResearch Station in Woodward, OK.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I appreciate my colleague's comments and the opportunity \nto discuss the USDA Southern Plains Range Research Station. I am aware \nof this project's importance to Oklahoma and the Oklahoma delegation. \nMy colleague is uniquely aware of the constraints of the budget we must \nwork within, and of the many areas in need of funding. I look forward \nto working with my colleague to address the issue of funding for Phase \nII of construction\n\n[[Page S14016]]\n\nat the Southern Plains Range Research Station in Woodward.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the difficult challenges that the Chairman \nis facing as he puts together the FY 2004 Agriculture Appropriations \nbill. I thank him for his attention to this very important need and for \nhis willingness to work with me to address this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Bennett and Senator \nKohl for their help in obtaining funds for cranberry research in the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. Cranberry production is an issue of \ngreat importance to Massachusetts, and I hope that the Manager's will \ncontinue to work with Senator Kerry and me to obtain $280,000 for the \nUniversity of Massachusetts Cranberry Station in Wareham for a complete \nrenovation of the State Cranberry Bog.\n  The State Cranberry Bog provides income for Cranberry Station \noperations. More importantly, it is a research site for the Cranberry \nStation faculty and students. The bog is especially useful for \nconducting research not appropriate for cranberry farms in production. \nThe faculty and students are able to use the facility to conduct \nresearch on new pesticide alternatives, or research that involves \nchanges in practices not yet adopted by farmers.\n  Unfortunately, over time, the average yield of the state facility has \ndeclined because of its research activities, and the bog itself, built \non peat, has begun to sink. The funds that Senator Kerry and I have \nrequested will be used for a complete renovation of the bog, so that \nthe Cranberry Station will again be able to conduct cutting-edge \nresearch plant physiology, pest and nutrient management, and irrigation \nmanagement. The renovation will also enhance the Station's ability to \ndemonstrate new technologies and practices as part of its educational \nmission. All of these activities contribute to both the economic health \nof the local economy and the overall vitality of the nation's cranberry \nindustry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I again express my appreciation to Chairman \nBennett and Senator Kohl for their assistance in developing the Fiscal \nYear 2004 Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill and their ongoing \nassistance to the Cranberry farmers in Massachusetts who are facing \neconomic difficulties. I would like to express my support for the \ncomments made by Senator Kennedy regarding funding for Cranberry \nresearch in the Fiscal Year 2004 Agriculture appropriations conference \nreport. This important research will develop new technologies to help \nimprove yields of cranberry bogs and help these farmers maintain their \nlivelihood. I look forward to working with the Managers of this \nlegislation to make sure this program receives funding in the \nConference Report. I appreciate the Managers' attention to this matter.\n  Mr. Kohl. Since Wisconsin is also one of the top-producing cranberry \nstates in the country, I recognize the need to support innovative \nresearch within this industry. I will continue to work with Senator \nKennedy and Senator Kerry on this issue, and I will do what I can to be \nof assistance.\n\n\n                       Funding for Seafood Safety\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Bennett and Senator \nKohl for their effective work on the Agriculture appropriations bill. I \nparticularly commend Senator Kohl for his help in obtaining $422,000 \nfor Seafood Safety in Massachusetts. I'm hopeful that two worthwhile \nresearch programs--the Safe Seafood Project at the University of \nMassachusetts in Amherst, and the Center for Marine Phytoremediation \nTechnologies at Northeastern University will be funded in the Fiscal \nYear 2004 Agriculture appropriations conference report.\n  In recent years, the Department of Agriculture, through the \nCooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Services, has \nawarded grants to the University of Massachusetts, Amherst for their \nwork on the Safe Seafood Project. The goal of this project is to \nprovide useful, science-based recommendations to enhance the seafood \nindustry's potential for producing safe, economically viable products. \nIt is essential for the project to receive funding again this year in \norder to continue its essential work on seafood quality and health.\n  Northeastern University is also an impressive research university on \nmarine issues. Funding will be used by the Center for Marine \nPhytoremediation Technologies to develop techniques employing marine \nplants to eliminate pollutants that result from fish aquaculture, as \nwell as toxic materials found in our waters, such as mercury and TNT. \nThe Center will also establish methods for restoring seagrass habitats \nwhere they have been destroyed.\n  We know that waste from the increasing number of fish aquaculture \nfacilities leads to the production of harmful algae and the destruction \nof other marine life. If these problems continue, the fish aquaculture \nindustry cannot be sustained, since it will cause greater risks in \neating fish, and also endanger seagrass habitats, which are critical to \nthe coastal economy of many states.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my appreciation for the efforts of Chairman Bennett and Senator \nKohl for their work in developing the Fiscal Year 2004 Senate \nAgriculture Appropriations bill. Their work is especially noteworthy \nbecause of the difficult authorization level set by the Budget \nResolution. I would like to express my support for the comments made by \nSenator Kennedy  regarding the Center of Marine Phytoremediation \nTechnologies at Northeastern University. The Center has developed a \nproposal which I believe is an important opportunity to develop new \ntechnologies and help eliminate pollutants from fish aquaculture. This \nresearch can help the marine life in our oceans and eliminate \npollutants from the seafood we enjoy. It is my hope that Senator \nKennedy and I could work with the Manager's of this legislation to make \nsure that these important programs receive funding in the Fiscal Year \n2004 Agriculture appropriations conference report.\n  Mr. KOHL. I agree with both Senator Kennedy and Senator Kerry on the \nimportance of funding food safety initiatives, and I am glad we were \nable to obtain funding for seafood safety research in Massachusetts.\n  The University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Northeastern University \nhave impressive programs vital to improving marine issues and seafood \nsafety. I will continue to work with both Senator Kennedy  and Senator \nKerry, as the bill progresses, and do what I can to see that these \nresources are available to these institutions.\n\n\n                            Section 306 (a)\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to address a provision \nthat Chairman Bennett has added to the manager's amendment to the \nfiscal year 2004 Agriculture Appropriations bill on my behalf.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would be happy if Senator Murkowski \nexplained this provision in greater detail.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. The provision in question makes the Alaska Department \nof Community and Economic Development eligible to receive a water and \nwaste disposal grant under section 306(a) of the Consolidated Farm and \nRural Development Act in an amount that is not less than 75 percent of \nthe total cost of providing water and sewer service to the proposed \nhospital in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough in Alaska. In addition, this \nprovision allows the funds to be passed through the department to the \nlocal governmental entity that will do the water and sewer work on the \nhospital. This local governmental entity will be chosen by the \nRegulatory Commission of Alaska.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like Ms. Murkowski to explain her \nrationale for including this provision in the manager's amendment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. This new hospital project will be an economic boon for \nthe Matanuska-Susitna Borough. Currently, there is a hospital in \nPalmer, which is one of the larger communities in the borough. However, \nthis is the only full-service hospital in the entire borough. This \nborough, which is the home to many people who commute to work in \nAnchorage, has grown a great deal over the years. In fact, the \nborough's population is projected to double in the next ten years. \nTherefore, a new hospital is needed in this borough. This proposed \nhospital will be located halfway between the communities of Wasilla and \nPalmer and will be more\n\n[[Page S14017]]\n\neasily accessible to more of the borough's residents.\n  Currently, the site on which the proposed hospital will be located \ndoes not have a water or sewer connection. Therefore, such a connection \nis critical to the success of the hospital project, which will serve so \nmany people in a high-growth area in my State.\n  Please allow me to share with you some details on the economic effect \nthat this hospital project will have on the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. \nIt will create 680 full time and part time construction jobs during the \nfirst phase of the construction. Once the hospital is complete, 1,200 \nto 1,800 new jobs will be created through new hospital operations. It \nwill add $22.8 million in construction labor income. The new hospital \nwill pay approximately $1.3 million in local property taxes and will \nproduce a total of $2.08 million in local and State revenues from \nconstruction and another $3.84 million from new hospital operations.\n  These statistics don't begin to depict the more significant \nstatistics on lives saved and people healed. This project is a win-win \nfor the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and the State of Alaska. It will have \nthe single largest positive impact on the borough's economy for the \nnext decade. More importantly, it will yield the single largest \npositive impact on the health of the community and residents, as well.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murkowski for explaining \nthe need for her provision in the manager's amendment to this important \nlegislation.\n\n\n                              ARS Research\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture to highlight a USDA agency that does extremely good work in \nmy home State of Arkansas. First, I want to commend the chairman's \nefforts to provide resources to our Nation's most important \nagricultural and rural development priorities. It has been a difficult \ntask and I appreciate your dedication.\n  In particular, I want to thank the chairman for his efforts to \ncontinue the necessary support for agricultural research, both within \nthe USDA and with the State university partners. The USDA Agricultural \nResearch Service is a critical agency in this effort. With the \nleadership of the chairman, I am pleased to note that ARS research will \ncontinue to have the strong support of Congress.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator and I share her assessment of the \nimportance of agricultural research and the value of the USDA and its \nState partners.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. The USDA ARS has a small, but vital presence in \nArkansas. For example, is the chairman aware that my home State ranks \nseventh in the Nation in total net farm income?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I did not know that.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes. In fact, few States in the Nation, and none in the \nSouth, are blessed with a higher percentage of their economic activity \ndependent upon agriculture than is Arkansas. I am also aware that \ntraditionally, however, the ARS presence in Arkansas has been \nsurprisingly small, especially in relation to the importance of \nagriculture to the economy and size of your contribution to the net \nfarm income of the United States.\n  Mr. BENNETT. In spite of this, I know that the research conducted in \nArkansas benefits us all.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes, that is certainly true. We are proud of the ARS \npresence that we do have and the impact of its research on the Nation \nas a whole. The research that has been generated from Arkansas \nlocations has been of great importance to the rice, poultry, small \nfruits, and aquaculture industries of the U.S. Additionally, the \nbreakthroughs in human nutrition research that have come from the ARS \nhuman nutrition center in Arkansas have been remarkable. In light of \nthe great importance of the research work being carried out at the ARS \nor ARS-supported research centers in Arkansas, I urge your continued \nsupport and ask that every effort be made, including in conference, to \ninsure that the ARS units in Arkansas enter the 2004 fiscal year with \nno less than the same fiscal resources that they had in 2003. \nAdditionally, I ask the chairman's assistance in working with Members \nof the House who will be on the conference committee to adopt the most \nfavorable funding recommendations that are brought into conference by \neither House.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I share the Senator's commitment to agricultural \nresearch and to the ARS. And, I recognize the importance of the ARS \nresearch conducted in Arkansas to your State, to the region, and to the \nNation. During our conference deliberations with the House, I will keep \nthe importance of these research activities in mind. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues from the House in conference to insure the \nhighest level of funding possible taking into consideration national \nresearch priorities. I am sure the Arkansas units will rank highly on \nthat list of priorities. I thank the Senator for bringing this \nimportant matter to my attention.\n\n\n                     travel and purchase card abuse\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa brought an issue to \nme which he hopes to remedy through Agriculture Appropriations. The \nissue involves the Department of Agriculture and the documented fraud \nand abuse occurring within both the purchase and travel card programs. \nI would like to ask the Senator from Iowa for further clarification.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the chairman for his interest in this issue. \nAdditionally, I want to thank him for his concern regarding credit card \nabuse. Working together I'm confident we can help USDA remedy this \nissue.\n  As Chairman Bennett knows, the Department's own Office of Inspector \nGeneral (OIG) has stated that USDA's travel card program is plagued \nwith problems including fraud, abusive ATM usage, ``bounded'' check \npayments, and lack of specific travel card policies and penalties. Many \nof these problems still remain unchecked despite recommendations from \nan OIG audit over 5 years ago.\n  USDA employees accumulated over $5.8 million in fraudulent charges in \na six-month period. The majority of these charges were racked up when \nindividuals were not even on travel. Purchases were made at The Gap, \nBath and Body, Cigarettes for Less, Tatoo and More Ink, and an Oregon \nLiquor Store. They also included 900 trips to Wal-Mart, K-Mart and \nTarget; tickets to Ozzy Osbourne, and automotive payments including the \npurchase of a $6,000 vehicles.\n  This is a clear abuse of government-issued cards and the trust \nembodied in these employees. Despite individuals signing an agreement \nacknowledging that the travel card is solely for work-related travel \nthis abuse continues. The travel card is not meant to be a line of \ncredit for employees, or to be used by individuals as a personal credit \ncard. There is no excuse for this type of abuse.\n  When I was first made aware of this abuse I asked how this was \nallowed to occur at USDA. What I found was outdated or non-existent \ninternal controls that do nothing more than provide lip-service to the \nconcept of accountability. USDA's travel card program is operating \nunder 19-year old regulations. Nineteen years ago our banking \ninfrastructure was fundamentally different than it is today. Nineteen \nyears ago we didn't even have ATM's!\n  In fact, ATM's pose the single most significant vulnerability to \ntravel card misuse due to cash advances fees and other bank surcharges. \nDuring the six month review by the OIG, ATM transactions cost the \ngovernment more than $137,000 in advance fees. There is chronic and \nintentional misuse with ATM withdrawals, for example, nearly $200,000 \nwas withdrawn to pay personal debts during the six-month review period.\n  If that isn't bad enough, when individuals leave the department they \ndon't always surrender their travel card! So individuals are out using \nthe travel card as a personal credit card. OIG found that 1,549 \nindividuals still had cards that could be used despite their departure \nfrom the Department. One individual was using his travel card nearly 2 \nyears after he left the department!\n  OIG identified $650,000 in returned checks, stop payment fees and \nreturned check fees in just a six-month period. A little diligence up \nfront could prevent millions of dollars in fraudulent purchases.\n  I would point out that USDA has made recent efforts to limit abuse. \nUSDA has attempted to reduce the number of credit card holders, revised\n\n[[Page S14018]]\n\ndepartmental regulations on purchase cards, and instituted new system \nalerts to catch abusive transactions.\n  With Chairman Bennett's help I plan to monitor the new efforts being \nmade by USDA to remedy these problems I'm cautiously optimistic that \nUSDA will recognize that the reforms must be successful, or we will \nestablish new, more stringent reforms for USDA next year.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I concur with my colleague's remarks. We will allow USDA \nto remedy the problems my colleague from Iowa has described. If USDA \ndoes not take action immediately and make substantive advances to fix \nthese problems, we'll likely give them something more than \nencouragement in next year's agriculture appropriations legislation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would like to take a moment of the chairman and \nranking members' time to discuss a project that has been supported by \nthe committee since 1999. The Natural Resource Conservation Service \n(NRCS) in South Carolina and the Earth Sciences and Resources Institute \nat the University of South Carolina (ESRI-USC) have successfully \ndeveloped technology to aid NRCS, both in South Carolina and throughout \nthe Nation, to meet the needs of the agricultural community in a more \neffective and efficient manner. Over the years, the University of South \nCarolina has demonstrated their capabilities and the quality of their \nproducts while building a solid working partnership with the NRCS.\n  The implementation of the software tools they developed has produced \nsignificant savings in manpower and cost for many of NRCS's \nconservation programs. For example, it is estimated that the man-hours \nneeded to create waste management plans using the traditional paper-\nbased way was on the order of 230 man-hours per plan. Using the ESRI-\nUSC geographic information systems tools, this time requirement was \nreduced to just over 100 man-hours per plan--that is 130 man-hours \nsaved per plan. The evolving products ESRI-USC has developed for \ncomprehensive nutrient management planning have resulted in even \ngreater time, and cost savings than the earlier tools. As a result of \nthe use of another program, EQIP-for-the-Web, South Carolina NRCS has \nconservatively saved three man-years of effort. Using another tool, \nNASIS-for-the-Web, we estimate that this automated access to the soil \nsurvey reports results in five man-hours per day in NRCS personnel \nsavings. There is also a benefit to the public, which can access these \ndata via the Web. The time savings to foresters, engineers, farmers, \nand other users of soil survey data is enormous. There are over 170 \nusers of a particular program in 17 States and a user base in 31 \nStates.\n  Consequently, I wish to continue to pursue this project at the next \nlevel and establish a Center of Excellence within ESRI-USC to assure a \nlong-term, cost-effect means to provide a stable and sustained \nenvironment for the development of new technologies as well as support \nof existing capabilities such as AFOPro, C-Grax, NASIS for the Web, and \nEQIP for the Web. ESRI-USC's value added NRCS programs provide \nfunctional, rapidly developed and deployed applications that can be \nused by conservationists and field office staff level.\n  Mr. KOHL. I would concur with my friend from South Carolina. I agree \nit is important for any federal agency to have the ability to establish \nthe appropriate technology to provide functional, rapidly developed and \ndeployed applications that can be used by the field personal in a \nreliable, user friendly manner. Given the nationwide interest in their \napplications, it is time that the USDA seriously consider directly \nlonger-term support with ESRI-USC.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the senior Senator from South Carolina for \nbringing this matter to my attention. I encourage you to pursue this \ndesignation with NRCS. Additionally, In encourage NRCS to give every \nconsideration to the Senator's proposal.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my friend and colleague for your time. It may \nalso be worth noting that Bruce Knight, Chief of NRCS recently visited \nthe University this past April and was very impressed with their \ncapabilities. He concurs that the work completed by ESRI-USC has been \nof high value to NRCS software development efforts.\n\n\n                   ASSISTANCE TO THE MENOMINEE TRIBE\n\n  Mr. KOHL. It has recently come to my attention that the Menominee \nIndian Tribe in Wisconsin is in need of additional assistance from \nRural Development. The latest poverty figures indicate 60 percent of \nrural Americans who are living in poverty reside in census tracks \ncontaining or adjacent to Indian reservations. Unfortunately, 50 \npercent of the members residing on the three reservations of the \nMenominee Tribe in my State of Wisconsin live below the poverty rate \nwith less than 72 percent of children receiving a high school diploma. \nUnemployment exceeds 20 percent. The Department of Agriculture needs to \nconsider meritorious applications for water and waste and business \ndevelopment programs which will benefit this tribe.\n  It is my intention that during our upcoming conference deliberations \nwith the House, to include language in the statement of managers to \nsupport the consideration of an application in relation to the Mole \nLake Water and Sewer System within the Water and Waste Loan and Grant \naccount to address the current sanitary needs and provide opportunities \nto attract new homeowners. In addition, there is a need to construct a \nMenominee Mini-Mall Development project and the Forest Enterprises \nTechnology Center to attract new businesses and create a business \nincubator. I intend to seek recognition that these two projects be \nincluded under the Rural Business Enterprise Grant account. Further, \nthe Menominee Tribal Enterprises should receive consideration under the \nIntermediary Relending account to support small business loans and \nthereby, to provide sustainability to the community. The last request \nincludes the Menominee Tribal Enterprises to be considered for the \nRural Business Opportunity Grant in order to establish a business \nnetwork including a market analysis.\n\n\n                         Resource Conservation\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Resource conservation is an essential element \nof our Nation's agriculture programs that has proven to be very popular \nwith farmers and ranchers. The incentives incorporated in programs such \nas the Farmland Protection Program, the Conservation Reserve Program, \nand the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, have not only \nheightened the awareness and value of good conservation practices, but \nthey have made it possible for families to continue limited production \nand be compensated for protecting fragile resources. The success of \nthese programs is that family farms can retain their economic viability \nand continue to contribute to the stability of communities throughout \nthe Nation.\n  Conservation programs have touched on many fragile resources, but \nhave not sufficiently encouraged the protection of the historic \nheritage that is embodied in historic buildings, structures, objects, \nand archaeological sites on farmland. Congress has declared that the \nspirit and direction of the nation is reflected in its historic \nheritage, and that the preservation of this heritage is in the public \ninterest. Therefore, I believe we must work together to protect our \ncommon heritage embedded on these private lands.\n  Senator Kohl, today I am requesting a report to the United States \nCongress from the United States Department of Agriculture evaluating \ntheir conservation programs under the Natural Resources Conservation \nService with the objective of determining what affirmative and \nprogrammatic actions are being taken to conserve and protect \narchaeological and historical resources on agricultural lands. \nFurthermore, this report should also provide or suggest new methods or \nprogram modifications to the conservation programs which will increase \nthe protection of historical and archaeological resources on \nagricultural lands and help determine the manner in which these type of \nlands can be included within the overall goal of natural resources \nprotection.\n  Finally, I am requesting that this report be completed within 120 \ndays of enactment of the FY04 Agriculture Appropriations bill.\n  Senator Kohl, will you support this request and work towards its \ninclusion in the final conference report of the FY 04 Agriculture \nAppropriations bill?\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator for bringing this matter to my \nattention. I will work to include this provision during conference \nnegotiations of this bill.\n\n[[Page S14019]]\n\n                    tree assistance program funding\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to recognize Senator Bennett \nand Senator Kohl for their effort on behalf of our Nation's farmers. At \nthis time, I would like to engage them in a colloquy regarding the need \nto provide aid to the fruit orchards of Western New York through the \nTree Assistance Program.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from New York for his kind remarks, \nand would be happy to engage in a colloquy with him.\n  Mr. KOHL. I am also happy to engage in this colloquy with the Senator \nfrom New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. As the Senators may know, New York is the third largest \nproducer of tart cherries in the nation and Wayne County is the largest \ncherry-producing county in New York. Unfortunately, fruit orchards \nthroughout Western New York sustained major damages as a result of a 3-\nday long ice storm in April. Approximately 85 percent of the tart \ncherry trees in Wayne County were severely damaged or destroyed by the \nstorm. Throughout the region, sweet cherry, peach, pear, apple and plum \ntrees were destroyed by the violent ice storm. The impact that these \nlosses are already having on the fruit tree industry in New York is \ndevastating and will continue to effect growers in for years to come \nsince it takes new trees over eight years to mature. In fact, it is \nestimated that losses resulting from this April's storms could reach a \ntotal of $15,000,000.\n  Federal assistance is greatly needed to cover the expenses of \nremoving and replacing the ruined trees. The Tree Assistance Program \n(TAP) was created in order to help farmers facing the challenges now \nfaced by those in Western New York. The TAP provides assistance to \neligible growers who have lost trees used for commercial purposes as a \nresult of a natural disaster.\n  Since its reauthorization, the TAP has yet to receive funding in \norder to carry out its mission. However, the House-passed version of \nthe FY04 Agricultural Appropriations Act contains $5,000,000 in funding \nfor the TAP program in order to provide assistance to the growers of \nWestern New York. The inclusion of these funds in this year's USDA \nbudget are extremely important to the long term health of the fruit \nindustry in New York.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from New York, \nand assure him that I will take his concerns into consideration when \nconferencing the House and Senate bills.\n  Mr. KOHL. I too, appreciate the difficulties facing these farmers, \nand will work with the chairman to do what we can during conference.\n\n\n                  eelgrass restoration in rhode island\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a brief colloquy with \nthe distinguished ranking member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Agriculture, Senator Kohl, regarding \nlanguage in the Committee's report to accompany S. 1427, the fiscal \nyear 2004 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, \nand Related Agencies Appropriations bill. I thank the Senator from \nWisconsin for including language in the committee's report recognizing \nthe importance of eelgrass habitats to marine ecosystems along the \ncoast of the Atlantic Ocean, and urging the Department of Agriculture \nto make funds available for projects in Rhode Island to enhance these \nhabitats. I understand that it was the Committee's intention to \nencourage USDA to make such funding available through the Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), rather than through the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) as stated on page 101 \nof Senate Report 108-107. The purpose of our colloquy today is to \nclarify that the report language should have read as follows: ``The \nCommittee urges the Department to give consideration to the use of WHIP \nfunding for projects in Rhode Island, and similar areas, that will \nenhance these habitats.''\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island is correct. I \njoin him in stating for the record that the Committee urges the \nDepartment of Agriculture to make funding available through the \nWildlife Habitat Incentives Program for eelgrass habitat projects in \nRhode Island.\n\n\n                             heber springs\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it has recently come to my attention that \nthere is urgent need to construct a new medical facility with the \nassociated water and sewer capability in Heber Springs in my home State \nof Arkansas.\n  Heber Springs is located in the medically underserved rural part of \nnorth-central Arkansas. It is the only hospital in Cleburne County and \nsurrounding areas providing treatment for local citizens.\n  Mr. KOHL. Just to make sure I understand, this is a medically \nunderserved area?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes, this 34-year-old facility is the only one in this \ncounty and surrounding areas. Secondary facilities are approximately \none hour in driving distance. Additionally, the population of Cleburne \nCounty and secondary service areas have grown more than threefold \nduring the past thirty-four years.\n  Mr. KOHL. What are the numbers of emergency room visits for that \nincreased population?\n  Mr. PRYOR. The emergency room experienced over 8,000 visits during \n2001. This volume of patients cannot be managed safely or efficiently \nin a thirty-four year old emergency room with a four patient capacity. \nAdditionally, the hospital operated on 851 patients in 2001 with only \none small preoperative room available and three beds available for \nrecovery. The volume of outpatients reached 13,649 in that year. The \ncurrent facility has been found deficient by both the Joint Commission \non Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the Arkansas \nDepartment of Health.\n  I would request that this community be included in the conference \nreport under the Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP) for the \nCommunity Facility Loan and Grant Program and the Water and Waste Loan \nand Grant Program for consideration of funding for a new facility with \nwater and sewer assistance.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator for making me and the committee aware \nof Heber Springs' situation and I will work with you to address these \nissues in conference.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank you for consideration of these requests.\n\n\n                  energy photovoltaics in rural areas\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to bring to your \nattention a renewable energy program for rural communities that I \nbelieve should be given strong consideration for funding. There is a \nprogram in my state of New Jersey in Gloucester, Burlington, and \nHunterdon Counties that will use photovoltaics to generate electricity \nin remote agriculture locations to power water supply systems for farm \nanimals and ventilation systems in livestock barns.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from the State of New Jersey. This \nprogram sounds interesting, but tell me, are rural areas being deprived \nof adequate energy sources?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am glad the Senator asked that question. The \neconomic pressure of rapid suburbanization is forcing farmers to lower \noperating costs to preserve their farming operations in New Jersey. \nFarms with livestock often need remote watering stations, ventilation \nin barns, and shade in grazing fields. Satisfying these requirements \ntraditionally requires substantial capital investment and increases \noperating costs. The use of electricity from photovoltaics would offer \nthe lowest cost option for farmers to apply these improvements. Energy \nPhotovoltaics, Inc., based in Lawrenceville, NJ, will provide and \nmonitor this technology.\n  Mr. KOHL. This sounds like the type of initiative that should receive \nconsideration under the Renewable Energy Program. I thank the Senator \nfrom New Jersey for bringing this program to my attention. As we \nproceed to conference, I will do what I can to see that this activity \nreceives proper attention.\n\n\n                           louisiana programs\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Agriculture appropriations subcommittee \nfor the opportunity to address several issues as the Agricultural \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2004 is considered on the floor of \nthe Senate as well as in a conference with House Agricultural \nAppropriations Subcommittee. It is my intention in this statement to \nexpress positions with respect to several areas of particular \nimportance to me and my State of Louisiana that the\n\n[[Page S14020]]\n\nchairman and ranking member will take during conference with the House. \nI would also like to thank both the chairman and ranking member for the \nnumber of my requests that have been addressed in S. Rept. 108-107.\n  First, there are two instances where the House Committee report, 108-\n193, included references to items that were not provided for in the \nSenate report. On page 28 of the House Report, $1.5 million was \nprovided for planning and design in the establishment of a new facility \nat the ARS Sugarcane Research Laboratory in Houma, Louisiana. Also, on \npage 18 of the same report, language was included that referenced the \nPennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC). Although, neither item is \nincluded in Senate Report, 108-107, I request that the Senate defer to \nthe House and provide for both items in a final conference report just \nexactly as they are referenced in the House Report.\n  Second, during the fiscal year 2003 appropriation process, both the \nSenate Agricultural Appropriations Committee Report, 107-223, p. 55 and \nSenate Amendment 1 to the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, H.J. \nRes. 2 or Omnibus Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2003, provided \n$70,000 to be used to initiate a multi-year program to conduct clinical \nepidemiologic research on diseases associated with intensive reptile \ndisease research in Louisiana. Unfortunately, this funding was not \nincluded in H.J. Res. 2 as signed into law on February 20, 2003, P.L. \n108-7. Although I included this same request among my requests \nsubmitted to the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee in \nfiscal year 2004, unfortunately there was no funding provided in either \nthe Senate or House Bills. I am hopeful that during conference \nnegotiations, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture \nSubcommittee can provide some funding for this urgent research.\n  Third, I am hopeful that during conference negotiations, the Chairman \nand Ranking Member can recognize the expertise of Grambling State \nUniversity in Louisiana, one of 117 Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities (HBCUs) which for over 100 years has been providing \nAfrican American farmers the education and skills to produce better \ncrops. Specifically, Grambling's contribution in the area of \naquaculture research has and would continue to spur economic \ndevelopment and sustainability within impoverished communities in North \nCentral Louisiana and the Louisiana Delta Region. In addition, the \nsignificant impact of this research would be felt among farmers and \nbusinesses throughout the State. Furthermore, this research would \naccentuate the intent of the White House Initiatives on HBCUs regarding \nincreasing both the capacity and capability for HBCUs to engage in \nresearch. Grambling State University would serve as the lead \ninstitution in a collaborative effort that will lend the expertise of \ninstitutional resources and technical support in assisting individuals \nand communities among the tri-State areas of Arkansas, Louisiana and \nMississippi.\n  Finally, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for \nmaintaining the funding at the same levels as fiscal year 2003 for four \naccounts that greatly impact the Nation's 18 historically black land-\ngrant colleges and universities or the 1890s as they are often \nreferred. Southern University of my State of Louisiana is among this \ngroup of very important and unique public universities. These four \naccounts include: Evans Allen--research formula funds; Extension \nformula funds; Capacity building Grants Program and Facilities Funding \nGrants. While I realize that the Subcommittee's spending cap for this \nyear is significantly less than last year, I request that these four \naccounts be increased during conference negotiations with the House. \nWith adequate funding the 1890 black land-grant colleges and \nuniversities could build and sustain new areas of specialization and, \nthus become more competitive in attracting public and private \nfinancing. Capacity Building is the model for eradicating historic \ninequities in State and Federal funding to the 1890 black land-grant \ncolleges/universities, especially with regards to chronically under-\nfunded faculty capacity. In fact, a recently released GAO study, 03-\n541, May 2003, entitled ``USDA's Outreach to Minority Serving \nInstitutions Could Improve Grant Competition'' highlights capacity \nbuilding and facilities funding as two key areas necessary for \nsuccessful competitive grant awards. The GAO study finds that many \n1890s need to attract top faculty to perform research, and it is very \ndifficult to do so when research facilities are underfunded. An \nincrease in facilities funding is necessary to fund costs of badly \nneeded facilities while not hindering the improvements today for \nresearch, extension, students and faculty on 1890s campuses.\n  Increased Research and Extension formula funding means saving \notherwise lost faculty positions at the Nation's historically black \nland-grant universities. Cash-strapped States are actually forcing cuts \nand substantial tuition increases on these institutions who served \nstudents from the lower economic scale. Formula funds constitute the \ncore of 1890 land-grant programs and are critical to sustaining the \n1890s land-grant mission of teaching, research and extension and public \nservice. I am hopeful that we can find a way to increase the funding \nfor some if not all of these four accounts.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I recognize the importance of the above \nitems to the Senator from Louisiana and will be as helpful as I can \nduring conference negotiations to address these issues as she has \nrequested.\n\n\n                 north carolina agromedicine institute\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. As a partnership of three strong North Carolina \nuniversities, the North Carolina Agromedicine Institute is a leader in \ndeveloping collaborative initiatives with colleagues in agencies and \nuniversities throughout the country. The Institute is having a \nsignificant impact in my State of North Carolina, across the Southeast \nregion, and across the country, on the health and safety of workers and \ntheir families in agriculture, forestry, and commercial fishing--three \nof the four most dangerous occupations in the Nation.\n  Support from the Congress over the past 3 years has provided \nessential core funding to the Institute as it has strived to initiate \nresearch projects to address some of the important health and safety \nissues that are found, not just in North Carolina, but also in all the \nsoutheastern States and across the Nation. In addition, fiscal year \n2003 funding has been used to expand the Institute's focus to address \nthe important areas of food safety, agricultural disasters, and \nagroterrorism. The Institute is working with the NC State Health \nDepartment, Department of Agriculture and other governmental agencies \nin these efforts. This year, the Senate Agriculture Appropriations \nCommittee appropriated $139,000 while the House Agriculture \nAppropriations set aside $278,000 for the Institute. It is vital that \nthe Institute receive the House level if it is to maintain its cutting-\nedge work.\n  When the House and Senate conference committee considers the fiscal \nyear 2004 agriculture appropriations measure, I strongly urge you and \nyour fellow conferees to provide $278,000 for the NC Agromedicine \nInstitute.\n  Senator Kohl, you have been a strong supporter of the Institute and I \ngreatly appreciate your efforts.\n  Mr. Kohl. I appreciate your request and I assure you I and my fellow \nconferees will give your request full consideration.\n\n\n                          garden state ethanol\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senators Bennett \nand Kohl for their leadership on this appropriations bill for \nAgriculture and related agencies for fiscal year 2004.\n  I would also like to take a moment to engage my colleagues Mr. Kohl \nand Mr. Bennett in a colloquy.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank my colleague for his kind words and would be happy \nto engage in a colloquy with the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BENNETT. And I the same.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that in Title \nIII of this bill, a new program in renewable energy has been added to \nthe bill. the Senate committee report accompanying this bill identified \na number of worthy projects under this program.\n  I hope that the conferees to this bill will consider adding to this \nlist a promising project from my State. The State of New Jersey has \nentered a partnership with Garden State Ethanol, a consortium of \nfarmers that wants to provide the farmers of New Jersey and surrounding \nStates with an alternative\n\n[[Page S14021]]\n\nmarket for their field corn, while generating a profit for its \ninvestors and producing a domestic, renewable transportation fuel. They \nplan to create an ethanol plant in order to provide a new opportunity \nfor area producers to sell their grain, and to employ directly \nsignificant numbers of farmers and laborers. In addition, this project \nwill create jobs related to the construction/renovation of the plant, \ngenerate an increase in wages, and increase the output of the regional \neconomy.\n  With a strong commitment to agriculture combined with its close \nproximity to high-value markets, New Jersey makes an excellent location \nfor an ethanol production plant.\n  Mr. KOHL. I share my colleague from New Jersey's interest in this \nproject and also urge the conferees on this bill to include this \nproject in the conference report under the Renewable Energy Program.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would like to join my colleague, Mr. Kohl, in voicing \nmy support for this project, and also hope that it will be added in \nconference.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture for their \ninterest in this project and for their outstanding leadership on this \nessential appropriations bill.\n\n\n                        tree assistance program\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. On September 14, I was pleased to have the opportunity \nto host our second annual Farm Day, an event that I derive great \npleasure from. While showcasing agriculture, our State's No. 1 \nindustry, my excitement was put in check by some visitors that stopped \nby my office before the festivities. Cherry growers from Wayne County \nhad made the long trek down to Washington, not to partake in the fun of \nFarm Day, but to remind me, and the rest of our country, of the perils \nof their profession.\n  Mr. KOHL. It is my understanding that these farmers suffered a \ndevastating loss this spring.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. That is correct. We depend on farmers for the food on \nour tables but rarely do we contemplate the vital part farmers and \ngrowers play in our local and State economies. On April 3, 2003, Mother \nNature dealt our New York cherry growers an unbearable hardship. \nSeventy-five percent of our cherry orchards and 20 percent of our peach \norchards were destroyed by an atypically severe ice storm.\n  Today, I strongly believe that we as a country have an obligation to \nspecialty crop producers. New York State growers have historically been \nself-sufficient, asking for little and receiving next to nothing in \ncomparison to large staple crop producers. Ineligible for the crop \ninsurance that many other farmers benefit from, fruit growers' need for \ndirect assistance from the Federal Government is all the more \nimperative during times of natural disaster.\n  Mr. KOHL. What assistance is available to these farmers?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. As I explained in my letter to the Committee dated \nApril 16, 2003, without our help in funding the Tree Assistance Program \n(TAP), most, if not all cherry growers will not be able to afford the \ncosts of replanting on top of the estimated 20 percent annual income \nloss they will incur over the next 7 to 10 years while new cherry trees \nmature to regular production capacity. Wayne County farmers cannot bear \nthis and neither can the economy of New York, a State that ranks second \nonly to Michigan in tart cherry production. I respectfully ask that you \nrecede to the House on this measure in conference.\n  Mr. KOHL. I understand the concerns of the Senator from New York, and \nI assure her that I will do what I can to be helpful during our \nconference with the House.\n\n\n          farmers' market electronic benefits transfer program\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I would like to ask today that Senator Kohl and other \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee give consideration to a matter \nof great importance to me. Few would disagree that we are living in an \nincreasingly complex world. It is a world dominated by technological \ninnovation but still ruled by the most basic of needs. Two years ago, \nNew York was chosen for a special pilot program related to the Food \nStamp Program. Since the food stamp program changed to the debit card \nsystem, farmers' markets across the country have been left out of the \nfood stamp program. Lacking electricity or the necessary phone lines to \nhard wire the terminals needed to process the new food stamp cards, \nfarmers' markets have been forced to refuse business, while food stamp \nrecipients have been denied the opportunity to patronize local fresh \nmarkets.\n  Mr. KOHL. I understand that in previous Agriculture Appropriations \nbills, the State of New York received a grant to try to curb this \nproblem. What was that funding used for, and what needs remain?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. USDA grants have paid for the purchase of over 50 \nelectronic benefit transfer machines. Now it is up to us to make sure \nthis investment proves to be a worthwhile one. Though there are already \npositive reports about the use of this new technology in New York \nfarmers' markets, we have an obligation to insure that in the upcoming \nfiscal year the necessary funds are made available to facilitate the \nintegration of this new equipment, in such a way that we may have an \naccurate picture of the viability of EBT nationwide. To do anything \nless is illogical and unfair to the many communities that have openly \nembraced this pilot program. I therefore request that you support the \nHouse language continuing the electronic benefit transfer grant program \nin conference.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the Senator from New York bringing this to my \nattention, and appreciate the hard work she does on behalf of her \nconstituents. I will keep her concerns under consideration as we work \nto complete this bill in our conference with the House.\n\n\n          Delmarva Conservation Corridor Demonstration Program\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my good friend and \ncolleague from Delaware, Senator Carper, to bring to the attention of \nthe esteemed ranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee an important provision in his bill relating to the \nDelmarva Conservation Corridor Demonstration Program.\n  I just want to take a few minutes to emphasize the importance of this \nprovision for the State of Delaware and for the entire Delmarva \npeninsula. As you know, the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture \nwas authorized to develop a Delmarva Conservation Corridor \nDemonstration Program in the 2002 farm bill. Unfortunately, the USDA \nhas not implemented the program.\n  The Delmarva Conservation Corridor Demonstration Program does, \nhowever, complement the existing conservation provisions in the bill \nand allows the USDA to target the benefits of watershed-based \nconservation programs to farmlands that local stakeholders have \ndetermined to be the most ecologically and economically important.\n  We must prevent the shrinking and fragmentation of undeveloped open \nspace that results from increasing growth pressures. By fortifying and \nrestoring green infrastructure, we can maximize the ecological and \nworking lands' potential of our landscape. Creating extensive corridors \nof both natural and agricultural lands will safeguard wildlife habitat, \ncontiguous headwaters, wetlands and open space. Left unprotected, our \nremaining green infrastructure is vulnerable and will be further \nreduced or fragmented.\n  The Delmarva Peninsula is blessed with an abundance of important \nnatural resources and productive working lands that support \nagriculture, forestry and the seafood industry. We believe that this is \nthe right time to make this commitment to conservation that reaches \nacross state lines and is important to a much larger region.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, let me say that I agree with everything \nthe Senator has said about the importance of the Delmarva Conservation \nCorridor Demonstration Program.\n  In addition to your comments, I would only add a request to our \ncolleagues who have been working on this Agriculture appropriations \nbill that they be made aware that the 2002 Farm bill included specific \nlanguage that authorized the Secretary to develop this program with the \nintent that it would provide a benefit not just to the three states of \nDelaware, Maryland and Virginia, but also to other programs being \nconsidered throughout the country. The lessons learned from work on the \nDelmarva Conservation Corridor will improve similar efforts elsewhere.\n\n[[Page S14022]]\n\n  Conferees should also be made aware that their colleagues in the \nHouse agree that the intent of the provision was to allow the Secretary \nof Agriculture and the States appropriate flexibility in using the \nresources of existing agricultural conservation and forestry programs. \nIn supporting this program during the farm bill, it was not our intent, \nnor is it today, to require new or earmarked funding. The USDA has not \nyet implemented this program because of what I believe is a \nmisunderstanding regarding the concept of the program and the \ncongressional intent contained within the farm bill. This confusion \nshould be resolved so that this example of effective conservation \npolicy can be realized.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank my colleagues for their interest in this program, \nand I want you to know that I understand the importance the Delmarva \nConservation Corridor Demonstration Program has to the State of \nDelaware and the entire Delmarva Peninsula. I can assure you both that \nI will support this project in conference and do all I can to see that \nit becomes a reality.\n\n\n              viticulture assistance for the state of iowa\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the State of Iowa has a blossoming \nviticulture industry, but the demand for technical assistance far \nexceeds the State's current resources. I have discussed this problem \nwith the Senator from Utah and I appreciate his interest in the issue.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Iowa has explained to me that his State \nis in need of specialized assistance through funding for a viticulture \ntechnician to provide on-site technical assistance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. A viticulture technician would help new producers with \nthe basic knowledge needed about the industry. Such assistance will \nenable growers to benefit from increased production, and in turn, \nproduce more successful vineyard businesses in Iowa.\n  This proposal has tremendous support from the Iowa Grape Growers \nAssociation, the Mississippi Valley Grape Growers Association, the \nWestern Iowa Grape Growers Association, and the Iowa Wine and Grape \nDevelopment Commission.\n\n\n             study on north carolina horticulture industry\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, the horticulture industry in North Carolina \nis a fast growing industry contributing significantly to the State's \neconomy. Though local, State and Federal officials know that the \nindustry is important, there has been no analysis done to quantify the \nimpact of this industry on North Carolina's economy.\n  Perhaps a possible remedy might be to direct the USDA Economic \nResearch Service to coordinate with the North Carolina Department of \nAgriculture and NC State University to collect the economic data and do \nthe statistical analysis necessary to conduct this study.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator from North \nCarolina that I appreciate the suggestion particularly in light of the \nbudget constraints that we face. I will be happy to look into this \nmatter to see if there is a workable solution that will achieve the \ndesired result.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his consideration \non this matter.\n\n\n                 national rural development partnership\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee regarding funding for the National Rural \nDevelopment Partnership (NRDP) for federal fiscal year 2004.\n  Last year, Congress included in the Farm Bill the provisions of the \nNational Rural Development Partnership Act, which I sponsored along \nwith the Senior Senator from North Dakota and 43 of our colleagues. The \nFarm Bill's NRDP language authorizes annual appropriations of up to $10 \nmillion. This authorization was included because of a recognition that \nthe funding arrangement for the Partnership, which has been in place \nsince its establishment a dozen years ago, has failed to provide \nadequate resources for the NRDP and the state rural development \ncouncils (SRDCs). That funding arrangement has depended on voluntary \ncontributions of discretionary funds from USDA and four other federal \nagencies, as well as matching funds from the states and others.\n  The work of the NRDP and SRDCs is more important than ever. The \ncurrent economic downturn has hit rural America hard. Drought and low \nprices have had a devastating impact on production agriculture, which \ncontinues to be the economic foundation of many rural communities. \nOther rural communities that depend on logging or mining have seen \nemployment and economic activity diminish in those important \nindustries. The nationwide decline in manufacturing has resulted in the \nclosure of thousands of factories in rural areas, eliminating the sole \nor principal source of good-paying jobs in many rural communities. This \nsituation has been aggravated by the fiscal challenges facing most \nState governments. As States slash budgets, the level of vital services \nupon which rural residents depend--from education and health care to \ntransportation and libraries--has been greatly diminished. At this dire \ntime in rural America, we must support organizations like the SRDCs \nwhich can help our citizens respond to the many challenges they face.\n  This year's committee report accompanying the fiscal year 2004 \nAgriculture Appropriations Bill includes language encouraging the USDA \nto continue its support of the NRDP and SRDCs by providing stable \nfunding, technical support, and guidance practices as they have done \nover past years. Similar language was included in the Senate \nsubcommittee's report on the fiscal year 2003 Agricultural \nAppropriations bill.\n  I appreciate the support the Chairman and Ranking Member have shown \nfor the NRDP and SRDCs. Besides continuing current USDA involvement, it \nis important to continue and intensify its efforts to secure support \nfor the NRDP and SRDCs from other federal agencies and with rural \nresponsibilities as it has done successfully in the past. This is \nconsistent with the intention of Congress in the Conference Committee \nReport of the 2002 Farm Bill.\n  The committee report has spoken to the importance of the Department \ncontinuing to support the continued development and increased \ninvolvement of the NRDP and SRDCs. I would also appreciate the \nCommittee's continued emphasis on importance of multi-agency \ncooperation with USDA to strengthen this vital effort to spur and \nstrengthen our rural economies.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I concur with my colleague's sentiments \non the importance of multi-agency involvement in rural development. I \nappreciate the Senator's comments and look forward to our continuing to \nwork together to support this effort when this bill goes to conference.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, our subcommittee has a consistent history of \nsupporting this rural development effort and promoting this kind of \nmulti-disciplinary approach. That was the intent of our committee \nreport and, I am sure, will continue to be an important focus of the \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S14022-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the live of a brave young man from Fort \nWayne, IN. Specialist Brian H. Penisten, 28 years old, died in Al \nFallujah on November 2, 2003, after the Chinook helicopter he was \ntraveling in made a crash landing. Brian joined the Army with his \nentire life before him. He chose to risk everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the \nworld.\n  Brian was the seventeenth Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving \nhis country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Brian leaves behind his father, \nJohn Penisten, his mother, Mona, his\n\n[[Page S14023]]\n\nfiancee, Johnna Loia, and his son, Trevor. Today, I join Brian's \nfamily, his friends, and the entire Fort Wayne community in mourning \nhis death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over his death, we can \nalso take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the \nworld a safer place. It is this courage and strength of character that \npeople will remember when they think of Brian, a memory that will burn \nbrightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Before leaving to fight in Iraq, Brian Penisten told his mother that \nhe was proud to be an American. Today, his family members him as a true \nAmerican hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while serving his \ncountry.\n  Brian was born on March 30, 1975. He graduated from Bishop Dwenger \nHigh School, where he was a member of the wrestling team and was \nundefeated through the semi-State Championship in 1993. Friends and \nfamily members remember Brian for the inner drive he demonstrated in \nalways challenging himself to be his best at whatever task lay at hand.\n  After joining the Army, Brian left home to begin full-time duty at \nFort Carson in Colorado. He was assigned to the 3rd Air Defense \nArtillery, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Brian's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Brian's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Brian H. Penisten in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families such as Brian's can find comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and pay \ntribute to Mr. Umberto P. Fedeli of Gates Mills, OH as a 2003 Ellis \nIsland Medal of Honor recipient.\n  The prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor award is presented \nannually to ``remarkable Americans who exemplify outstanding qualities \nin both their personal and professional lives,'' and ``who have \ndistinguished themselves as citizens of the United States, while \ncontinuing to preserve the richness of their particular heritage.''\n  Umberto P. Fedeli is such an American. In addition to creating a \nbusiness in Ohio and being active in numerous charitable causes, \nUmberto has maintained strong ties to the Italian American community. \nI've often said, ``show me someone who is proud of their ethnic \nheritage and I'll show you a great American!''\n  Mr. Fedeli's parents immigrated from Lascio, Italy to the same \nneighborhood in which I grew up--the Collinwood neighborhood of \nCleveland, OH. He learned many important lessons from his father, \nUmberto, Sr. including a philosophy of life which is based on \nintegrity, loyalty, civic responsibility and a strong work ethic.\n  In his early 20s, Mr. Fedeli formed a partnership which led to the \ncreation of his own insurance company, The Fedeli Group which he built \nto one of the top 100 insurance firms in the nation. Today his company \nemploys 85 people and provides a range of insurance products and \nservices--property, general liability, life, health, workmen's \ncompensation and estate planning. It provides insurance for over 3,000 \nbusinesses and, remarkably, has averaged nearly 20 percent growth per \nyear for 20 years.\n  The Fedeli Group has received many industry awards and has been named \nseveral times as winner of the Weatherhead 100's fastest growing \ncompanies in northeastern Ohio.\n  Through the years, Mr. Fedeli has been active in Ohio politics--\nserving on advisory committees for my campaigns, those of Senator Mike \nDeWine and countless other state, local and national candidates.\n  As Governor-elect of Ohio in 1991, I appointed Umberto Fedeli to my \ngubernatorial transition team and after I took office, I was pleased to \nappoint him to the Ohio Turnpike Commission where he served as chairman \nfor 6 years. Under his leadership, the turnpike's resources served as a \ncatalyst for growth and economic development. In fact, as Governor, I \nnoted that ``Umberto's leadership will be remembered as the Turnpike \nCommission's most energetic and accomplished era.'' I still believe \nthat today. Umberto Fedeli was the best leader of the turnpike aside \nfrom the man who created it.\n\n  Mr. Fedeli is very involved in his community and is a friend to \ncountless people in northeast Ohio, across the State--and throughout \nour Nation. He values serving others above all else, including his \nfamily, his church, his clients and his community.\n  He has been named Man of the Year for both the Italian-American \nSports Hall of Fame and the Americans of Italian Heritage. In 1995, he \nwas recognized by the John Carroll University Business School as one of \n``Fifty of Its Finest.''\n  Umberto serves as chairman of the Cleveland Chapter of Legatus, an \ninternational group of Catholic CEOs for which he also serves on the \nInternational Board of Directors. He was recognized as 2002 Officer of \nthe Year for Legatus, and became a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre of \nJerusalem, administered by the Holy See, in 1998.\n  He received both the Grand Illusion Award for the Ohio Cancer \nResearch Associates and the National Multiple Sclerosis Norman Cohn \nHope Award for philanthropic and community service. In 2000 he was \nhonored by the Italian Federation with its Columbian Award and 2003 Man \nof the Year for the Christ Child Society.\n  In 1995, Umberto was instrumental in the formation of the Northern \nOhio Italian American Foundation, a group of prominent business people \nwho lend philanthropic support to various groups in northeast Ohio and \nwhich he presently serves as chairman.\n  In 1997, the Northern Ohio Italian American Foundation established \nthe Bishop Anthony M. Pilla Institute of Italian American Studies at \nJohn Carroll University.\n  Umberto is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Cleveland \nClinic Foundation, the Board of Trustees at John Carroll University and \ntrustee of the Cleveland Catholic Diocese Foundation.\n  Mr. Fedeli cares deeply for others and gives witness to his faith in \nGod every day by helping people he knows well and those he has never \nmet. He gives witness to the second great commandment, ``Love thy \nneighbor as thyself'' at every opportunity.\n  He is a role model in every sense of the word: in terms of his \ndevotion to his family, his success in business and his contributions \nto his ``extended family'' in the community.\n  He and his wife Maryellen, whom he describes as the only girlfriend \nhe ever had, have been married for 19 years and have five children.\n  Umberto Fedeli is indeed a remarkable American of the highest \nintegrity in both his personal and professional life. He has made many \noutstanding contributions to the Italian American community, to his \nlocal community and to America.\n  I am proud to recognize my friend, Umberto P. Fedeli and congratulate \nhim on this wonderful honor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Daniel Bader, a fellow Nebraskan and staff sergeant in the United \nStates Army. Sergeant Bader was killed on November 2 near Fallujah, \nIraq when the Chinook helicopter he was aboard was shot down. Sergeant \nBader was one of 15 soldiers killed and 25 wounded en route to the \nUnited States for two weeks of leave. He was 28 years old.\n  Sergeant Bader served in the 3rd Armored Cavalry, Tiger Squadron, \nbased in Fort Carson, CO. He was deployed to Iraq on April 4, 2003.\n  A York, NE, native, Sergeant Bader was a dedicated soldier who was \ncommitted to his family and country. He\n\n[[Page S14024]]\n\njoined the military shortly after graduating from high school and \n``absolutely loved'' his career in the Army, said his wife, Tiffany. In \naddition to his wife, Sergeant Bader leaves behind a 14-month-old \ndaughter, Taryn Makenzie. Our thoughts and prayers are with them both \nat this difficult time.\n  Sergeant Bader and thousands of brave American service men and women \nconfront danger every day in Iraq. Their tremendous risks and \nsacrifices must never be taken fro granted. For his service, bravery, \nand sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in \nhonoring SGT Daniel Bader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S14024-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. PHILLIP BOARDMAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Phillip \nBoardman on his selection as Nevada Professor of the Year by the \nCouncil for Advancement and Support of Education and the Carnegie \nFoundation for the Advancement of Teaching.\n  As someone whose life was transformed by education, I understand the \nimportance of recognizing the work of good teachers, and I consider it \nan honor to speak today of Dr. Boardman's dedication to teaching and \ncommitment to his students.\n  This award is a major accomplishment. The Professor of the Year \nAwards are the only national awards to recognize college and university \nprofessors for their teaching skills. But this is by no means the first \ntime Dr. Boardman has been honored for his great gift as a teacher. He \nhas previously received awards from the University of Nevada and the \nState of Nevada Regents.\n  A Professor of English and the Chair of Core Humanities at the \nUniversity of Nevada, Reno, UNR, Dr. Boardman is an expert on English \nand Renaissance literature and has taught for three decades at UNR. \nThroughout his career he has taught courses on Shakespeare, C.S. Lewis, \nthe Bible, medieval literature, linguistics, and composition.\n  Dr. Boardman's contributions to teaching have not been limited to the \nuniversity classroom. He has also delivered scores of presentations to \nhigh school classes, senior centers and libraries. He was the executive \nco-producer of the The Western Tradition Lectures, a videotaped series \nof nine lectures by UNR instructors.\n  Dr. Boardman has also made substantial contributions to scholarship. \nNot only has he edited books and written numerous articles and reviews, \nhe well soon complete his major 25-year project, The Arthurian Annals: \nThe Tradition in English from the Beginnings to 2000.\n  Despite his strong commitment to his teaching and scholarly \nresponsibilities, Dr. Boardman also finds time to assist his colleagues \nin their development as instructors. He was the author of a successful \nNational Endowment for the Humanities Challenge Grant, matched during \n1994-1998, to establish an endowment fund to support teacher stipends \nand faculty development at UNR. He has also written several articles on \nhow to approach teaching medieval literature and culture.\n  Dr. Boardman has led a distinguished career in an important and noble \nprofession. Please join me in congratulating him on his selection as \nthe Nevada Professor of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S14024-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable to our society.\n  Gregory Beauchamp, a 21-year old gay male, was the last homicide \nvictim of 2002 in Cincinnati, OH. On December 31, Mr. Beauchamp was \nheaded to a nightclub to ring in the New Year with friends. At about 9 \np.m. a blue Cadillac pulled up alongside them, and the four or five \nAfrican American men inside started yelling anti-gay epithets, \naccording to survivors of the attack. Shots were fired from the \nvehicle, killing Mr. Beauchamp.

Mr. President. I want to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues troubling reports that indicate one of America's leading \nphilanthropic foundations has meddled in world diplomacy in a deeply \ndisturbing way.\n  Let me say that I think my colleagues know very well that I have \ngreat respect for the good works done by America's non-profit sector, \nincluding philanthropic foundations. So much respect, in fact, that, as \nmy colleagues know, I am working with some of them to get a conference \ncommittee to convene with the other body so that we can complete work \non the CARE Act and provide a range of incentives that would boost \ncontributions to charities and foundations at a time of great need.\n  And so it pains me that I must come to the floor today to apprise my \ncolleagues of allegations that have been reported with regard to some \nof the activities of one of America's leading foundations, the Ford \nFoundation. The reports--published initially by the Jewish Telegraphic \nnewswire service and picked up by many newspapers around the country \nand in this week's New Republic magazine--describe how the Ford \nFoundation gave million of dollars to dozen of Palestinian \norganizations that have been in the forefront of the anti--semitic and \nanti-Israel campaign that is ongoing around the world.\n  In particular, these reports describe how the Ford Foundation funded \nPalestinian non-governmental organizations, NGOs, that were responsible \nfor transforming the 2001 United Nations Conference on Racism held in \nDurban, South Africa into a forum of virulent anti-Semitic and anti-\nIsrael hate. According to the investigation and reports--which \ninterviewed dozens of individuals and reviewed 9,000 pages of \ndocuments--Ford contributions financed the development of the anti-\nIsrael strategy and its public relations strategy for dissemination.\n  Accroding to the reports, Ford has extended more than $35 million in \ngrants to more than 270 Arab and Palestinian NGOs in the 2001-01 period \nalone, and since the 1950s, Ford has distributed nearly $200 million to \nArab and Islamic NGOs in the Mideast, and many Palestinian operatives \nwho were involved in the Durban Conference admit that ``Ford has made \nit possible for us to do much of our work'' and that ``Our biggest \ndonations come, of course, from Ford.''\n  At least two groups identified in the news reports--the Palestinians \nCommittee for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment and \nthe Palestinian NGO Network--received more than $2.5 million from Ford \nin the last few years and were key players in hijacking the agenda of \nthe Durban conference.\n  And let me just remind my colleagues how badly the Durban conference \nwas hijacked. It was so bad that Secretary of State Powell declared the \nconference to be ``a transparent attempt to delegitimize the moral \nargument for Israel's existence,'' and Secretary Powell withdrew our \ncountry's delegation from participation.\n  As The New Republic's editor in chief writes--``the Ford Foundation's \n. . . reckless generously is empowering foreign haters and apologists \nfor killers.''\n  In fairness, the Ford Foundation has denied the charges made in these \nreports. Ford's vice president has said that his institution was \n``shocked by the extremist rhetoric of some participants on Israeli-\nPalestinian issues.'' Moreover, Ford has said that it shares our \ngovernment's commitment to ``ensure that grant funds are not diverted \nfor terrorist and other purposes.''\n  I appreciate these statements by Ford, but I don't believe they have \nput this matter to rest. The news reports are too specific and well \ndocumented to be dismissed by such generalities.\n\n[[Page S14025]]\n\n  Fellow senators, we are in a war against terrorism and those who hate \nus and those who hate Israel are very often one and the same. We, of \ncourse, are responsible for ensuring that government funds we \ndistribute as foreign aid are serving our national security interests \nand those of our allies. But what I think these reports have brought to \nour attention is that there are other entities out there, foundations, \nand not just of the sort that are part of extremist communities whose \nclear purpose is to channel funds to the terrorists and against whom \nthe Treasury Department is moving aggressively and indictments are \nbeing handed down but well known, respected foundations can undermine \nour policies and activities by making an end run and supporting those \nwith whom we deeply disagree,\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I am going to be asking \nChairman Grassley that the committee look into this more deeply and \nagain review the controls we have in place for foundation activities \nand grant overseas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S14025-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VOLUNTEERS ARE ESSENTIAL TO VA\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, has some of the most dedicated volunteers in the country, \nand today I would like to shine a light on those at the Gainesville VA \nMedical Center, VAMC, in my home State of Florida.\n  The Malcolm Randall VAMC in Gainesville is a tertiary care facility \nthat specializes in an array of services including cardiology, \nneurosurgery, and nursing home care. With its symbiotic relationship to \nthe University of Florida, it is also an active teaching hospital. In \n2002, the hospital had 388,471 outpatient visits, and it continues to \ndraw hundreds of volunteers. The hospital currently has over 800 \nregistered volunteers.\n  The Gainesville Sun profiled some of these selfless individuals and \ntheir commitment to service at the VAMC. Included among these \nvolunteers was an 82-year-old widow named Dorothy ``Dot'' Caldwell. The \narticle described how every Tuesday, Dot leaves her home at 3:30 in the \nmorning to make the 1-hour drive to the medical center and then spends \n10 hours there. She makes this 100-mile round trip every week so she \ncan repay VA for the care if gave he husband William, a World War II \nveteran, her father, and two of her brothers. Dot has been volunteering \nat the Gainesville VAMC for 21 years.\n  Each of us owes a debt of gratitude to those who risked their lives \ndefending our country, and I am thankful to all of this Nation's \nhardworking, compassionate volunteers for helping to repay that debt. I \nam especially proud that such shining examples of this kind of service \nhail from my own State, one that is so highly populated with veterans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Gainesville Sun \nhighlighting the work of these volunteers, as well as the complete list \nof volunteers who work at the Gainesville VAMC be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Gainesville Sun, Sept. 25, 2003]\n\n                            Hospital Angels\n\n                           (By Julie Garrett)\n\n       At a time when friends and loved ones are serving our \n     country overseas and when cuts to veterans' benefits are \n     taking place back home, one way we can support veterans is by \n     taking care of those who need us here in the states.\n       Dorothy ``Dot'' Caldwell has given more than 20,500 hours \n     of volunteer time to the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center in \n     Gainesville. That's the equivalent of a full-time job for \n     more than 10 years.\n       Every Tuesday morning, she rises at 2:30 a.m. (``God wakes \n     me up. I don't need an alarm clock.'') so that she can be on \n     the road by 3:30 a.m. to make the one-hour trip to \n     Gainesville from her home in Old Town--a 100-mile round-trip \n     drive. She'll volunteer 10 hours, then start home at about \n     2:30 p.m. She's 82.\n       ``It's kind of special to see a vet smile at you when you \n     come in and just pat him on the arm or hand him something,'' \n     says Caldwell. ``That look of gratitude on their faces. They \n     light up. They look at us as family.''\n       Caldwell started volunteering at the VA 21 years ago after \n     her husband, William, a combat engineer during World War II, \n     underwent heart surgery.\n       ``I saw the volunteers running around and I said, `When you \n     get out of this hospital, we're gonna repay. We're gonna \n     volunteer.' He said, `Like hell I am.' ''\n       But she prevailed, fueled by the fact that William, her \n     father and two of her brothers were veterans who received \n     medical care through the VA. ``So I'm trying to pay back,'' \n     she says.\n       Her own health is good. William died of cancer 10 years ago \n     after the couple were married for 53 years.\n       ``Volunteering is keeping me young. God is rewarding me,'' \n     she says. ``You see veterans here a lot younger than I am and \n     they can't even feed themselves.''\n       The Gainesville VA had 388,471 outpatient visits in fiscal \n     year 2002, said John Pickens, public affairs officer for the \n     North Florida South Georgia Veteran's Health System.\n       And last year, more than 800 volunteers gave more than \n     80,000 hours at the VA Medical Center in Gainesville, says \n     Julie Baker, chief of voluntary services.\n       The youngest volunteers are 13, the eldest is 88, with a \n     50-50 split between male and female volunteers, Baker says.\n       The entire VA orientation takes about three hours and \n     consists of watching a short video and meeting with Baker.\n       Volunteers perform clerical duties, staff the information \n     desk, transport patients to appointments in departments \n     around the hospital and make hospitality visits. In the \n     pharmacy, they open and sort mail.\n       Groups from organizations such as the American Legion and \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars serve coffee and doughnuts in the \n     outpatient clinics' reception areas.\n       ``It's a great PR tool for us,'' says Baker. ``This is a \n     great way for a group to volunteer together.''\n       During the holidays, the VA encourages people to sing \n     Christmas carols to patients. You need to coordinate your \n     visit through the Voluntary Services office, but Baker says \n     it tends to be easier to set up a visit at the VA than at \n     other hospitals.\n       Students planning careers in medicine can get their feet \n     wet by volunteering at the VA. They observe in the emergency \n     room, surgical unit and intensive care unit, take specimens \n     to labs, answer phones and stock supplies.\n       Helena Chapman, a 22-year-old University of Florida \n     graduate student in public health, began volunteering at the \n     VA through the teen volunteer program as a 15-year-old Oak \n     Hall student.\n       At first, she volunteered through the recreational therapy \n     department, playing bingo with the veterans on Saturdays. \n     From there, she proceeded to the ICU, where she helped with \n     bedside stocking.\n       The nurses took her under their wing when they saw she was \n     a serious, consistent and responsible volunteer. It wasn't \n     long before she was drawn to medicine as a career choice.\n       On the lighter side, Chapman plays piano for the VA's \n     nursing home patients--there's a nursing home onsite--and \n     paints the nails of female veterans.\n       ``I like to pamper them,'' she said. ``Everyone has a story \n     to tell. I love 'em.''\n       Chapman was awarded the Disabled American Veterans' $5,000 \n     National Commander Youth Scholarship for 2002 for her \n     volunteering and plans to become a physician focusing on \n     geriatric medicine. Despite the demands of graduate school, \n     she still volunteers at least three hours a week, sometimes \n     up to 10.\n       Baker says the VA's teenage volunteer program is growing in \n     popularity as schools require community service for \n     graduation.\n       In the summer, young people ages 13 to 18 can volunteer two \n     to three full days a week, or weekdays four hours a day. The \n     VA starts accepting applications May 1. Slots fill quickly.\n       Once teens volunteer for the summer, they can return on \n     school breaks and weekends to continue volunteering, if they \n     choose.\n       And finally, if you've had bus driver fantasies all your \n     life, you can drive a van through the Disabled American \n     Veterans Driver Program. Drivers are needed to transport \n     veterans to appointments in Jacksonville, Ocala and \n     Inverness. You don't need a special driver's license to do \n     this, but they do check driving records and require a \n     physical.\n       ``We need more drivers. There's always a turnover,'' says \n     Baker.\n       Don Myhre, a 79-year-old retired UF professor, started \n     volunteering at the VA 11 years ago.\n       He and his wife travel a lot to visit family, but when he's \n     home in Gainesville he volunteers about four hours a day at \n     the VA.\n       He spent three years in the U.S. Army as an X-ray \n     technician during World War II. The GI Bill of Rights sent \n     him to college. He worked as a soil chemist and retired from \n     UF as a meritorious professor in 1991.\n       ``I'm giving back something to the government. That was a \n     good program,'' he says.\n       Myhre says he likes volunteering at the VA and being around \n     all sorts of people.\n       ``It's fun, and you get the benefit of lots of exercise. I \n     probably walk about 3 miles a day here. I like to be doing \n     something constructive.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S14025-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14025-S14026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE LIFE OF CONGRESSMAN FRANK McCLOSKEY\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of my fellow\n\n[[Page S14026]]\n\nHoosier, Congressman Frank McCloskey, who lost his battle with cancer \non Sunday, November 2. Congressman McCloskey dedicated his life to \nserving his country and our home State of Indiana, setting an example \nof personal conviction and political courage throughout his years as a \npublic servant.\n  Francis Xavier McCloskey was born on June 12, 1939 in Philadelphia. \nHe earned both his undergraduate and law degrees at Indiana University \nin Bloomington, where he would later serve as mayor for three terms, \nfollowing 4 years in the Air Force and a brief career as a newspaper \nreporter. During his time as mayor, McCloskey transformed Bloomington \npolitics with his new style of leadership. He initiated a transit \nservice and the first direct passageway through the center of \nBloomington, and oversaw the formation of city boards and commissions \ndedicated to the environment, women and human rights.\n  In 1982, McCloskey was elected to the U.S. Congress from Indiana's \n8th district. In a district known across the Nation for its tumultuous \nand closely contested races, McCloskey held his seat to serve as \nCongressman for six terms. During his time in office, Frank McCloskey \nbecame one of the first public servants to travel overseas and witness \nfirst hand the atrocities taking place in Bosnia. A man of great \ncompassion and conviction, Frank McCloskey focused his career on ending \nthe ethnic cleansing taking place in Bosnia during the 1990s. His \ndedication to the cause continued even after he left public office, \nuntil cancer forced him to cancel his plans to return to Bosnia and \ncontinue democratic reforms there.\n  The sense of loss to all those who knew Congressman Frank McCloskey \nis tremendous. His work in Bloomington and later in Washington inspired \na generation of Hoosiers to answer the call to public service. Many of \nIndian's current political leaders owe their start to the example set \nby McCloskey, and their continued works will serve as a lasting legacy \nto a man who dedicated his life to serving others. He is survived by \nhis wife, Roberta Ann Barker, and their two children, Helen and Mark.\n  It is my honor to enter the name of Congressman Frank McCloskey into \nthe Congressional Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S14026-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      HONORING MRS. CAROL KANAREK\n\n Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, every November \norganizations throughout America recognize the spirit of community \nservice with National Philanthropy Day.\n  This November, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate \nan outstanding Floridian, Mrs. Carol Kanarek of Vero Beach, who is \nreceiving the 2003 National Philanthropy Day Unsung Hero Award from the \nTreasure Coast Chapter of the Association of Fundraising Professionals.\n  The Unsung Hero Award is given to an individual who has been an \nexceptional volunteer. Carol Kanarek certainly fits this description.\n  Carol Kanarek is a valued member of the Vero Beach community for her \nleadership, commitment, and extensive knowledge and experience. She is \nknown as a coalition builder--someone who brings people and resources \ntogether to further the goals of the organizations for whom she \nvolunteers. She has a true love of people, and a compassion for all \ncauses.\n  For more than 20 years, Mrs. Kanarek has volunteered her time and \nenergy to numerous organizations in her community including health care \norganizations, religious organizations, schools, and charities. For \nexample, Mrs. Kanarek has worked with the Riverside Children's Theatre, \nthe March of Dimes, the United Way, the Visiting Nurses Association \nHospice House, St. Edwards School, and the Temple Beth Shalom. This \nlist is by no means exhaustive.\n  No project is too big or too small for Mrs. Kanarek. From chairing \nthe Rabbi Selection committee at Temple Beth Shalom to working the \nconcession stand at a Riverside Children's Theatre event, she always \nmakes time. When working on committees, Mr. Kanarek is known as a \nconsensus builder, always considering the concerns of others when \ndeveloping a solution. Her gracious manner and gentle persistence have \nmade Mrs. Kanarek a valuable asset to the many organizations of which \nshe is a member. Mrs. Kanarek's patience and tireless enthusiasm for \ncommunity service distinguish her as a woman who places others before \nherself.\n  Mr. President, philanthropy is one of defining characteristics of \nAmerican society. Service for the benefit of others and commitment to \nsomething greater than personal reward strengthen our communities and \nneighborhoods, bringing us together and improving our quality of life.\n  I commend Carol Kanarek for her commitment to community service, \nvolunteerism, and philanthropy. I am pleased that outstanding \nFloridians like Mrs. Kanarek are setting an example for communities \nacross our nation, and I want to thank her for her service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S14026-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE EXPLORING FREE ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, over the past few years \nthe U.S. Senate has acted to stimulate the American economy. This \nspring we passed an economic stimulus package to provide meaningful tax \nrelief for businesses and assistance for unemployed workers to soften \nthe blow of difficult economic times. We have also worked to approve \ntrade agreements that ensure a free and fair trade market for U.S. \nbusinesses.\n  As we work on these measures to improve our economy today, it is \nequally important to ensure that America's economy remains strong for \nthe next generation as well.\n  I recently joined with Chadron State College to establish the \nExploring Free Enterprise program. This program will focus on teaching \nstudents in elementary, middle and high school the principles of market \neconomics, entrepreneurship, personal financial success and business \nethics.\n  Entrepreneurship is a particularly important skill in Nebraska. A \nrevitalized rural economy requires individuals who are able to seize \nupon openings in the marketplace and expand employment opportunities.\n  Business ethics is another area of great importance. I am proud to be \na part of a program that will teach our future leaders that being \nhonest is even more important than making money.\n  In 2002 I was honored to receive the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Spirit \nof Enterprise award. The Exploring Free Enterprise program seeks to \nspread that spirit of enterprise to a new generation of young business \nleaders and entrepreneurs. It is their entrepreneurial spirit that will \ndrive America's economic engine in a competitive world economy.\n  I would like to thank Chadron State College for the opportunity to \nparticipate in this program and especially Dr. Rick Koza, the director \nof the program, and Dr. Tom Krepel, president Chadron State College, \nfor their leadership.\n  Together, our investment in education recognizes that while children \nmay only be 20 percent of our population, that they are 100 percent of \nour future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S14026-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14026-S14027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ELLIS ISLAND MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT MONTE AHUJA\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \npay tribute to Mr. Monte Ahuja of Hunting Valley, OH as an Ellis Island \nMedal of Honor recipient.\n  The prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor award is presented \nannually to ``remarkable Americans who exemplify outstanding qualities \nin both their personal and professional lives,'' and ``who have \ndistinguished themselves as citizens of the United States, while \ncontinuing to preserve the richness of their particular heritage.'' \nMonte Ahuja was selected to receive this honor in 2001.\n  Mr. Ahuja is a distinguished American who immigrated to the United \nStates from India in 1969. He received a bachelor of science degree in \nmechanical engineering in India and pursued his graduate education at \nOhio State University where he received his masters degree in \nmechanical engineering. He moved to Cleveland, OH in 1972 and received \nhis masters in business administration at Cleveland State University in \n1975 while working full time.\n\n[[Page S14027]]\n\n  While pursuing his MBA, Mr. Ahuja began to dream about creating a \nglobal parts distribution network solely dedicated to providing \ntransmission rebuilders the highest quality products and services. He \npursued his dream by undertaking considerable research and hard work \ndeveloping his idea, and he established Transtar Industries, Inc. in \n1975.\n  Over the past 28 years, Transtar Industries has grown from a two-\nperson, one-location operation to a company with over 25 locations \nnationwide and over 500 dedicated employees that services the \nautomotive transmission aftermarket in over 60 countries.\n  Transtar Industries, Inc. is headquartered in Cleveland, OH and \ndistributes the world's largest and most comprehensive line of \nautomotive transmission replacement parts and kits. The company's \nproducts are the result of proactive product research and development. \nTranstar also has outstanding business systems. Its sales forecasting \nsystem is state-of-the art and its level of customer service \nconsistently exceeds 95 percent. All of Transtar's distribution centers \nare electronically linked, which makes it possible for Transtar to ship \nvirtually every order the same day.\n  Mr. Ahuja has provided outstanding leadership at Transtar Industries \nand he has received numerous awards for his achievements, including the \nArthur Anderson 2000 Leadership Award, the Inside Business NEO Success \nAward and the Association of Corporate Growth Deal Makers Award.\n  As Governor of Ohio, I was proud to recognize Mr. Ahuja on two \noccasions as recipient of the ``E'' Award for Excellence in Export.\n  In 2002, Mr. Ahuja was chosen the World Trade Center Cleveland \nInternational Executive of the Year.\n  Monte Ahuja is also extremely involved in the community and he \ndemonstrates generously his philosophy of contributing to the community \nthat has given him so much.\n  He has a passion for education which is demonstrated by his years of \ncommitment to his alma mater where he began to envision and create his \ncompany. At Cleveland State University, he has served as director of \nthe Cleveland State University Foundation and he has established the \nAhuja Endowed Scholarship Fund in business administration and \nengineering.\n  He also established the Distinguished Scholar in Comparative Indian \nand Western Philosophy--which is so important today as we strive to \nappreciate the richness of this country's cultural diversity.\n  I was so impressed with Monte's devotion to education that when I was \ngovernor of Ohio I appointed him to Cleveland State's Board of Trustees \nin 1991. From 1992 to 1998, he served with distinction as chairman of \nthe Board of Trustees.\n  He also served as chairman of the Cleveland State University Task \nForce, part of a statewide project I initiated as governor of Ohio, the \n``Ohio Task Force for Managing Future Higher Education in the State of \nOhio'' to challenge the universities to conduct private sector \nmanagement audits to work harder and smarter and do more with less. \nUnder Monte Ahuja's leadership, Cleveland State University's audit was \none of the best in the State and saved the University $8.5 million a \nyear.\n  Monte Ahuja's commitment to education is relentless and he has \ndedicated himself to the advancement of quality education at Cleveland \nState and in Ohio.\n  He is the embodiment of the achievements that a quality education can \nhelp facilitate. In 1990, Mr. Ahuja was named one of Cleveland State \nUniversity's 25 most distinguished alumni.

A bill to authorize the States to implement such mechanisms \nas are necessary to endure the continuity of Congress in the event that \none-fourth of the members of either the House of Representatives or the \nSenate are killed or incapacitated; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about the \ncontinuity of Government. More than 2 years since the terrible events \nof September 11, Congress has not taken any steps necessary to protect \nthe Nation by ensuring continuity of Government operations should there \nbe another attack and the tragic loss of life or disability on the part \nof Members of the United States Congress. The Founders of this country \nrightly required a majority of each House to constitute a quorum to do \nbusiness, to ensure a nationally representative Congress. But the \nConstitution does not provide, I should say, adequate mechanisms to \nassure a continuing, functioning Congress if a majority of the Members \nare incapacitated or killed by a terrorist attack.\n  Our current system of providing for the continuity of Government in \nthe event of a disaster is simply inadequate to meet the realities of a \npost-9/11 world. As unthinkable as another attack of that magnitude \nmight be, we must be ready for the worst.\n  In fact, we have a duty as the elected Representatives of our \nrespective States to do everything within our power to provide for a \nstable continuance and function of Government, despite all possible \ncatastrophes. We must not leave our Nation's citizens without \nrepresentation, without order, and without defense. We simply owe it to \nthe American people to ensure that our Government will remain strong \nand stable, even in the face of disaster.\n  It is my conviction that this issue deserves more than just token \nattention. It is not something we can or should put off until another \nday. It is urgent and it is a critical element of our ongoing fight \nagainst terror.\n  Today, I have offered a proposal to provide for the continuity of \ncongressional operations. In coming weeks, I will submit legislation to \naddress the problems of our current system of Presidential succession \nas well.\n  Earlier this year, the bipartisan Continuity of Government \nCommission,\n\n[[Page S14033]]\n\nwhich was a joint project of the American Enterprise Institute and the \nBrookings Institution, issued a report which unanimously recommended a \nconstitutional amendment:\n\n       To allow immediate, temporary appointments to Congress \n     until special elections could be held to fill vacancies or \n     until matters of incapacitation can be resolved.\n\n  Many Members of Congress strongly agree with the recommendation of \nthat commission. Some, however, are reluctant to allow for the \nappointment rather than the election of Representatives, no matter how \ndire the emergency. To protect the American people and ensure a \nfunctioning Congress, we must find a way to bridge the gap on a \ntemporary basis. I submit that this must be an emergency measure which \nwould allow for the ongoing operation of Government in a catastrophe \nbut which would then allow for election in the ordinary course of \nevents, after events had been stabilized.\n  I have proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress \nto enact laws providing for congressional succession modeled after the \nprovision of article II, authorizing Congress to enact laws providing \nfor Presidential succession.\n  I also propose implementing legislation to authorize each State to \ncraft their own mechanisms for filling vacancies in their congressional \ndelegations, which is modeled after the 17th amendment. In other words, \nmy proposal specifically refrains from choosing sides in this debate, \nas far as whether the temporary emergency measure be by appointment or \nby election, leaving that decision up to the States, following the \nmodel of the 17th amendment, which of course provides for the election \nor selection of Senators in the event of vacancy. Forty-eight States \nprovide for temporary appointment by the Governor, but two States \nprovide for special elections. This proposal would give each State the \noption to choose which procedures they deem most advisable. The \nproposed constitutional amendment would simply defer the question to \nCongress, and the implementing legislation would defer the question to \nthe States.\n  In an age of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, I believe it \nis high time to address this need that is all that much more apparent \npost-9/11 to ensure the continuity of this body and of the entire \nCongress. In my capacity as chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee \nof the Senate, the Committee of the Judiciary, I plan to convene \nhearings next year so we can debate this proposal as soon as possible.\n  I was not in Washington when the attacks came on September 11. Like \nso many other Americans, I was at home in Texas, getting ready to go to \nwork when I heard the terrible news, and then was rivetted to the \nevents unfolding on television. But I know for many of my friends and \ncolleagues who were here on that horrific day, they and we all feel a \ntremendous debt of gratitude to the heroes of flight 93. The brave \npassengers on that airplane did more than just save the lives of their \nfellow citizens. Absent their courageous sacrifice, flight 93 could \nhave reached its final destination, perhaps this very building, in an \nattack that could have eliminated an entire branch of government.\n\n  That hallowed ground in Pennsylvania, where flight 93 met its \nultimate rest, marks a promise left behind by those courageous heroes, \na promise carried on to their children, to their loved ones, and, \nindeed, to this very Nation.\n  It is a promise that says that freedom will not end here in the \nviolent acts of evil men. It persists, it endures, and it will not be \ndestroyed.\n  Even as we dedicate ourselves to the ongoing war on terror at home \nand abroad, even as we hope and pray that the tragedies of September 11 \nwill never be repeated, we must always remain conscious of our promise \nas Senators, to serve the people of our States and of our Nation, and \nto support and defend the Constitution of the United States. It is not \nevery day that you introduce legislation hoping and praying that it \nwill never be necessary, but this legislation is, in a very real sense, \nurgent and necessary.\n  We must prepare for all contingencies fulfilling our oaths of office \nto ensure that this promise--the promise of a free government, a \ngovernment of laws, not men--shall not perish from the Earth.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1821. A bill to establish a National Space Commission on \nactivities of the United States related to the future of space; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have 17 dead astronauts on our \nplate--3 from Apollo I, all preventable; 7 from the Challenger, all \npreventable; and 7 from the Columbia, all preventable.\n  What we are trying to do on behalf of myself and these several other \nSenators is get to a good healthy debate on the future of space in the \nUnited States and, more particularly, on correcting the safety \nfeatures. There is a culture there that prevents safety from being \nadhered to, and, more than anything else, NASA is broke.\n  What is not understood is that at the present time we are going in \nall directions. It is like the Navy during World War II: When in \ndanger, when in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout.\n  We here are saying we ought to take the orbital space station and \naccelerate it. Others on the other side say no, that is should be \nabolished. Some say we ought to go to Mars, and others say what we \nreally need is to hire more expert personnel and bring them in. No one \nis going to leave their job and come work for the NASA endeavor at this \nparticular time until we get a mixture and a program and a policy. That \nhas to come from the President of the United States.\n  I introduce the National Space Commission Act to address the range of \nissues that the Columbia Accident Investigation Board--CAIB--identified \nwith the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--NASA--and our \nspace program in general, following the tragic loss of the Columbia \nSpace Shuttle and its crew of seven astronauts. This bill authorizes \nthe creation of a National Space Commission appointed by the President, \nto ensure that the safety reforms and recommendations of the Columbia \ninvestigation board are fully implemented by NASA. The commission will \nreview and make recommendations regarding NASA's return-to-flight \nproposals and institutional changes that NASA will need to make to \nimprove safety in the agency and to improve safety of the space \nshuttle, and other actions to assure future safe transportation to \nspace and to the International Space Station. The commission will also \nlook at the broader question of how the United States is organized for \nthe safety of space flight across civilian, military and commercial \nsectors. It will begin to build a consensus on a future vision of space \nexploration that I hope will rekindle enthusiasm for our space program \nand generate the necessary support in the Congress and the \nadministration for these endeavors.\n  The Columbia Accident Investigation Board shone a laser-sharp \nspotlight upon NASA and its program of human space exploration. Their \npain-staking work to determine the cause of the loss of the Space \nShuttle Columbia provides the context and justification for a new \nnational agenda for space, a turning point in the history of space. \nThough the board stopped short of laying out this new future, its clear \nexpectation is that the President and Congress should take up where the \nboard left off.\n\n       The U.S. civilian space effort has moved forward for more \n     than 30 years without a guiding vision, and none seems \n     imminent . . . Recommending the content of this debate goes \n     well beyond the Board's mandate, but we believe that the \n     White House, Congress, and NASA should honor the memory of \n     Columbia's crew by reflecting on the nation's future in space \n     and the role of new space transportation capabilities in \n     enabling whatever space goals the nation chooses to pursue.\n     Columbia Accident Investigation Board Report, Volume I, \n     August 2003, p. 210\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the National Space Commission \nAct, is designed to respond to this challenge. It is a complex \nchallenge, and a complex undertaking, that now lies before the Congress \nand the Nation. My bill is not intended to supplant, nor substitute \nfor, the President's desire to set a new goal in place for the Human \nSpace Flight Program. But as we have seen in the board's report, merely \nsetting a far-reaching goal into place for\n\n[[Page S14034]]\n\nNASA and for the Nation is not enough. It will not resolve the many \ncomplex issues raised by Admiral Harold Gehman and the Columbia \nAccident Investigation Board. No, this report, and these challenges, \nrun deeper than a rousing call for future missions to Mars on the \nEarth's Moon can resolve. As Admiral Gehman said last week in testimony \nbefore the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee:\n\n       In the course of (our) study, we became convinced how \n     difficult it is to get into and out of low Earth orbit. It is \n     extraordinarily dangerous and very difficult to do . . . We \n     have to do it more safely than 49 out of 50 times, that's not \n     good enough . . . No matter what your vision is for human \n     space flight, whether it's Mars or the L2 or the Moon or \n     whatever it is, it starts in low Earth orbit . . . We need \n     some leadership to say, ``Just getting into and out of low \n     Earth orbit is a goal worthy of itself, without killing a lot \n     of people.'' And that's hard to argue, because it isn't very \n     jazzy.\n     Hearing on NASA's Future, October 29, 2003\n\n  Since the inception of the human space flight program, seventeen \nastronauts have lost their lives and all were avoidable. In its \ninvestigative work, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board reached \nseveral fundamental conclusions that went beyond the specific technical \nand physical causes of the loss of Columbia. The Columbia Board found \nbasic flaws in how NASA managers behaved, the belief system that lay \nbehind NASA attitudes and behavior, and NASA's understanding of basic \ntechnical and organizational requirements of safety.\n\n       The attitudes and decision-making of Shuttle Program \n     managers and engineers during the events leading up to this \n     accident were clearly overconfident and often bureaucratic in \n     nature.\n     Columbia Accident Investigation Board Report, Volume I, \n     August 2003, p. 177\n\n       NASA's bureaucratic culture kept important information from \n     reaching engineers and managers alike. The same NASA whose \n     engineers showed initiative and a solid working knowledge of \n     how to get things done fast had a managerial culture with an \n     allegiance to bureaucracy and cost-efficiency that squelched \n     the engineers' efforts. When it came to NASA managers' own \n     actions, however, a different set of rules prevailed. The \n     Board found that Mission Management Team decision-making \n     operated outside the rules even as it held its engineers to a \n     stifling protocol . . .\n       Each decision, taken by itself, seemed correct, routine, \n     and indeed, insignificant and unremarkable. Yet, in \n     retrospect, the cumulative effect was stunning.\n     Ibid, p. 202-203\n\n  Most troubling to the Board was the fact that these NASA tendencies \nwere not new but existed in full force at the time of both the \nChallenger and the Columbia Shuttle accidents.\n\n       The (Rogers) Commission found that NASA's safety system had \n     been silent . . . (denoted by) a lack of problem reporting \n     requirements, inadequate trend analysis, misrepresentation of \n     criticality, and lack of involvement in critical discussions \n     . . .\n       By the eve of the Columbia accident, institutional \n     practices that were in effect at the time of the Challenger \n     accident--such as inadequate concern over deviations from \n     expected performance, a silent safety program, and schedule \n     pressure--had returned to NASA.\n     Ibid, p. 100-101\n\n  This ``echo'' between the events eighteen years ago and the present \nmade the loss of Columbia and its explanation all the more confounding, \nbecause so many who reviewed the agency, its practices, and its culture \nhad sounded an alarm. The fact that these NASA behaviors and beliefs \nwere so enduring that they persisted beyond the stunning loss of the \nChallenger and her crew was all the more startling to the Columbia \nBoard. So startling, that the Board found it necessary to offer a blunt \nand chilling assessment.\n\n       If these persistent, systemic flaws are not resolved, the \n     scene is set for another accident.\n     Ibid, p. 195\n\n  The Columbia Accident Investigation Board also found that it was not \nonly NASA that was at fault for the loss of Columbia. Rather, the Board \nfound that the weaknesses at NASA were just as much a result of the \nNation's neglect of its human space flight program.\n\n       Post-Challenger policy decisions made by the White House, \n     Congress, and NASA leadership resulted in the agency \n     reproducing many of the failings identified by the Rogers \n     Commission. Policy constraints affected the Shuttle Program's \n     organization culture, its structure, and the structure of its \n     safety system.\n     Ibid, p. 197\n\n  The impact of this neglect extended beyond NASA's organizational \nresponses, encompassing broad aspects of planning for NASA's future \nmissions and the development of its technology.\n\n       There (has been a) lack, over the past three decades, of \n     any national mandate providing NASA a compelling mission \n     requiring human presence in space . . . (and a) lack of \n     sustained government commitment over the past decade to \n     improving U.S. access to space by developing a second-\n     generation space transportation system.\n     Ibid, p. 209\n\n       It is the view of the Board that previous attempts to \n     develop a replacement vehicle for the aging Shuttle represent \n     a failure of national leadership.\n     Ibid, p. 211\n\n  The bill I am introducing today establishes a permanent National \nSpace Commission to oversee the nation's current and future development \nand use of space. The commission is established with 12 members, \nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Commission \nmembers will be leaders chosen from industry, academia, and other \nprofessions who have a profound expertise in space flight and safety \nand have worn the mantle of responsibility and challenge in the \ndevelopment and use of space.\n\n  The Commission will be independent of NASA and is authorized to hire \na staff to develop the engineering and technical expertise to carry out \nits work. It will begin its work looking at some of our most vexing \ncurrent problems raised by the Columbia Board's report and provide the \nnecessary oversight to ensure that the Board's recommendations are \nimplemented in the following areas: (1) the return-to-flight of the \nSpace Shuttle and return to assembling the International Space Station, \n(2) replacement of the Space Shuttle, and (3) changes to the culture of \nNASA. We specify a number of detailed questions, criteria, and concerns \nthat the Commission should take up in laying out a near-term path \nforward for NASA's Human Space Flight program. In making its \nrecommendations, the Commission is directed to consider the safety and \ndignity of human life as its highest priority.\n  This specific aspect of the bill is a special clause in my mind, one \nthat is not subject redaction--the United States space flight program \nmust, above all, be an American approach to the future of space flight \nand, as such, must place the dignity and preservation of human life \nabove all other considerations. This assertion is not meant as an \naccusation or indictment of NASA--Admiral Gehman made it clear that the \nfault for the loss of Columbia rests with us all, impressed as we all \nwere with space flight and our accomplishments, and naive about its \nrisks and challenges.\n\n       If Shuttle operations came to be viewed as routine, it was, \n     at least in part, thanks to the skill and dedication of those \n     involved in the program. They have made it look easy, though \n     in fact it never was. The Board urges NASA leadership, the \n     architects of U.S. space policy, and the American people to \n     adopt a realistic understanding of the risks and rewards of \n     venturing into space.\n     Ibid, p.208\n\n  For never again should we have to read in a formal accident report of \nthe United States space program:\n\n       Managers failed to fulfill the implicit contract to do \n     whatever is possible to ensure the safety of the crew.\n     Ibid, p.170\n\n  Never again.\n  In each of these assessments of current issues in NASA's Human Space \nFlight Program, we intend the commission to provide the President, the \nCongress, and NASA its informed judgment and advice, so that we can \nexpeditiously return the program to a condition of stability and adopt \na NASA culture of safety as soon as possible.\n  The second aspect of the bill is to set a long-range view of our \nNation's participation in and development of space.\n  Concurrent with the work on current issues at NASA, but due by late \n2005, are two ground-breaking studies. These studies are intended to go \nbeyond defining a destination for humans in space and to address \nbroader questions about the goals and methods we use, with a specific \nconcern for public and private utilization and investment in space. \nThough we have learned that the economics of space flight should never \nagain take precedence over its safety, we also know that, in the past, \nits cost has driven us down pathways that have not resulted in success.\n\n       In all three (Shuttle replacement) projects--National \n     Aerospace Plane, X-33,\n\n[[Page S14035]]\n\n     and X-34--national leaders had set ambitious goals in \n     response to NASA's ambitious proposals. The programs relied \n     on the invention of revolutionary technology, had run into \n     major technical problems, and had been denied the funds \n     needed to overcome these problems--assuming they could be \n     solved. NASA had spent nearly 15 years and several billion \n     dollars, and yet had made no meaningful progress toward a \n     Space Shuttle replacement.\n     Ibid, p. 111\n\n       Continued U.S. leadership in space is an important national \n     objective. That leadership depends on a willingness to pay \n     the costs of achieving it.\n     Ibid, p. 211\n\n  First, the commission is chartered to provide a sweeping assessment \nof the future of space. Included in that assessment is a review of \nUnited States capabilities, goals, and uses for space, including the \nstate of our Nation's investment in launch capabilities, how space \ncould benefit State and local governments and regions, and the role of \nnon-governmental, private organizations in the promotion of our space \nendeavors. The review will also take up the difficult issues related to \npublic and private investment: the role of private institutions in the \ndevelopment and use of space and the business conditions they must \nmeet; how Federal Government programs in space science, exploration, \nnational security, and public safety support or limit the commercial \ndevelopment of space; and how space contributes to the terrestrial \neconomy of the United States.\n  Given the high cost of space, and the even higher costs of space that \nthe Nation is certain to experience in the near and long-term future, \nresolution of these questions of private versus public participation \nand promotion of the development of space is a necessary part of the \nexamination of possible technological and economic futures for the \nspace sector of the economy.\n  Second, and most importantly, the National Space Commission Act is \ndirected to perform a comprehensive assessment and inventorying of the \nNation's programs and practices related to the conduct and safety of \nspace flight. This study will assess the state of the Nation's \nacceptance, approval, and commercial licensing practices as they relate \nto the conduct of civil, commercial, and military space flight and \nexplore how space launch and high-risk space operations are conducted \nacross each of these sectors. This study is intended to result in a \nseries of recommendations about the future management of space launch \nand high-risk orbital and sub-orbital space operations in order to \nachieve the highest level of safety and management of these risks. To \nthose who question the importance of establishing an authority \nindependent of NASA to assess these provisions, the Columbia Accident \nInvestigation board stated the case most convincingly:\n\n       (NASA) cultural norms tend to be fairly resilient . . . The \n     norms bounce back into shape after being stretched or bent. \n     Beliefs held in common throughout the organization resist \n     alteration.\n     Ibid, p. 101\n\n       Within NASA, the cultural impediments to safe and effective \n     Shuttle operations are real and substantial . . . Leadership \n     will have to rid the system of practices and patterns that \n     have been validated simply because they have been around so \n     long . . . These recommendations will be difficult to \n     initiate, and they will encounter some degree of \n     institutional resistance.\n     Ibid. p. 209\n\n       NASA's blind spot is it believes it has a strong safety \n     culture . . . Twice in NASA history, the agency embarked on a \n     slippery slope that resulted in catastrophe . . . A safety \n     team must have equal and independent representation so that \n     managers are not again lulled into complacency by shifting \n     definitions of risk.\n     Ibid, p. 203\n\n       Since NASA is an independent agency answerable only to the \n     White House and Congress, the ultimate responsibility for \n     enforcement of the recommended corrective actions must reside \n     with those governmental authorities.\n     Ibid, p. 209\n\n  The National Space Commission is established on a permanent basis to \nmaintain oversight of the implementation of space flight across all \nsectors of industry and government and vigilance in the management of \nsafety in all United States high-risk space operations.\n  Let me reiterate. Merely announcing a bold new plan to travel to the \nEarth's Moon or to Mars is not sufficient. If the loss of the Space \nShuttle Columbia merely results in that proposal, we will have failed \nthe memory of our brave astronauts who lost their lives aboard both \nChallenger and Columbia. And we will have failed our own future. \nUnfortunately, our current charge is more difficult. We must challenge \nour assumptions, question our decisions and designs, revisit our \napproaches, and rethink our Nation's ambitions and goals for space. We \nmust submit ourselves to the discipline to begin anew. The future of \nspace and our Nation's reputation that we carry into history rests in \nthe balance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and an article from \nthe New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1821\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Space Commission \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since the enactment of the National Aeronautics and \n     Space Act of 1958, space has become increasingly important \n     for science, public safety, national defense and intelligence \n     gathering, commercial telecommunications and other Earth \n     applications, and the advancement of international relations \n     tied to the use of space for peaceful purposes.\n       (2) The recent loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia \n     highlighted the true condition of space flight: that it is \n     highly prone to risk, fundamentally challenges the laws of \n     nature, is extremely unforgiving of lapses in judgment, and \n     demands the utmost consideration of safety and the dignity of \n     human life.\n       (3) The Columbia Accident Investigation Board expressed \n     extreme misgivings about the management and technical culture \n     of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In \n     addition to prescribing a specific menu of recommendations, \n     the Board expressed concerns that the agency may not be able \n     to achieve its own reform, stating that, ``Based on NASA's \n     history of ignoring external recommendations, or making \n     improvements that atrophy with time, the Board has no \n     confidence that the Space Shuttle can be safely operated for \n     more than a few years based solely on renewed post-accident \n     vigilance''.\n       (4) Today, American astronauts and International Partner \n     cosmonauts reside in space with limited means of safe rescue \n     and support. The Nation remains dependent on the Space \n     Shuttle as the sole means of International Space Station \n     assembly and human operation in space for the foreseeable \n     future. And the Nation faces a period of greatly in creased \n     expense merely to sustain current space operations.\n       (5) Even if new vehicle technologies were available, it is \n     a matter of public discussion whether the historic ideals and \n     prospects for the human exploration and development of space \n     still guide our national program in space or whether the role \n     and purpose of human presence in space has become ambiguous \n     in light of other potential purposes for and uses of space.\n       (6) Meanwhile, our national program in space suffers from \n     an aging space workforce and aging, sometimes dilapidated \n     space facilities and systems, an atrophying of expertise, and \n     a general lack of renewal of purposes, objectives, and \n     methods. Commercial markets requiring space launch that are \n     crucial to establishing the firm economic basis for the \n     development of space and for the commercial development of \n     space technology have not emerged but have withered. Although \n     the use of space for science and national security purposes \n     is expanding, the economic and commercial development of \n     space continues to be fledgling. Although the Nation stands \n     on the doorstep of the permanent human habitation of space, a \n     mature agenda for safe, economic operation in space necessary \n     to broaden the Nation's participation and interest in the \n     peaceful development of space is lacking.\n       (7) The Nation would benefit by establishing a permanent \n     National Space Commission to advise the President and \n     Congress on issues related to the reflight and future use of \n     the Space Shuttle and on the possibilities for the future \n     development and use of space, and to recommend measures the \n     Nation should take to secure the safety of future space \n     flight.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Wald)\n\n       Washington, Nov. 4--After the shuttle Columbia \n     disintegrated on Feb. 1, many supporters of NASA expected a \n     renewed national debate on the goals of the space program. \n     But nine months later, supporters of space exploration and \n     the science program say that the subject appears to be in \n     danger of slipping below the national horizon.\n       ``There have been fits and starts of a national debate,'' \n     said Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, the \n     ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee, which has \n     jurisdiction over NASA.\n       Mr. Hollings plans to introduce a bill on Wednesday to \n     create a national space commission to oversee NASA's progress \n     in fixing the hardware and the ``broken safety culture'' \n     identified in the Columbia investigation, and to help set \n     goals.\n       Senator Hollings' bill, which has six sponsors, all \n     Democrats, joins a varied flock of measures on the House \n     side, none likely to see major action this year.\n       ``It's not commanding anywhere near the level of attention \n     that the Challenger did,'' said a House staff aide who was on \n     Capitol Hill at the time of that accident, in 1986.\n       The war in Iraq helps explain the difference, the aide \n     added, but beyond that, ``space is more humdrum now,'' even \n     when astronauts die.\n       Sean O'Keefe, the NASA administrator, said in testimony \n     last week that the Bush administration would produce a new \n     plan for space, including a replacement vehicle for the \n     shuttle, now more than 20 years old. He said Congress should \n     wait until that plan is released, but he refused to predict \n     how long that would take.\n       The leisurely pace contrasts with the push by the Columbia \n     Accident Investigation Board to complete its work over the \n     summer so members of Congress could digest the report during \n     their recess and be ready for a vigorous debate when they \n     returned.\n       The most prominent feature of the debate so far has been a \n     skirmish between NASA and the chairman of the House Science \n     Committee and the ranking Democrat on the panel. The two \n     lawmakers, Representatives Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of \n     New York, and Ralph M. Hall, Democrat of Texas, suggested \n     that NASA hold off on development of an orbital space plane, \n     a crew-transport vehicle that could replace the shuttle, \n     until an ``overall vision for the human spaceflight program'' \n     emerges.\n       Mr. Boehlert said at a hearing on Oct. 16 that NASA would \n     be successful ``only if it's pursuing a clear and broad \n     national consensus with sustained and adequate funding,'' and \n     he added, ``That hasn't been the case in three decades.''\n       Mr. O'Keefe, responding to the letter on the orbital space \n     plane, argued that the project was still at a conceptual \n     stage and should proceed.\n       Beyond establishing a commission to oversee NASA's \n     progress, the Senate bill to be introduced on Wednesday seeks \n     ``to address broader questions about the goals and methods we \n     use,'' with specific concern for public and private \n     investment in spaceflight and use of it. In remarks prepared \n     for delivery on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Mr. Hollings \n     argues that while economics of spaceflight should not take \n     precedence over safety, ``we also know that, in the past, its \n     cost has driven us down pathways that have not resulted in \n     success.''\n\n[[Page S14038]]\n\n       On the House side, Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of \n     Tennessee, introduced a bill that would have future accidents \n     investigated by a presidential commission independent of \n     NASA. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board began under a \n     charter written after the Challenger accident, with members \n     selected according to positions they held in the Air Force, \n     Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.\n       Mr. Gordon's bill was approved by a subcommittee but has \n     gone no further.\n       Mr. Hall, the ranking Democrat on the House Science \n     Committee, introduced a bill on Oct. 1, with 24 sponsors, \n     including 3 Republicans, that would have the National Academy \n     of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering assemble \n     an oversight committee, as was done after the Challenger \n     accident. NASA has generally opposed outside oversight.\n       Mr. Hall also introduced an amendment to an appropriations \n     bill that would mandate a $15 million study of shuttle crew \n     escape, to be performed by NASA. The House passed the bill, \n     and it is now in a conference committee.\n       Representative Nick Lampson, Democrat of Texas, has \n     introduced a measure that would require NASA to develop \n     reusable spaceships that could sit for long periods balanced \n     between the gravitational pull of Earth and the Sun or the \n     Moon; ships that could reach an asteroid; and, ultimately, \n     ones that could reach Mars. The bill has 24 sponsors but has \n     not yet been taken up in committee.\n       Mr. Lampson said in a telephone interview that he was glad \n     that Senator Hollings was focused on the problem, but he \n     added, ``we don't need a commission, we need a commitment for \n     NASA.''\n       ``If the goals get set, we will re-energize the academic \n     community, and the space industrial community,'' he said, \n     predicting that missions to Mars would ``do a great deal to \n     move this country forward.''\n       Mr. Hollings, in a separate interview, said, ``I want to go \n     to Mars, too, but unless you get the culture changed and \n     fixed, we're not going anywhere.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1822. A bill to require disclosure of financial relationships \nbetween brokers and mutual fund companies and of certain brokerage \ncommissions paid by mutual fund companies; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nintended to restore public trust in mutual funds, the Mutual Fund \nTransparency Act of 2003. I thank Senator Fitzgerald and Senator \nLieberman for cosponsoring my bill. I greatly appreciate the efforts of \nSenator Fitzgerald to address this issue. Our Financial Management, \nBudget, and International Security Subcommittee held a very thorough \nhearing on mutual fund trading abuses on Monday. I applaud the efforts \nof Representative Richard Baker for his leadership and his efforts to \nimprove mutual fund governance. I also commend the efforts of New York \nAttorney General Eliot Spitzer and the Secretary of Massachusetts \nWilliam Galvin for their efforts to pursue individuals that have harmed \nmutual fund investors.\n  Mr. President, 95 million people have placed a significant portion of \ntheir future financial security into mutual funds. Mutual funds provide \nmiddle-income Americans, blue and white collar workers and their \nfamilies, with an investment vehicle that offers diversification and \nprofessional money management. Mutual funds are what average investors \nrely on for retirement, savings for children's college education, or \nother financial goals and dreams.\n  My legislation will bring about structural reform of mutual fund \ngovernance and increase disclosures in order to provide useful and \nrelevant information to mutual fund investors. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a letter of support for my bill from the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, Fund Democracy, Consumer Action, U.S. Public Interest Research \nGroup, and Consumers Union be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Consumer Federation of America, Fund Democracy, Inc., \n           Consumer Action, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, \n           Consumers Union,\n                                                 October 31, 2003.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: We are writing to express our \n     enthusiastic support for your draft legislation to increase \n     the transparency of mutual disclosures and enhance the \n     independence of fund oversight. Over the last two decades, \n     mutual funds have become firmly established as average \n     Americans' investment vehicle of choice, and investors have \n     for the most part benefitted greatly from the ability mutual \n     funds have offered even those of modest means to diversify \n     their portfolios and obtain professional management. However, \n     fund rules in some areas have not kept pace with industry \n     practices, and the recent scandals embroiling the mutual fund \n     industry have raised serious questions about the quality of \n     corporate governance in this industry.\n       Given the importance of mutual funds in the financial \n     portfolios of average Americans and the heavy reliance of the \n     least sophisticated investors on these investment vehicles, \n     we applaud your efforts to address key weaknesses in the \n     regulatory structure for mutual funds. Your proposed reforms \n     to improve disclosures about fund costs and strengthen the \n     independence of mutual fund boards, if adopted, should help \n     the fund industry to regain the investor trust that has been \n     the key to its success over the years but has been so \n     severely undermined by recent revelations.\n     1. We support requiring disclosure of broker compensation for \n         mutual fund transactions\n       The legislation would require disclosure of the \n     compensation brokers receive for selling funds. While funds \n     are currently required to disclose the existence of such \n     payments in fund prospectuses, the actual amount of the \n     broker's compensation for a particular mutual \n     fund transaction does not currently have to be disclosed. \n     This from of compensation creates a conflict of interest \n     between the broker, who may be inclined to recommend the \n     fund that offers him or her the highest compensation, and \n     the investor, whose interest is in obtaining the highest \n     quality fund at the lowest cost. By requiring timely \n     disclosure to investors of the actual dollar amount of \n     these commissions, your bill should help to increase \n     investors' awareness of the existence and extent of this \n     conflict of interest and its potential to induce their \n     broker to place his or her interests ahead of theirs.\n       Ample evidence that brokers do not always put investors' \n     interests first can be found in the allegations of improper \n     sale of fund B shares at some fund companies. In addition, a \n     recent Consumer Federation of America-Fund Democracy study of \n     excess costs paid by investors in S 500 Index funds found \n     that many of the funds with unjustifiably high expense ratios \n     were funds that brokers sold on commission. Since costs \n     subtract directly from fund performance, investors in these \n     funds end up paying a premium for sub-par performance. Had \n     these investors been made aware of the often substantial \n     payments their brokers received on the sale, they might have \n     been encouraged to look more closely at whether the fund or \n     share type being sold was really the best for them.\n     2. We support requiring improved disclosure of portfolio \n         transaction costs\n       The legislation would also require mutual funds to \n     disclosure in the prospectus the brokerage commissions they \n     pay on portfolio transactions and to include this cost in the \n     fund expense ratio. Portfolio transaction costs vary greatly \n     among funds and can be the single largest fund expense, \n     exceeding all other fund expenses combined. These costs are \n     not, however, currently included in fee information provided \n     in the prospectus. The only public disclosure of portfolio \n     transaction costs is a statement of the dollar amount of the \n     fund's commissions in the Statement of Additional \n     Information, a document never reviewed by the vast majority \n     of mutual fund investors.\n       Fuller disclosure of portfolio transaction costs would help \n     investors to hold fund advisers accountable for their trading \n     practices. It also would provide a collateral benefit in \n     connection with funds' soft dollar practices. Commissions \n     paid by funds typically pay for both execution and research \n     services. Since soft dollars pay for research that fund \n     advisers would otherwise have to pay for themselves, this \n     creates a significant conflict of interest for fund advisers. \n     Requiring brokerage commission cost disclosure would subject \n     these fund expenditures, including expenditures on soft \n     dollar services, to market forces, and in the process provide \n     a practical solution to the problem of regulating soft dollar \n     practices.\n     3. We support reforms to enhance the independence of mutual \n         fund boards.\n       The legislation contains a number of provisions to \n     strengthen the independence of fund boards. It would require \n     that 75 percent of board members, including the board \n     chairman, be independent. It would substantially strengthen \n     the definition of independent director by excluding \n     individuals who had served as directors, officers, or \n     employees within the past 10 years of the fund's manager, \n     principal underwriter, or other significant service \n     provider. It would delegate selection of new independent \n     directors exclusively to existing independent directors. \n     And it would establish qualification standards for board \n     members that must be publicly disclosed.\n       The recent investigation into market timing and late \n     trading at certain mutual funds has raised serious questions \n     about the quality of oversight provided by fund boards. Of \n     particular concern are the allegations that some Putnam fund \n     managers and the CEO of the Strong fund family were timing \n     their own funds--essentially picking the pockets of their own \n     shareholders to the tune of several hundred thousand dollars \n     in each instance. This is an unconscionable violation\n\n[[Page S14039]]\n\n     of these fund managers' fiduciary duty to their shareholders. \n     It is also strong evidence of the need to end the domination \n     of fund boards by the fund manager. Increasing the \n     representation of independent members on boards, making sure \n     that independent members are truly independent, and ensuring \n     that the boards are led by independent members should go a \n     long way toward advancing that goal.\n     4. Other bill provisions would also benefit investors\n       The recent mutual fund scandals are not just a corporate \n     governance failure--though they certainly are that. They are \n     also a regulatory failure. The fact is that the SEC was \n     apparently aware of problems related to market timing for \n     years and had drifted along without doing anything about it. \n     Given the lack of clear direction from the SEC, it is hardly \n     surprising that fund boards failed to closely supervise the \n     trading practices at funds they oversaw. Your bill offers an \n     innovative approach to enhancing the quality of fund board \n     oversight. It would direct the SEC to study the benefits of \n     creating a Mutual Fund Oversight Board, generally modeled \n     after the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, with \n     authority to examine and bring enforcement actions against \n     mutual fund boards of directors. Under this approach, the SEC \n     would retain responsibility for direct oversight of \n     investment adviser, but that responsibility would be \n     supplemented by the new independent agency's supervision of \n     fund boards. We believe this approach is well worth studying.\n       We also support the bill's provisions requiring disclosure \n     of portfolio managers' compensation and ownership of fund \n     shares (something that might have discouraged market timing \n     by fund managers), as well as its proposed GAO study of \n     mutual fund advertising practices and SEC study of financial \n     literacy. Such a study should look at innovative disclosure \n     methods designed to reach unsophisticated investors--those \n     who fail to take costs into account, for example--with \n     information they understand and act on.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Recent events have provided a rude awakening to those who \n     have long trusted mutual funds as the one place where the \n     needs of average investors are generally well protected. Your \n     bill offers a reasonable approach--one that recognizes the \n     continued benefits of mutual fund investing for millions of \n     Americans but also recognizes that reforms are needed to \n     restore investor confidence in the integrity of this \n     industry.

I also ask unanimous consent that a letter of support for \nthe legislation from AARP be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2003.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: AARP supports your effort to improve \n     investor awareness of mutual fund costs, and to improve the \n     independent oversight and governance functions of fund boards \n     of directors. The legislation you have introduced, ``the \n     Mutual Fund Transparency Act of 2003,'' would put into effect \n     an overdue upgrade in investor protection for the ordinary \n     saver-investor. These reforms are already warranted by the \n     continuing evolution in market practices and the growth in \n     market choices. They are now more urgently required.\n       Mounting allegations of illegal--at best unethical--\n     practices by mutual fund management companies, executives and \n     brokers highlight the need for prompt action. We are \n     concerned that lay investor confidence in the mutual fund \n     industry not be allowed to deteriorate further--specifically \n     in its ability to reliably provide fairly priced benefits of \n     investment diversification and expert management.\n       With regard to initiatives designed to increase fund \n     transparency, we strongly support the bill's provisions to \n     require that: fees be disclosed in dollar amounts; fee \n     disclosures incorporate all fees, including portfolio \n     transaction costs; fee disclosures identify all distribution \n     expenses; and compensation paid to portfolio managers and \n     retail brokers be fully disclosed.\n       While greater transparency is essential to fair competition \n     among funds for investors, we believe it does not provide a \n     sufficient check on the cost of fund governance. Mutual funds \n     allow investors to share the costs of professional money \n     managers--who under the 1940 Investment Company Act are \n     called ``advisers.'' However, most funds are not established \n     by investors but rather are incorporated by advisory firms, \n     who then contractually provide research, trading, money \n     management and customer support services, and also have some \n     representation on the fund's board. The advisory firms have \n     their own corporate charters and are accountable to their own \n     boards of directors, posing--as we are seeing--a range of \n     potential conflicts of interest in the costs of services \n     provided to the fund.\n       We support the provisions in the proposal to strengthen the \n     role and independence of boards of directors, which should \n     reduce potential conflicts of interest. Specifically, we \n     support the requirement that: a super-majority (i.e., two-\n     thirds to three-fourths) of fund board members be \n     independent; the board chairman be selected from among the \n     independent members; and the independent directors be \n     responsible for establishing and disclosing the qualification \n     standards of independence, and for nominating and selecting \n     all subsequent independent board members.\n       We also see merit in the bill's requirements for three \n     separate studies of investor financial literacy, the value of \n     creating a mutual fund oversight board, and mutual fund \n     advertising.\n       The importance of the mutual fund market as a critical \n     component of the economic security of all Americans--\n     especially order persons--should not be underestimated. \n     Similar--although not identical--legislation (H.R. 2420) is \n     pending before the House financial Services Committee. We \n     look forward to working with you and with the other members \n     of the Senate to enact this measured and important piece of \n     investor protection legislation. Please feel free to contact \n     me, or have your staff call Roy Green of our Federal Affair \n     staff at (202) 434-3800, if you have any questions about our \n     views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Certner,\n                                        Director, Federal Affairs.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, recent revelations of widespread market-\ntiming and late-trading abuses demonstrate the failures of mutual fund \nboards of directors to fulfill their fiduciary obligations to \nshareholders. The activities of Canary Capital Partners and Putnam \nInvestments are two deeply troubling examples. However, it is likely \nthat the trading abuses are much more routine. At our hearing, Mr. \nStephen Cutler, Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and \nExchange Commission, SEC, testified that preliminary results of an SEC \nsurvey show that about ``50 percent of responding fund groups appear to \nhave one or more arrangements with certain shareholders that allow \nthese shareholders to engage in market timing.'' This statistic is just \none example of mutual funds having different sets of rules for large \nand small investors. These differing rules allow the larger investors \nto profit at the expense of average, ordinary investors who are working \ntoward their long-term financial goals.\n  The abuses that have been brought to our attention make it clear that \nthe boards of mutual fund companies are not providing sufficient \noversight. To be more effective, the boards must be strengthened and \nmore independent. Investment company boards should be required to have \nan independent chairman, and independent directors must have a dominant \npresence on the board. My bill strengthens the definition of who is \nconsidered to be an independent director. It also requires that mutual \nfund company boards have 75 percent of their members considered to be \nindependent. To be considered independent, shareholders would have to \napprove them. My legislation also prohibits the board from making \ndecisions that require a vote of a non-independent director. In \naddition, a committee of independent members would be responsible for \nnominating members and adopting qualification standards for board \nmembership. These steps are necessary to add much needed protections to \nstrengthen the ability of mutual fund boards to detect and prevent \nabuses of the trust of shareholders.\n  In addition, this bill requires the SEC to develop rules to disclose \nthe compensation of individuals employed by the investment advisor of \nthe company to manage the portfolio of the company and their ownership \ninterest in the company. Consumers deserve to know relevant information \nabout the portfolio manager's incentives and whether they are properly \naligned with those of their shareholders. Again, I am referring to \nordinary American families patiently working toward their long-term \nfinancial goals.\n\n[[Page S14040]]\n\n  The strengthening of boards to protect shareholders is only one \nimportant aspect of my bill. My bill will also increase the \ntransparency of often complex financial relationships between brokers \nand mutual funds in ways that are meaningful and easy to understand for \ninvestors.\n\n  Shelf-space payments and revenue-sharing agreements between mutual \nfund companies and brokers present conflicts of interest that must be \naddressed. Brokers also compile preferred lists which highlight certain \nfunds, which typically generate more investment than those left off the \nlist. It is not clear to investors that the mutual fund company also \nmay pay a percentage of sales and/or an annual fee on the fund assets \nheld by the broker to obtain a place on the preferred list or to have \ntheir shares sold by the broker.\n  Shelf-space and revenue sharing agreements present risk to investors. \nBrokers have conflicts of interest, some of which are unavoidable, but \nthese need to be disclosed to investors. Without such disclosure, \ninvestors cannot make informed financial decisions. Investors may \nbelieve that brokers are recommending funds based on the expectation \nfor solid returns or low volatility, but the broker's recommendation \nmay be influenced by hidden payments.\n  The SEC has exempted mutual funds from Rule 10b-10, which requires \nthat confirmation notices of securities transactions be sent to \ncustomers to indicate how the broker was compensated in the trade. \nMutual funds should be subject to this confirmation notice requirement. \nMy legislation will require brokers to disclose in writing, to those \nwho purchase mutual fund company shares, the amount of compensation the \nbroker will receive due to the transaction, instead of simply providing \na prospectus. The prospectus fails to include the detailed relevant \ninformation that investors need to make informed decisions. Mutual fund \ninvestors deserve to know how their broker is being paid.\n  My bill also will inject a measure of reality into the expenses of \nmutual funds. In order to increase the transparency of the actual costs \nof the fund, brokerage commissions must be counted as an expense in \nfilings with the SEC and included in the calculation of the expense \nratio, so that investors will have a more realistic view of the \nexpenses of their fund. Consumers often compare the expense ratios of \nfunds when making investment decisions. However, the expense ratios \nfail to take into account the costs of commissions in the purchase and \nsale of securities. Therefore, investors are not provided with an \naccurate idea of the expenses involved. Currently, brokerage \ncommissions have to be disclosed to the SEC, but not to individual \ninvestors. Brokerage commissions are only disclosed to the investor \nupon request. My bill puts teeth into brokerage commission disclosure \nprovisions and ensures that commissions will be included in a document \nthat investors actually have access to and utilize.\n  This bill also creates a powerful incentive to reduce the use of soft \ndollars. Soft dollars refer to the bundling of services or products \ninto commissions. Mutual fund companies often pay higher commissions in \norder to obtain other products and services, typically research on \nstocks. Soft dollars can be used to lower their expenses by having \nservices and products paid for by soft dollars. Purchases using soft \ndollars do not count as expenses and are not calculated into the \nexpense ratio. The SEC released a study in September 1998 concluding \nthat soft dollars were used to pay for research, salaries, office rent, \ntelephone services, legal expenses, and entertainment, among other \nexpenses.\n  At the hearing, Secretary Galvin called for a prohibition of soft \ndollars. This is a recommendation that needs to be examined. However, \nmy bill provides an immediate alternative, which is to provide an \nincentive for funds to limit their use of soft dollars by calculating \nthem as expenses. If commissions are disclosed in this manner, the use \nof soft dollars will be reflected in the higher commission fees and \noverall expenses. This will make it easier for investors to see the \ntrue cost of the fund and compare the expense ratios of funds.\n\n  Some may argue that this gives an incomplete picture and fails to \naccount for spreads, market impact, and opportunity costs. However, the \nSEC has the authority to address the issue further if it can determine \nan effective way to quantify these additional factors. This bill does \nnot impose an additional reporting requirement that would be burdensome \nto brokers. It merely uses what is already reported and presents this \ninformation in a manner meaningful to investors.\n  My legislation also directs the SEC to conduct a study to assess \nfinancial literacy among mutual fund investors. The SEC will identify \nthe most useful and relevant information that investors need prior to \npurchasing shares, methods to increase the transparency of expenses and \npotential conflicts of interest in mutual fund transactions, and a \nstrategy to increase the financial literacy of investors that results \nin positive change in investor behavior. None of our disclosure \nprovisions will truly work unless investors are effectively given the \ntools they need to make smart investment decisions.\n  Finally, my bill requires the General Accounting Office, GAO, to \nstudy the current marketing practices for the sale of shares of mutual \nfunds. GAO will provide recommendations to improve investor protections \nin mutual fund advertising to ensure that investors are able make \ninformed financial decisions when purchasing shares.\n  Public confidence in mutual funds will not recover if funds continue \nto employ different sets of rules for large and small investors, engage \nin ethical misconduct, and enrich themselves at the expense of \nshareholders. The transgressions brought to light underscore the \nabsence of effective oversight by the boards of mutual funds companies. \nThis legislation will strengthen board independence and enhance the \ntransparency of financial relationships. The American investing public \ndeserves nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nenacting meaningful reform of the troubled mutual fund industry. We \nmust act to restore trust in this critical investment vehicle that \npeople rely on for their financial future and goals. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the Mutual Fund Transparency Act of 2003 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1822\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues \nSenator Daniel Akaka and Senator Peter Fitzgerald and cosponsor \nlegislation that would begin the crucial process of reforming the \nmutual fund industry. In the wake of shocking revelations of abusive \ntrading and self-dealing in some of America's largest funds, it is \nimperative that we act quickly, and I commend my friend Senator Akaka \nfor his leadership. We must\n\n[[Page S14042]]\n\ndo two things in order to reassure the 95 million Americans who invest \nin mutual funds that they have not misplaced their trust. We must find \nout how this was allowed to happen, and we must put safeguards in place \nto prevent these widespread abuses from poisoning our markets again.\n  As the deceptions and conflicts of the Wall Street analysts were \nuncovered last year in the wake of the Enron scandal, the oft-heard \nadvice to the average investor was to invest in mutual funds. Investors \ntook this advice in droves. Half of all American households own shares \nin mutual funds, and of the $7 trillion invested in mutual funds, $2.1 \ntrillion of it is invested for retirement.\n  Perhaps these working families felt comfortable entrusting their \nprecious savings with mutual funds because these funds offer one of the \nmost highly regulated investments available. Mutual funds, their \ndirectors and their managers owe their investors a statutory fiduciary \nduty. Mutual funds are overseen by the SEC through a prescribed \nregistration and reporting process as well as a regular examination and \naudit process, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n  Unfortunately, the trust of these American families has been abused. \nAccording to a just-released survey conducted by the Securities and \nExchange Commission, half of the largest 88 mutual funds have permitted \na practice called ``market-timing,'' which allows some investors to \ntrade quickly in and out of the funds, even though many of those funds \nhad explicit policies against such trading because of its detrimental \nimpact on other investors in the fund. Many fund companies admitted \nproviding portfolio information, unavailable publicly, to certain large \ninvestors to help them make trading decisions. Also, a full one-quarter \nof the brokerage firms surveyed indicated that they had allowed certain \ncustomers to engage in late-trading, an illegal practice that allows \nfavored investors to execute trades based on that day's price, but \nafter the market close, when new information has come to light. Perhaps \nmost shocking, Stephen Cutler, Director of the SEC's Enforcement \nDivision, has said that there is evidence that officials at fund \ncompanies profited personally at the expense of their customers by \nmarket-timing their own funds.\n  The SEC didn't discover these abuses on its own initiative, however. \nIt acted only after the New York State Attorney General and the \nMassachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth took steps to investigate \nand stop this conduct. The SEC didn't discover the abuses through the \nextensive reporting process mutual funds go through; the SEC didn't \ndiscover the abuses through the broad and regular examinations the SEC \ndoes of these mutual funds; the SEC didn't even discover the abuses \nafter it received a tip from an insider, who went to the SEC with his \nattorney, evidence in hand.\n  Yesterday, I sent a ten-page letter to SEC Chairman William \nDonaldson, demanding to know how the SEC could have failed to uncover \nsuch a sweeping problem in the mutual fund industry. I asked how the \nSEC planned to change its practices in order to ensure that it is never \nagain caught so unaware. Congress gave the SEC the responsibility to \nmonitor the mutual fund industry, and we must ensure that the SEC does \nits job.\n  This is not the first time the SEC has been caught off guard with a \nscandal on Wall Street. In October 2002, the staff of the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, of which I was then the Chairman, \nreleased a report, Financial Oversight of Enron: The SEC and Private-\nSector Watchdogs, detailing the ignored red flags and the missed \nopportunities that kept the SEC from detecting the problems at Enron \nbefore that company collapsed, taking with it the jobs and retirement \nsavings of thousands of Americans. Again, despite being fully aware of \nthe troubling conflicts faced by Wall Street analysts, the SEC turned a \nblind eye to that problem until this Committee and others held hearings \non the issue and New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer exposed \nhow deeply deceptive many analyst recommendations truly were. I hope \nthis mutual fund scandal represents the last time the SEC is playing \nregulatory catch-up.\n  In addition to holding the SEC accountable, Congress must also act to \nprotect investors by fixing the holes in the statutory scheme for \nmutual funds. That's why I'm pleased to cosponsor the Mutual Fund \nTransparency Act of 2003, which enjoys widespread support from consumer \ngroups. It contains many of the policy changes I urged the SEC to \nconsider in my letter to Chairman Donaldson. It would strengthen the \nindependence of mutual fund boards of directors by tightening the \ndefinition of independence and by requiring that 75 percent of the \ndirectors be independent. The bill would also require that mutual fund \nboards have nominating committees comprised solely of independent \ndirectors, so that directors are not chosen by management.\n  In my letter to the SEC, I also criticized the opaque or, in some \ncases, lack of, disclosure to investors about mutual fund fees. The \nMutual Fund Transparency Act would significantly improve such \ndisclosure to investors, by including in the fees disclosed to \ninvestors the costs the fund incurs when it executes trades of its \nholdings. Currently, such costs are not included among these more \nvisible fees, which are disclosed in documents provided directly to \nmutual fund shareholders. Trading costs are currently only disclosed in \nfilings with the SEC, but if this bill became law, trading costs would \nbe included among the fees provided directly to investors. Such \ninformation is useful because it can give investors a sense of how \noften their funds are buying and selling assets and at what expense. \nThe bill would also require funds to tell shareholders how fund \nadvisers are compensated. Public companies are required to tell their \nshareholders how their managers are paid; mutual fund shareholders \nshould have the same information. Finally, the bill would require that \nbrokers offering mutual funds to investors inform those investors of \nany fees or incentives those brokers are receiving for making those \nsales in a sale confirmation.\n\n  The bill also mandates that the SEC study three initiatives to \nimprove mutual fund oversight and transparency. The first two ask the \nSEC and the Comptroller General, respectively, to look at financial \nliteracy among mutual fund investors and at mutual fund advertising, to \ndetermine how relevant information can be made clearer and more readily \nunderstandable to the average investor. In my letter to the SEC, I \nsuggested the agency consider using consumer research methods in order \nto achieve such a result. The third study required by the bill relates \nto the formation of a Mutual Fund Oversight Board to take over the \nfrontline efforts of mutual fund regulation from the SEC, while \nremaining under that agency's oversight. This may be a good approach, \nbut I have concerns about the costs of such a board being borne by \nmutual fund investors, which is one of the areas suggested for study. I \nhope other options would be explored.\n  The Mutual Fund Transparency Act is clearly an important first step \nin closing some of the gaps in the laws governing these important \ninvestment vehicles. But there is more work to do, and I look forward \nto working with Senator Akaka and the other cosponsors of this bill in \nmaking further necessary improvements. For example, we should consider \nstrengthening the fiduciary duties owed by mutual fund directors and \nmanagers to their shareholders. In addition, as I indicated in my \nletter to the SEC, guidelines must be developed to prevent mutual fund \ndirectors from serving on more boards of funds than they can \neffectively oversee; at some of the major funds, directors serve on a \nhundred or more boards. Compliance officers at the funds must be \nelevated to emphasize their role. I suggested in my letter to the SEC \nthat such a compliance officer should be active at each fund and should \nreport directly to an independent committee of the board.\n  Moreover, as I pointed out to the SEC in my letter to Chairman \nDonaldson, we must close the loophole that allowed so many brokers and \nmutual funds to circumvent the law on late trading. Imposing a hard \ndeadline of a time at which trades must be into the mutual fund may be \nthe solution to this problem. We also must provide even more, clearer \ninformation to investors about the fees they are actually paying to \nparticipate in mutual funds. In my letter the SEC, I asked\n\n[[Page S14043]]\n\nthe agency why investors should not receive on their monthly statements \ndetail about the fees they actually paid to the fund during that time \nperiod, similar to the finance charge information that credit card \nconsumers get. I also suggested that funds be required to provide \ncomparative fee information. This would help people make better \ninvestment decisions, and might also encourage more competition among \nfunds to reduce expenses.\n  Mutual funds hold the nest eggs, the retirement savings, and the \ncollege funds for many of America's working families. Through those \ninvestments in their own futures, those families are also feeding \ncapital into today's economy, fueling the engine that creates and \nmaintains American jobs. In a very real sense, these mutual fund \ninvestments are investments in the American dream. We must act now to \nprotect them, and to restore the integrity to the mutual fund industry.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Akaka for his leadership on this issue, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this important and timely \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1823. A bill to amend the Act of August 9, 1955, to authorize the \nAssiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation to lease \ntribally-owned land on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation for 1 or more \ninterstate gas pipelines; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Northern \nBorder Lease Extension legislation. Currently, and since 1981, Northern \nBorder Pipeline Company has leased tribally owned lands on the Fort \nPeck Indian Reservation for its gas pipeline, which carries gas from \nAlberta, Canada to consumers in the Midwest. This lease expires in \nMarch 2011.\n  Northern Border wishes to have the right to continue to lease tribal \nlands for up to fifty years beyond 2011 for its pipeline. They need to \nbe assured as soon as possible their lease can be extended. If not, \nthey must look for other options that would include constructing a new \npipeline to go around the Reservation by 2011.\n  If the lease is not extended, not only will Northern Border be forced \nto build a new pipeline, but also the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of \nthe Fort Peck Reservation will lose over $20 million in payments from \nNorthern Border. Additionally, if extended, the lease would provide \ntens of millions of dollars in additional payments, with the rental \npayments increasing at an annual rate of three percent per year every \nfive years. These terms came about after negotiations between Northern \nBorder and the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck \nReservation.\n  This legislation would allow the Tribes to enter into a lease with \nNorthern Border that would give Northern Border the right to continue \nto lease tribal lands for up to fifty years beyond 2011 for its \npipeline. This is one of those great instances when both sides of a \nsituation agree and are of one mind. This provision was included in a \nbill previously approved by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, but \nunfortunately for reasons not associated with this provision, is being \nheld up. Therefore, I wish to introduce this important piece of \nlegislation as a stand-alone bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1823\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LEASE OF TRIBALLY-OWNED LAND BY ASSINIBOINE AND \n                   SIOUX TRIBES OF THE FORT PECK RESERVATION.\n\n       The first section of the Act of August 9, 1955 (25 U.S.C. \n     415), is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g) Lease of Tribally-Owned Land by Assiniboine and Sioux \n     Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a) and any \n     regulations under part 162 of title 25, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (or any successor regulation), subject to \n     paragraph (2), the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort \n     Peck Reservation may lease to the Northern Border Pipeline \n     Company tribally-owned land on the Fort Peck Indian \n     Reservation for 1 or more interstate gas pipelines.\n       ``(2) Conditions.--A lease entered into under paragraph \n     (1)--\n       ``(A) shall commence during fiscal year 2011 for an initial \n     term of 25 years;\n       ``(B) may be renewed for an additional term of 25 years; \n     and\n       ``(C) shall specify in the terms of the lease an annual \n     rental rate--\n       ``(i) which rate shall be increased by 3 percent per year \n     on a cumulative basis for each 5-year period; and\n       ``(ii) the adjustment of which in accordance with clause \n     (i) shall be considered to satisfy any review requirement \n     under part 162 of title 25, Code of Federal Regulations (or \n     any successor regulation).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 1825. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide \npenalties for the sale and use of unauthorized mobile infrared \ntransmitters; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, to introduce the Safe \nIntersections Act of 2003. This bill would criminalize the unauthorized \nsale and possession of a mobile infrared transmitter, MIRT.\n  A MIRT is a remote control for changing traffic signals. These \ndevices have been used for years by ambulances, police cars, and fire \ntrucks, allowing them to reach emergencies faster. As an ambulance \napproaches an intersection where the light is red, the driver engages \nthe transmitter. That transmitter then sends a signal to a receiver on \nthe traffic light, which changes to green within a few seconds. This is \na very useful tool when properly used in emergency situations.\n  In a 2002 survey, the U.S. Department of Transportation found that in \nthe top 78 metropolitan areas, there are 24,683 traffic lights equipped \nwith the sensors. In my home State of Ohio, there is a joint pilot \nproject underway by the Washington Township Fire Department and the \nDublin Police Department to install these devices. Other areas in Ohio \nwhere they are in use include Mentor, Twinsburg, Willoughby, and \nWesterville. Across the country, law enforcement officers, fire \ndepartments, and paramedics utilize this technology to make communities \nsafer.\n  However, recently it has come to light that this technology may be \nsold to unauthorized individuals--individuals who want to use this \ntechnology to bypass red lights during their commute or during their \neveryday driving. MIRT was never intended for this use. MIRT \ntechnology--in the hands of unauthorized users--could result in traffic \nproblems, like gridlock, or even worse, accidents in which people are \ninjured or killed.\n  Let me quote from an ad that was recently posted on the Internet \nauction site, ``eBay'':\n\n       Tired of sitting at endless red lights? Frustrated by \n     lights that turn from green to red too quickly, trapping you \n     in traffic? The MIRT light changer used by police and other \n     emergency vehicles Change the Traffic Signal Red to Green \n     [for] only $499.00. Traffic Signal Changing Devices--It's \n     every motorist's fantasy to be able to make a red traffic \n     light turn green without so much as easing off the \n     accelerator. The very technology that has for years allowed \n     fire trucks, ambulances and police cars to emergencies \n     faster--a remote control that changes traffic signals--is now \n     much cheaper and potentially accessible.\n\n  This ad demonstrates the extent to which the potential widespread \nsale and possession of MIRT technology by drivers would be a hazard to \npublic safety and must be stopped before it starts. That is why I am \nintroducing the Safe Intersections Act of 2003. I encourage my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the legislation I have just introduced \nbe printed in the appropriate place in the Record immediately following \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 1826. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain land in Washoe County, Nevada, to the Board of Regents of the \nUniversity and Community College System of Nevada; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, sometime, when the opportunity arises, I am \ngoing to introduce, for myself and Senator Ensign, the Dandini Research \nPark Transfer Act, which will transfer an important tract of land in \nWashoe County, Nevada, to the University and Community College System \nof Nevada.\n  The University of Nevada holds two patents from the Bureau of Land \nManagement for approximately 467 acres of\n\n[[Page S14044]]\n\npublic land located north of downtown Reno. In the early 1970s, the \nland was patented to the university pursuant to the Recreation and \nPublic Purposes Act. Now known as the Dandini Research Park, it is the \nhome of Truckee Meadows Community College and the Desert Research \nInstitute's Northern Nevada Science Center.\n  Truckee Meadows Community College and its predecessor, Western Nevada \nCommunity College, have provided educational programs and opportunities \nto the residents of Reno, Sparks, and the surrounding communities for \nover 30 years. Construction of the College's facilities on the Dandini \ncampus began in 1975, shortly after conveyance of the original patents.\n  For over 25 years the Desert Research Institute has excelled in \napplied scientific research and the application of technologies to \nimprove people's lives in Nevada and throughout the world. Its three \ncore divisions of Atmospheric, Hydrologic, and Earth and Ecosystem \nSciences cooperate with two interdisciplinary centers to provide \ninnovative solutions to pressing environmental problems. The Center for \nArid Lands Environmental Management and the Center for Watersheds and \nEnvironmental Sustainability apply scientific understanding to the \neffective management of natural resources while addressing our needs \nfor economic diversification and science-based educational \nopportunities. In doing so, DRI undertakes fundamental scientific \nresearch in Nevada and around the globe. For example, as a key \nparticipant in the U.S. Geological Survey Water Research Program, DRI \nplays a critical role in identifying and helping protect the region's \nscarce water resources.\n  DRI shares its facility with the Western Regional Climate Center, one \nof six regional climate centers operating under the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration's climate program. The Western Regional \nClimate Center conducts applied research and provides high quality \nclimate data and information pertaining to the western United States.\n  The Desert Research Institute wishes to expand its Northern Nevada \nScience Center. DRI is considering an innovative means of financing the \nexpansion, which would involve a private developer who would build and \nfinance the expansion and lease it back to DRI. The private developers \nwith whom DRI has discussed the proposal, as well as the Institute's \ncounsel, however, have pointed out that the terms of the patents and \nthe restrictions imposed by the Recreation and Public Purposes Act \nrepresent obstacles to such an arrangement.\n  Truckee Meadows Community College and the Northern Nevada Science \nCenter are exceptional assets to the scientific and educational \ncommunity in the Truckee Meadows. The Center serves not only the \ncitizens of Washoe County, but the needs of all Nevadans and the \nwestern United States as well. It deserves the opportunity to grow and \nprosper with the community--one of the fastest-growing communities in \nthe Nation.\n  The bill Senator Ensign and I will introduce simply directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to convey this property from the Bureau of \nLand Management to the University and Community College System of \nNevada. Because of the overwhelming public benefit provided by the \nCenter, we ask that the land be conveyed for free, but that the \nUniversity cover the costs of the transaction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1826\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Dandini Research Park \n     Conveyance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Board of regents.--The term ``Board of Regents'' means \n     the Board of Regents of the University and Community College \n     System of Nevada.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE TO THE UNIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE \n                   SYSTEM OF NEVADA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall convey to the Board of \n     Regents, without consideration, all right, title, and \n     interest of the United States in and to the approximately 467 \n     acres of land located in Washoe County, Nevada, patented to \n     the University of Nevada under the Act of June 14, 1926 \n     (commonly known as the ``Recreation and Public Purposes \n     Act'') (43 U.S.C. 869 et seq.), and described in paragraph \n     (2).\n       (2) Description of land.--The land referred to in paragraph \n     (1) is--\n       (A) the parcel of land consisting of approximately 309.11 \n     acres and more particularly described as T. 20 N., R. 19 E., \n     Sec. 25, lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 11, SE \\1/4\\ NW \\1/4\\, NE \n     \\1/4\\ SW \\1/4\\, Mount Diablo Meridian, Nevada; and\n       (B) the parcel of land consisting of approximately 158.22 \n     acres and more particularly described as T. 20 N., R. 19 E., \n     Sec. 25, lots 6 and 7, SW \\1/4\\ NE \\1/4\\, NW \\1/4\\ SE \\1/4\\, \n     Mount Diablo Meridian, Nevada.\n       (b) Costs.--The Board of Regents shall pay to the United \n     States an amount equal to the costs of the Secretary \n     associated with the conveyance under subsection (a)(1).\n       (c) Conditions.--If the Board of Regents sells any portion \n     of the land conveyed to the Board of Regents under subsection \n     (a)(1)--\n       (1) the amount of consideration for the sale shall reflect \n     fair market value, as determined by an appraisal; and\n       (2) the Board of Regents shall pay to the Secretary an \n     amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale, for use by the \n     Director of the Bureau of Land Management in the State of \n     Nevada, without further appropriation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Craig, Mr. Nickles, \n        Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 1828. A bill to eliminate the substantial backlog of DNA samples \ncollected from crime scenes and convicted offenders, to improve and \nexpand the DNA testing capacity of Federal, State, and local crime \nlaboratories, to increase research and development of new DNA testing \ntechnologies, to develop new training programs regarding the collection \nand use of DNA evidence, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Advancing \nJustice Through DNA Technology Act of 2003.'' This bill consists of the \nPresident's DNA initiative, which will expand and improve DNA databases \nused for criminal investigations and authorize additional funds to \nclear the backlog of untested DNA evidence in the nation's crime labs.\n  This bill offers several advantages over another version of the \nPresident's proposal that recently was introduced in the Senate. \nToday's bill gives States greater leeway in the use of DNA grants, \nremoves arbitrary and unnecessary restrictions on the testing of \ncriminal suspects' DNA samples, authorizes additional funds to clear \nthe backlog of non-DNA forensics evidence, and--most importantly avoids \ntying this critical program to unrelated and highly controversial anti-\ndeath penalty legislation. I include in the record at the end of this \nstatement a news story that describes the nature of the state counsel \nand other extraneous provisions that others have sought to attach to \nthe President's proposal.\n  The bill that I introduce today is an unencumbered--and unabridged--\nversion of the President's DNA initiative: the DNA Sexual Assault \nJustice Act and the Rape Kits and DNA Evidence Backlog Elimination Act, \nwhich authorize the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program and provide \n$755 million over five years to address the DNA backlog crisis in the \nnation's crime labs.\n  Today's bill includes the following improvements over other \ncongressional versions of the President's proposal: First, this bill \nalso expands funding for non-DNA forensics funding. Section 211 of the \nbill authorizes $100 million in new grant programs to eliminate ``the \nbacklog in the analysis of any area of forensic science evidence, \nincluding firearms examination, latent prints, toxicology, controlled \nsubstances, forensic pathology, questionable documents, and trace \nevidence.''\n  Second, this bill increases the authorization for the Paul Coverdell \ngrant program, in recognition of the fact that this program never has \nbeen funded at more than a small fraction of its authorization. Other \ncongressional versions of the President's DNA initiative only authorize \ndecreasing Coverdell funding in the coming years. This bill resets the \nclock on the Coverdell program, authorizing 2004 funding at the level \nfor 2001, and subsequent years accordingly. This will allow sharp \nincreases in Coverdell funding in the coming years.\n\n[[Page S14045]]\n\n  Third, today's bill allows states to test DNA samples from convicts \nseeking exoneration against the national DNA database, in order to \ndetermine if the convict has committed other rapes or murders. The \nother congressional versions of the President's DNA initiative would \nbar such testing; they effectively would give convicts a free roll of \nthe dice to challenge their current convictions while protecting them \nagainst the risk that they will be linked to other crimes. There is no \nreason why states should be prevented from solving such other crimes. \nIf DNA evidence is good enough to test a prisoner's conviction for the \ncrimes that we do know that he committed, it also is good enough to \nestablish the prisoner's involvement in crimes that we do not yet know \nthat he committed.\n  Fourth, this bill includes all Federal felony arrestees in the \nfederal DNA database. Other versions of this bill exclude arrestees and \nplace other unnecessary and arbitrary limits on the federal DNA index. \nThe federal government already maintains fingerprints for all federal \nfelony arrestees--there is no reason to treat DNA evidence differently. \nNor is there any reason to prevent states and the federal government \nfrom solving other crimes committed by suspects arrested for a federal \nfelony offense.\n  The Department of Justice has expressly informed Congress of the \nbenefits of casting a wide net when including criminal suspects in the \nfederal DNA database. During a July 17 hearing on the President's DNA \ninitiative before the Crime Subcommittee of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, Sarah Hart, the Director of the National Institute of \nJustice, testified that:\n\n       The efficacy of the DNA identification system depends \n     entirely on the profiles entered into it. Experience \n     demonstrates that broad collection and indexing of DNA \n     samples is critical to the effective use of the DNA \n     technology to solve rapes, murders, and other serious crimes.\n       The DNA sample that enables law enforcement to identify the \n     perpetrator of a rape, for example, often was not collected \n     in connection with an earlier rape. Rather, in a large \n     proportion of such cases, the sample was taken as a result of \n     the perpetrator's prior conviction for a non-violent crime \n     (such as a burglary, theft, or drug offense).\n       For example, in Virginia, which has authorized the \n     collection of DNA samples from all felons since 1991, a \n     review of cases in which offenders were linked to sex crimes \n     through DNA matching found that almost 40% of the offenders \n     had no prior convictions for sexual or violent offenses. Most \n     serious offenders do not confine themselves to violent \n     crimes. The experience of States with broad DNA collection \n     regimes demonstrates that DNA databases that include all \n     felons dramatically increase law enforcement's ability to \n     solve serious crimes.\n\n  Fifth, today's bill tolls the statute of limitations when a \nperpetrator has been identified through DNA--including in rape cases. \nOther congressional versions of the President's initiative inexplicably \nexclude sexual-assault crimes from the initiative's DNA tolling \nprovision. There is no reason to do so. Indeed, it is in sexual-assault \ncases that DNA evidence is most likely to identify a perpetrator. At \nthe July 17 hearing before the House Judiciary Committee's Crime \nSubcommittee, the Department of Justice testified in favor of tolling \nthe statute of limitations to the full extent permitted by the \nConstitution.\n  Sixth, this bill allows grants for DNA training and research to be \nmade to prosecutors' organizations, universities, and other private \nentities. Competing bill versions limit such grants to state and local \ngovernments, which is inconsistent with the President's DNA initiative.\n  Finally, the bill that I introduce today does not include the so-\ncalled ``Innocence Protection Act'' (IPA), a controversial anti-death \npenalty bill. The other congressional versions of the President's \ninitiative have incorporated the IPA as a third title to the \nPresident's bill. At the July 17 hearing on the President's initiative, \nthe Department of Justice made very clear that it ``do[es] not believe \nthat legislation embodying the important proposals in the President's \nDNA initiative should be joined to these controversial [IPA] measures, \nwhich intrinsically are unrelated to DNA.''\n  In an October 27 letter to several members of Congress, the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association also voiced strong objections to the \ncapital-counsel provisions included in the IPA titles of the other \nbills. The NDAA's letter stated:\n\n       Section 321 [of these bills] attempts to re-establish the \n     old 'death penalty resource centers.' As you no doubt recall, \n     Congress abolished funding for such centers because they \n     devolved into organizations dedicated solely to the abolition \n     of the death penalty and were staffed and controlled by those \n     dedicated to the disruption of the criminal justice system by \n     whatever means available, ethical or otherwise. Section 321 \n     would cause a return to such tactics by removing the ability \n     for the state judiciary to appoint counsel in death penalty \n     cases and giving that authority to a self-appointed group of \n     anti-death penalty attorneys.\n       . . . NDAA strongly urges deletion of Section 321 from this \n     bill . . . .\n       Elimination of Section 321 . . . keeps the appointment and \n     control of capital defense counsel in the hands of state \n     court judges who are responsible for insuring that defendants \n     receive quality representation. With Section 321 there is no \n     oversight of those individuals selected to develop state \n     standards for capital defense counsel.\n\n  The IPA titles included in the other congressional versions of the \nPresident's DNA initiative would authorize $500 million in Federal \nfunding for State public defenders in State capital cases. There is no \nreason for Congress to finance the States' public-defender systems. The \nStates adequately fund these programs themselves--indeed, many have \nenacted reforms and substantially increased funding for public \ndefenders in recent years. When the IPA originally was introduced in \n2000, it was targeted at the State of Texas. In 2001, the Texas \nlegislature enacted reforms that completely overhauled the State's \npublic-defender system. Yet the IPA provisions of the other Senate bill \nwould declare Texas's reforms ``ineffective,'' and would force the \nState to again replace its indigent-defense system. Such a mandate \nmakes no sense.\n  Moreover, there is no reason why States cannot or should not fund \ntheir own indigent-defender systems. Basic principles of federalism \ndictate that each level of government should finance its own \noperations. Once States become accustomed to and budget for Federal \nfunds, they never are able to reject the money (or its conditions) in \nthe future. And Federal funding inevitably comes with increasing \nFederal strings. In the long run, the States risk losing control over \ntheir own public-defender programs. There is no reason to start down \nthis path.\n  The IPA proposals in the other congressional versions of the \nPresident's initiative begin by placing a number of conditions on the \nstates' receipt of federal funds. Among these conditions is that states \ntransfer control over capital defense to an ``entity'' composed of \npersons with ``demonstrated knowledge and expertise in capital \nrepresentation.'' (This means private defense lawyers; public \nprosecutors likely would be barred by their jobs from serving or would \nbe conflicted out.) This new ``entity'' would be charged with: (1) \nsetting standards for capital-defense counsel; (2) deciding which \nlawyers meet those standards; and (3) appointing lawyers from the \nroster of qualifying attorneys to represent defendants in particular \ncases.\n  Essentially, the bill's new ``entity'' would completely control \nstaffing of the defense in capital cases. From past experience with the \n``capital resource centers,'' which were defunded by Congress in 1996, \nwe know that hard-core death penalty opponents tend to gravitate toward \nthese jobs, and will engage in litigation abuse when not supervised. \nCongress should not require the states to repeat its own past mistakes. \nIt should not place anti-death penalty partisans in charge of public \nrepresentation of capital defendants.\n  The other congressional versions of the President's proposal also \ninclude these additional highly problematic provisions:\n  They allow free DNA testing under very low standards. The competing \nbills provide that DNA tests shall be available to any prisoners if a \nnegative test match would ``raise a reasonable probability that the \napplicant did not commit the offense.'' This standard is too low. Not \nall DNA evidence clearly came from the perpetrator of the crime or had \nanything to do with the crime--for example, a blood spot near the crime \nscene may or may not have come from the perpetrator. The ``reasonable \nprobability'' standard means a prisoner could secure a test even if, \ndespite a negative match, the other evidence would still show that the \nprisoner more likely than not committed the crime.\n\n[[Page S14046]]\n\nThe bill requires only a chance that the prisoner did not commit the \ncrime. Almost every prisoner with material to test will be able to meet \nthis standard. Reopening old cases forces victims and their families to \nrelive the ordeal of the crime. They should not be put through this \nunless a negative test result could at least show more likely than not \nthat the prisoner did not commit the crime.\n  During the July 17 hearing before the House Crime Subcommittee, NIJ \nDirector Sarah Hart expressly warned congress of the consequences of \napplying unduly low DNA testing standards. Director Hart testified:\n\n       [W]hile post-conviction DNA testing is necessary to correct \n     erroneous convictions imposed prior to the ready availability \n     of DNA technology, experience also points to the need to \n     ensure that postconviction DNA testing is appropriately \n     designed so as to benefit actually innocent persons, rather \n     than actually guilty criminals who wish to game the system or \n     retaliate against the victims of their crimes. Frequently, \n     the results of postconviction DNA testing sought by prisoners \n     confirm guilt, rather than establishing innocence. In such \n     cases, justice system resources are squandered and the system \n     has been misused to inflict further harm on the crime victim. \n     The recent experience of a local jurisdiction is instructive:\n       ``Twice last month, DNA tests at the police crime lab in \n     St. Louis confirmed the guilt of convicted rapists. Two other \n     tests, last year and in 2001, also showed the right men were \n     behind bars for brutal rapes committed a decade or more \n     earlier.\n       `` [The St. Louis circuit attorney's] staff spent scores of \n     hours and thousands of dollars on those tests. She personally \n     counseled shaking, sobbing victims who were distraught to \n     learn that their traumas were being aired again.\n       `` One victim, she said, became suicidal and then vanished; \n     her family has not heard from her for months. Another, a deaf \n     elderly woman, grew so despondent that her son has not been \n     able to tell her the results of the DNA tests. Every time he \n     raises the issue, she squeezes her eyes shut so that she will \n     not be able to read his lips.\n       `` `She finally seemed to have some peace about the rape, \n     and now she's gone back to being angry,' the woman's son \n     said.\n       `` DNA tests confirmed that she was raped by Kenneth \n     Charron in 1985, when she was 59. To get that confirmation, \n     however, investigators had to collect a swab of saliva from \n     her so that they could analyze her DNA. They also had to \n     inquire about her sexual past, so they could be sure the \n     semen found in her home was not that of a consensual partner.\n       `` The questioning sent the woman into such depression that \n     she's now on medication. `None of this needed to happen,' her \n     son said. ''\n\n  Post-conviction DNA testing is not without its costs. It should be \nallowed only in carefully measured circumstances.\n  Another problematic provision in the other congressional versions of \nthe President's DNA initiative would employ an unduly low standard to \nauthorize new trials for very old cases. This provision of these bills \nis designed to allow new trials for prisoners who may have been \nconvicted 20 or more years ago. But it is very often impossible to \nretry a case this old--key witnesses die or disappear or their memories \nsimply fade, and other evidence deteriorates or is lost. For many such \ncases, ordering a new trial effectively means that the prisoner walks \nfree.\n  Congress should make sure that there is compelling evidence of \ninnocence before ordering new trials in old cases. Unfortunately, these \nother bills would allow a new trial if test results simply ``establish \nby a preponderance of the evidence that a new trial would result in an \nacquittal.'' The key language here is ``result in acquittal.'' It means \na test result would not even have to indicate actual innocence; it need \nonly conflict with other evidence of guilt so as to undermine the \njury's ability to convict beyond a reasonable doubt. Prisoners could \nwin new trials--and go free--even if, despite the negative DNA match, \nother evidence still shows the prisoner very likely committed the \ncrime. Current law, Federal Rule 33, uses the liberal ``result in \nacquittal'' standard to allow new trials based on new evidence, but \nonly within three years of trial. It usually is not difficult to retry \na case within three years. But for older cases, Congress should insist \non a showing of actual innocence before ordering an often-impossible \nnew trial.\n  There are other problems with the IPA titles in the various \ncongressional versions of the President's DNA initiative. These titles \nwould vastly expand DNA testing by authorizing tests even for prisoners \nwho pleaded guilty. According to the Department of Justice, 90 percent \nof Federal prisoners pleaded guilty. Extending free tests to these \nprisoners literally expands the pool of potential test seekers by an \norder of magnitude. A guilty plea also means that there is no trial \nrecord, which makes it much more difficult to assess the potential \nrelevance of DNA-test evidence.\n  These other bills also impose broad and potentially costly new \nevidence-retention requirements on the States--requirements that appear \nto require States to preserve all potential DNA evidence in all cases, \nindefinitely. And these bills also would give the newly created \ncapital-counsel ``entities'' an unwarranted degree of control over \ndefense attorneys' budgets. States traditionally have charged courts \nand other responsible agencies with monitoring budgets for capital \nrepresentation. Prosecutors do not have unlimited budgets. There is no \nreason to allow the capital-counsel entity to draw a blank check on \nState treasuries.\n  There are other problems with the IPA titles of the competing bills. \nSuffice it to say that these titles are unrelated to the President's \nDNA initiative and both the Department of Justice and the NDAA oppose \nadding them to the President's bill. We should not weigh down the \nPresident's DNA initiative with the IPA. For this reason, my colleagues \nand I today introduce the President's proposal--important, consensus \nlegislation that should be enacted by Congress without delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, the \nfollowing letter, and the following article all be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1828\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Kyl: Recently, the Judiciary Committee approved \n     H.R. 3214, the ``Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act \n     of 2003.'' Although the goals of this bill are laudable, one \n     provision in particular is extremely ill-considered, and it \n     will actually operate to obstruct the system rather than \n     improve it. Section 321 should be deleted from the bill.\n       Section 321 authorizes grants ``for the purpose of \n     improving the quality of legal representation provided to \n     indigent defendants in State capital cases.'' That is \n     certainly a worthy purpose, but this bill will not achieve \n     it. Instead, it is a giant step backward in the direction of \n     the discredited ``resource centers'' which Congress defunded \n     years ago, after finding that they had become taxpayer-funded \n     nests of saboteurs.\n       A condition for the grant is that a state establish an \n     ``effective system'' for capital representation. However, \n     ``effective system'' is nonsensically defined as one that \n     removes the authority to appoint trial counsel from the trial \n     judge and gives it to a central authority composed of capital \n     defense lawyers.\n       We saw with the ``resource centers'' how these capital \n     representation organizations were invariably staffed by hard-\n     core, anti-death-penalty fanatics who saw it as their mission \n     to bring the system to a screeching halt. In an unusual \n     moment of candor, the head of one of the resource centers \n     wrote in a published article that it was the duty of the \n     lawyer to file motions just to ``make trouble,'' Lyon, \n     Defending the Capital Case: What Makes Death Different? 42 \n     Mercer L. Rev. 695, 700 (1991). Such conduct is, of course, \n     clearly unethical. In 1996, Congress finally woke up to what \n     was being done with taxpayer money and defunded the resource \n     centers.\n       Appointment authority is one of the few checks available \n     against unethical conduct by defense lawyers. The attorney \n     discipline system is toothless. The prosecution cannot appeal \n     on defense misconduct, the way the defense does on prosecutor \n     misconduct. The trial judge's refusal to appoint lawyers who \n     are notorious for obstructionism and other unethical behavior \n     is the most effective deterrent. To remove the appointment \n     authority to an entity full of people who actually encourage \n     such misconduct is a recipe for chaos.\n       Congress has not removed the appointment authority from \n     federal district judges, for good reason. A number of states \n     have recently implemented improvements to their capital \n     representation systems. These reforms have taken different \n     shapes in different states, as is appropriate for a federal \n     system. Instead of evaluating the different approaches to see \n     which one works best in the real world, section 321 would \n     declare most, if not all, of them ``ineffective,'' and deny \n     defense grants to states that have chosen a different and \n     possibly better path. Section 326 effectively makes a state \n     ineligible for the prosecution grants if it chooses not to \n     change its appointment system to qualify for the defense \n     grants.\n       Congress should not mandate a single solution without the \n     most careful consideration of the reforms the states have \n     already enacted. The problem of effective counsel is a \n     complex one. It requires more study and more debate before \n     Congress endorses a particular solution. Section 321 of H.R. \n     3214 is half-baked, and it should be deleted.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Kent S. Scheidegger,\n     Legal Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From National Review Online, Oct. 29, 2003]\n\n  Protection Racket--Congress Prepares To Fund the Anti-Death-Penalty \n                                 Lobby\n\n                          (By Ramesh Ponnuru)\n\n       Why is a Republican Congress considering a bill to fund \n     anti-death-penalty activists? A bill that could result in \n     murderers going free? A bill that was initially introduced to \n     hurt George W. Bush? Beats me. But that's exactly what \n     Congress is doing.\n       In early 2000, Democrats were portraying George W. Bush's \n     Texas as a third-world hellhole where the water was dirty, \n     the churches were filled with guns, and the streets ran red \n     with blood of unlucky defendants. A few anecdotes in which \n     public defenders really had been lax in capital murder cases \n     were extrapolated into a critique of law enforcement in the \n     state. At around this time, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont \n     and Representative William Delahunt of Massachusetts, both \n     Democrats, introduced the ``Innocence Protection Act.'' \n     Supposedly, the bill was going to keep innocents from getting \n     put on death row by, among other things, providing for better \n     legal defenses for accused capital murderers.\n       In a modified form, the bill has been made part of the \n     ``Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act of 2003.'' \n     Sponsors of the bill include Orrin Hatch and James \n     Sensenbrenner, the chairmen of the House and Senate judiciary \n     committees. The House Judiciary Committee voted for the bill \n     28-1. Conservative Jeff Flake was the only dissenter.\n       There are two major problems with the bill. First, its low \n     standard for requiring new trials makes it likely that \n     murderers will go free. The bill says that federal prisoners \n     have a right to a new trial if a DNA test ``establish[es] by \n     a preponderance of evidence that a new trial would result in \n     acquittal.'' This standard is very different from a \n     requirement that the DNA test establish that the prisoner \n     probably did not commit the crime. DNA at a murder scene can, \n     of course, come from a variety of sources. It may be that the \n     jury in the original trial, faced with a negative DNA result, \n     would have found the defendant guilty anyway based on other \n     evidence. But witnesses die and evidence deteriorates. Wait \n     long enough to get a DNA test, and a new trial may be \n     unlikely to yield a conviction even if the defendant actually \n     committed the crime. The ``result in acquittal'' standard is \n     used to allow new trials based on new evidence--but only \n     within three years of the original trial. This bill has no \n     such time limit. The result is not a reduced sentence, but \n     the defendant's walking.\n       The second problem is that the bill bribes states to give \n     up control of their public-defender systems. Essentially, the \n     bill would funnel taxpayer dollars to the ``capital resource \n     centers'' that Congress defunded in 1996, having found \n     that they frequently abused the appeals process. (See \n     pages 53-57 of this report for a long list of examples of \n     such abuses.) Abuses would be likely since state courts, \n     and other branches of state and local government, would no \n     longer have supervisory authority over publicly funded \n     defense counsel. Indeed, supporters of the Innocence \n     Protection Act have been positively enthusiastic about one \n     form of abuse. When Leahy ran the Judiciary Committee last \n     year, it issued a report that said that capital resource \n     centers ``may legitimately assert a large number of \n     claims'' based on a ``reversal of existing law.'' In other \n     words, it's legitimate for tax-funded public defenders to \n     file a ``large number of claims'' that are precluded by \n     current law.\n       Is federal intervention necessary? States have been busy \n     reforming their own capital-\n\n[[Page S14051]]\n\n     defense systems. But the same Leahy report mentioned earlier \n     identified five cases in which ineffective counsel had led \n     innocent people to be sentenced to death. But as the \n     dissenting Republican report pointed out, the five cases \n     Leahy discussed established no such thing. In one of the \n     cases, the defendent was never actually sentenced to death. \n     In three of the cases, it is not at all clear that the \n     defendant was innocent. (Prosecutors declined to retry them \n     because evidence had deteriorated. In one case, for example, \n     the building in which the murder took place had been \n     demolished.) The cases are marked more, in any case, by \n     prosecutorial misconduct than by sloppy defenses.\n       That's true, by the way, of cases in which actually \n     innocent people have been put on death row. It has generally \n     been because prosecutors relied too much on unreliable \n     evidence, such as the testimony of jailhouse informants, or \n     because police and prosecutors acted in grossly improper \n     ways. (Say hello to our friends in Cook County.) When \n     prosecutors suppress evidence, the most competent defense \n     attorneys will be at a disadvantage. The Innocence Protection \n     Act's capital-defense provisions will not ameliorate that \n     problem. But then, it's more about funneling tax money to \n     opponents of the death penalty than springing truly innocent \n     people from death row.\n       ``What's disgusting is we're actually wasting time fighting \n     this in a Republican Congress,'' says one Republican Senate \n     staffer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S.J.

Mr. BENNETT (for Ms. Collins) proposed an amendment to the \nbill S. 589, to strengthen and improve the management of national \nsecurity, encourage Government service in areas of critical national \nsecurity, and to assist government agencies in addressing deficiencies \nin personnel possessing specialized skills important to national \nsecurity and incorporating the goals and strategies for recruitment and \nretention for such skilled personnel into the strategic and performance \nmanagement systems of Federal agencies; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Federal \n     Workforce Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND EFFECT OF LAW.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The security of the United States requires the fullest \n     development of the intellectual resources and technical \n     skills of its young men and women.\n       (2) The security of the United States depends upon the \n     mastery of modern techniques developed from complex \n     scientific principles. It depends as well upon the discovery \n     and development of new principles, new techniques, and new \n     knowledge.\n       (3) The United States finds itself on the brink of an \n     unprecedented human capital crisis in Government. Due to \n     increasing competition from the private sector in recruiting \n     high-caliber individuals, Government departments and \n     agencies, particularly those involved in national security \n     affairs, are finding it hard to attract and retain talent.\n       (4) The United States must strengthen Federal civilian and \n     military personnel systems in order to improve recruitment, \n     retention, and effectiveness at all levels.\n       (5) The ability of the United States to exercise \n     international leadership is, and will increasingly continue \n     to be, based on the political and economic strength of the \n     United States, as well as on United States military strength \n     around the world.\n       (6) The Federal Government has an interest in ensuring that \n     the employees of its departments and agencies with national \n     security responsibilities are prepared to meet the challenges \n     of this changing international environment.\n       (7) In January 2001, the General Accounting Office reported \n     that, at the Department of Defense ``attrition among first-\n     time enlistees has reached an all-time high. The services \n     face shortages among junior officers, and problems in \n     retaining intelligence analysts, computer programmers, and \n     pilots.'' The General Accounting Office also warned of the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service's ``lack of staff to \n     perform intelligence functions and unclear guidance for \n     retrieving and analyzing information.''\n       (8) The United States Commission on National Security also \n     cautioned that ``the U.S. need for the highest quality human \n     capital in science, mathematics, and engineering is not being \n     met.'' The Commission wrote, ``we must ensure the highest \n     caliber human capital in public service. U.S. national \n     security depends on the quality of the people, both civilian \n     and military, serving within the ranks of government.''\n       (9) The events on and after September 11th have highlighted \n     the weaknesses in the Federal and State government's human \n     capital and its personnel management practices, especially as \n     it relates to our national security.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) provide attractive incentives to recruit capable \n     individuals for Government and military service; and\n       (2) provide the necessary resources, accountability, and \n     flexibility to meet the national security educational needs \n     of the United States, especially as such needs change over \n     time.\n       (c) Effect of Law.--Nothing in this Act, or an amendment \n     made by this Act, shall be construed to affect the collective \n     bargaining unit status or rights of any Federal employee.\n\nTITLE I--PILOT PROGRAM FOR STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES \n                     IN NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS\n\n     SEC. 101.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 240, S. 589.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 589) to strengthen and improve the management of \n     national security, encourage Government service in areas of \n     critical national security, and to assist Government agencies \n     in addressing deficiencies in personnel possessing \n     specialized skills important to national security and \n     incorporating the goals and strategies for recruitment and \n     retention for such skilled personnel into the strategic and \n     performance management systems of Federal agencies.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support passage of the Homeland Security \nFederal Workforce Act, S. 589, and urge favorable Senate action and \nswift House adoption, as well. Senators Akaka and Durbin deserve great \ncredit for developing this legislation last Congress with Senator \nThompson and pursuing it to passage this year.\n  I share their concern that we need to do more to recruit and retain \noutstanding personnel in our pursuit of national security. I believe \nthat includes our law enforcement personnel. For the last two \nCongresses I have sponsored the Federal Prosecutors' Retirement Benefit \nEquity Act, which is now S. 640. That bill, which is cosponsored by \nSenators Hatch, Mikulski and Durbin, would correct an inequity that \nexists under current law whereby Federal prosecutors receive \nsubstantially less favorable retirement benefits than nearly all others \ninvolved in the federal criminal justice system. We have proposed that \nAssistant United States Attorneys be included as law enforcement \nofficers under the Federal Employees' Retirement System and Civil \nService Retirement System. I urge the Republican chairs of the \nGovernment Affairs Committee and the Subcommittee on Oversight of \nGovernment Management, the Federal workforce, and the District of \nColumbia to make enactment of that measure a priority rather than allow \nit to continue to languish without action year after year.\n  Similarly, I am a cosponsor of the Law Enforcement Officers \nRetirement Equity Act, S. 819, which was introduced by Senator Mikulski \nand is cosponsored by Senators Sarbanes and Campbell. This measure \nwould include Customs agents, Treasury agents, and Homeland Security \nagents whose duties include the investigation or apprehension of \nsuspected or convicted individuals and who are authorized to carry a \nfirearm within the definition of ``law enforcement officer'' for \npurposes of retirement benefits equity. This measure, likewise, is one \nthat has been introduced and reintroduced but that has not received \nattention from the Government Affairs Committee or Subcommittee. In the \ninterest of fairness and in recognition of the sacrifices that our \nofficers make every day on our behalf, I urge attention to this \nmeasure.\n\n[[Page S14076]]\n\n  I also note that last Congress the Senate Judiciary Committee \nfavorably reported the Innocence Protection Act of 2002, which included \nprovisions on student loan forgiveness. The bill would have established \na program under which full-time prosecutors and public defenders could \napply for repayment assistance of the Federal Stafford loans and would \nhave extended the Perkins loan forgiveness program to include public \ndefenders. I commend Senator Durbin for his strong leadership in these \nmatters. Unfortunately, those improvements and encouragements to young \nlawyers were blocked and are not yet enacted. They need to be. We must \nensure that full-time public defenders have equivalent eligibility if \nthe public defense function is to fulfill its constitutionally required \nrole in our criminal justice system.\n  Specifically, with respect to the Homeland Security Federal Workforce \nAct that we consider today, I believe the program it establishes for \nstudent loan repayment can be an important incentive for our national \nsecurity programs and understand those to include our law enforcement \nagents and officers. I regret that the substitute amendment lowers the \nmaximum amount of loan repayment from $80,000 to $60,000 but believe it \nis an important start and should be used broadly as an incentive to \nboth recruit and retain our national security employees. According to \nDr. Paul Light of the Brookings Institution Center for Public Service, \nin 2002 the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense \ntogether awarded student loan repayment to only seven employees. To \nhave its intended effect to recruit and retain outstanding talent to \ngovernment service, especially national security positions that include \nlaw enforcement, we need to have a broad-based incentive through loan \nforgiveness. Student loans, include law school loans, that saddle \ntalented and public-spirited graduates are a key reason so many opt for \nhigher paying jobs in the private sector. An effective program of \nstudent loan forgiveness can help counterbalance that pressure.\n  I regret that the bill as written limits its application to executive \ndepartments like the Department of Justice and does not include Federal \ncourts, which oversee our federal public defenders. Our prosecutors and \nour public defenders need this assistance and incentive to join and \nremain as critical components of the criminal justice system. To skew \nprograms to help only one side of the criminal justice system is \nshortsighted and unfair. For more information on this important topic \nof loan forgiveness, I urge consideration of pages 37 through 40 of \nSenate report 107-315.\n  I am concerned that the Bush administration and its Office of \nPersonnel Management will adopt an unreasonably restrictive view of \nthose Federal employees who contribute to our national security. As I \nread the substitute amendment, the determination of national security \npositions is left to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General and the \nother agency heads. That decision no longer is intended to reside with \nthe Director of the Office of Personnel Management. That is an \nimprovement. I hope that it will lead to a more broadly-based \ndetermination of the employment positions eligible for the student loan \nrepayment program to include all who contribute to our national \nsecurity.\n  I also look forward to enactment of the fellowship program provided \nby the bill and the strengthening of our national security workforce. I \nhave been extremely disappointed by the efforts made at the Department \nof Justice to fulfil the mandates of the USA PATRIOT Act with respect \nto improving our workforce. As I detailed recently in connection with \nthe confirmation hearing for the nominee to be the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, the Attorney General has yet to give us a straight answer with \nrespect to hiring the necessary Arabic translators. That was a need I \nidentified within days of the September 11, 2001 attacks and insisted \nbe addressed in the PATRIOT Act. Over the last 2 years the Department \nhas been both evasive and inconsistent in its answers regarding \nimplementation of those provisions in that Act. Recently the FBI has, \nagain, put out the call for assistance and additional translators. \nWhile Senator Voinovich may be correct that these provisions in the \nbill may be necessary, it is my hope that they will encourage the \nadministration to do that which it could have done but has not under \nexisting authority.\n  The administration has a long way to go to provide for our national \nsecurity. I support this bill as another bipartisan effort by the \nSenate to help it along the way.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that the Collins substitute \namendment which is at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, \nbe read the third time and passed; the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; and any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on November 5, 2003, by the President \nof the United States: Convention on International Interests in Mobile \nEquipment and Protocol to Convention on International Interests in \nMobile Equipment (Treaty Document 108-10).\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, \nthe Convention on International Interest in Mobile Equipment and the \nProtocol on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment, concluded at Cape \nTown, South Africa, on November 16, 2001. The report of the Department \nof State and a chapter-by-chapter analysis are enclosed for the \ninformation of the Senate in connection with its consideration.\n  The essential features of the Convention and Aircraft Protocol are \nthe establishment of an international legal framework for the creation, \npriority, and enforcement of security and leasing interests in mobile \nequipment, specifically high-value aircraft equipment (airframes, \nengines, and helicopters), and the creation of a worldwide \nInternational Registry where interests covered by the Convention can be \nregistered. The Convention adopts ``asset-based financing'' rules, \nalready in place in the United States, enhancing the availability of \ncapital market financing for air carriers at lower cost. The \nConvention's and Protocol's finance provisions are consistent with the \nUniform Commercial Code with regard to secured financing in the United \nStates.\n  This new international system can significantly reduce the risk of \nfinancing, thereby increasing the availability and reducing the costs \nof aviation credit. As a result, air commerce and air transportation \ncan become safer and environmentally cleaner through the acquisition of \nmodern equipment facilitated by these instruments. The new \ninternational system should increase aerospace sales and employment, \nand thereby stimulate the U.S. economy.\n  Negotiation of the Convention and Protocol has involved close \ncoordination between the key Federal agencies concerned with air \ntransportation and export, including the Departments of State, \nCommerce, and Transportation, as well as the Eximbank, and U.S. \ninterests from manufacturing, finance, and export sectors.\n  Ratification is in the best interests of the United States. I \ntherefore urge the Senate to give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol, and that the Senate \npromptly give its advice and consent to ratification, subject to the \nseven declarations set out in the\n\n[[Page S14077]]\n\naccompanying report of the Department of State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S14077-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2003\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

I further ask consent that following the prayer \nand pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of \nproceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be \nreserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a \nperiod of morning business for 60 minutes, with the first 30 minutes \nunder the control of the minority leader or his designee, and the \nsecond 30 minutes under the control of Senator Hutchison or her \ndesignee; provided that following morning business, the Senate proceed \nto executive session and the consideration of Calendar No. 310, the \nnomination of William Pryor, to be U.S. circuit judge for the Eleventh \nCircuit, and that there then be 60 minutes equally divided for debate \non the nomination prior to the vote on the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me just say, very briefly, we have been told that next Wednesday \nthe majority leader is going to move to a period of time where the \nmajority will come and talk for some 30 hours about how the judges that \nhave been recommended by President Bush have been treated.\n  I would say, I cannot possibly imagine why in the world we would take \nthe time of this body at such an important time in the history of this \ncountry. On this side of the aisle, we have bent over backwards to \ncooperate on appropriations bills. We have cajoled, begged members on \nour side not to offer controversial amendments. On any one of these \nappropriations bills, there can be all kinds of things offered. Maybe \nthey would be deemed not appropriate procedurally, but certainly a \ndebate could be had and they would have to be disposed of by a vote. \nBut we wanted to work for what we thought was the betterment of this \nbody and this country.\n  We agreed, without any reservation or hesitation, to be in next \nMonday and Tuesday, Tuesday being a legal holiday. And when we are told \nthat the sacrifices made to move this matter along are going to, in \neffect, play second fiddle to two legislative days; that is, 30 hours \ntalking about judges, keep in mind we have done a pretty remarkably \ngood job on these judges.\n  We have approved 168 judges; we have turned down 4--168 to 4. We have \nthe lowest vacancy rate of the Federal judiciary in some 15 years.\n  So I say--and not in any way as criticism other than constructive \ncriticism--I cannot imagine how the majority would allow this to \nhappen. We are aware of this. And as my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Utah knows, we work very hard to try to make things as \nconvenient for Members as possible. But, keep in mind, recognizing how \nwe can work to make things easy on Members, we can also work to make \nthings hard on Members.\n  If this is going to be done, there has to be some reasonable response \nto it. You cannot be slapped around forever. We believe in turning our \ncheeks, and we have done it. Our cheeks have been turned and both sides \nslapped and we still move forward. But I think this is the ultimate. I \nthink we have taken about as much as we are going to take.\n\n  I say to everyone within the sound of my voice, this is not to \nthreaten, but just to make people understand that there is going to \nhave to be some appropriate action taken if this is going to happen. We \nhave been told it is going to happen by the highest authorities on the \nmajority side. We have asked that it not happen. We have been told it \nis going to happen. I think it is too bad for our Nation.\n  I have no objection to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/05/senate-section/article/S14077-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Bennett for his \nleadership today and the work he does. He is such an able part of this \nbody. I will just say to Senator Reid, the assistant Democratic leader, \nthat something has happened here in this body that has never happened \nbefore.\n  Even though there are a majority of Senators prepared to vote and \nconfirm a series of highly qualified nominees for the Federal bench, \nfor the first time in the history of this Nation, the Democratic \nleadership--Senator Daschle and his team--have deliberately and \nsystematically filibustered. That has never been done before on Federal \njudges. It should not be done. It is a complete change in the history \nof this body.\n  I believe that Senator Frist is correct that we need to talk about \nthese nominees, and we need to spend some time talking about them. We \nneed to state what their records are, what their accomplishments are, \nwhy they are fine and decent men and women, and why they ought to be \nconfirmed.\n  I hope the American people will listen because everywhere I go people \ntell me they are concerned about the courts. They believe judges are \nstepping outside of their bounds. They are legislating when they ought \nto be adjudicating. They are taking over schools, prisons, hospitals, \nand whatever else, and running them for years and years. And people \nquestion that.\n  President Bush has said: I am going to nominate judges who believe in \nthe rule of law and who believe in doing the right thing, who do not \nlegislate but adjudicate, who decide cases based on what the law says, \nnot what they think is good politics.\n  Now we have these filibusters for the first time in history. I cannot \nimagine why Senator Daschle and his team would object to utilizing the \nlegitimate, historic rules of this body, to talk all night, if need be, \nabout why filibustering is unfair. They are not going to be out here \nanyway doing business. We are not doing anything in the middle of the \nnight anyway.\n  To take a day of this session to talk it all the way through that day \nabout the incredible, historical change in procedure that has occurred \nhere is eminently justified. Why they would think they should, \ntherefore, be offended is really amazing to me. There is just no basis \nfor it. It is mock anger that they are going to now block legislation, \nwhich apparently was the intention all along.\n  We passed the CARE Act 90 to 5. We can't move the bill to conference \nbecause that bill is being filibustered under the leadership of Senator \nDaschle and the Democrats. We passed the Healthy Forests Act 80 to 14, \nan overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. That is being blocked, so it cannot \nbe sent to conference. This is obstructionism again and again. I \nbelieve it is not harmful for the American people to have a glimpse of \nwhat is going on in this body.\n  When we saw what went on in the Intelligence Committee with the \ndisclosure of this internal memorandum for the first time in history \nthat I know of--the Intelligence Committee, which has always been \norganized and always been led to be a nonpartisan--not bipartisan, a \nnonpartisan entity dealing\n\n[[Page S14078]]\n\nwith the most sensitive secrets this Nation deals with, wrestling with \nthe idea of whether or not we have enough intelligence, do we have \nenough interpreters, do we have enough agents, do we have enough high-\ntech equipment to defend our country and to give our men and women in \nuniform the best information they have; that is what this committee has \nbeen about. Now we know that the minority Democratic staff were \nplotting and making plans to drag out the committee hearings, then turn \non the chairman who has tried his best to be fair and open with them, \nand then attack him and attack the President next year during the \nelection year. This is what we are seeing here to an unprecedented \ndegree.\n  Let me talk now about Bill Pryor, the attorney general of the State \nof Alabama, who is nominated by the President for the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. He represents the highest and best and finest \nqualities in lawyering in America today. I know Bill Pryor. I hired him \nas an assistant attorney general. I put him in charge of the most \ncomplex and important cases in my office. He was a partner in two of \nBirmingham's finest law firms, two of Alabama's finest law firms. He \ngave that up for public service. No more idealistic public servant \nexists in America today, a man of unquestioned integrity, unquestioned \nability, a man who is willing to give up the high salaries he could \nmake in any law firm in America and give his service to the people of \nAmerica because that is the way he was raised.\n  His daddy was band director at the McGill-Toolen High School in \nMobile, AL, a Catholic school. He was raised to do right. He believes \nin doing right. His family believes in doing right. His mother has \ntaught in African-American schools voluntarily for most of her career \nas a schoolteacher. They have done the right things. They are the good \npeople, people who always wanted to make America better, to reach a \nhigher level of morality and decency and faithfulness. That is the way \nhe is.\n  Bill Pryor attended Tulane University. I know the Presiding Officer \nknows Tulane is an excellent school, in the league with the Ivy League \ninstitutions. They think so at least. It is certainly a superb \ninstitution. He graduated magna cum laude. He was editor in chief of \nthe Tulane Law Review. For those who understand law school, they know \nthat the editor of the law review is the most respected graduate of the \nlaw class. Somebody might have higher grades, although few had higher \ngrades than Bill Pryor. But if you are selected by your compatriots on \nthe law review to be editor in chief, that is an additional indication \nof respect that even high grades don't have.\n  That is what he came from. He then clerked for Judge John Minor \nWisdom on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the very type of position \nhe will be undertaking. He was a law clerk sitting at the right hand of \nJudge John Minor Wisdom on the old Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nJudge Wisdom is known as a champion of civil rights. He was one of the \ngiants on the Fifth Circuit who was faced with rendering the decrees \nthat dismantled segregation throughout the South. That is Bill Pryor's \nbackground.\n  His father was a John F. Kennedy Democrat, Catholic Democrat, who \nbelieved in that and voted for President Kennedy years ago. So this is \nhis background.\n  He was very successful in his clerkship with Judge Wisdom. Then he \nserved as an attorney with two law firms in Birmingham, first rate \nfirms. I called on him to join my office-the office of the State \nAttorney General--and he took over the most important cases in my \noffice. And, lo and behold, 2 years later I find myself in the Senate. \nThe Governor made a decision to appoint Bill Pryor as my successor. He \nwas one of the youngest, if not the youngest, attorneys general in \nAmerica at the time. He handled that office with courage, with \nbrilliance, with commitment to the rule of law, and with enthusiasm and \ncommitment to a degree matched by few.\n\n  In the course of it, he won tremendous respect throughout the State. \nHe had case after case that were exceedingly difficult, tough cases, \nmore than you would normally get, in which he was called on to make \nchoices, make legal decisions in litigation that placed him at odds \nwith his core supporters, friends of his, friends of mine.\n  For example, there was a redistricting in Alabama. In the State \nlegislature, the Republicans hold not many offices, well below half. \nBut five of the seven Congressmen are Republicans. The Governor is \nRepublican. Both Senators are Republican. But the way they organized \nthose districts--some would say gerrymandered the districts--it favored \nDemocrats being elected. Republicans filed a lawsuit to attack it. \nUnfortunately, the lawsuit was legally improper and not sound.\n  Bill Pryor is attorney general of the State of Alabama. He has to \nspeak for the State. This reapportionment plan, whether he liked it or \nnot--I assume he didn't like it; I haven't liked it--he was empowered \nand required under the duty of an attorney general to defend the acts \nof the Alabama Legislature, the reapportionment plan they had, and \ndefend it he did.\n  It made them mad. A lot of our Republican friends were mad at Bill \nPryor. They said he ought to work with them, he ought to help them. \nThis was several years ago. He said: My job is to defend the law. My \njob is to do what an attorney general should do. An attorney general \nshould defend the duly enacted laws of the State of Alabama, including \nthe laws they passed to redistrict the State, as long as they are \ndefensible.\n  He lost in the court of appeals. The Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals, which he would be joining, ruled against him. But he didn't \nstop there. He knew he was correct. He appealed to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case, ruled against the \nRepublicans, ruled with Attorney General Pryor, and kept in place the \nreapportionment plan in that State.\n  I hear people say: Attorney General Pryor is an activist. He has \npolitical views. He is a conservative. He won't follow the law.\n  I am telling you, this man, as much as any man I have ever known in \nmy life--and I have spent 20 years in the full-time practice of law and \nI know a lot of lawyers--is committed to the rule of law. He is \ncommitted to doing what is right. That is the way he was raised. That \nis the way he always does.\n  He has had many other difficult positions. Right this very minute, \nthis very week, he has been drawn into the case of the Ten Commandments \nat the Supreme Court. Justice Roy Moore, chief justice of the Alabama \nSupreme Court, had a Ten Commandments plaque in his office as county \njudge. It was carved out of wood. And when he got elected to the \nsupreme court, he was sort of known as the Ten Commandments judge. \nAfter that, he decided to put in a block of stone, not much bigger than \nthese desks, and it had the Ten Commandments on the top.\n  Frankly, I am not offended by it. At least three replicas of the Ten \nCommandments are in the Supreme Court Building right across that \nstreet. Right up on that wall in the Senate Chamber are the words ``In \nGod We Trust.'' I don't see anything wrong with it, frankly. But Judge \nMoore had some very strong views about this. He had his own ideas about \nseparation of church and state. He read all the papers of the Founding \nFathers. He can quote from them at length. He thinks we are \nmisinterpreting what the Founding Fathers thought about separation of \nchurch and state. He believes it deeply, and I respect him for it.\n  Attorney General Pryor says: I am sympathetic with you, Judge, and I \nsupport your opinion. But as attorney general, I write the briefs for \nthe State and we will argue it my way.\n  Judge Moore said: No, I want you to argue it my way.\n  He is chief justice. But, basically, what happened was the attorney \ngeneral said: You hire your lawyer, and you argue it the way you want \nto; I am the attorney general, and I represent the State, and I will \nmake the best argument that I think is worthy of merit and that could \nprotect the ability to preserve the Ten Commandments.\n  The story goes that the supreme court did not agree and the courts \nhave not agreed. They have ordered the Ten Commandments block to be \nremoved, and there has been quite a bit of stir about it. So what do \nyou do?\n  Under Alabama law, the attorney general is required to, and has a \nduty to, argue cases brought by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. The \nJudicial Inquiry Commission met and returned\n\n[[Page S14079]]\n\ncharges against the chief justice, saying he violated a court order to \nremove the Ten Commandments. The attorney general now is required to \nhandle that case. There is no way he can get away from it. He is either \ngoing to violate his duty and obstruct the rule of law, or he is going \nto prosecute the case. So he is prosecuting the case. He is going \nforward.\n  I say this: Go back and look at the documents put out by People for \nthe American Way in opposition to the confirmation of William Pryor, \nand some of these other trashy, sorry, dishonest documents that were \nput out there. They have accused Bill Pryor of being in cahoots with \nJudge Moore to upset the rule of law, to impose religious views on \npeople because he has expressed his personal belief in God and his \npersonal faith in public statements. So they have accused him of being \na religious extremist and are trying to attack him on that basis.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. It is just a false charge. \nAs a matter of fact, when former Gov. Bob James--who was the Governor \nwho appointed Bill Pryor--resisted the Federal court rulings that said \nteachers could not lead children in prayer, Governor James took the \nview that football coaches ought to be able to lead the boys in prayer. \nHe didn't see anything wrong with that. He didn't think the \nConstitution prohibited that. Frankly, I don't think it does either. \nThe Constitution says that Congress shall make no law respecting the \nestablishment of a religion nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof. \nThat is all it says.\n  Anyway, the courts say you cannot have a football coach lead the kids \nin prayer before the ball game. So it caused a big stir. Some schools \nthought they could and some didn't. Lawsuits were being filed. Attorney \nGeneral Pryor researched the law of schools and prayer and wrote a \nletter to every school board in the State asserting leadership. He \nacted in a way that the Atlanta Journal Constitution even said helped \nto bring a cooling voice in a heated period. He told them what they \ncould do and what they could not do. As it turns out, that opinion he \nwrote was very similar to the position the Clinton Department of \nEducation took on these matters. He researched the law and decided what \nthe law was, and he followed it. So it is a pretty high price that some \npeople are trying to put on him, because it is not true.\n  Dr. Joe Reed is one of the most powerful political figures in the \nState of Alabama. Every Democratic Presidential candidate will know Dr. \nReed. He is an important African-American leader in the State. When he \nspeaks as chairman of the Alabama Democratic Conference, an arm of the \nAlabama Democratic Party, and endorses a candidate for President, or \nGovernor, or Lieutenant Governor, he has tremendous weight. His \nopinions are followed closely. He is a member of the Democratic \nNational Committee. Dr. Reed is a vice chairman of the teachers union \nin Alabama--another source of influence and power. He is a man who has \nalways been interested in Federal courts. He has endorsed Attorney \nGeneral Pryor, saying, ``He is a first-class public official'' who will \n``be a credit to the judiciary and a guardian of justice.''\n\n  Some of the national civil rights groups have attacked Bill Pryor. \nThey don't know him, don't know anything about him, and they have \naccused him of being a southerner who is conservative; they try to say \nhe is anti civil rights. Joe Reed is a serious leader in this State, \nand has been for 30 years, and he endorses him.\n  Thurbert Baker, an African-American Democratic attorney general in \nGeorgia, says that Attorney General Pryor ``has always done what he \nthought was best for the people of Alabama'' and ``know[s] that his \nwork on the bench will continue to serve as an example of how the \npublic trust should be upheld.''\n  Attorney General Baker strongly supports him.\n  Former Democratic Governor, Don Siegleman, stated:\n\n       Bill Pryor is an incredibly talented, intellectually honest \n     attorney general. He calls them like he sees them. He's got a \n     lot of courage, and he will stand up and fight when he \n     believes he's right.\n\n  That is absolutely true. They are not political allies, but that is \ntrue.\n  State Representative Alvin Holmes, who is one of the most outspoken \nAfrican-American leaders in the State senate, is very supportive of \nBill Pryor. He told me he would come up here and speak for him and that \nhe believes this very strongly. One of the stories he tells is that, \nunder Alabama's constitution--and a number of States had this--was a \nprovision that prohibited interracial marriage. Mr. Holmes opposed \nthat. Attorney General Pryor was sworn in as attorney general of \nAlabama, and he made reference to that as being wrong. Of course, it is \nunconstitutional. Clearly, it is in violation of the Federal \nConstitution, and the courts, if they have not already declared it \ninvalid, would do that at any time. But it was still in the document. \nIt ought not to have been there.\n  Bill Pryor led the charge around the State to remove this improper \nlanguage in the Alabama Constitution that said people of different \nraces could not marry. Alvin Holmes said no other state wide elected \npolitician stood with Bill Pryor.\n  Artur Davis, an African-American Congressman from Alabama, is a big \nsupporter of Bill Pryor and also supports his confirmation.\n  Mr. President, we will talk about this more tomorrow. I know the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, is extremely \nimpressed with Attorney General Bill Pryor. He has seen him as a \nwitness. He has met him personally. He told me after Attorney General \nPryor's confirmation hearing that Attorney General Pryor testified \nbrilliantly. He was one of the best witnesses he had ever seen before \nthe Judiciary Committee. They tried to give him a hard time and they \nnever laid a glove on him.\n  He spoke carefully. He spoke pleasantly. He spoke with conviction and \nwith great intelligence and legal acumen. It was a tremendous \nperformance. They questioned him about his views on abortion because he \ndoesn't believe in abortion. I know that is a big subject with some \npeople. He believes abortion is taking of innocent human life, and when \npressed on it, that is what he said. He said: Senator, I believe it is \ntaking of innocent human life. The reason I criticize Roe v. Wade is \nbecause I believe it is unprincipled, and I also believe it has led to \nthe death of millions of innocent unborn.\n  That is his view. That is the view of the Catholic Church, the \nlargest Christian church in the world. It is the view of a lot of other \nchurches and denominations, and a lot of people who don't go to church \nbelieve that is a life.\n  We have to get our heads straight in the confirmation process. We \nhave to get our thinking clear in this process. It makes no difference \nwhat he may believe personally about abortion. The question is, if the \nUnited States passed a constitutional law that deals with abortion, \nwill he follow it? If the Supreme Court of the United States makes a \ndeclaration of interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, will he follow \nit? Bill Pryor has proved he will.\n  With regard to abortion, which he feels deeply about, Bill Pryor \nwrote a number of years ago, before he was ever considered for a \nFederal judgeship, to the attorneys general in Alabama and told them \nthe Supreme Court had rendered an opinion on partial-birth abortion and \nthat a large part of it had been declared unconstitutional; that it \ncould not be enforced by them and they should not bring legal actions \nunder it.\n  Even though he deeply believes abortion is wrong and certainly even \nmore strongly believes that partial-birth abortion is wrong, which is \noverwhelmingly the view of the American people, indeed overwhelmingly \nof this Senate because we passed a law declaring it unconstitutional, \nhe told them they couldn't enforce it. They had to allow this procedure \nto go forward under certain terms. He was condemned by the pro-life \nmovement of which he shares many friends and shares many beliefs.\n  What we have to do as a Senate throughout this confirmation process \nis not ask what a person's political beliefs are or their religious \nbeliefs but whether or not they understand the law of America and \nwhether or not they will enforce it. That is the key to it. If we get \naway from that, we are going to be in trouble.\n  Orthodox Jews have views I do not share and most Americans do not \nshare. The Muslim faith has views I\n\n[[Page S14080]]\n\nmay not share that is in the Koran. Other denominations and church \ngroups throughout America have views I do not share and in which I do \nnot believe. Are we going to get to the point of asking these questions \nand saying: I don't agree with you and your religion; I don't agree \nwith how you interpret the Scripture; therefore, I am not going to vote \nfor you. How ridiculous can that be? We will never get anybody \nconfirmed.\n  We have to say to Mr. Pryor, as was asked of him: OK, Mr. Pryor, I \nrespect how you believe this, but the Supreme Court has held otherwise, \nand I want to know whether or not you will follow that law. He has \ndemonstrated time and again that he will follow the law. He believes in \nthe rule of law. He will carry his duties on in a way that brings \ncredit to the rule of law. The rule of law is the key cornerstone of \nAmerican greatness, in my view.\n  Bill Pryor is a champion of the rule of law. We couldn't have a finer \nnominee. I am so distressed his record has been distorted. I am so \ndistressed people have tried to make him out to be something he is not. \nIt is not right to have a decent, kind, Christian gentleman who has \ndone nothing throughout his life but try to serve his Lord and his \ncountry with distinction and integrity, to have these skunks come in \nhere, as Senator Hatch calls them, the usual suspects, with their \ndistorted interpretations of his career and try to paint him as \nsomething he is not is just wrong. We need to stop it.\n  It is wrong to have a filibuster, and it is wrong to distort a man's \nrecord--it is not correct--in a way that demeans him and undermines his \ntrue worth as a human being. He is first rate in every way.\n  I am confident he will make a great judge. I see my time has passed. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Alabama leaves, \nmay I ask him a question, and if it is appropriate to make a comment \nabout his remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the \nSenator from Alabama, and I have been listening to the debate about the \njudges. I understand what some of our colleagues on the other side are \nsaying is somehow Mr. Pryor is, for some reason, not sensitive to civil \nrights, is an activist, is a person who is unwilling to put his own \npersonal beliefs, political beliefs aside and enforce the law; is that \nwhat the charge is?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is part of it; that he is insensitive to civil \nrights.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As I was listening to the Senator from Alabama, and \nmaybe he will correct me if I have this wrong, but we are talking about \nAlabama, this is not Brooklyn, NY, we are talking about; right? And we \nare talking about the attorney general of the State of Alabama.\n  If I understand it right, after he was appointed, he went out of his \nway to point out that to have the words banning an interracial marriage \nin the Alabama State Constitution was wrong; did I understand the \nSenator to say that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely. He said it was bad law, but more than that, \nhe said it was morally wrong and not to be accepted any longer in our \nConstitution.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Then, Mr. President, I believe the Senator from \nAlabama talked about the situation going on there today where the chief \njudge is embroiled in a great controversy over whether the Ten \nCommandments have to be taken out of the courtroom. I ask the Senator \nfrom Alabama, Mr. President, what percent of Alabamians probably \nbelieve the chief judge is right about the Ten Commandments?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I don't have the numbers for Alabama \nparticularly, but I saw a USA Today poll that said 77 percent of the \npeople in the United States believe it is all right to have the Ten \nCommandments in the building.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am going to just guess, having lived a long time in \na State that borders Alabama, that it is higher than that in Alabama. \nIf I understood the Senator from Alabama correctly, here is the \nattorney general of Alabama, who may also agree with Judge Moore about \nthe Ten Commandments, but he is endorsing the judicial proceedings \nagainst Judge Moore; is that what I heard the Senator say?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Against the judge who wants to keep the Ten \nCommandments there.\n  I think I also heard the Senator from Alabama say there was a \nreapportionment case in the State of Alabama, and the Republican Party \nwanted the attorney general to work with them, since he was appointed \nby a Republican Governor and is a Republican, and that he wouldn't do \nthat, and that he even lost the case in the appellate court and kept \ngoing. He finally defeated a law that was adverse to his party; did I \nunderstand that right, too?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. I think he could have not appealed to \nthe Supreme Court. The Supreme Court doesn't take a lot of these cases. \nHe could have probably justified that and rationalized that, but if he \nbelieved that the existing Alabama reapportionment system was duly \nenacted and defensible, an attorney general of integrity would appeal \nto the Supreme Court, and he did so, to the detriment of the interest \nof his political party.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Just a couple of other questions, because I think the \nSenator from Alabama is making an important statement. I believe I \nheard him say that the attorney general of Alabama wrote a letter to \nevery school district in Alabama, every superintendent and every \nschool, telling them that the football coach could not lead a prayer \nbefore the football game, not because that was what he believed but \nbecause he researched the law and came to the conclusion that is what \nthe law requires, and then he went ahead and suggested to the schools \nwhat they could do as well as what they could not do, and that his \nadvice turned out to be almost exactly the same advice that President \nClinton and former Secretary of Education Dick Riley advised schools \nall over America. Do I have that about right?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Again, thoroughly unpopular. Alabama is interested in \nfootball and Alabama is interested in prayer, and for a public official \nto write every school and tell them they cannot pray before a football \ngame is not an easy thing to do, even if the law does require it.\n  Then, on the issue of abortion, he is a Roman Catholic and he has a \nreligious belief about it, but did I understand the Senator from \nAlabama to say that he told the legislature that he could not enforce a \nlaw they passed limiting abortion because it was unconstitutional?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, very similar. What he actually did, I say to the \nSenator from Tennessee, is that as attorney general he has the \nauthority to superintend all of the State district attorneys who \nenforce the law.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I see.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. There was an already-passed partial birth abortion ban \nin Alabama. The Supreme Court ruled that big chunks of that were not \nconstitutional and could not be enforced, and Attorney General Pryor, \neven though he strongly thinks that abortion is not good policy, wrote \nthose district attorneys throughout the State and told them they could \nnot enforce the law.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So the point I am trying to make is, if I were to come \nbefore my colleagues today and we had no other----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. May I say one thing on that?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The pro-life groups in Alabama that supported Mr. Pryor \ncriticized him for that letter, and the ACLU thanked him for it.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If we had never heard of this individual and someone \ncame today and said he is attorney general of the State of Alabama, and \nhe voluntarily scolded the State for still having interracial marriage \nwords in the State constitution at a time when he really did not have \nto, who is enforcing the proceedings against a judge who has taken an \noverwhelmingly popular position about the Ten Commandments, who took to \nthe Supreme Court a case that was adverse to the Republican Party of \nwhich he was a member, who advised the district attorneys they could \nnot enforce a law about abortion that he personally disagreed with but \nhe felt that the law required it, who wrote all of the schools\n\n[[Page S14081]]\n\nthat they could not pray before a football game, where is someone going \nto find anybody who has more clearly proven that he or she is able to \ntake personal positions and subjugate them to a willingness to enforce \nthe law?\n  As I said earlier, this is not northern California or the Bronx we \nare talking about, even though those might be difficult positions in \nthose States. He was taking positions that were contrary to virtually \nall of the people that he represented and against his own beliefs.\n  I am not sure the Senator from Alabama is even aware of this, but I \nwas also a law clerk for Judge John Minor Wisdom of the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, as was Mr. Pryor. Judge Wisdom was one of the great \njudges of America. He was a part of the panel that ordered Ole Miss to \nadmit James Meredith in 1962. He, along with Judge Elbert Tuttle of \nAtlanta, Richard Rives of Florida, and John R. Brown of Texas, presided \nover the peaceful desegregation of the South.\n  I want to be careful how I say this. I was technically not a law \nclerk. I was a messenger to Judge Wisdom in 1965 and 1966 because he \nalready had one of the top graduates of Harvard, but he had a little \nmoney left for a messenger and he said he would treat me like a law \nclerk. So I am saying that so people will not think I am talking about \nmyself.\n\n  All through the 1960s and 1970s and 1980s and 1990s, law graduates in \nAmerica fought each other to be a law clerk for Judge Wisdom. I was \nlucky to be his messenger who was treated as a law clerk. He hired the \nbest and the brightest. He was also a graduate of Tulane Law School. He \nwould consider the editor in chief of the Tulane Law School to be one \nof the finest persons in America eligible for a law clerkship.\n  I can also guarantee that he would never have hired anyone as a law \nclerk who he did not think of as someone of the highest character, good \nintelligence, capacity to be a good lawyer and committed to civil \nrights and to the rights of the individual.\n  So something is really amiss in our system of approving judges when \nsomeone of the academic character and personal integrity of Mr. Pryor, \nwho clearly is one of the finest lawyers in the country, who has taken \na position contrary to the position of most of the people of the State \nhe represents because he believes in the law, how could he not be \nconfirmed by the Senate? What is it that causes our friends on the \nother side to pick someone like that out and seek to destroy him or \nturn him down?\n  I congratulate the Senator from Alabama for his vigorous advocacy of \nsuch an outstanding person, and I hope very much when the vote comes he \nwill be confirmed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I remain and have always been impressed with the \nSenator from Tennessee since the day he came to the Senate. I did not \nknow he clerked for or worked for Judge Wisdom. He gave some real \ninsight into the prestige of an appointment to clerk for a judge like \nJudge Wisdom on the court of appeals, a very competitive thing.\n  Bill Pryor is one of the best lawyers in America, and these charges \nfrom People for the American Way that he tried to undermine the \nseparation of church and State, he had a majoritarian ideology--\nactually, he stood firm for minorities and against the majority in many \ncases, as we just mentioned. They call him an extreme ideologue, a \ncrusader to push the law far to the right. Anybody who knows him and \nknows the circumstances under which he has operated knows the courage \nhe has shown and knows that these charges are just bogus. It is not \nfair, and we are doing that too often here.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his fine comments. I believe \nBill Pryor is the most principled, committed lawyer I have known in \nthis country. I know he would be a magnificent Federal judge, and we \nwill make a big mistake if this body does not see fit to confirm him. \nHe needs an up-or-down vote, and we will have that vote tomorrow to see \nif he gets an up-or-down vote.
